      <title>Patterns of spin and pseudo-spin symmetries in nuclear relativistic mean-field approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The behavior of spin doublets is known to play a major role in nuclear structure and shell effects. Pseudo-spin doublets are also known to impact the single-particle spectrum. The covariant framework, having these two effects encoded in its approach, is an excellent tool to understand the main mechanism driving theses spin and pseudo-spin symmetries and their breaking. A perturbative expansion of the degeneracy raising related to spin and pseudo-spin effects is proposed, up to second order. It allows to understand the main behavior of spin and pseudo-spin energy doublets, such as their A dependence, as well as their common footing and differences. In the case of the spin symmetry, only the lower component of the Dirac bi-spinor is involved, whereas in the case of the pseudo-spin one, both the upper and lower components are involved. Their interplay with the covariant potentials is also analyzed.</description>

      <title>Exploring total fission cross sections of neutron- and proton-induced reactions of exotic nuclei at relativistic energies using the INCL-ABLA++ models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spallation-induced fission reactions, in combination with state-of-the-art dynamical calculations, provide a robust framework for studying the nuclear dissipation mechanism in nuclear matter over a wide range of deformations. Experimental datasets of neutron- and proton-induced fission, accumulated over the last decades, cover a wide range of nuclei from the pre-actinide to the actinide region. In this work, these datasets are used to benchmark the dynamical Li\`ege intranuclear cascade model INCL++ integrated with the ABLA++ de-excitation code, which has been improved by updating the calculation of particle separation energies to the atomic mass evaluation (AME2020) and incorporating phenomenological corrections to enhance the description of fission-barrier heights. The results show good agreement with the available experimental data of total fission cross sections induced by protons and neutrons, thereby confirming the applicability and predictive capability of these models. Moreover, the improved framework is used to investigate the fission cross sections of exotic heavy fissile nuclei, far from the valley of stability, with masses $A &gt; 155$.</description>

      <title>Magnetic field evolution of X-ray emitting radio-quiet pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The intense magnetic fields present in neutron stars are closely linked to their observed temperature and spectral characteristics, timing properties, including spin period and its derivatives. Therefore, a comprehensive theoretical analysis of magnetic field evolution is essential for understanding how the strength of the magnetic field change over time. The decay rate of magnetic field in isolated, non-accreting neutron stars can be assessed by evaluating the second derivative of the spin frequency. Another method to estimate this rate involves monitoring an increase in thermal emission beyond what is expected from standard cooling processes, assuming no additional heating mechanisms are present. Our findings indicate that for X-ray emitting isolated neutron stars, the evolution rate of spin period derivative aligns with the dissipation rate of magnetic energy from the dipolar field, provided that a substantial portion of the released energy is emitted as X-rays. The time scale of magnetic field decay is found to be much shorter than typical age of radio pulsars.</description>

      <title>Novel Scalings of Neutron Star Properties from Analyzing Dimensionless Tolman--Oppenheimer--Volkoff Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The TOV equations govern the radial evolution of pressure and energy density in static neutron stars (NSs) in hydrodynamical equilibrium. Using the reduced pressure and energy density with respect to the NS central energy density, the original TOV equations can be recast into dimensionless forms. While the traditionally used integral approach for solving the original TOV equations require an input nuclear Equation of State (EOS), the dimensionless TOV equations can be anatomized by using the reduced pressure and energy density as polynomials of the reduced radial coordinate without using any input nuclear EOS. Interesting and novel perspectives about NS core EOS can be extracted directly from NS observables using this new approach based on Intrinsic and Perturbative Analyses of the Dimensionless (IPAD) TOV equations (IPAD-TOV). In this review, we first discuss the length and energy density scales of NSs as well as the dimensionless TOV equations for scaled variables and their perturbative solutions near NS cores. We then review several new insights into NS physics gained from using the IPAD-TOV. We also demonstrate that the strong-field gravity plays a fundamental role in extruding a peak in the density/radius profile of the speed of sound squared (SSS) in massive NS cores independent of the nuclear EOS. Finally, some future perspectives of NS research using the IPAD-TOV are outlined.</description>

      <title>Visualizing How the Structure of Large-Radius Jets Shapes Their Wakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ATLAS collaboration has introduced and implemented a strategy for selecting and analyzing large-radius jets composed of skinny $R=0.2$ subjets in heavy ion collisions at the LHC. We show how measurements of these jets teach us about the resolution length $L_{\rm res}$ of quark-gluon plasma (QGP) and can teach us how jet substructure shapes the wakes that jets excite in the QGP droplets through which they pass. We use Hybrid Model calculations to reproduce measurements of $R_{AA}$ for large-radius jets in PbPb collisions, and study their dependence on the angle between the two skinny subjets involved in the final reclustering step of an $R=1$ jet. We show how these observables can constrain the value of $L_{\rm res}$ and demonstrate that the ATLAS data rule out any picture in which an entire parton shower loses energy coherently as if it were a single entity. Determining the degree to which the QGP can resolve partons within a jet is central to the broader program of using jet quenching measurements to probe QGP.
  We make further use of this setup by analyzing the response of the medium to the passage of large-radius $R=2$ jets containing two skinny subjets in gamma-jet events. We introduce novel jet-shape observables that allow us to visualize the angular shape of the soft hadrons originating from the wakes that wide jets with two skinny subjets excite in a droplet of QGP, as a function of the angular separation between the subjets. We find that even when they are $\sim 0.8- 1$ radian apart, a single broad wake is produced. Only when the two subjets are even farther apart is the presence of two sub-wakes revealed. We show that the way in which jet structure shapes jet wakes can be visualized with similar clarity in experiments by using only those hadrons with low $p_T$. These observables thus offer a new and distinctive way of seeing jet wakes in heavy ion collision data.</description>

      <title>Deviations from the Porter-Thomas distribution due to non-statistical $\gamma$ decay below the $^{150}$Nd neutron separation threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new method for the study of fluctuations of partial transition widths based on nuclear resonance fluorescence experiments with quasimonochromatic linearly-polarized photon beams below particle separation thresholds. It is based on the average branching of decays of $J=1$ states of an even-even nucleus to the $2^+_1$ state in comparison to the ground state. Between 5 and 7 MeV, an almost constant average branching ratio of 0.490(16) is observed for the nuclide $^{150}$Nd. Assuming $\chi^2$-distributed partial transition widths, this average branching ratio is related to a degree of freedom of $\nu = 1.93(12)$, rejecting the validity of the Porter-Thomas distribution, requiring $\nu=1$. The observed deviation can be explained by non-statistical effects in the $\gamma$-decay behavior with contributions in the range of 9.4(10)% up to 94(10)%.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic attractor in periodically driven ultracold quantum gases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.19240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hydrodynamic attractors are a universal phenomenon of strongly interacting systems that describe the hydrodynamic-like evolution far from local equilibrium. In particular, the rapid hydrodynamization of the Quark-Gluon Plasma is behind the remarkable success of hydrodynamic models of high-energy nuclear collisions. So far, hydrodynamic attractors have been explored only in systems undergoing monotonic expansion, such as Bjorken flow. We demonstrate that a system with an oscillating isotropic expansion exhibits a novel cyclic attractor behavior. This phenomenon can be investigated in ultracold quantum gases with externally modulated scattering length, offering a new avenue for experimentally discovering hydrodynamic attractors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.19250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the recently derived equation that resums DGLAP corrections to the JIMWLK Hamiltonian in the simplified setting of the SU(2) gauge theory. We solve the equation numerically for the scattering matrix of a dressed gluon for a particular initial condition, that corresponds to a dipole initial state. As expected, the $S$-matrix of a single dressed gluon state ceases to be unitary if evolved to significant $\ln Q^2/Q_s^2$. Our numerical results indicate an interesting universal (independent of the coupling constant) pattern for this deviation from unitarity.</description>

      <title>Kilonova Emission from Neutron Star Mergers with Different Equations of State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kilonova is an optical-infrared transient powered by the radioactive decay of heavy nuclei from binary neutron star mergers. Its observational characteristics depend on the mass and the nuclide composition of meger ejecta, which are sensitive to the equation of state (EoS) of neutron star. We use astrophysical conditions derived from different EoSs as nucleosynthesis inputs to explore the impact of various EoS on the $r$-process nucleosynthesis and the kilonova emission. Our results show that both the abundance patterns of merger ejecta and kilonova light curves are strongly dependent on the neutron star EoSs. Given the mass of two neutron stars, the merger with a softer EoS tends to generate a larger amount of ejected material, and may lead to a brighter kilonova peak luminosity. The relationship between the neutron star EoS and the peak luminosity provides a probe for constraining the properties of EoS in multi-messenger observations of neutron star mergers.</description>

      <title>Viscous effects of a hot QGP medium in time dependent magnetic field and their phenomenological significance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we have studied, for the first time, the impact of a realistic picture of a time dependent electric and magnetic field on the shear and bulk viscosities of the medium. Both the electric and magnetic fields are considered to be exponentially decaying with time, and the study is valid in the regime where the magnetic field strength is weak ($eB\ll T^2$). The evaluation has been done in the kinetic theory framework wherein we have solved the relativistic Boltzmann transport equation within the relaxation time approximation collision kernel. We have shown that the constant weak field results as well as the $B=0$ results in the literature can be obtained as special cases of our general results. We have observed that the shear and bulk viscosities increase with time or equivalently, decrease with the strength of the magnetic field. To connect these observations with experiments, we have calculated the thermalization time, shear viscosity to entropy ratio ($\eta /s$), and bulk viscosity to entropy ratio ($\zeta /s$).</description>

      <title>Calibrating the medium effects of light clusters in heavy-ion collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02307v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a Bayesian inference estimation of in-medium modification of the cluster self-energies from light nuclei multiplicities measured in selected samples of central $^{136,124}$Xe$+^{124,112}$Sn collisions with the INDRA apparatus. The data are interpreted with a relativistic quasi-particle cluster approach in the mean-field approximation without any prior assumption on the thermal parameters of the model. An excellent reproduction is obtained for H and He isotope multiplicities, and compatible posterior distributions are found for the unknown thermal parameters.
  We conclude that the cluster-$\sigma$-meson coupling is temperature dependent, becoming weaker when the temperature increases, in agreement with microscopic quantum statistical calculations. This implies a faster decrease of the light cluster abundances with temperature than previously estimated.</description>

      <title>Constraint on initial conditions of one-dimensional expanding fluids from nonlinear causality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02405v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The initial conditions of one-dimensional expanding viscous fluids in relativistic heavy-ion collisions are scrutinized in terms of nonlinear causality of the relativistic hydrodynamic equations. Conventionally, it is believed that the matter generated in relativistic heavy-ion collisions starts to behave as a fluid all at once at some initial time. However, it is by no means trivial how soon after the first contact of two high-energy nuclei the fluid picture can be applied. It is demonstrated that one-dimensional expanding viscous fluids violate the necessary and the sufficient conditions of nonlinear causality at large departures from local equilibrium. We therefore quantify the inverse Reynolds number to justify the hydrodynamic description to be valid. The initial conditions are strictly constrained not to violate the causality conditions during the time evolution. With the help of the transverse energies per rapidity measured at RHIC and LHC, we obtain the minimum initial proper time and the maximum energy density allowed by nonlinear causality. This analysis strongly suggests that the initial stage of relativistic heavy-ion collisions needs to be described by a non-equilibrium description other than the framework of relativistic dissipative hydrodynamics.</description>

Abstract: We study one-flavor $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ and $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ lattice QCD in ($1+1$) dimensions at zero temperature and finite density using matrix product states and the density matrix renormalization group. We compute physical observables such as the equation of state, chiral condensate, and quark distribution function as functions of the baryon number density. As a physical implication, we discuss the inhomogeneous phase at nonzero baryon density, where the chiral condensate is inhomogeneous, and baryons form a crystal. We also discuss how the dynamical degrees of freedom change from hadrons to quarks through the formation of quark Fermi seas.</description>

Abstract: A thorough account of electromagnetic interactions of massive Dirac neutrinos as well as their spin-flavor state in the theoretical formulation of elastic neutrino-nucleon scattering is given. The formalism of neutrino charge, magnetic, electric, and anapole form factors defined as matrices in the mass basis is employed under the assumption of three-neutrino mixing. The flavor and spin change of neutrinos propagating from the source to the detector is taken into account in the form of a spin-flavor density matrix of the neutrino arriving at the detector. The potential effects of the neutrino charge radii, magnetic moments, and spin polarization in the neutrino-nucleon scattering experiments are outlined.</description>

Abstract: The approach of direct integration of the three-dimensional Faddeev equations with respect to the breakup T-matrix in momentum space for three bodies of different masses is presented. The Faddeev equations are written out explicitly without the requirement for symmetry or antisymmetry of two-body t matrices, taking into account the difference in the masses of three interacting particles. An algorithm for the algebraic search for non-relativistic wave functions of a system of three bodies of different masses is described. A significant change in the domain of logarithmic singularities of the integral kernels of the Faddeev equations from the choice of masses of interacting particles is demonstrated.</description>
