      <title>LLM-Driven Data Generation and a Novel Soft Metric for Evaluating Text-to-SQL in Aviation MRO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to text-to-SQL tasks promises to democratize data access, particularly in critical industries like aviation Maintenance, Repair, and Operation (MRO). However, progress is hindered by two key challenges: the rigidity of conventional evaluation metrics such as execution accuracy, which offer coarse, binary feedback, and the scarcity of domain-specific evaluation datasets. This paper addresses these gaps. To enable more nuanced assessment, we introduce a novel F1-score-based 'soft' metric that quantifies the informational overlap between generated and ground-truth SQL results. To address data scarcity, we propose an LLM-driven pipeline that synthesizes realistic question-SQL pairs from database schemas. We demonstrate our contributions through an empirical evaluation on an authentic MRO database. Our experiments show that the proposed soft metric provides more insightful performance analysis than strict accuracy, and our data generation technique is effective in creating a domain-specific benchmark. Together, these contributions offer a robust framework for evaluating and advancing text-to-SQL systems in specialized environments.</description>

      <title>Sketched Sum-Product Networks for Joins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sketches have shown high accuracy in multi-way join cardinality estimation, a critical problem in cost-based query optimization. Accurately estimating the cardinality of a join operation -- analogous to its computational cost -- allows the optimization of query execution costs in relational database systems. However, although sketches have shown high efficacy in query optimization, they are typically constructed specifically for predefined selections in queries that are assumed to be given a priori, hindering their applicability to new queries. As a more general solution, we propose for Sum-Product Networks to dynamically approximate sketches on-the-fly. Sum-Product Networks can decompose and model multivariate distributions, such as relations, as linear combinations of multiple univariate distributions. By representing these univariate distributions as sketches, Sum-Product Networks can combine them element-wise to efficiently approximate the sketch of any query selection. These approximate sketches can then be applied to join cardinality estimation. In particular, we implement the Fast-AGMS and Bound Sketch methods, which have successfully been used in prior work, despite their costly construction. By accurately approximating them instead, our work provides a practical alternative to apply these sketches to query optimization.</description>

      <title>HARMONY: A Scalable Distributed Vector Database for High-Throughput Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) is essential for various data-intensive applications, including recommendation systems, image retrieval, and machine learning. Scaling ANNS to handle billions of high-dimensional vectors on a single machine presents significant challenges in memory capacity and processing efficiency. To address these challenges, distributed vector databases leverage multiple nodes for the parallel storage and processing of vectors. However, existing solutions often suffer from load imbalance and high communication overhead, primarily due to traditional partition strategies that fail to effectively distribute the workload. In this paper, we introduce Harmony, a distributed ANNS system that employs a novel multi-granularity partition strategy, combining dimension-based and vector-based partition. This strategy ensures a balanced distribution of computational load across all nodes while effectively minimizing communication costs. Furthermore, Harmony incorporates an early-stop pruning mechanism that leverages the monotonicity of distance computations in dimension-based partition, resulting in significant reductions in both computational and communication overhead. We conducted extensive experiments on diverse real-world datasets, demonstrating that Harmony outperforms leading distributed vector databases, achieving 4.63 times throughput on average in four nodes and 58% performance improvement over traditional distribution for skewed workloads.</description>

      <title>AMLgentex: Mobilizing Data-Driven Research to Combat Money Laundering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Money laundering enables organized crime by allowing illicit funds to enter the legitimate economy. Although trillions of dollars are laundered each year, only a small fraction is ever uncovered. This stems from a range of factors, including deliberate evasion by launderers, the rarity of confirmed cases, and the limited visibility each financial institution has into the global transaction network. While several synthetic datasets are available, they fail to model the structural and behavioral complexity of real-world money laundering. In particular, they often overlook partial observability, sparse and uncertain labels, strategic behavior, temporal dynamics, class imbalance, and network-level dependencies. To address these limitations, we present AMLGentex, an open-source suite for generating realistic, configurable transaction data and benchmarking detection methods. It enables systematic evaluation of anti-money laundering (AML) systems in a controlled environment that captures key real-world challenges. We demonstrate how the framework can be used to rigorously evaluate methods under conditions that reflect the complexity of practical AML scenarios.</description>

      <title>Keigo: Co-designing Log-Structured Merge Key-Value Stores with a Non-Volatile, Concurrency-aware Storage Hierarchy (Extended Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Keigo, a concurrency- and workload-aware storage middleware that enhances the performance of log-structured merge key-value stores (LSM KVS) when they are deployed on a hierarchy of storage devices. The key observation behind Keigo is that there is no one-size-fits-all placement of data across the storage hierarchy that optimizes for all workloads. Hence, to leverage the benefits of combining different storage devices, Keigo places files across different devices based on their parallelism, I/O bandwidth, and capacity. We introduce three techniques - concurrency-aware data placement, persistent read-only caching, and context-based I/O differentiation. Keigo is portable across different LSMs, is adaptable to dynamic workloads, and does not require extensive profiling. Our system enables established production KVS such as RocksDB, LevelDB, and Speedb to benefit from heterogeneous storage setups. We evaluate Keigo using synthetic and realistic workloads, showing that it improves the throughput of production-grade LSMs up to 4x for write- and 18x for read-heavy workloads when compared to general-purpose storage systems and specialized LSM KVS.</description>

      <title>Magneto: Combining Small and Large Language Models for Schema Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08194v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in language models opened new opportunities to address complex schema matching tasks. Schema matching approaches have been proposed that demonstrate the usefulness of language models, but they have also uncovered important limitations: Small language models (SLMs) require training data (which can be both expensive and challenging to obtain), and large language models (LLMs) often incur high computational costs and must deal with constraints imposed by context windows. We present Magneto, a cost-effective and accurate solution for schema matching that combines the advantages of SLMs and LLMs to address their limitations. By structuring the schema matching pipeline in two phases, retrieval and reranking, Magneto can use computationally efficient SLM-based strategies to derive candidate matches which can then be reranked by LLMs, thus making it possible to reduce runtime without compromising matching accuracy. We propose a self-supervised approach to fine-tune SLMs which uses LLMs to generate syntactically diverse training data, and prompting strategies that are effective for reranking. We also introduce a new benchmark, developed in collaboration with domain experts, which includes real biomedical datasets and presents new challenges to schema matching methods. Through a detailed experimental evaluation, using both our new and existing benchmarks, we show that Magneto is scalable and attains high accuracy for datasets from different domains.</description>

      <title>Abacus: A Cost-Based Optimizer for Semantic Operator Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14661v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: LLMs enable an exciting new class of data processing applications over large collections of unstructured documents. Several new programming frameworks have enabled developers to build these applications by composing them out of semantic operators: a declarative set of AI-powered data transformations with natural language specifications. These include LLM-powered maps, filters, joins, etc. used for document processing tasks such as information extraction, summarization, and more. While systems of semantic operators have achieved strong performance on benchmarks, they can be difficult to optimize. An optimizer for this setting must determine how to physically implement each semantic operator in a way that optimizes the system globally. Existing optimizers are limited in the number of optimizations they can apply, and most (if not all) cannot optimize system quality, cost, or latency subject to constraint(s) on the other dimensions. In this paper we present Abacus, an extensible, cost-based optimizer which searches for the best implementation of a semantic operator system given a (possibly constrained) optimization objective. Abacus estimates operator performance by leveraging a minimal set of validation examples and, if available, prior beliefs about operator performance. We evaluate Abacus on document processing workloads in the biomedical and legal domains (BioDEX; CUAD) and multi-modal question answering (MMQA). We demonstrate that systems optimized by Abacus achieve 18.7%-39.2% better quality and up to 23.6x lower cost and 4.2x lower latency than the next best system.</description>

      <title>UNIFY: Unified Index for Range Filtered Approximate Nearest Neighbors Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02448v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an efficient and scalable framework for Range Filtered Approximate Nearest Neighbors Search (RF-ANNS) over high-dimensional vectors associated with attribute values. Given a query vector $q$ and a range $[l, h]$, RF-ANNS aims to find the approximate $k$ nearest neighbors of $q$ among data whose attribute values fall within $[l, h]$. Existing methods including pre-, post-, and hybrid filtering strategies that perform attribute range filtering before, after, or during the ANNS process, all suffer from significant performance degradation when query ranges shift. Though building dedicated indexes for each strategy and selecting the best one based on the query range can address this problem, it leads to index consistency and maintenance issues.
  Our framework, called UNIFY, constructs a unified Proximity Graph-based (PG-based) index that seamlessly supports all three strategies. In UNIFY, we introduce SIG, a novel Segmented Inclusive Graph, which segments the dataset by attribute values. It ensures the PG of objects from any segment combinations is a sub-graph of SIG, thereby enabling efficient hybrid filtering by reconstructing and searching a PG from relevant segments. Moreover, we present Hierarchical Segmented Inclusive Graph (HSIG), a variant of SIG which incorporates a hierarchical structure inspired by HNSW to achieve logarithmic hybrid filtering complexity. We also implement pre- and post-filtering for HSIG by fusing skip list connections and compressed HNSW edges into the hierarchical graph. Experimental results show that UNIFY delivers state-of-the-art RF-ANNS performance across small, mid, and large query ranges.</description>
