      <title>Onsager-Machlup Functional and Large Deviation Principle for Stochastic Hamiltonian Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the application of KAM theory within the probabilistic framework of stochastic Hamiltonian systems. We begin by deriving the Onsager-Machlup functional for the stochastic Hamiltonian system, identifying the most probable transition path for system trajectories. By establishing a large deviation principle for the system, we derive a rate function that quantifies the system's deviation from the most probable path, particularly in the context of rare events. Furthermore, leveraging classical KAM theory, we demonstrate that invariant tori remain stable, in the most probable sense, despite small random perturbations. Notably, we establish that the exponential decay rate for deviations from these persistent tori coincides precisely with the previously derived rate function, providing a quantitative probabilistic characterization of quasi-periodic motions in stochastic settings.</description>

Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be a torsion-free subgroup of $SL_3(R)$ commensurable with $SL_3(Z)$, and $Y=SO_3(R)\backslash SL_3(R)/\Gamma$ be endowed with the natural locally symmetric space structure. We prove that for any point y in Y, the set of directions in which the geodesic ray starting from y is bounded in Y, is hyperplane absolute winning.</description>

      <title>Large deviation principles for periodic points of the Dyck shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate periodic points of the Dyck shift from the viewpoint of large deviations. We establish the level-2 Large Deviation Principle with the rate function given in terms of Kolmogorov-Sinai entropies of shift-invariant Borel probability measures. Unlike topologically mixing Markov shifts, the level-2 rate function is non-convex and level-1 rate functions are superpositions of two convex continuous functions. Using the thermodynamic formalism, we show the analyticity of level-1 rate functions in some relevant cases. We display a non-convex level-1 rate function with a non-differentiable point in the interior of its effective domain.</description>

      <title>Quantization for a condensation system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a given $r \in (0, +\infty)$, the quantization dimension of order $r$, if it exists, denoted by $D_r(\mu)$, represents the rate at which the $n$th quantization error of order $r$ approaches to zero as the number of elements $n$ in an optimal set of $n$-means for $\mu$ tends to infinity. If $D_r(\mu)$ does not exist, we define $\underline{D}_r(\mu)$ and $\overline{D}_r(\mu)$ as the lower and the upper quantization dimensions of $\mu$ of order $r$, respectively. In this paper, we investigate the quantization dimension of the condensation measure $\mu$ associated with a condensation system $(\{S_j\}_{j=1}^N, (p_j)_{j=0}^N, \nu).$ We provide two examples: one where $\nu$ is an infinite discrete distribution on $\mathbb{R}$, and one where $\nu$ is a uniform distribution on $\mathbb{R}$. For both the discrete and uniform distributions $\nu$, we determine the optimal sets of $n$-means, and calculate the quantization dimensions of condensation measures $\mu$, and show that the $D_r(\mu)$-dimensional quantization coefficients do not exist. Moreover, we demonstrate that the lower and upper quantization coefficients are finite and positive.</description>

      <title>POD-Galerkin Reduced Order Modeling of the El Ni\~no-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reduced order modeling (ROM) aims to mitigate computational complexity by reducing the size of a high-dimensional state space. In this study, we demonstrate the efficiency, accuracy, and stability of proper orthogonal decomposition (POD)-Galerkin ROM when applied to the El Ni\~no Southern Oscillation model, which integrates coupled atmosphere, ocean, and sea surface temperature (SST) mechanisms in the equatorial Pacific. While POD identifies the most energetic modes of a system from simulation data, the Galerkin projection maps the governing equations onto these reduced modes to derive a simplified dynamical system. Leveraging the unique coupling properties of the model, we propose a novel approach to formulate a reduced order model derived from Galerkin projection. Our approach achieves remarkable computational efficiency, requiring only four POD modes. The results provide highly stable and accurate solutions over 95% compared to the high-dimensional full-order model (FOM), highlighting the potential of POD-Galerkin reduction for efficient and accurate climate simulations.</description>

      <title>Equidistribution of divergent diagonal orbits in positive characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a local field $\widehat K$ with positive characteristic, we study the dynamics of the diagonal subgroup of the linear group $\operatorname{GL}_n(\widehat K)$ on homogeneous spaces of discrete lattices in ${\widehat K}^{\,n}$. We first give a function field version of results by Margulis and Tomanov-Weiss, characterizing the divergent diagonal orbits. When $n=2$, we relate the divergent diagonal orbits with the divergent orbits of the geodesic flow in the modular quotient of the Bruhat-Tits tree of $\operatorname{PGL}_2(\widehat K)$. Using the (high) entropy method by Einsiedler-Lindentraus et al, we then give a function field version of a result of David-Shapira on the equidistribution of a natural family of these divergent diagonal orbits, with height given by a new notion of discriminant of the orbits.</description>

      <title>Developing cholera outbreak forecasting through qualitative dynamics: Insights into Malawi case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cholera, an acute diarrheal disease, is a serious concern in developing and underdeveloped areas. A qualitative understanding of cholera epidemics aims to foresee transmission patterns based on reported data and mechanistic models. The mechanistic model is a crucial tool for capturing the dynamics of disease transmission and population spread. However, using real-time cholera cases is essential for forecasting the transmission trend. This prospective study seeks to furnish insights into transmission trends through qualitative dynamics followed by machine learning-based forecasting. The Monte Carlo Markov Chain approach is employed to calibrate the proposed mechanistic model. We identify critical parameters that illustrate the disease's dynamics using partial rank correlation coefficient-based sensitivity analysis. The basic reproduction number as a crucial threshold measures asymptotic dynamics. Furthermore, forward bifurcation directs the stability of the infection state, and Hopf bifurcation suggests that trends in transmission may become unpredictable as societal disinfection rates rise. Further, we develop epidemic-informed machine learning models by incorporating mechanistic cholera dynamics into autoregressive integrated moving averages and autoregressive neural networks. We forecast short-term future cholera cases in Malawi by implementing the proposed epidemic-informed machine learning models to support this. We assert that integrating temporal dynamics into the machine learning models can enhance the capabilities of cholera forecasting models. The execution of this mechanism can significantly influence future trends in cholera transmission. This evolving approach can also be beneficial for policymakers to interpret and respond to potential disease systems. Moreover, our methodology is replicable and adaptable, encouraging future research on disease dynamics.</description>

      <title>Transitions to Intermittent Chaos in Quorum Sensing Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study analyses the dynamical consequences of heterogeneous temporal delays within a quorum sensing-inspired (QS-inspired) system, specifically addressing the differential response kinetics of two subpopulations to signalling molecules. A nonlinear delay differential equation (DDE) model, predicated upon an activator-inhibitor framework, is formulated to represent the interspecies interactions. Key analytical techniques, including the derivation of the pseudo-characteristic polynomial and the determination of Hopf bifurcation criteria, are employed to investigate the stability properties of steady-state solutions. The analysis reveals the critical role of multiple, dissimilar delays in modulating system dynamics and inducing bifurcations. Numerical simulations, conducted in conjunction with analytical results, reveal the emergence of periodic self-sustained oscillations and intermittent chaotic behaviour. These observations emphasise the intricate relationship between temporal heterogeneity and the stability landscape of systems exhibiting QS-inspired dynamics. This interplay highlights the capacity for temporal variations to induce complex dynamical transitions within such systems. These findings assist to the comprehension of temporal dynamics within these and related systems, and may contribute to the development of strategies aimed at modulating intercellular communication and engineering synthetic biological systems with temporal control.</description>

      <title>Rational functions sharing preimages and height functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $A$ and $B$ be non-constant rational functions over $\mathbb{C}$, and let $K \subset \mathbb{P}^1(\mathbb{C})$ be an infinite set. Using height functions, we prove that the inclusion $ A^{-1}(K) \subseteq B^{-1}(K) $ implies the inequality $ {\rm deg} B \geq {\rm deg} A $ in the following two cases: the set $K$ is contained in $\mathbb{P}^1(k)$, where $ k$ is a finitely generated subfield of $\mathbb{C}$, or the set $K$ is discrete in $\mathbb{C}$, and $A$ and $B$ are polynomials. In particular, this implies that for $A$, $B$, and $K$ as above, the equality $ A^{-1}(K) = B^{-1}(K) $ is impossible, unless $ {\rm deg} B = {\rm deg} A $.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09633v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hitting rate and escape rate are two examples of recurrence laws for a dynamical system, and a general limit connects them. We show that for both Gibbs-Markov systems or any systems with the $\phi$-mixing measure, for a sequence of nested sets whose intersection is a measure zero set, this general limit equals one in the absence of short returns and less than one otherwise, which is given by an explicit formula called extremal index. One of the applications of this result is to dynamical systems on Riemannian manifolds such as hyperbolic maps and expanding maps, and it can be applied to any system with a suitable Young tower.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a study of the isosceles problem resulting by a perturbation of Euler's collinear solution under Newtonian gravitational attraction of three bodies in space. After the Hamiltonian was obtained, a circumference of relative equilibria points was found. The original system was subsequently reduced to another system with two degrees of freedom, periodic in the time, where there is now a single point of equilibrium. Linear and parametric stability were discussed in this simplified model of the three-body problem.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we estimate the Hausdorff dimension of dynamical coverings with respect to mixing ergodic systems. More precisely, if the ergodic measure is exact-dimensionnal, we establish a formula provided that the system is polynomially fast mixing and if the measure is not exact-dimensionnal, we establish a similar result under super-polynomial speed of mix assumpetion. As an application of our result, we extend the result of Fan-Shmeling-Troubetzkoy for the doubling map on the circle to the case of the times 2, times 3 map on the two dimensional torus.</description>

      <title>An SIRS model with hospitalizations: economic impact by disease severity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03540v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a two-timescale SIRS-type model in which a fraction $\theta$ of infected individuals experiences a severe course of the disease, requiring hospitalization. During hospitalization, these individuals do not contribute to further infections. We analyze the model's equilibria, perform a bifurcation analysis, and explore its two-timescale nature (using techniques from Geometric Singular Perturbation Theory). Our main result provides an explicit expression for the value of $\theta$ that maximizes the total number of hospitalized individuals for long times, revealing that this fraction can be lower than 1. This highlights the interesting effect that a severe disease, by necessitating widespread hospitalization, can indirectly suppress contagions and, consequently, reduce hospitalizations. Numerical simulations illustrate the growth in the number of hospitalizations for short times. The model can also be interpreted as a scenario where only a fraction $\theta$ of infected individuals develops symptoms and self-quarantines.</description>

      <title>Localized Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14987v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Localized patterns are coherent structures embedded in a quiescent state and occur in both discrete and continuous media across a wide range of applications. While it is well-understood how domain covering patterns (for example stripes and hexagons) emerge from a pattern-forming/Turing instability, analyzing the emergence of their localized counterparts remains a significant challenge. There has been considerable progress in studying localized patterns over the past few decades, often by employing innovative mathematical tools and techniques. In particular, the study of localized pattern formation has benefited greatly from numerical techniques; the continuing advancement in computational power has helped to both identify new types patterns and further our understanding of their behavior. We review recent advances regarding the complex behavior of localized patterns and the mathematical tools that have been developed to understand them, covering various topics from spatial dynamics, exponential asymptotics, and numerical methods. We observe that the mathematical understanding of localized patterns decreases as the spatial dimension increases, thus providing significant open problems that will form the basis for future investigations.</description>

      <title>Contact geometry of Hill's approximation in a spatial restricted four-body problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06927v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well-known that the planar and spatial circular restricted three-body problem (CR3BP) is of contact type for all energy values below the first critical value. Burgos-Garc\'ia and Gidea extended Hill's approach in the CR3BP to the spatial equilateral CR4BP, which can be used to approximate the dynamics of a small body near a Trojan asteroid of a Sun--planet system. Our main result in this paper is that this Hill four-body system also has the contact property. In other words, we can "contact" the Trojan. Such a result enables to use holomorphic curve techniques and Floer theoretical tools in this dynamical system in the energy range where the contact property holds.</description>

      <title>Shadowing and Stability of Non-Invertible $p$-adic Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04779v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The stability theory of compact metric spaces with positive topological dimension is a well-established area in Continuous Dynamics. A central result, attributed to Walters, connects the concepts of topological stability and the shadowing property in invertible dynamics. In contrast, zero-dimensional stability theory is a developing field, with an analogue of Walters' theorem for Cantor spaces being fully established only in 2019 by Kawaguchi.
  In this paper, we investigate the shadowing and stability properties of non-invertible dynamics in zero-dimensional spaces, focusing on the $p$-adic integers $\mathbb{Z}_p$ and the $p$-adic numbers $\mathbb{Q}_p$, where $p \geq 2$ is a prime number. The main result provides sufficient conditions under which the following families of maps exhibit strong shadowing and stability properties: 1) $p$-adic dynamical systems that are right-invertible through contractions, and 2) left-invertible contractions. Consequently, new examples of stable $p$-adic dynamics are presented.</description>

      <title>A dichotomy for the Hofer growth of area preserving maps on the sphere via symmetrization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08854v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that autonomous Hamiltonian flows on the two-sphere exhibit the following dichotomy: the Hofer norm either grows linearly or is bounded in time by a universal constant C. Our approach involves a new technique, Hamiltonian symmetrization. Essentially, we prove that every autonomous Hamiltonian diffeomorphism is conjugate to an element C-close in the Hofer metric to one generated by a function of the height.</description>

      <title>Interpolating quasiregular power mappings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10190v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a quasiregular mapping in $\mathbb{R}^3$ that is the first to illustrate several important dynamical properties: the quasi-Fatou set contains wandering components; these quasi-Fatou components are bounded and hollow; and the Julia set has components that are genuine round spheres. The key tool in this construction is a new quasiregular interpolation in round rings in $\mathbb{R}^3$ between power mappings of differing degrees on the boundary components. We also exhibit the flexibility of constructions based on these interpolations by showing that we may obtain quasiregular mappings which grow as quickly, or as slowly, as desired.</description>

      <title>Memorization and Regularization in Generative Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15785v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful framework for generative modeling. At the heart of the methodology is score matching: learning gradients of families of log-densities for noisy versions of the data distribution at different scales. When the loss function adopted in score matching is evaluated using empirical data, rather than the population loss, the minimizer corresponds to the score of a time-dependent Gaussian mixture. However, use of this analytically tractable minimizer leads to data memorization: in both unconditioned and conditioned settings, the generative model returns the training samples. This paper contains an analysis of the dynamical mechanism underlying memorization. The analysis highlights the need for regularization to avoid reproducing the analytically tractable minimizer; and, in so doing, lays the foundations for a principled understanding of how to regularize. Numerical experiments investigate the properties of: (i) Tikhonov regularization; (ii) regularization designed to promote asymptotic consistency; and (iii) regularizations induced by under-parameterization of a neural network or by early stopping when training a neural network. These experiments are evaluated in the context of memorization, and directions for future development of regularization are highlighted.</description>

      <title>A lower bound on end-periodic stretch factors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17389v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given an end-periodic homeomorphism $f: S \to S$ we give a lower bound on the Handel--Miller stretch factor of $f$ in terms of the core characteristic of $f$, which is a measure of topological complexity for an end-periodic homeomorphism. We also show that this bound is asymptotically sharp.</description>

      <title>Irrationality of the Length Spectrum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03461v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is a classical result of Dal'Bo that the length spectrum of a non-elementary Fuchsian group is non-arithmetic, namely, it generates a dense additive subgroup of $\mathbb{R}$. In this note we observe the following extension of this fact: a non-elementary Fuchsian group contains two elements whose lengths are linearly independent over $\mathbb{Q}$.</description>

      <title>Invariant subalgebras of the reduced group $C^*$-algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09548v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be a countable discrete group. We say that $\Gamma$ has $C^*$-invariant subalgebra rigidity (ISR) property if every $\Gamma$-invariant $C^*$-subalgebra $\mathcal{A}\le C_r^*(\Gamma)$ is of the form $C_r^*(N)$ for some normal subgroup $N\triangleleft\Gamma$. We show that all torsion-free, non-amenable (cylindrically) hyperbolic groups with property-AP and a finite direct product of such groups have this property. We also prove that an infinite group $\Gamma$ has the C$^*$-ISR property only if $\Gamma$ is simple amenable or $C^*$-simple.</description>
