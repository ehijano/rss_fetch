      <title>Perceived risk determines spatial position in fish shoals through altered rules of interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Risk perception plays a key role in shaping the collective behavior of moving animal groups, yet the effects of variation in perceived risk within groups is unknown. Here, we merge two subgroups of fish with different levels of perceived risk, manipulated through habituation to the experimental arena, and quantitatively analyze their movement. Fish with heightened risk perception tend to occupy more central positions within the group, consistent with the selfish herd hypothesis. This behavior appears to be driven by adjusted local interactions with nearby individuals. Compared to more habituated fish, these individuals also exhibit greater coordination, shorter burst-and-coast dynamics, more efficient information transmission, and a stronger tendency to adopt follower roles. To validate the findings, we develop a machine learning tool that successfully classifies the subgroup identity of individual fish. Our study demonstrates how differences in local-scale inter-individual interactions can drive spatial assortment within groups, based on heterogeneity in the perception of risk.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary origin of the bipartite architecture of dissipative cellular networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, plenty research has been done on discovering the role of energy dissipation in biological networks, most of which focus on the relationship of dissipation and functionality. However, the development of networks science urged us to fathom the systematic architecture of biological networks and their evolutionary advantages. We found the dissipation of biological dissipative networks is highly related to their structure. By interrogating these well-adapted networks, we find that the energy producing module is relatively isolated in all situations. We applied evolutionary simulation and analysis on premature networks of classic dissipative networks, namely kinetic proofreading, activator-inhibitor oscillator and two typical adaptative response models. We found despite that selection was imposed merely on the network function, the networks tended to decouple high energy molecules as fuels from the functional module, to achieve higher overall dissipation during the course of evolution. Furthermore, we find that decoupled fuel modules can increase the robustness of the networks towards parameter or structure perturbations. We provide theoretical analysis on the kinetic proofreading networks and the general case of energy-driven networks. We find fuel decoupling can guarantee higher dissipation and, in most cases when considering dissipative networks, higher performance. We conclude that fuel decoupling is an evolutionary outcome and bears benefits during evolution.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial Exploration of Multidrug Polyspecificity in Efflux Pumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A major feature of efflux pumps is multidrug polyspecificity, which to date still eludes some of the traditional dogmas of drug binding within protein science. We propose a combinatorial approach to explore, in the vast sequence space of polypeptide chains, the neighbourhood of some superfamilies of efflux pumps. Creating new functional structures as permutations of existing ones has the potential to unveil some of the hidden mechanisms behind the functionality of efflux pumps.</description>

      <title>Tethered Particle Motion Technique in Crowded Media: Compaction of DNA by Globular Macromolecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tethered Particle Motion (TPM) is a single molecule technique, which consists in tracking the motion of a nano-particle (NP) immersed in a fluid and tethered to a glass surface by a DNA molecule. The present work addresses the question of the applicability of TPM to fluids which contain crowders at volume fractions ranging from that of the nucleoid of living bacteria (around 30%) up to the jamming threshold (around 66%). In particular, we were interested in determining whether TPM can be used to characterize the compaction of DNA by globular crowders. To this end, extensive Brownian Dynamics simulations were performed with a specifically built coarse-grained model. Analysis of the simulations reveals several effects not observed in dilute media, which impose constraints on the TPM set-up. In particular, the Tethered Fluorophore Motion (TFM) technique, which consists in replacing the NP by a much smaller fluorophore, is probably better suited than standard TPM. Moreover, a sample preparation technique which does not involve hydrophilic patches may be required. Finally, the use of a DNA brush may be needed to achieve DNA concentrations close to in vivo ones.</description>

      <title>Transcribing RNA polymerases: Dynamics of Twin Supercoiled Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gene transcription by a RNA Polymerase (RNAP) enzyme requires that double-stranded DNA be locally and transiently opened, which results in an increase of DNA supercoiling downstream of the RNAP and a decrease of supercoiling upstream of it. When the DNA is initially torsionally relaxed and the RNAP experiences sufficiently large rotational drag, these variations lead to positively supercoiled plectonemes ahead of the RNAPs and negatively supercoiled ones behind it, a feature known as ''Twin Supercoiled Domain'' (TSD). The present work aims at deciphering into some more detail the torsional dynamics of circular DNA molecules being transcribed by RNAP enzymes. To this end, we performed Brownian Dynamics simulations with a specially designed coarse-grained model. Depending on the superhelical density of the DNA molecule and the ratio of RNAP's twist injection rate and rotational relaxation speed, simulations reveal a rich panel of behaviors, which sometimes differ markedly from the crude TSD picture. In particular, for sufficiently slow rotational relaxation speed, positively supercoiled plectonemes never form ahead of a RNAP that transcribes a DNA molecule with physiological negative supercoiling. Rather, negatively supercoiled plectonemes form almost periodically at the upstream side of the RNAP and grow up to a certain length before detaching from the RNAP and destabilizing rapidly. The extent to which topological barriers hinder the dynamics of TSDs is also discussed. 2 SIGNIFICANCE : It has been known for four decades that a RNA Polymerase enzyme which transcribes torsionally relaxed DNA favors the formation of positively supercoiled plectonemes downstream of its position and negatively supercoiled ones upstream of it. How these plectonemes are born, how they evolve and eventually vanish, has however received little attention. We used coarse-grained modeling and Brownian Dynamics simulations to provide theoretical insight into this question, for both torsionally relaxed DNA and negatively supercoiled (bacterial) DNA. The contact maps obtained from these simulations reveal a rich dynamics, which depend essentially on the superhelical density of the DNA molecule and the torsional relaxation speed of the RNA Polymerase. Twin Supercoiled Domains are certainly NOT static features but instead very dynamic ones.</description>

      <title>Inference of non-exponential kinetics through stochastic resetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an inference scheme of long timescale, non-exponential kinetics from Molecular Dynamics simulations accelerated by stochastic resetting. Standard simulations provide valuable insight into chemical processes but are limited to timescales shorter than $\sim 1 \mu s$. Slower processes require the use of enhanced sampling methods to expedite them, and inference schemes to obtain the unbiased kinetics. However, most kinetics inference schemes assume an underlying exponential first-passage time distribution and are inappropriate for other distributions, e.g., with a power-law decay. We propose an inference scheme that is designed for such cases, based on simulations enhanced by stochastic resetting. We show that resetting promotes enhanced sampling of the first-passage time distribution at short timescales, but often also provides sufficient information to estimate the long-time asymptotics, which allows the kinetics inference. We apply our method to a model system and a short peptide in an explicit solvent, successfully estimating the unbiased mean first-passage time while accelerating the sampling by more than an order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Tracking the Morphological Evolution of Neuronal Dendrites by First-Passage Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A high degree of structural complexity arises in dynamic neuronal dendrites due to extensive branching patterns and diverse spine morphologies, which enable the nervous system to adjust function, construct complex input pathways and thereby enhance the computational power of the system. Owing to the determinant role of dendrite morphology in the functionality of the nervous system, recognition of pathological changes due to neurodegenerative disorders is of crucial importance. We show that the statistical analysis of a temporary signal generated by cargos that have diffusively passed through the complex dendritic structure yields vital information about dendrite morphology. As a feasible scenario, we propose engineering mRNA-carrying multilamellar liposomes to diffusively reach the soma and release mRNAs, which encodes a specific protein upon encountering ribosomes. The concentration of this protein over a large population of neurons can be externally measured, as a detectable temporary signal. By developing a stochastic coarse-grained approach for first-passage through dendrites, we connect the model parameters to the characteristics of the evolving signal and, on the other hand, map them to the key morphological properties affected by neurodegenerative diseases -- including the density and size of spines, the extent of the tree, and the segmental increase of dendrite diameter towards soma. Thus, we establish a direct link between the dendrite morphology and the statistical characteristics of the detectable signal. Our approach provides a fast noninvasive measurement technique to indirectly extract vital information about the morphological evolution of dendrites in the course of neurodegenerative disease progression.</description>

      <title>The positioning of stress fibers in contractile cells minimizes internal mechanical stress</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07797v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mechanics of animal cells is strongly determined by stress fibers, which are contractile filament bundles that form dynamically in response to extracellular cues. Stress fibers allow the cell to adapt its mechanics to environmental conditions and to protect it from structural damage. While the physical description of single stress fibers is well-developed, much less is known about their spatial distribution on the level of whole cells. Here, we combine a finite element method for one-dimensional fibers embedded in an elastic bulk medium with dynamical rules for stress fiber formation based on genetic algorithms. We postulate that their main goal is to achieve minimal mechanical stress in the bulk material with as few fibers as possible. The fiber positions and configurations resulting from this optimization task alone are in good agreement with those found in experiments where cells in 3D-scaffolds were mechanically strained at one attachment point. For optimized configurations, we find that stress fibers typically run through the cell in a diagonal fashion, similar to reinforcement strategies used for composite material.</description>

      <title>ATP-induced reconfiguration of the micro-viscoelasticity of cardiac and skeletal myosin solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.07160v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the high-frequency micro-mechanical response of suspensions composed by cardiac and skeletal muscle myosin by optical trapping interferometry. We observe that in low ionic strength solutions upon the addition of magnesium adenosine triphosphate (\ch{MgATP^2-}), myosin suspensions radically change their micro-mechanics properties, generating a viscoelastic fluid characterized by a complex modulus similar to a suspension of worm-like micelles. This transduction of energy, from chemical to mechanical, may be related to the relaxed states of myosin, which regulate muscle contractility and can be involved in the etiology of many myopathies. Within an analogous generic mechanical response, cardiac and skeletal myosin suspensions provide different stress relaxation times, elastic modulus values, and characteristic lengths. These discrepancies probably rely on the dissimilar physiological functions of cardiac and skeletal muscle, on the different MgATPase hydrolysis rates of cardiac and skeletal myosins, and on the observed distinct cooperative behavior of their myosin heads in the super-relaxed state. \textit{In vitro} studies like these allow to understand the foundations of muscle cells mechanics on the micro-scale, and may contribute to the engineering of biological materials whose micro-mechanics can be activated by energy regulators.</description>

      <title>Multiphoton super-resolution imaging via virtual structured illumination</title>

Abstract: Imaging in thick biological tissues is often degraded by sample-induced aberrations, which reduce image quality and resolution, particularly in super-resolution techniques. While hardware-based adaptive optics, which correct aberrations using wavefront shaping devices, provide an effective solution, their complexity and cost limit accessibility. Computational methods offer simpler alternatives but struggle with complex aberrations due to the incoherent nature of fluorescence. Here, we present a deep-tissue super-resolution imaging framework that addresses these challenges with minimal hardware modification. By replacing the photodetector in a standard laser-scanning microscope with a camera, we measure an incoherent response matrix (IRM). A dual deconvolution algorithm is developed to decompose the IRM into excitation and emission optical transfer functions and the object spectrum. The proposed method simultaneously corrects excitation and emission point-spread functions (PSFs), achieving a resolution of {\lambda}/4, comparable to structured illumination microscopy. Unlike existing computational methods that rely on vector decomposition of a single convoluted PSF, our matrix-based approach enhances image reconstruction, particularly for high spatial frequency components, enabling super-resolution even in the presence of complex aberrations. We validated this framework with two-photon super-resolution imaging, achieving a lateral resolution of 130 nanometers at a depth of 180 micrometers in thick mouse brain tissue.</description>

      <title>Doob's Lagrangian: A Sample-Efficient Variational Approach to Transition Path Sampling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07974v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rare event sampling in dynamical systems is a fundamental problem arising in the natural sciences, which poses significant computational challenges due to an exponentially large space of trajectories. For settings where the dynamical system of interest follows a Brownian motion with known drift, the question of conditioning the process to reach a given endpoint or desired rare event is definitively answered by Doob's h-transform. However, the naive estimation of this transform is infeasible, as it requires simulating sufficiently many forward trajectories to estimate rare event probabilities. In this work, we propose a variational formulation of Doob's h-transform as an optimization problem over trajectories between a given initial point and the desired ending point. To solve this optimization, we propose a simulation-free training objective with a model parameterization that imposes the desired boundary conditions by design. Our approach significantly reduces the search space over trajectories and avoids expensive trajectory simulation and inefficient importance sampling estimators which are required in existing methods. We demonstrate the ability of our method to find feasible transition paths on real-world molecular simulation and protein folding tasks.</description>
