      <title>Nonvanishing derived limits without scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The derived functors $\lim^n$ of the inverse limit are widely studied for their topological applications, among which are some repercussions on the additivity of strong homology. Set theory has proven useful in dealing with these functors, for instance in the case of the inverse system $\mathbf{A}$ of abelian groups indexed by ${}^\omega \omega$. So far, consistency results for nonvanishing derived limits of $\mathbf{A}$ have always assumed the existence of a scale (i.e. a linear cofinal subset of $({}^\omega \omega, \leq^\ast )$, or equivalently that $\mathfrak{b} = \mathfrak{d} $). Here we do away with that assumption and prove that nonvanishing derived limits, and hence the non-additivity of strong homology, are consistent with any value of $\aleph_1 \leq \mathfrak{b} \leq \mathfrak{d} &lt; \aleph_\omega$, thus giving a partial answer to a question of Bannister.</description>

      <title>Countably compact extensions and cardinal characteristics of the continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we show that the existence of certain first-countable compact-like extensions is equivalent to the equality between corresponding cardinal characteristics of the continuum. For instance, $\mathfrak b=\mathfrak s=\mathfrak c$ if and only if every regular first-countable space of weight $&lt; \mathfrak c$ can be densely embedded into a regular first-countable countably compact space.</description>

      <title>Arrow-Sen theory simplified</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The traditional Arrow--Sen Social Choice Theory $\bf{TSCT}$ is a mathematical theory built apparently on higher--order formal language. In this paper, we propose a reformulation and reclassification of the $\bf{TSCT}$ axioms in order to obtain a simpler theory based on the first--order language axioms, keeping the spirit of original ideas. This new theory, called Simplified Social Choice Theory, denoted by $\bf{SSCT}$, presents a sub--theory of $\bf{TSCT}$. Roughly speaking, we extract all quatifications over $n$--tuples of binary relations from the axioms of $\bf{TSCT}$ and move them to the meta--level obtaining a sub--theory $\bf{SSCT}$ of $\bf{TSCT}$. More accurately, we assign to each traditional higher--order axiom $\bf{TA}$ its simplified first--order version $\bf{SA}$ such that $\bf{TA}\vdash\bf{SA}$, i.e. $\bf{SA}$ can be logically derived from $\bf{TA}$. In this way we define a simpler and more accessible set of principles that provide a context in which we can prove many propositions analogous to well--known theorems including the Arrow's impossibility of Paretian non--dictatorship and Sen's impossibility of Paretian liberal. These simplifications are the result of decades of lecturing by the author with the aim of bridging the barriers between this beautiful complex theory and his students.</description>

      <title>Logic in Mathematics and Computer Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Logic has pride of place in mathematics and its 20th century offshoot, computer science. Modern symbolic logic was developed, in part, as a way to provide a formal framework for mathematics: Frege, Peano, Whitehead and Russell, as well as Hilbert developed systems of logic to formalize mathematics. These systems were meant to serve either as themselves foundational, or at least as formal analogs of mathematical reasoning amenable to mathematical study, e.g., in Hilbert's consistency program. Similar efforts continue, but have been expanded by the development of sophisticated methods to study the properties of such systems using proof and model theory. In parallel with this evolution of logical formalisms as tools for articulating mathematical theories (broadly speaking), much progress has been made in the quest for a mechanization of logical inference and the investigation of its theoretical limits, culminating recently in the development of new foundational frameworks for mathematics with sophisticated computer-assisted proof systems. In addition, logical formalisms developed by logicians in mathematical and philosophical contexts have proved immensely useful in describing theories and systems of interest to computer scientists, and to some degree, vice versa. Three examples of the influence of logic in computer science are automated reasoning, computer verification, and type systems for programming languages.</description>

      <title>Complete Game Logic with Sabotage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Sabotage Game Logic ($\mathsf{GL_s}$), a simple and natural extension of Parikh's Game Logic with a single additional primitive, which allows players to lay traps for the opponent to avoid. $\mathsf{GL_s}$ can be used to model infinite sabotage games, in which players can change the rules during game play. In contrast to Game Logic, which is strictly less expressive, GLs is exactly as expressive as the modal $\mu$-calculus. This reveals a close connection between the entangled nested recursion inherent in modal fixpoint logics and adversarial dynamic rule changes characteristic for sabotage games. Additionally we present a natural Hilbert-style proof calculus for $\mathsf{GL_s}$ and prove completeness. The completeness of an extension of Parikh's calculus for Game Logic follows.</description>

      <title>Non-locally modular regular types in classifiable theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.11404</link>
      <description>arXiv:1910.11404v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of strong $p$-semi-regularity and show that if $p$ is a regular type which is not locally modular then any $p$-semi-regular type is strongly $p$-semi-regular. Moreover, for any such $p$-semi-regular type, "domination implies isolation" which allows us to prove the following: Suppose that $T$ is countable, classifiable and $M$ is any model. If $p\in S(M)$ is regular but not locally modular and $b$ is any realization of $p$ then every model $N$ containing $M$ that is dominated by $b$ over $M$ is both constructible and minimal over $Mb$.</description>

      <title>Strong ergodicity phenomena for Bernoulli shifts of bounded algebraic dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.04989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.04989v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The algebraic dimension of a Polish permutation group $Q\leq \mathrm{Sym}(\mathbb{N})$ is the smallest $n\in\omega$, so that for all $A\subseteq \mathbb{N}$ of size $n+1$, the orbit of every $a\in A$ under the pointwise stabilizer of $A\setminus\{a\}$ is finite. We study the Bernoulli shift $P\curvearrowright \mathbb{R}^{\mathbb{N}}$ for various Polish permutation groups $P$ and we provide criteria under which the $P$-shift is generically ergodic relative to the injective part of the $Q$-shift, when $Q$ has algebraic dimension $\leq n$. We use this to show that the sequence of pairwise $*$-reduction-incomparable equivalence relations defined in [KP21] is a strictly increasing sequence in the Borel reduction hierarchy. We also use our main theorem to exhibit an equivalence relation of pinned cardinal $\aleph_1^{+}$ which strongly resembles the equivalence relation of pinned cardinal $\aleph_1^{+}$ from [Zap11], but which does not Borel reduce to the latter. It remains open whether they are actually incomparable under Borel reductions.
  Our proofs rely on the study of symmetric models whose symmetries come from the group $Q$. We show that when $Q$ is "locally finite" -- e.g. when $Q=\mathrm{Aut}(\mathcal{M})$, where $\mathcal{M}$ is a locally finite countable structure with no algebraicity -- the corresponding symmetric model admits a theory of supports which is analogous to that in the basic Cohen model.</description>

      <title>Non-distributive description logic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.09561v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define LE-ALC, a generalization of the description logic ALC based on the propositional logic of general (i.e. not necessarily distributive) lattices, and semantically interpreted on relational structures based on formal contexts from Formal Concept Analysis (FCA). The description logic LE-ALC allows us to formally describe databases with objects, features, and formal concepts, represented according to FCA as Galois-stable sets of objects and features. We describe ABoxes and TBoxes in LE-ALC, provide a tableaux algorithm for checking the consistency of LE-ALC knowledge bases with acyclic TBoxes, and show its termination, soundness and completeness. Interestingly, consistency checking for LE-ALC is in PTIME for acyclic and completely unravelled TBoxes, while the analogous problem in the classical ALC setting is PSPACE-complete.</description>

      <title>Relational Algebraic Approach to the Real Numbers: The Least-Upper-Bound Property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01590v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we continue the investigation of a real number object, i.e., an object representing the real numbers, in categories of relations. Our axiomatization is based on a relation algebraic version of Tarski's axioms of the real numbers. It was already shown that the addition of such an object forms a dense, linear ordered abelian group. In the current paper we will focus on the least-upper-bound property of such an object.</description>

      <title>Generic derivations on algebraically bounded structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.20511v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let K be an algebraically bounded structure and T be its theory. If T is model complete, then the theory of K endowed with a derivation, denoted by $T^{\delta}$, has a model completion. Additionally, we prove that if the theory T is stable/NIP then the model completion of $T^{\delta}$ is also stable/NIP. Similar results hold for the theory with several derivations, either commuting or non-commuting.</description>

      <title>On the logic of interventionist counterfactuals under indeterministic causal laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07223v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the generalization of causal models to the case of indeterministic causal laws that was suggested in Halpern (2000). We give an overview of what differences in modeling are enforced by this more general perspective, and propose an implementation of generalized models in the style of the causal team semantics of Barbero &amp; Sandu (2020). In these models, the laws are not represented by functions (as in the deterministic case), but more generally by relations.
  We analyze significant differences in the axiomatization of interventionist counterfactuals in the indeterministic vs. the deterministic case, and provide strongly complete axiomatizations over the full class of indeterministic models and over its recursive subclass.</description>
