      <title>AdS Length corrected Thermodynamics of a Black Hole in a Cloud of Strings and Perfect Fluid Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The research paper investigates the thermodynamic behavior of a black hole in a cloud of strings (CoS) and perfect fluid dark matter (PFDM), incorporating a minor correction to the Anti de Sitter (AdS) length scale. The study reveals that while the entropy remains unaffected by the AdS length correction, other thermodynamic quantities such as enthalpy, free energy, pressure, internal energy, Gibbs free energy, and heat capacity exhibit significant modifications. Positive corrections to the AdS length generally enhance these quantities, leading to faster growth or slower decay with increasing black hole size, while negative corrections often produce the opposite effect, sometimes resulting in divergent or negative values. These findings highlight the sensitivity of black hole thermodynamics to geometric corrections and exotic matter fields, providing deeper information about the interplay between such modifications and thermodynamic stability. These results underscore the importance of considering minor corrections in theoretical models to better understand black hole behavior in the presence of dark matter and string-like matter distributions.</description>

      <title>The Hubble tension as an effect of the renormalization of fundamental constants and cosmological parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this Letter we propose an interpretation of the Hubble tension as an effect of the scale-running of cosmological parameters and fundamental constants, as the Newton's constant $G$ and the cosmological constant $\Lambda$. Namely, the tension between $H_0$ measurements by CMB and Supernovae observations would be a consequence of the fact that the value of $H_0$ depends (due to the running of $G$ and $\Lambda$) on the scale at which it is measured. Indeed, the two different values of the Hubble parameter today correspond to the two different cosmological scales at which Supernovae and CMB measurements probe our universe. We discuss some possible theoretical scenarios in which the running of $G$ and $\Lambda$ can occur. We stress that one should interpret such a running as a scale-dependence of the cosmological parameters and fundamental constants at the same time rather than a time dependence, as it is usually considered in the literature.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Inflation from Fermion Condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how inflation can emerge from four-fermion interactions generated by spacetime torsion, eliminating the need for additional scalar fields beyond the Standard Model. We partition fermions in two sectors and introduce two bound fields. In the effective theory approach, once all the fermions have been integrated out, the bound fields serve as the inflaton and the auxiliary field, in analogy to the hybrid inflation and accounting for a waterfall (hybrid) mechanism. The inclusion of an axial chemical potential naturally facilitates the end of reheating. During the waterfall regime, the effective potential governing the fermion condensate supports the formation of non-topological solitons, known as Q-balls, which can be accounted for seeding primordial black holes (PBHs).</description>

      <title>On Stability and Isotropization of Kasner Solution in $R^{2}$ Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fate of the Universe that initially expands anisotropically in the theory with $R^{2}$ quantum-gravitational term in the Lagrangian is investigated. The stability of Kasner-like expansion, specifically in the class of Kantowski-Sachs spacetimes, is analyzed. Kasner solutions are found to be unstable, with the bifurcation line between the initial conditions that lead to collapsing universes and the ones that set the universe for continuing expansion that becomes isotropic, established analytically. Under suitable conditions, the isotropized spacetime enters the intermediate slow-rolling inflationary stage similar to Starobinsky inflation.</description>

      <title>Effect of dark matter halo environment on GW memory signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the gravitational wave (GW) memory effect for a black hole embedded in a dark matter halo described by a Hernquist-type density profile, both with and without a spike. We first solve the geodesic equations in this spacetime under the influence of a GW pulse to examine how the combined effects of the dark matter halo and the GW pulse modify the geodesic deviation equation and particle trajectories. We then investigate how the memory effect manifests in the waveform in the presence of the dark matter halo. To do that, we analyze the memory contribution at asymptotic null infinity using the Bondi-Sachs formalism and, in particular, the Bondi-Metzner-Sachs (BMS) flux balance laws associated with BMS symmetries. This framework allows us to quantify the GW memory contribution to the waveform, incorporate it into the ringdown waveform templates, and thereby provide a possible avenue for extracting information about the dark matter halo parameters.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25952v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) experiments have transformed our understanding of the Universe by enabling direct observations of compact object mergers and other astrophysical phenomena. This chapter reviews the concepts of GW detectors, such as LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA, and describes their operating principles, data acquisition and analysis techniques, and some of the methods used to extract source properties. The scientific impact of GW observations is discussed as well, including contributions to astrophysics, tests of general relativity, and cosmology. We also examine the role of multimessenger astronomy and the complementarity between different GW detectors and with other astroparticle experiments. Finally, we outline future prospects with next-generation detectors, like the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer, and space-based missions.</description>

      <title>Tidal disruption of a neutron star near a naked singularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the tidal disruption of a neutron star (NS) near a black hole (BH), and for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, near a naked singularity (NaS). For a BH with a mass greater than about $10 M_{\odot}$, the tidal disruption of NS should occur within the event horizon, and hence neither can the stellar material escape nor a distant observer observe the disruption. Since NaS does not have an event horizon, a significant portion of the NS's material can escape, and the tidal disruption can be observed by a distant observer. One could identify such an event from the observed emission from the disrupted NS's material and the decay of the light curve of the disruption event. The escape of a significant fraction of the NS's material may also have implications for the heavy elements in the universe. Moreover, observing such an event can be useful for confirming a NaS, probing its spacetime, and studying the motion of matter in such a geometry. This may help constrain the NS parameters and equation of state models. As a first step in this direction, we calculate here the tidal disruption radius and other parameters for a specific type (Joshi-Malafarina-Narayan type 1) of NaS and compare our results with observations.</description>

      <title>The transverse-traceless gauge and the gauge problem of second order gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gauge problem arises in the second order gravitational waves due to the mode mixing. Here, we introduce the transverse-traceless (TT) gauge to cosmological backgrounds, and find that if we choose the TT gauge at first order, the second order tensor mode would be gauge invariant. Analogous to the Ricci flat spacetime, the vacuum condition is the key to guarantee the existence of the TT gauge on cosmological backgrounds. When we have the vacuum condition, the Poisson gauge, the uniform curvature gauge, the synchronous gauge and the total matter gauge are all equivalent to the TT gauge. Once the vacuum condition is approximately satisfied, the Poisson gauge would reduce to the TT gauge at the same order of approximation. With the sub-horizon limit, the vacuum condition could be obtained approximately, and the Poisson gauge, the uniform curvature gauge and the synchronous gauge are all approximated TT gauge. Our findings explain several existing results in the literature and indicate that the proposed TT gauge is useful to discuss higher order gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Light propagation in 2PN approximation in the monopole and quadrupole field of a body at rest: The basic transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Todays astrometry has reached the micro-arcsecond level in angular measurements of celestial objects. The next generations of astrometric facilities are aiming at the sub-micro-arcsecond scale. Sub-micro-arcsecond astrometry requires a considerable improvement in the theory of light propagation in the curved space-time of the solar system. In particular, it is indispensable to determine light trajectories to the second order of the post-Newtonian scheme, where the monopole and quadrupole structure of some solar system bodies need to be taken into account. In reality, both the light source as well as the observer are located at finite spatial distances from the gravitating body. This fact implies for the need to solve the boundary value problem of light propagation, where the light trajectory is fully determined by the spatial positions of source and observer and its unit direction at past infinity. This problem has been solved in a recent investigation. A practical relativistic model of observational data reduction necessitates the determination of the unit tangent vector along the light trajectory at the spatial position of the observer, which is determined by a sequence of several basic transformations. The determination of this unit tangent vector allows one to calculate the impact of the monopole and quadrupole structure of solar system bodies on light deflection on the sub-micro-arcsecond level, both for stellar light sources as well as for light sources located in the solar system. Numerical values for the magnitude of light deflection caused by the monopole and quadrupole structure of the body are given for grazing light rays at the giant planets. The model GREM is presently used for data reduction of the ESA astrometry mission Gaia. It is shown how the implementation of these basic transformations into GREM would proceed for possible future space astrometry missions.</description>

      <title>Formation and evolution of a 2-brane structure in multidimensional $f(R)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been previously shown that multidimensional $f(R)$ gravity
  {can lead} to a two-brane structure.
  In this paper, we analyze such a model with a spatially flat 4D de
  Sitter (dS) cosmology {whose Hubble parameter $H$ determines the
  universal energy scale}. We show that the two-brane metric is
  nucleated at the highest energies. The distance between the branes
  grows gradually as the energy decreases, tending to a finite value at
  zero energy density.
  It is stated that the physical parameters such as the 4D Planck mass,
  the Higgs vacuum expectation value, and vacuum energy density vary
  with the evolving universal energy scale, even on the classical level.
  We also show that the Higgs vacuum expectation value is different on
  different branes.</description>

      <title>Using precession and Lense-Thirring effect to constrain a rotating regular black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the frame-dragging effect on an accretion disk and test gyroscope orbiting around a rotating regular black hole with a Minkowski core. Firstly, we perturb a bound timelike circular orbit around the black hole, and analyze the periastron precession and Lense-Thirring (LT) precession frequencies of the orbit's epicyclic oscillations. Since these epicyclic oscillations can be used to explain the quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs) phenomena of the accretion disc around this rotating regular black hole, we then employ the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation to fit our theoretical results with five QPOs events (GRO J1655-40, GRS 1915+105, XTE J1859+226, H1743-322 and XTE J1550-564). The simulations give the relevant physical parameter space of the black hole, including the characteristic radius $r$, the mass related parameter $M$, the spinning parameter $a$ and the quantum gravity effect $\alpha$. The results give the constraint on the quantum effect parameter, with an upper limit $\alpha/M^{3/2} &lt; 0.60$ at the $95\%$ C.L., which is tighter than $&lt;0.7014$ in our pervious study within static case. Then, we theoretically explore the LT precession frequency, geodetic precession frequency, and the general spin precession frequency of a test gyro attached to a stationary observer in this black hole background. We find that the quantum gravity effect suppresses the precession frequencies comparing against those in Kerr black hole, further providing a theoretical diagnostic of the potential quantum gravity effect.</description>

Abstract: Asymptotically safe quantum gravity is a candidate theory to quantum gravity, which could unify the gravitational interaction with particle physics. It is characterized by quantum scale-symmetry at high energies. The constraining power of scale symmetry could be strong enough to even explain some parameters of the Standard Model of particle physics from first principles.</description>

      <title>Radiative and Jet Signatures of Regular Black Holes in Quantum-Corrected Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate regular rotating black holes predicted by asymptotically safe gravity, where the Newton constant varies with energy scale and modifies the near horizon geometry. These solutions remain asymptotically flat and avoid central singularities while differing from the classical Kerr spacetime in the strong field region. We compute the radiative efficiency of thin accretion disks and the jet power from the Blandford Znajek mechanism, both of which depend on the deformation parameter of the model. The predictions are compared with observational estimates for six stellar mass black holes. For systems with low or moderate spin the model reproduces the data within reported uncertainties, while rapidly spinning sources such as GRS 1915 105 present tensions and point to a restricted deformation range or the need for additional physics. The results show that quantum corrections confined to the strong gravity regime can still leave detectable imprints on high energy astrophysical processes. Radiative and jet based diagnostics therefore provide a promising method to test the geometry near the horizon and to explore possible signatures of quantum gravity in observations.</description>

      <title>Affine Gauge Theory: A Diffeomorphism Invariant Gauge Theory of Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is a comprehensive investigation of the Affine Gauge Theory (AGT) as a gauge theory of gravity having the same mathematical structure as gauge theories of the other fundamental forces of nature. This mathematical structure consists of a principal fiber bundle over the spacetime manifold that is endowed with an affine connection. The relationship between AGT and various formulations of teleparallel theories of gravity, which are alternatives to General Relativity, are examined. Here, it is argued that the Affine Bundle is the most natural principal fibre bundle for a gauge theory of gravity. AGT is also shown to be strictly diffeomorphism invariant. In particular, an explicit proof of diffeomorphism invariance in AGT is given - showing that AGT possesses the important symmetry of General Relativity, as would be expected from a theory of gravity. Lastly, the claim that AGT is background independent, as General Relativity is, from varying degrees of strictness in the definition of background independence is closely examined. Reasons for why a background independent theory is preferred are also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper answers examines the relationship between Diffeomorphism Invariance and Background Independence. First, a review of the relationship between Background Independence, General Relativity (GR) and pre-GR theories are given. Then, a wide range of other conceptions of background independence is discussed. It is shown that the definition of Background Independence is fluid and can mean different things to different philosophers and/or physicists. Most pertinently, the paper addresses the question of what kind of background independence is implied by a mathematical criterion of diffeomorphism invariance or in what sense is diffeomorphism invariance background independence. Lastly, the concept of haecceity in relation to diffeomorphism invariance is discussed.</description>

      <title>Restrictions on Initial Conditions in Cosmological Scenarios and Implications for Simulations of Primordial Black Holes and Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical relativity simulations provide a means by which to study the evolution and end point of strong over-densities in cosmological spacetimes. Specific applications include studies of primordial black hole formation and the robustness of inflation. Here we adopt a toy model previously used in asymptotically flat spacetimes to show that, for given values of the over-density and the mean curvature, solutions to the Hamiltonian constraint need not exist, and if they do exist they are not unique. Specifically, pairs of solutions exist on two branches, corresponding to strong-field and weak-field solutions, that join at a maximum beyond which solutions cease to exist. As a result, there is a limit to the extent to which an over-density can be balanced by intrinsic rather than extrinsic curvature on the initial slice. Even below this limit, iterative methods to construct initial data may converge to solutions on either one of the two branches, depending on the starting guess, leading to potentially inconsistent physical results in the evolution.</description>

      <title>Particles before symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25276v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The standard model of particle physics is usually cast in symmetry-first terms. Recently, a geometry-first picture has been proposed, in which the relevant symmetries do not appear explicitly at the ground level of ontology. In this paper I extend this approach to two central mechanisms of the standard model: spontaneous symmetry breaking and the Yukawa coupling, both essential for particles to acquire mass. These reformulations offer alternative explanations cast in purely geometric terms. For example, a particle's quantum numbers correspond to the internal space it inhabits and to the geometric type of object it is (e.g. an $(n,m)$-tensor). I argue that a symmetry-first account in terms of principal and associated bundles admits a genuine geometry-first counterpart only when the group's representation coincides with the automorphism group of the fibre -- a condition that cuts the slack tolerated by the symmetry-first view.</description>

      <title>Cosmological tensions in the era of precision cosmology: Insights from Tensions in Cosmology 2025</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ``Tensions in Cosmology'' series of conferences has been established as one of the main venues where the cosmological community collectively assesses the cracks in the concordance model and explores possible theoretical and observational remedies. The 2025 edition, held once again in Corfu, Greece, came at a crucial time: the Hubble constant $H_0$ discrepancy has now exceeded $6\sigma$, and new high-precision data from DESI, JWST, ACT, and other facilities have made this tension more robust while opening new windows on the early and late Universe. The $S_8$ tension, though milder and survey-dependent, remains an important probe of late-time structure formation, while emerging anomalies involving dynamical dark energy and neutrino physics are gaining increasing attention as potential signs of physics beyond $\Lambda$CDM. Here we provide a report on the meeting and an update on the state of the tensions in 2025, highlighting progress since the pioneering 2022 event.</description>

      <title>Thermal Damping of Neutrino-Coupled Scalar Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We point out that ultralight scalar dark matter that modulates neutrino masses can be significantly thermal damped by cosmic neutrinos in the early universe. This dissipative effect arises as a backreaction from the neutrinos which are being driven slightly out of thermal equilibrium by the scalar. We estimate the rate of such thermal damping and explore its phenomenological implications. For a scalar that is produced early, we find that the effect of thermal damping results in a predictable final abundance largely insensitive to its initial condition while circumventing late time limits. This motivates a parameter-space line to target experimentally.</description>

      <title>Holography vs. Scale Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we point out a contradiction between holography and scale-separated AdS (i.e. parametrically large mass gap) in string theory, making the standard assumption that the holographic CFT describes the IR degrees of freedom on a brane that decouple from gravity. We show that the CFT can only decouple from gravity if the scalar potential in the dual AdS satisfies a certain criterion. Namely, there must exist a scalar field trajectory that follows the gradient of the scalar potential to the asymptotic region of the scalar field space in which limit $V\sim m^\alpha$, where $\alpha\leq 2$ is a constant and $m$ is the mass scale of the lightest tower of states. This condition, which implies lack of scale-separation, is satisfied in the standard examples of AdS/CFT. However, proposed attempts at achieving scale separation, such as DGKT, employ scalar potentials that scale as $m^\alpha$ with $\alpha&gt;2$ in the asymptotic region of moduli space. We therefore conclude that the CFT duals of DGKT vacua cannot exist in string theory. Barring fine-tuning, our conclusions apply to other Ricci-flat flux compactifications including the KKLT scenario which relies on scale separation to obtain a metastable de Sitter uplift.</description>

      <title>Null matter and the ultrarelativistic origin of hydrodynamics at zero temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We uncover a universal sector of relativistic fluid dynamics by taking a novel ultrarelativistic limit in which the temperature tends to zero while the flow simultaneously approaches the speed of light. In this regime, hydrodynamics becomes an effective theory of \emph{null matter}, characterised by a preferred null vector, a preferred scale, and their gradients. We show that this theory of null matter constitutes an example of a hydrodynamic theory that can be linearly stable and causal in an arbitrary choice of frame. The framework developed here for null matter can offer insights into ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions, astrophysical phenomena with inherently large Lorentz factors, and the dynamics of black hole horizons.</description>

      <title>Residual Symmetries and Algebraic Structures in the Kerr-Schild Double Copy II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We complete our investigation into the residual symmetries of the Kerr-Schild double copy for the Schwarzschild solution. In Part I, we showed that the infinite-dimensional residual gauge algebra collapses to the finite-dimensional global isometries when restricted to Killing vectors. Here, we extend the analysis to proper conformal Killing vectors (CKVs), solving the field equations via the method of characteristics to obtain explicit conformal solutions. While asymptotic flatness and horizon regularity remove divergent contributions, the surviving components form a non-trivial infinite-dimensional algebra, revealing a structural mismatch with the canonical Schwarzschild solution. We resolve this by constructing a unified, Weyl-compensated BRST complex, showing that the infinite-dimensional modes are BRST-exact and do not correspond to physical degrees of freedom. This demonstrates the quantum consistency of the Kerr-Schild double copy, confirming that the physical spectrum is restricted to global isometries.</description>

      <title>Updated observational constraints on $\phi$CDM dynamical dark energy cosmological models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present updated observational constraints on the spatially flat $\phi$CDM model, where dark energy is described by a minimally coupled scalar field $\phi$ with an inverse power-law potential $V=V_0 \phi^{-\alpha}$. Using Planck 2018 CMB temperature, polarization (P18), and lensing power spectra (lensing), along with a compilation of non-CMB data including baryon acoustic oscillation, type Ia supernova, Hubble parameter, and growth rate measurements, we constrain $\phi$CDM and $\phi$CDM+$A_L$ models where $A_L$ is the CMB lensing consistency parameter. The scalar field parameter $\alpha$, which governs dark energy dynamics, is more tightly constrained by non-CMB data than by CMB data alone. For the full dataset, we obtain $\alpha = 0.055 \pm 0.041$ in the $\phi$CDM model and $\alpha = 0.095 \pm 0.056$ in the $\phi$CDM+$A_L$ model, mildly favoring evolving dark energy over a cosmological constant by $1.3\sigma$ and $1.7\sigma$. The Hubble constant is $H_0=67.55_{-0.46}^{+0.53}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ in the $\phi$CDM model, consistent with median statistics and some local determinations, but in tension with other local determinations. The constraints for matter density and clustering amplitude ($\Omega_m = 0.3096 \pm 0.0055$, $\sigma_8 = 0.8013_{-0.0067}^{+0.0077}$) of the flat $\phi$CDM model statistically agree with $\Lambda$CDM model values. Allowing $A_L$ to vary reduces tensions between CMB and non-CMB data, although we find $A_L = 1.105 \pm 0.037$, $2.8\sigma$ higher than unity, consistent with the excess smoothing seen in Planck data. Model comparison using AIC and DIC indicates that the $\phi$CDM model provides a fit comparable to $\Lambda$CDM, with the $\phi$CDM+$A_L$ slightly preferred. Overall, while the $\Lambda$CDM model remains an excellent fit, current data leave open the possibility of mildly evolving quintessence-like dynamical dark energy.</description>

      <title>Excursion Set Approach to Primordial Black Holes: Cloud-in-Cloud and Mass Function Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The abundance and mass function of primordial black holes (PBHs) are often estimated using the Press-Schechter (PS) formalism. In the case of halo formation, the PS formalism suffers from the miscounting of regions collapsing into halos, known as the cloud-in-cloud problem, which is usually corrected by introducing a multiplicative `fudge factor 2'. By analogy, this factor has sometimes been applied to PBH calculations, although its validity has remained unsettled. We reformulate the PS approach for PBHs within the excursion-set framework, where the smoothed density contrast undergoes a stochastic random walk as the smoothing scale varies and collapse is identified with the first threshold crossing. While the halo case is described by a Markovian process, we show that the PBH case is non-Markovian, even when the sharp-k filter Window function is adopted. Decomposing the total collapse probability into two distinct components of the stochastic motion, we numerically confirm that their contributions are exactly equal in the case of halo formation, justifying the fudge factor. For PBHs, however, we demonstrate that this equality no longer holds, and consistent inclusion of both contributions is essential to ensure a positive-definite mass function. Our results clarify the origin of the ambiguity surrounding the fudge factor and establish a robust theoretical foundation for PBH abundance calculations.</description>

      <title>Empirical Validation: Investigating the $\Lambda_s $CDM Model with new DESI BAO Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $\Lambda$CDM model has long served as the cornerstone of modern cosmology, offering an elegant and successful framework for interpreting a wide range of cosmological observations. However, the rise of high-precision datasets has revealed statistically significant tensions, most notably the Hubble tension and the $S_8$ discrepancy, which challenge the completeness of this standard model. In this context, we explore the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model-an extension of $\Lambda$CDM featuring a single additional parameter, $z_\dagger$, corresponding to a sign-switching cosmological constant. This minimal modification aims to alleviate key observational tensions without compromising the model's overall coherence. Recent findings present in the literature indicate that the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model not only provides a better fit to Lyman-$\alpha$ forest data for $z_\dagger &lt; 2.3$, but also accommodates both the SH0ES measurement of $H_0$ and the angular diameter distance to the last scattering surface when 2D BAO data are included. We present a comprehensive analysis combining the full Planck 2018 CMB data, the Pantheon Type Ia Supernovae sample, and the recently released Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). Our finding reveal that the Preliminary DESI results, a possible $3.9\sigma$ deviation from $\Lambda$CDM expectations, reinforce the importance of exploring such dynamic dark energy frameworks. In sum, our study underscores the potential of $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM to reconcile multiple cosmological tensions and sheds light on the role of upcoming high-precision observations in reshaping our understanding of the universe's expansion history and the nature of dark energy.</description>

      <title>Testing the nature of GW200105 by probing the frequency evolution of eccentricity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26152v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: GW200105 is a compact binary coalescence (CBC) event, consisting of a neutron star and a black hole, observed in LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA's (LVK's) third observing run (O3). Recent reanalyses of the event using state-of-the-art waveform models have claimed observation of signatures of an eccentric orbit. It has nevertheless been pointed out in the literature that certain physical or modified gravity effects could mimic eccentricity by producing a spurious non-zero eccentricity value, at a given reference frequency, when recovered with an eccentric waveform model. We recently developed a model-independent Eccentricity Evolution Consistency Test (EECT, S. A. Bhat et al. 2025) to identify such mimickers, by comparing the measured frequency $\textit{evolution}$ of eccentricity, $e(f)$, with that expected from General Relativity (GR). In this $\textit{Letter}$, we apply EECT to GW200105 and find that it satisfies EECT within 68% confidence. Our analysis therefore lends complementary support in favour of the eccentricity hypothesis, while also providing a novel test of the consistency of $e(f)$ with GR.</description>

      <title>Slow-rolling down the curvature: a reassessment of the Planck constraints on $\phi^2$ inflation in a closed universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) constraints on the spatial curvature of the Universe, assessing how they change when the curvature parameter and the primordial inflationary scalar spectrum are treated consistently within theoretically motivated frameworks. Instead of relying on the phenomenological parametrisation commonly used to capture curvature effects at the largest scales, we present a case study based on closed quadratic inflation, where the primordial spectrum is derived in full generality and in a gauge-invariant manner. Within this framework, we analyze both the $\texttt{plik}$ PR3 and $\texttt{CamSpec}$ PR4 Planck CMB likelihoods and find that the constraints on $\Omega_{\mathcal{K}}$ shift towards spatial flatness. In $\texttt{plik}$ the preference for $\Omega_{\mathcal{K}}&lt;0$ decreases from $\gtrsim 3.5\sigma$ to $\sim 2.5\sigma$, while in $\texttt{CamSpec}$ it reduces to $\sim 2\sigma$. At large angular scales ($\ell &lt; 10$), our model explains the low-$\ell$ power suppression anomaly, notably improving the fit to the quadrupole. However, the reduced preference for highly negative values of $\Omega_{\mathcal{K}}$ only partially accounts for the lensing anomaly at high multipoles, worsening the fit to the $\texttt{plik}$ spectrum at small scales. By contrast, in the $\texttt{CamSpec}$ PR4 spectrum, where the lensing anomaly is less pronounced, the model yields an overall improvement. Our analysis highlights a key conceptual point: closed-inflation models tie the curvature parameter to the inflationary dynamics and the primordial spectrum, enforcing consistency conditions that do not necessarily allow for the large deviations from flatness seen in phenomenological parametrisations. In the case of quadratic inflation, these restrictions reduce the apparent evidence for negative curvature reported by earlier analyses, while allowing for a mildly closed geometry.</description>

      <title>General Relativity Can Prevent a Runaway Greenhouse on Potentially Habitable Planets Orbiting White Dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Planets orbiting in the habitable zones of white dwarfs have recently been proposed as promising targets for biosignature searches. However, since the white dwarf habitable zone resides at 0.01 - 0.1 AU, planets residing there are subject to tidal heating if they have any orbital eccentricity. Previous work (Barnes &amp; Heller 2013) identified nearby planetary companions as potential roadblocks to habitability of planets around white dwarfs, as such companions could induce secular oscillations in eccentricity for the potentially habitable planet, which could in turn heat a surface ocean and induce a runaway greenhouse for even very low values ($e \sim 10^{-4}$) of the eccentricity of the potentially habitable planet. In this work, we examine the potential for general relativistic orbital precession to protect habitable planets orbiting white dwarfs from such a runaway greenhouse, and demonstrate that for some system architectures, general relativity can be protective for planetary habitability.</description>

      <title>Higher-form (Quasi)Hydrodynamics from Holography: Deformations and Dualities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the low-energy dynamics of systems with exact and approximate higher-form symmetries using gauge/gravity duality. These symmetries are realised holographically via Maxwell-type theories for massless and massive $p$-forms in AlAdS spacetimes. Double-trace deformations of the boundary theory are considered. While massless theories describe systems with conserved higher-form current, the massive case provides a controlled linearised framework for explicit symmetry breaking induced by defects and charged operators. We perform holographic renormalisation and establish a unified holographic dictionary across a broad theory space, parametrised by spacetime dimension, form rank, quantisation scheme and deformation scale. We compute thermal correlation functions in isotropic black brane backgrounds to characterise the hydrodynamic and quasihydrodynamic regimes of the dual boundary theories. Our analysis reveals a rich structure of relaxation dynamics, emergent photons and duality relations -- including the conventional electric-magnetic Hodge duality and its massive counterpart. These results extend bottom-up holography to include weakly broken higher-form symmetries and open avenues for exploring generalised self-duality constraints and new classes of deformed holographic duals.</description>

      <title>Formation of quiescent big bang singularities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.11370v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hawking's singularity theorem says that cosmological solutions arising from initial data with positive mean curvature have a past singularity. However, the nature of the singularity remains unclear. We therefore ask: If the initial hypersurface has sufficiently large mean curvature, does the curvature necessarily blow up towards the singularity?
  In case the eigenvalues of the expansion-normalized Weingarten map are everywhere distinct and satisfy a certain algebraic condition (which in 3+1 dimensions is equivalent to them being positive), we prove that this is the case in the CMC Einstein-non-linear scalar field setting. More specifically, we associate a set of geometric expansion-normalized quantities to any initial data set with positive mean curvature. These quantities are expected to converge, in the quiescent setting, in the direction of crushing big bang singularities. Our main result says that if the mean curvature is large enough, relative to an appropriate Sobolev norm of these geometric quantities, and if the algebraic condition is satisfied, then a quiescent (as opposed to oscillatory) big bang singularity with curvature blow-up forms. This provides a stable regime of big bang formation without requiring proximity to any particular class of background solutions.
  An important recent result by Fournodavlos, Rodnianski and Speck demonstrates stable big bang formation for all the spatially flat and spatially homogeneous solutions to the Einstein-scalar field equations satisfying the algebraic condition. Here we obtain analogous stability results for any solution inducing data at the singularity, in the sense introduced by the third author, in particular generalizing the aforementioned result. Moreover, we are able to prove both future and past global non-linear stability of a large class of spatially locally homogeneous solutions.</description>

Abstract: We propose that moments of time arise through the failed emergence of the temporal diffeomorphism as gauge symmetry, and that the passage of time is a continual process of an instantaneous state collapsing toward a gauge-invariant state. Unitarity and directedness of the resulting time evolution are demonstrated for a minisuperspace model of cosmology.</description>

      <title>Frolov Black Hole Surrounded by Quintessence -- I: Thermodynamics, Geodesics and Shadows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06252v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Frolov black hole (BH) is a charged extension of the Hayward BH, having regularity at the central point $r = 0$ and an asymptotically Schwarzschild form for large values of $r$. Such a BH is parameterized by a length scale parameter, \( \alpha_0 \). In this paper, we analyze the thermodynamic properties, null and timelike geodesics, and shadows of a Frolov BH immersed in a quintessence field. Our results indicate that the smaller BH is locally thermodynamically stable yet globally unstable at all horizon radii. Neither the quintessence parameter nor the other model parameters like the charge $q$ and length scale parameter $\alpha_0$ change this global instability. We extend the study of the null and timelike geodesics to the vicinity of the BH by analyzing how the geodesic motion depends on the model parameters. Finally, we analyze the shadow of the BH system and find that the shadow radii are sensitively dependent on model parameters. In contrast, the influence of the quintessence parameter itself on the size of the shadow is found to be rather weak.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from regular black holes in extreme mass-ratio inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11847v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze a rotating regular black hole spacetime with an asymptotically Minkowski core, focusing on extreme mass-ratio inspiral (EMRIs) where a stellar-mass object inspirals a supermassive black hole under consideration. Such spacetimes are also called Kerr-like spacetimes, which motivate the investigation of black holes beyond general relativity and the test of the no-hair theorem. In the present article, we consider the eccentric equatorial motion of an inspiralling object in the background of a rotating regular black hole. The dynamics generate gravitational waves (GWs) that imply a loss in energy and angular momentum of the orbiting body. In this scenario, as a result of the radiation reaction, we analytically compute the orbital evolution of the moving object. Further, we generate the gravitational waveforms and constrain the non-Kerr parameter through dephasing and mismatch computations using Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) observations. Our result indicates that LISA can distinguish the effect of the additional non-Kerr/deviation parameter with the parameter as small as $\sim10^{-6}$. The constraint on the parameter in the regular black hole using the Fisher information matrix (FIM) can be obtained within a fraction error of $10^{-5}$. The estimates of our analysis with EMRIs present the possible detectability of Kerr-like geometries with future space-based detectors, and further open up ways to put a stringent constraint on non-Kerr parameters with more advanced frameworks.</description>

      <title>Observational implications of Wald-Gauss-Bonnet topological dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15927v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the observational implications of Wald--Gauss--Bonnet (WGB) topological dark energy, a modified cosmological framework derived from the gravity-thermodynamics conjecture applied to the Universe's apparent horizon, with the Wald--Gauss--Bonnet entropy replacing the standard Bekenstein--Hawking one. Assuming a topological connection between the apparent horizon and interior black hole (BH) horizons, we derive modified Friedmann equations where the evolution of dark energy depends on BH formation and merger rates, which are approximated by the cosmic star formation rate. These equations introduce an additional, astrophysics--dependent contribution to the cosmological constant. We test two scenarios, one with a vanishing cosmological constant ($\Lambda = 0$) and another with a modified $\Lambda$ against late--Universe data (SNIa, BAO, Cosmic Chronometers) via a Bayesian analysis. Although the WGB framework is consistent with observations, information criteria statistically favor the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. An analysis of linear perturbations shows that the growth of cosmic structures is nearly indistinguishable from that of $\Lambda$CDM, with negligible dark energy clustering and minimal deviation in the effective Newton's constant. The standard thermal history is also preserved. In conclusion, WGB cosmology presents a phenomenologically rich alternative that connects dark energy to black hole astrophysics while remaining compatible with current cosmological data.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves decohere quantum superpositions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18111v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the interplay between quantum mechanical systems and gravity is a crucial step in uniting these two ideas. In recent works [1-7], the loss of coherence of quantum spatial superpositions is explored in the context of the local and global properties of spacetime. Moreover, Danielson et al [2, 3] showed that this decoherence is directly related to the memory effect, which is a prominent feature of gravitational radiation. We therefore seek to explore how a burst of gravitational radiation from a far-away source can effect the coherence of a quantum superposition. In this paper, we identify the individual contributions to the decoherence from the oscillatory and memory components of the incident gravitational wave, corresponding to hard and soft graviton emissions, respectively. In general, the memory contributions dominate, while the oscillatory component of the decoherence is strongly dependent on the phase of the burst when it is switched off. This work demonstrates how decoherence in quantum systems can arise from interactions with a classical gravitational field. We also briefly comment on the electromagnetic analogue of this effect and discuss its correspondence to the gravitational case.</description>

      <title>The reliable quantum master equation of the Unruh-DeWitt detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06411v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a method for estimating the validity range of the quantum Markovian master equation as applied to the Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detector within a broader context, particularly without necessitating an exact solution for the detector's evolution. We propose a relaxed van Hove limit (i.e., late-time limit) and offer a perturbative estimate of the error order resulting from the standard derivation procedure of open quantum dynamics. Our primary findings include reliability criteria for the Markov approximation and conditions for the applicability of the rotating wave approximation (RWA). Nevertheless, the specific forms of these validity conditions rely on the details of the detector-field system, such as the spacetime background, the trajectory of the detector, and the type of quantum field being analyzed. Finally, we illustrate our results by re-examining the open dynamics of an accelerating UDW detector undergoing the Unruh effect, where the validity conditions narrow the parameter space to ensure the solution's reliability regarding the quantum Markovian master equation.</description>

      <title>A Directive for obtaining Algebraically General Solutions of Einstein Equations Based on the Canonical Killing Tensor Forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00202v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work follows earlier investigations in which the existence of canonical Killing tensor forms and the application of general null tetrad transformations led to a variety of solutions, Petrov types D, III, N, in vacuum with a cosmological constant. Among those, a distinct Petrov type D family was extracted and characterized by a topological product of two-dimensional constant-curvature spaces admitting the canonical form. This is a general family of spacetimes with constant curvature and it is derived and presented here in full detail. In addition, an algebraically general solution exhibiting the exact same non-zero spin coefficients is introduced. Beyond this, we introduce an algebraically general solution, obtained by imposing the same canonical Killing tensor form and applying a Lorentz transformation within the anti-symmetric null tetrad transformation. The resulting geometry describes a non-stationary, cylindrically symmetric spacetime in vacuum with cosmological constant. On this basis, we propose a new directive: by assuming the canonical forms of Killing tensors and implementing Lorentz transformations within the anti-symmetric null tetrad concept, a broader class of algebraically general solutions of Einstein's equations can be derived.</description>

      <title>Spatial Correlation between Pulsars from Interfering Gravitational-Wave Sources in Massive Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07679v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the nanohertz band, the spatial correlations in pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) produced by interfering gravitational waves (GWs) from multiple sources likely deviate from the traditional ones without interference under the assumption of an isotropic Gaussian ensemble. This work investigates the impact of such interference within the framework of massive gravity. Through simulations, we show that while the resulting correlation patterns can be described by Legendre expansions with coefficients that depend on the interference configuration, they remain predominantly quadrupolar (l = 2), with this feature becoming more pronounced as the graviton mass increases--reflecting both the tensorial polarizations and the modified GW dispersion. However, the interference introduces significant variability in the angular correlation, making it difficult to distinguish massive gravity from general relativity based on a single realization of the Universe. We conclude that beyond a fundamental constraint set by the PTA observation time, achieving a substantially tighter bound on the graviton mass is statistically challenging and observationally limited under realistic conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21869v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-Gaussian noise in gravitational-wave detectors, known as "glitches," can bias the inferred parameters of transient signals when they occur nearby in time and frequency. These biases are addressed with a variety of methods that remove or otherwise mitigate the impact of the glitch. Given the computational cost and human effort required for glitch mitigation, we study the conditions under which it is strictly necessary. We consider simulated glitches and gravitational-wave signals in various configurations that probe their proximity both in time and in frequency. We determine that glitches located outside the time-frequency space spanned by the gravitational-wave model prior and with a signal-to-noise ratio, conservatively, below 50 do not impact estimation of the signal parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10002v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study effects of presence of a small amount of so-called anisotropic solid remnant in the early post-inflationary Universe dominated by radiation. This model is inspired by solid inflation and its generalizations with matter described through a triplet of fields. In our model, the internal full global Euclidean symmetry of this triplet is broken, which leads to an anisotropic expansion of the Universe. Superhorizon scalar and vector perturbations grow, while behavior of tensor perturbations remains the same as in the standard case with Universe filled with only radiation. We also find a very interesting case within the limit of a very small amount of the anisotropic solid remnant and the longest possible duration of its presence, where size of vector perturbations decreases with a different power of scale factor as in the standard scenario. The obtained results improve agreement between the observational data and the theoretical predictions of solid inflation in a case with suppressed non-linear effects.</description>

The vacuum equations admit inflationary solutions, hinting at an entropic origin for inflation. Equations also admit a regime of phantom like behavior. Assuming that the relation between slow roll parameters and CMB observables holds for entropic gravity, the theory predicts a viable spectrum.</description>

      <title>The BINGO/ABDUS Project: Forecast for cosmological parameters from a mock Fast Radio Bursts survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17516v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There are various surveys that will provide excellent data to search for and localize Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs). The BINGO project will be one such survey, and this collaboration has already estimated a FRB detection rate that the project will yield. We present a forecast of the future constraints on our current cosmological model that the BINGO FRB detections and localizations will have when added to other current cosmological datasets. We quantify the dispersion measure (DM) as a function of redshift ($z$) for the BINGO FRB mock sample. Furthermore, we use current datasets (Supernovae, Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations, and Cosmic Microwave Background data) prior to assessing the efficacy of constraining dark energy models using Monte Carlo methods. Our results show that spatially localized BINGO FRB dataset will provide promising constraints on the population of host galaxies intrinsic DM and be able to measure the nuisance parameters present within a FRB cosmological analysis. They will also provide alternative estimates on other parameters such as the Hubble constant and the dark energy equation of state. In particular, we should see that BINGO FRB data can put constraints on the degenerate $w-H_0$ plane, which the CMB is incapable of measuring, allowing FRBs to be a viable alternative to BAO to constrain the dark energy equation of state. We conclude that FRBs remain a promising future probe for cosmology and that the FRBs localized by the BINGO project will contribute significantly to our knowledge of the current cosmological model.</description>

      <title>Heat engines for scale invariant systems dual to black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03363v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: According to holography, a black hole is dual to a thermal state in a strongly coupled quantum system. One of the best-known examples of holography is the Anti-de Sitter/Conformal Field Theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence. Despite extensive work on holographic thermodynamics, heat engines for CFT thermal states have not been explored. We construct reversible heat engines where the working substance consists of a static thermal equilibrium state of a CFT. For thermal states dual to an asymptotically AdS black hole, this yields a realization of Johnson's holographic heat engines. We compute the efficiency for a number of idealized heat engines, such as the Carnot, Brayton, Otto, Diesel, and Stirling cycles. The efficiency of most heat engines can be derived from the CFT equation of state, which follows from scale invariance, and we compare them to the efficiencies for an ideal gas. However, the Stirling efficiency for a generic CFT is uniquely determined in terms of its characteristic temperature and volume only in the high-temperature or large-volume regime. We derive an exact expression for the Stirling efficiency for CFT states dual to AdS-Schwarzschild black holes and compare the subleading corrections in the high-temperature regime with those in a generic CFT.</description>

      <title>Shadows of a Non-Commutative Black Hole under the Influence of a Magnetized Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00581v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of the shadow cast by a black hole (BH) in a non-commutative spacetime surrounded by a plasma medium. BHs in a plasma environment can exhibit complex interactions that profoundly affect their shadow properties. In specific terms, we consider a special type of plasma medium motivated from the interactions among axions, photons and plasma excitations, or commonly termed as axion-plasmon in the presence of a magnetic field. We have studied the effect of these plasma parameters and the non-commutative parameter on the shadow properties by focusing particularly on the photon sphere radius, angular shadow and the shadow observed from the observer's perspective. For this we have considered two different forms of plasma, viz homogeneous and inhomogeneous plasma. In this work we have presented the parameter dependence of these BH shadow properties. Finally, we have also studied the energy emission rate of the BH and how it depends on the model and plasma parameters.</description>

      <title>Superradiant dark matter production from primordial black holes: Impact of multiple modes and gravitational wave emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18935v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rotating primordial black holes (PBHs) in the early universe can emit particles through superradiance, a process particularly efficient when the particle's Compton wavelength is comparable to the PBH's gravitational radius. Superradiance leads to an exponential growth of particle occupation numbers in gravitationally bound states. We present an analysis of heavy bosonic dark matter (DM) production through three gravitational mechanisms: Hawking radiation, superradiant instabilities, and ultraviolet (UV) freeze-in. We consider PBHs that evaporate before Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). For both scalar and vector DM, our analysis incorporates the evolution of a second superradiant mode. We demonstrate that the growth of a second superradiant mode causes the decay of the first mode, and thus the second mode cannot further enhance the DM abundance beyond that already achieved by the first mode. Our study also reveals that while superradiance generally enhances DM production, gravitational wave (GW) emission from the superradiant cloud may significantly modify this picture. For scalar DM, GW emission reduces the parameter space where superradiance effectively augments relic abundance. For vector DM, rapid GW emission from the superradiant cloud may yield relic abundances below those achieved through Hawking radiation alone. These findings demonstrate that multiple-mode effect and GW emission play critical roles in modeling DM production from PBHs in the early universe.</description>

      <title>Model-Independent Dark Energy Measurements from DESI DR2 and Planck 2015 Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17415v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using DESI DR2 baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) distance measurements and Planck cosmic microwave background distance priors, we have measured the dark energy density $\rho_X(z)$ and dark energy equation of state w_X(z) as free functions of redshift (smoothly interpolated from values at {z_i}={0, 1/3, 2/3, 1, 4/3, 2.33}, and find both to be consistent with a cosmological constant, with only deviations of 1\sigma for $\rho_X(z)$ &amp; ~ 2$\sigma$ for w_X(z) at z=2/3. We also find that measuring {$\rho_X(z_i)$} is preferred to measuring {w_X(z_i)} by model selection using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) as well as the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). Varying the choice of redshift values of the $\rho_X(z)$ measurements leads to very consistent results, with AIC/BIC slightly favoring the case of our fiducial {z_i} with z=4/3 omitted. We find agreement with a cosmological constant except for the 1-2$\sigma$ deviation at 0.4 &lt; z &lt; 0.9, where DESI DR2 BAO measurements deviate from a cosmological constant at similar statistical significance. Our results differ noticeably from those of the DESI Collaboration, in which they used the same DESI DR2 data combined with Planck data and found a 3.1$\sigma$ deviation from a cosmological constant, which is primarily the consequence of their assuming parametrization w_X(z)=w_0+w_a(1-a). Our results indicate that assuming a linear w_X(z) could be misleading and precludes discovering how dark energy actually varies with time at higher redshifts. In our quest to discover the physical nature of dark energy, the most urgent goal at present is to determine definitively whether dark energy density varies with time. It is of critical importance to measure dark energy density as a free function of redshift from data. Future galaxy redshift surveys by Euclid and Roman at higher redshifts will significantly advance our understanding of dark energy.</description>

      <title>Beyond Entanglement: Diagnosing quantum mediator dynamics in gravitationally mediated experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04300v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: No experimental test to date has provided conclusive evidence on the quantum nature of gravity. Recent proposals, such as the BMV experiment, suggest that generating entanglement could serve as a direct test. Motivated by these proposals, we study a system of three-harmonic oscillator system, with the mediator oscillator operating in two distinct parameter regimes: a heavy mediator regime and a light mediator regime. These regimes induce qualitatively different entanglement dynamics between the terminal oscillators. Crucially, distinguishing these regimes experimentally remains challenging when relying solely on entanglement measures. We demonstrate that the dynamical fidelity susceptibility offers a viable and sensitive probe to contrast the regimes in practice. Our results provide testable signatures for optomechanical and trapped-ion platforms simulating gravitational interactions, and provide new avenues to characterize quantum-gravity-inspired systems beyond entanglement-based protocols.</description>

      <title>GW231123 Mass Gap Event and the Primordial Black Hole Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15701v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the possibility that the recently reported GW231123 event, with component masses $M_1=137^{+22}_{-17}\,M_\odot$, $M_2=103^{+20}_{-52}\,M_\odot$ and a local merger rate $R_{\mathrm{local}}=0.08^{+0.19}_{-0.07}\,\mathrm{Gpc^{-3}\,yr^{-1}}$, originates from primordial black holes (PBHs) formed during an early matter-dominated era. We compute the PBH mass function, abundance, spin distribution and the merger rate density and find a set of choices for the parameters to reproduce the key properties of GW231123. While PBHs formed in such a scenario can acquire large spins through sustained tidal torques, the spin distribution remains uncertain and additional accretion might lead to extreme spin values inferred in GW231123. We also show that the resulting PBH abundance, $f_{\mathrm{pbh}}=1.64^{+5.00}_{-1.59}\times10^{-1}$, lies close to the exclusion bounds from CMB accretion limits and other probes, highlighting a potential tension with current constraints. Finally, we estimate the scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) that are inevitably generated during PBH formation. PBHs that interpret GW231123 are accompanied by negligible SIGWs in the nano-hertz band, indicating no conflict with current pulsar timing arrays data.</description>

      <title>Quantum Metric Corrections to Liouville's Theorem and Chiral Kinetic Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15731v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quasiparticles may possess not only Berry curvature but also a quantum metric in momentum space. We develop a canonical formalism for such quasiparticles based on the Dirac brackets, and demonstrate that quantum metric modifies the phase-space density of states at $\mathcal{O}(\hbar^2)$, leading to corrections to Liouville's theorem, kinetic theory, and related physical quantities. In particular, we show that, in the presence of an inhomogeneous electric field, quantum metric induces corrections to the energy density and energy current. Applied to chiral fermions, this framework provides a nonlinear extension of chiral kinetic theory consistent with quantum field theory. Our work paves the way to potential applications of the quantum metric in high-energy physics and astrophysics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17583v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct an exact solution in four-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton theory, describing multi-centered rotating black holes carrying both electric and magnetic charges, obtained via dimensional reduction from five-dimensional Einstein gravity. This generalizes the Majumdar-Papapetrou solution to the rotating case, and extends the recent multi-centered rotating black hole solutions of Teo and Wan to configurations with unequal electric and magnetic charges. The resulting spacetimes are free of curvature singularities, conical defects, Dirac-Misner strings, and closed timelike curves, both on and outside the horizons, provided that the black holes have either aligned or anti-aligned spin orientations.</description>

      <title>Residual Symmetries and Algebraic Structures in the Kerr-Schild Double Copy I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24112v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Kerr-Schild double copy is celebrated for producing exact gravitational spacetimes from gauge fields, yet the preservation of symmetry content remains largely unexplored. We investigate the fate of residual symmetries in the Kerr-Schild double copy, focusing on the Schwarzschild solution. On the gauge theory side, we derive the residual transformations that preserve the Abelian and non-Abelian Kerr-Schild ansatz\"e, finding they both form an infinite-dimensional Lie algebra parameterized by arbitrary null functions. On the gravity side, we analyze the resulting residual diffeomorphisms of the Kerr-Schild Schwarzschild metric. Restricting our focus to the Killing vector class of solutions, we find that the only surviving diffeomorphisms are the finite-dimensional global isometries of Schwarzschild, reducing the residual gauge algebra to the Poincar\'e subalgebra containing exclusively time translations and spatial rotations. This finding confirms a fundamental structural mismatch: the infinite-dimensional algebra of the gauge side admits no analogous structure in this gravitational sector. We formalize this by showing that the BRST operator for the residual symmetry is trivialized under the Killing condition, establishing the consistency of this algebraic reduction within a quantum field theoretic framework. This paper is the first of a two-part series. In Part II, we complete this analysis by examining the more complex proper conformal Killing vector class of solutions and formulating a unified BRST framework.</description>
