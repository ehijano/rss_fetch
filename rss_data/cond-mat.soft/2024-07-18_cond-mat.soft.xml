      <title>Emergence of cellular nematic order is a conserved feature of gastrulation in animal embryos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cells undergo dramatic changes in morphology during embryogenesis, yet how these changes affect the formation of ordered tissues remains elusive. Here we find that the emergence of a nematic liquid crystal phase occurs in cells during gastrulation in the development of embryos of fish, frogs, and fruit flies. Moreover, the spatial correlations in all three organisms are long-ranged and follow a similar power-law decay (y~$x^{-\alpha}$ ) with $\alpha$ less than unity for the nematic order parameter, suggesting a common underlying physical mechanism unifies events in these distantly related species. All three species exhibit similar propagation of the nematic phase, reminiscent of nucleation and growth phenomena. Finally, we use a theoretical model along with disruptions of cell adhesion and cell specification to characterize the minimal features required for formation of the nematic phase. Our results provide a framework for understanding a potentially universal features of metazoan embryogenesis and shed light on the advent of ordered structures during animal development.</description>

      <title>Efficient condensation on spiked surfaces with superhydrophobic and superhydrophilic coatings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Steam condensation on the surface of a solid is a widely observed mode of energy transfer in nature and various industrial applications. The condensation efficiency is closely related to the material properties and geometric morphology of the solid surface, as well as the method of liquid removal. Despite many surface modification strategies at the micro and nano levels having been employed to enhance steam condensation, understanding how to regulate steam condensation and liquid removal on complex surface morphologies remains incomplete. Here, we report a method that uses superhydrophilic and superhydrophobic coatings as well as spiked surfaces to achieve efficient steam condensation and rapid removal of the liquid. We reveal that on a copper plate with millimeter-scale spikes, hydrophobic spiked surfaces facilitate the dropwise condensation, while hydrophilic bottom grooves promote liquid spreading, and the suction in capillary gaps can promptly remove the condensate liquid. This method achieves a high condensation efficiency without relying on gravity. Additionally, we demonstrate that the condensation on spiked surfaces has a significant suction effect, as it continuously attracts the steam flow, thereby altering the flow direction. This finding provides a new approach for efficient steam condensation technology and opens up a promising pathway for providing circulation power and improving condensation efficiency in phase-change heat transfer devices such as heat pipes.</description>

      <title>Flexible String Model of Unsaturated Lipid Bilayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An analytically solvable model of unsaturated lipid bilayer is derived by introducing finite bending angle of the unsaturated bond relative to straight part of the lipid chain considered previously in our model of semi-flexible strings. It is found that lateral pressure profile of unsaturated lipids has distinct maximum in the unsaturated bond region due to enhanced excluded volume effect caused by the bent bond, leading to an increase of entropic repulsion between the lipid chains. Simultaneously, just away from the unsaturated bond some parts of the neighbouring lipid chains have less probability to collide by geometrical reasons, causing depletion of entropic repulsion relative to saturated lipid chains case and resulting in the local minima of the lateral pressure profile surrounding the maximum at the bent unsaturated bond. Lipid chain order parameter, lateral pressure profile, and area per lipid are computed for POPC and compared with those for DPPC lipid bilayer.</description>

      <title>Scaling Properties of Gelling Systems in Nonlinear Shear Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study model near-critical polymer gelling systems made of gluten proteins dispersions stabilized at different distances from the gel point. We impose different shear rates and follow the time evolution of the stress. For sufficiently large shear rates, an intermediate stress overshoot is measured before reaching the steady state. We evidence self-similarity of the stress overshoot as a function of the applied shear rate for samples with various distances from the gel point, which is related to the elastic energy stored by the samples, as for dense systems close to the jamming transition. In concordance with the findings for glassy and jammed systems, we also measure that the stress after flow cessation decreases as a power law with time with a characteristic relaxation time that depends on the shear rate previously imposed. These features revealed in non-linear rheology could be the signature of a mesoscopic dynamics, which would depend on the extent of gelation.</description>

      <title>Delicate Analysis of Interacting Proteins and Their Assemblies by Flow Field-Flow Fractionation Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the efficiency of several Asymmetrical Flow Field-Flow Fractionation (AF4) techniques to investigate the self-associating wheat gluten proteins. We compare the use of a denaturing buffer including sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and a mild chaotropic solvent, water/ethanol, as eluent, on a model gluten sample. Through a thorough analysis of the data obtained from coupled light scattering detectors, and with the identification of molecular composition of the eluted protein, we evidence co-elution events in several conditions. We show that the focus step used in conventional AF4 with the SDS buffer leads to the formation of aggregates that co-elute with monomeric proteins. By contrast, a frit-inlet device enables the fractionation of individual wheat proteins in the SDS buffer. Interestingly conventional AF4, using water/ethanol as eluent, is an effective method for fractionating gluten proteins and their complex dynamic assemblies which involve weak forces and are composed of both monomeric and polymeric proteins.</description>

      <title>Inderdigitation, double twist, and topological defects in a system of hard lollipops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using hard particle Monte Carlo simulations, we studied a three-dimensional system consisting of identical, lollipop-like particles. Each lollipop was built of five identical, tangent balls placed along a line and one larger ball at one side of the particle and modeled the RM734 molecule, for which ferroelectric and splay nematics were recently discovered in the experiment. Although our model did not recreate these phases, we observed inherently polar type A and C interdigitated smectics. Moreover, an intriguing, isotropic phase consisting of double-twisted clusters joined by planar defects was formed for a moderate packing fraction and ball diameters ratio.</description>

      <title>Dissipative effects in odd viscous Stokes flow around a single sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.09574v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Odd viscosity (OV) is a transport coefficient in, for example, fluids of self-spinning (active) particles or electrons in an external magnetic field. The key feature of OV is that it does not contribute to dissipation in two spatial dimensions. In contrast, we explicitly show that in the three-dimensional case, OV can contribute indirectly to dissipation by modifying the fluid flow. We quantify the dissipation rate of a single spherical particle moving through a fluid with OV via an exact analytical solution of the generalised stationary creeping flow equations. Our results provide a novel way to quantify the effects of OV by measuring the solid-body motion of a single spherical particle. Moreover, we explicitly demonstrate how complex fluids can be designed in terms of their rheological properties by mixing passive particles with self-spinning active particles.</description>

      <title>Early-stage dynamics of impact-induced hardening of dense suspensions of millimeter-sized particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19202v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the phenomenon of the early-stage dynamics of impact-induced hardening in dense suspensions, where materials undergo solidification upon impact. While Stokes flow theory traditionally applies to suspensions with micrometer-sized particles due to their low Reynolds numbers, suspensions containing larger particles defy such idealizations. Our work focuses on the early-stage impact-induced hardening of suspensions containing millimeter-sized particles through dynamic impact experiments. We are particularly interested in the maximum drag force $F_\mathrm{max}$ acting on the projectile as a function of the impact speed $u_0$. We successfully conducted experiments using these suspensions and confirmed the relation $F_\mathrm{max}\sim u_0^{3/2}$ for relatively large $u_0$ as observed in the previous studies suspensions of micrometer-sized particles. Our findings reveal that the early-stage behaviors of millimeter-sized particle suspensions align well with predictions from the floating model, typically applicable under Stokes flow conditions. This research sheds light on the complex dynamics of impact-induced hardening in dense suspensions, particularly with larger particles, advancing our understanding beyond conventional micrometer-sized systems.</description>

      <title>Accurate estimation of the normalized mutual information of multidimensional data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04980v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While the linear Pearson correlation coefficient represents a well-established normalized measure to quantify the interrelation of two stochastic variables $X$ and $Y$, it fails for multidimensional variables such as Cartesian coordinates. Avoiding any assumption about the underlying data, the mutual information $I(X, Y)$ does account for multidimensional correlations. However, unlike the normalized Pearson correlation, it has no upper bound ($I \in [0, \infty)$), i.e., it is not clear if say, $I = 0.4$ corresponds to a low or a high correlation. Moreover, the mutual information (MI) involves the estimation of high-dimensional probability densities (e.g., six-dimensional for Cartesian coordinates), which requires a k-nearest neighbor algorithm, such as the estimator by Kraskov et al. [Phys. Rev. E 69, 066138 (2004)]. As existing methods to normalize the MI cannot be used in connection with this estimator, a new approach is presented, which uses an entropy estimation method that is invariant under variable transformations. The algorithm is numerically efficient and does not require more effort than the calculation of the (un-normalized) MI. After validating the method by applying it to various toy models, the normalized MI between the $C_{\alpha}$ -coordinates of T4 lysozyme is considered and compared to a correlation analysis of inter-residue contacts.</description>

      <title>Dissociation of red blood cell aggregates in extensional flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11645v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Blood rheology and microcirculation are strongly influenced by red blood cell aggregation. We investigate the dissociation rates of red cell aggregates in extensional flow using hyperbolic microfluidic constrictions and image analysis by a convolutional neural network (CNN). Our findings reveal that aggregate dissociation increases sharply when a critical extension rate is reached which falls within the range of microcirculatory conditions, suggesting that large variations of aggregate sizes should be expected in-vivo. This work contributes to a deeper understanding of the behavior of red blood cell aggregates in response to extensional stress in microcirculatory networks, provides crucial experimental data to validate theoretical and numerical models, and constitutes the basis for improved evaluation of blood aggregability in clinical contexts.</description>
