      <title>On quantum Floquet theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Schr\"odinger equation $ih\partial_t\psi = H\psi$, $\psi=\psi(\cdot,t)\in L^2({\mathbb T})$. The operator $H = -\partial^2_x + V(x,t)$ includes smooth potential $V$, which is assumed to be time $T$-periodic. Let $W=W(t)$ be the fundamental solution of this linear ODE system on $L^2({\mathbb T})$. Then according to terminology from Lyapunov-Floquet theory, ${\cal M}=W(T)$ is the monodromy operator. We prove that ${\cal M}$ is unitarily conjugated to $\exp\big(-\frac{T}{ih} \partial^2_x\big) + {\cal C}$, where ${\cal C}$ is a compact operator with an arbitrarily small norm.</description>

      <title>A note on spectral theory of integral-functional Volterra operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A concise overview of the spectral theory of integral-functional operators is provided. In the context of analysis, a technique is described for deriving solutions to equations involving operators in a closed form. A constructive theorem has been established, outlining a procedure for determining the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of these operators. Based on this foundation, an analytical approach for generating solutions to a Volterra-type integro-functional inhomogeneous equation is proposed.</description>

      <title>Normalization flow in the presence of a resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following arXiv:2303.02992, we develop an approach to the Hamiltonian theory of normal forms based on continuous averaging. We concentrate on the case of normal forms near an elliptic singular point, but unlike arXiv:2303.02992 we do not assume that frequences of the linearized system are nonresonant. We study analytic properties of the normalization procedure. In particular we show that in the case of a codimension one resonance an analytic Hamiltonian function may be reduced to a normal form up to an exponentially small reminder with explicit estimates of the reminder and the analyticity domain.</description>

      <title>Accessibility and Ergodicity of Partially Hyperbolic Diffeomorphisms without Periodic Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that every $C^2$ conservative partially hyperbolic diffeomorphism of a closed 3-manifold without periodic points is ergodic, which gives an affirmative answer to the Ergodicity Conjecture by Hertz-Hertz-Ures in the absence of periodic points. We also show that a partially hyperbolic diffeomorphism of a closed 3-manifold $M$ with no periodic points is accessible if the non-wandering set is all of $M$ and the fundamental group $\pi_1(M)$ is not virtually solvable.</description>

      <title>Parametric topological entropy on orbits of arbitrary multivalued maps in compact Hausdorff spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Adler-Konheim-McAndrew type definitions and the Bowen-Dinaburg-Hood type definitions of parametric topological entropy will be considered on orbits and coincidence orbits of nonautonomous multivalued maps in compact Hausdorff spaces. Their mutual relationship and their link to various further types of definitions like those of (parametric) preimage entropy, will be investigated. In this way, several recent results of the other authors will be generalized and extended into a new setting.</description>

      <title>Investigating Ocean Circulation Dynamics Through Data Assimilation: A Mathematical Study Using the Stommel Box Model with Rapid Oscillatory Forcings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate ocean circulation changes through the lens of data assimilation using a reduced-order model. Our primary interest lies in the Stommel box model which reveals itself to be one of the most practicable models that has the ability of reproducing the meridional overturning circulation. The Stommel box model has at most two regimes: TH (temperature driven circulation with sinking near the north pole) and SA (salinity driven with sinking near the equator). Currently, the meridional overturning is in the TH regime. Using box-averaged Met Office EN4 ocean temperature and salinity data, our goal is to provide a probability that a future regime change occurs and establish how this probability depends on the uncertainties in initial conditions, parameters and forcings. We will achieve this using data assimilation tools and DAPPER within the Stommel box model with fast oscillatory regimes.</description>

      <title>Embedding-based comparison of reaction networks of Wnt signaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a new method for comparing two reaction networks of the same or closely related systems through their embedded networks in terms of the shared set of species. Hence, we call this method the Common Species Embedded Networks (CSEN) analysis. Using this approach, we conduct a comparison of existing reaction networks associated with Wnt signaling models (Lee, Schmitz, MacLean, and Feinberg) that we have identified. The analysis yields three important results for these Wnt models. First, the CSEN analysis of the Lee (mono-stationary) and Feinberg (multi-stationary) shows a strong similarity, justifying the study of the Feinberg model, which was a modified Lee model constructed to study an important network property called "concordance". It also challenge the absoluteness of discrimination of the models into mono-stationarity versus multi-stationarity, which is a main result of Maclean et al. (PNAS USA 2015). Second, the CSEN analysis provides evidence supporting a strong similarity between the Schmitz and MacLean models, as indicated by the "proximate equivalence" that we have identified. Third, the analysis underscores the absence of a comparable relationship between the Feinberg and MacLean models, highlighting distinctive differences between the two. Thus, our approach could be a useful tool to compare mathematical models of the same or closely related systems.</description>

Abstract: For a real analytic periodic function $\phi:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}^d$, an integer $b \ge 2$ and $\lambda\in(1/b,1)$, we prove that the box dimension and the Hausdorff dimension of the graph of the Weierstrass function $W(x)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}{{\lambda}^n\phi(b^nx)}$ are both equal to $$\min\left\{\log_{\lambda^{-1}}b,\,1+\left(\,d-q\,\right)\left(1+\log_b\lambda\right)\right\},$$ where $q = q(\phi, b, \lambda)$ denotes the maximum dimension of all linear spaces $V &lt; \mathbb{R}^d$ such that the projection $\pi_V W$ is Lipschitz.</description>

      <title>Arakelov-Green's functions for dynamical systems on projective varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce functions associated to polarized dynamical systems that generalize averages of the dynamical Arakelov-Green's functions for rational functions due to Baker and Rumely. For a polarized dynamical system $X\to X$ over a product formula field, we prove an Elkies-style lower bound for these functions evaluated on the adelic points of $X$. As an application, we prove a Lehmer-type lower bound on the canonical height of a non-torsion point $P$ on an abelian variety $A/K$, where $K$ is a product formula field having perfect residue fields at its completions (for instance, $K$ may be a number field or the function field of a curve over $\mathbb{C}$ or $\mathbb{F}_p$). For $A$ of dimension $g$, the lower bound has the form \[\widehat{h}(P)\ge\frac{C}{D^{2g+3}(\log D)^{2g}},\] where $C=C(A,K,\widehat{h})&gt;0$, $D=[K(P):K]\ge2$, and $P\in A(\bar{K})\setminus A(\bar{K})_{\text{tors}}$ is not contained in a torsion translate of an abelian subvariety of $A$ having everywhere potential good reduction.</description>

      <title>On the prevalence of the periodicity of maximizing measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.00536v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a continuous map $T: X\rightarrow X$ on a compact metric space $(X,d)$, we say that a function $f: X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ has the property $\mathscr{P}_T$ if its time averages along forward orbits of $T$ are maximized at a periodic orbit. In this paper, we prove that for the one-side full shift of two symbols, the property $\mathscr{P}_T$ is prevalent (in the sense of Hunt--Sauer--Yorke) in spaces of Lipschitz functions with respect to metrics with mildly fast decaying rate on the diameters of cylinder sets. This result is a strengthening of \cite[Theorem~A]{BZ16}, confirms the prediction mentioned in the ICM proceeding contribution of J. Bochi (\cite[Seciton 1]{Boc18}) suggested by experimental evidence, and is another step towards the Hunt--Ott conjectures in the area of ergodic optimization.</description>

      <title>Kronecker Product of Tensors and Hypergraphs: Structure and Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.03875v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hypergraphs and tensors extend classic graph and matrix theory to account for multiway relationships, which are ubiquitous in engineering, biological, and social systems. While the Kronecker product is a potent tool for analyzing the coupling of systems in graph or matrix contexts, its effectiveness in capturing multiway interactions remains elusive. In this article, we present a comprehensive exploration of algebraic, structural, and spectral properties of the tensor Kronecker product. We express Tucker and tensor train decompositions and various tensor eigenvalues in terms of the tensor Kronecker product. Additionally, we utilize the tensor Kronecker product to form Kronecker hypergraphs, a tensor-based hypergraph product, and investigate the structure and stability of polynomial dynamics on Kronecker hypergraphs. Finally, we provide numerical examples to demonstrate the utility of the tensor Kronecker product in computing Z-eigenvectors, various tensor decompositions, and determining the stability of polynomial systems.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we prove centralizer rigidity near an element of the Weyl chamber flow on a semisimple Lie group. We show that a volume preserving perturbation of an element of the Weyl chamber flow on a quotient $G/\Gamma$ of an $\mathbb{R}$-split, simple Lie group $G$ either has centralizer of dimension $0$ or $1$, or is smoothly conjugate to an element of the Weyl chamber flow. We also acquire a general condition for the centralizer of a partially hyperbolic diffeomorphism to be a Lie group.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.07575v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that if $\mu$ is the physical measure of a $C^2$ flow in $\mathbb{R}^d, d \geq 3,$ diffeomorphically conjugated to a suspension flow based on a Poincar\'{e} application $R$ with physical measure $\mu_{R}$, then $D_{q}(\mu)=D_{q}(\mu _{R})+1$, where $D_{q}$ denotes the generalized dimension of order $q \neq1$. We also show that a similar result holds for the local dimensions of $\mu$ and, under the additional hypothesis of exact-dimensionality of $\mu_{R}$, that our result extends to the case $q=1$. We apply these results to estimate the $D_{q}$ spectrum associated with R\"ossler systems and turn our attention to Lorenz-like flows, proving the existence of their information dimension and giving a lower bound for their generalized dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05514v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain an analog of the prime number theorem for a class of branched covering maps on the $2$-sphere $S^2$ called expanding Thurston maps, which are topological models of some non-uniformly expanding rational maps without any smoothness or holomorphicity assumptions. More precisely, we show that the number of primitive periodic orbits, ordered by a weight on each point induced by an (eventually) positive real-valued H\"{o}lder continuous function on $S^2$ that is not cohomologous to a constant, is asymptotically the same as the well-known logarithmic integral. In particular, our results apply to postcritically-finite rational maps for which the Julia set is the whole Riemann sphere.</description>

Abstract: There has been a significant effort in recent years to generalize the traditional concept of iterated function systems (IFS).In this article, we proposed Suzuki contraction in hyperspace and finding out the fixed point for Hutchinson mapping, which is called a deterministic fractal. The deterministic fractal for such a Suzuki contraction mapping is shown to exist and to be unique. We propose the Suzuki IFS (SIFS) in the literature for fractal creation based on this conclusion. Keywords: Fixed point, iterated function system, Suzuki contraction, Suzuki iterated function system, Attractor (Deterministic Fractal).</description>

Abstract: This paper explores the domain of meromorphic extension for the dynamical zeta function associated to a class of one-dimensional differentiable parabolic maps featuring an indifferent fixed point. We establish the connection between this domain and the spectrum of the weighted transfer operators of the induced map. Furthermore, we discuss scenarios where meromorphic extensions occur beyond the confines of the natural disc of convergence of the dynamical zeta function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.05329v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\theta\in\mathbb{R}^d$. We associate three objects to each approximation $(p,q)\in \mathbb{Z}^d\times \mathbb{N}$ of $\theta$: the projection of the lattice $\mathbb{Z}^{d+1}$ to the hyperplane of the first $d$ coordinates along the approximating vector $(p,q)$; the displacement vector $(p - q\theta)$; and the residue classes of the components of the $(d + 1)$-tuple $(p, q)$ modulo all primes. All of these have been studied in connection with Diophantine approximation problems. We consider the asymptotic distribution of all of these quantities, properly rescaled, as $(p, q)$ ranges over the best approximants and $\epsilon$-approximants of $\theta$, and describe limiting measures on the relevant spaces, which hold for Lebesgue a.e. $\theta$. We also consider a similar problem for vectors $\theta$ whose components, together with 1, span a totally real number field of degree $d+1$. Our technique involve recasting the problem as an equidistribution problem for a cross-section of a one-parameter flow on an adelic space, which is a fibration over the space of $(d + 1)$-dimensional lattices. Our results generalize results of many previous authors, to higher dimensions and to joint equidistribution.</description>

      <title>Expander graphs are globally synchronizing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.12788v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Kuramoto model is fundamental to the study of synchronization. It consists of a collection of oscillators with interactions given by a network, which we identify respectively with vertices and edges of a graph. In this paper, we show that a graph with sufficient expansion must be globally synchronizing, meaning that a homogeneous Kuramoto model of identical oscillators on such a graph will converge to the fully synchronized state with all the oscillators having the same phase, for every initial state up to a set of measure zero. In particular, we show that for any $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ and $p \geq (1 + \varepsilon) (\log n) / n$, the homogeneous Kuramoto model on the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph $G(n, p)$ is globally synchronizing with probability tending to one as $n$ goes to infinity. This improves on a previous result of Kassabov, Strogatz, and Townsend and solves a conjecture of Ling, Xu, and Bandeira. We also show that the model is globally synchronizing on any $d$-regular Ramanujan graph, and on typical $d$-regular graphs, for large enough degree $d$.</description>

      <title>Hypertrace and entropy gap characterizations of property (T) for $\mathrm{II}_1$ factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15110v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a hypertrace characterization of property (T) for $\mathrm{II}_1$ factors: Given a $\mathrm{II}_1$ factors $M$, $M$ does not have property (T) if and only if there exists a von Neumann algebra $\mathcal{A}$ with $M\subset \mathcal{A}$ such that $\mathcal{A}$ admits a $M$-hypertrace but no normal hypertrace. For $M$ without property (T), such an inclusion $M\subset \mathcal{A}$ also admits vanishing Furstenberg entropy. With the same construction of $M\subset \mathcal{A}$, we also establish similar characterizations of Haagerup property for $\mathrm{II}_1$ factors.</description>

      <title>Quasipolynomial bounds on the inverse theorem for the Gowers $U^{s+1}[N]$-norm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17994v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove quasipolynomial bounds on the inverse theorem for the Gowers $U^{s+1}[N]$-norm. The proof is modeled after work of Green, Tao, and Ziegler and uses as a crucial input recent work of the first author regarding the equidistribution of nilsequences. In a companion paper, this result will be used to improve the bounds on Szemer\'{e}di's theorem.</description>
