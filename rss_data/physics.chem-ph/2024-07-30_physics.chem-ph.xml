      <title>A Machine Learning and Explainable AI Framework Tailored for Unbalanced Experimental Catalyst Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The successful application of machine learning (ML) in catalyst design relies on high-quality and diverse data to ensure effective generalization to novel compositions, thereby aiding in catalyst discovery. However, due to complex interactions, catalyst design has long relied on trial-and-error, a costly and labor-intensive process leading to scarce data that is heavily biased towards undesired, low-yield catalysts. Despite the rise of ML in this field, most efforts have not focused on dealing with the challenges presented by such experimental data. To address these challenges, we introduce a robust machine learning and explainable AI (XAI) framework to accurately classify the catalytic yield of various compositions and identify the contributions of individual components. This framework combines a series of ML practices designed to handle the scarcity and imbalance of catalyst data. We apply the framework to classify the yield of various catalyst compositions in oxidative methane coupling, and use it to evaluate the performance of a range of ML models: tree-based models, logistic regression, support vector machines, and neural networks. These experiments demonstrate that the methods used in our framework lead to a significant improvement in the performance of all but one of the evaluated models. Additionally, the decision-making process of each ML model is analyzed by identifying the most important features for predicting catalyst performance using XAI methods. Our analysis found that XAI methods, providing class-aware explanations, such as Layer-wise Relevance Propagation, identified key components that contribute specifically to high-yield catalysts. These findings align with chemical intuition and existing literature, reinforcing their validity. We believe that such insights can assist chemists in the development and identification of novel catalysts with superior performance.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Coupled Cluster Theory with Approximate Triples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formalism of real-time (RT) methods has been well-established during recent years, while no inclusion beyond the double excitation has been discussed. In this article, we introduce an implementation of real-time coupled cluster singles, doubles and approximate triples (CC3) method to explore the potential of a high excitation level. The CC3 method is well-known for its advantages in calculating dynamic properties and combining with the response theory. It is a well-qualified candidate for handling the interaction between the system and the applied field, and therefore suitable for a RT implementation. The derivation and implementation are first demonstrated following applications on calculating frequency-dependent properties. Terms with triples are calculated and added upon the existing CCSD equations, giving the method a formally $N^{7}$ scaling. The Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) accelerated implementation is utilized to reduce the computational cost. It is been verified that the GPU implementation can speed up the calculation by up to a factor of 17 for water cluster test cases. Additionally, the single-precision arithmetic is used and compared to the conventional double-precision arithmetic. No significant difference is found in the polarizabilities and $G'$ tensor results, but a higher percentage error for the first hyperpolarizabilities is observed. Compared to the linear response (LR) CC3 results, the percentage errors of RT-CC3 polarizabilities and RT-CC3 first hyperpolarizabilities are under 0.1% and 1%, respectively for the $H_2O$/cc-pVDZ test case. Furthermore, a discussion on the calculation of polarizabilities is included, which compares RT-CC3 with RT-CCSD and time-dependent nonorthogonal orbital-optimized coupled cluster doubles (TDNOCCD), in order to examine the performance of RT-CC3 and the orbital-optimization effect using a group of ten-electron systems.</description>

      <title>Prospects for rank-reduced CCSD(T) in the context of high-accuracy thermochemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Obtaining sub-chemical accuracy (1 kJ mol${}^{-1}$) for reaction energies of medium-sized gas-phase molecules is a longstanding challenge in the field of thermochemical modeling. The perturbative triples correction to CCSD, CCSD(T), constitutes an important component of all high-accuracy composite model chemistries that obtain this accuracy, but can be a roadblock in the calculation of medium to large systems due to its $\mathcal{O}(N^7)$ scaling, particularly in HEAT-like model chemistries that eschew separation of core and valance correlation. This study extends the work of Lesiuk [J. Chem. Phys. 156, 064103 (2022)] with new approximate methods and assesses the accuracy of five different approximations of (T) in the context of a subset of molecules selected from the W4-17 dataset. It is demonstrated that all of these approximate methods can achieve sub-0.1 kJ mol${}^{-1}$ accuracy with respect to canonical, density-fitted (T) contributions with a modest number of projectors. The approximation labeled $\tilde{Z}T$ appears to offer the best trade-off between cost and accuracy and shows significant promise in an order-of-magnitude reduction in the computational cost of the CCSD(T) component of high-accuracy model chemistries.</description>

      <title>Can The Mystery of The Born-Oppenheimer Electronic Current Density Be Explained With A Simple Phase Space Electronic Hamiltonian? Yes (And A Lot More Too)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that a phase space electronic Hamiltonian $\hat{H}_{PS}(\mathbf{X},\mathbf{P})$, parameterized by both nuclear position $\mathbf{X}$ and momentum $\mathbf{P}$, can recover not just experimental vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) signals, but also a meaningful electronic current density that explains the features of the VCD rotatory strengths. Combined with earlier demonstrations that such Hamiltonians can also recover qualitatively correct electronic momenta with electronic densities that approximately satisfy a continuity equation, the data would suggest that we have isolated a meaningful alternative approach to electronic structure theory, one that entirely avoids Born-Oppenheimer theory and frozen nuclei. While the dynamical implications of such a phase space electronic Hamiltonian are not yet known, we hypothesize that, by offering classical trajectories the conserve the total angular momentum (unlike Born-Oppenheimer theory), this new phase space electronic structure Hamiltonian may well explain some fraction of the chiral-induced spin selectivity effect.</description>

      <title>A phase-space view of vibrational energies without the Born-Oppenheimer framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that following the standard mantra of quantum chemistry and diagonalizing the Born-Oppenheimer (BO) Hamiltonian $\hat H_{\rm BO}(\bm R)$ is not the optimal means to construct potential energy surfaces. A better approach is to diagonalize a phase-space electronic Hamiltonian, $\hat H_{\rm PS}(\bm R,\bm P)$, which is parameterized by both nuclear position $\bm R$ and nuclear momentum $\bm P$. The foundation of such a non-perturbative phase-space electronic Hamiltonian can be made rigorous using a partial Wigner transform and the method has exactly the same cost as BO for a semiclassical calculation (and only a slight increase in cost for a quantum nuclear calculation). For a three-particle system, with two heavy particles and one light particle, numerical results show that a phase space electronic Hamiltonian produces not only meaningful electronic momenta (which are completely ignored by BO theory) but also far better vibrational energies. As such, for high level results and/or systems with degeneracies and spin degrees of freedom, we anticipate that future electronic structure and quantum chemistry packages will need to take as input not just the positions of the nuclei but also their momenta.</description>

      <title>On The Effect Of Size On The Kinetics Of Reactions In Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reactions in solution require "contact" between the reagents. We can predict the rate at which reagents come into "contact" (at least in dilute conditions), but if the initial collision does not lead to reaction, what happens then? The collision rates in solution-phase reactions are generally described (explicitly or implicitly) with the Smoluchowski equation. Unfortunately, that model describes coagulations in gases, not reactions in solutions. The model is memory-less, i.e., collisions are treated as random processes, unaware of each other in space and time. The reality is that unreactive collisions create memory: particles (even molecules) "remember" they just collided, i.e, the probability of collision depends on how far back in time their prior collision happened. As we show here, this purely geometric and statistical fact is valid as long as their size is larger than the Kuhn length of their Brownian motion in solution. Under these conditions, particles in solution form, even in the absence of attractive interactions, relatively long-lived "clusters" kept together by the statistical unlikeliness of separating. We show here through Brownian dynamics simulations that, as a result of this memory, the collision rates and the lifetimes of these clusters, differently from what predicted by Smoluchowski's model, are proportional to the ratio between the radius of the colliders and the Kuhn length of their path in solution, with a coefficient close to unity!</description>

      <title>FMO-LC-TDDFTB method for excited states of large molecular assemblies in the strong light-matter coupling regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new methodology to calculate the strong light-matter coupling between photonic modes in microcavities and large molecular aggregates that consist of hundreds of molecular fragments. To this end, we combine our fragment molecular orbital long-range corrected time-dependent density functional tight-binding methodology with a generalized Tavis-Cummings Hamiltonian. We employ an excitonic Hamiltonian, which is built from a quasi-diabatic basis that is constructed from locally excited and charge-transfer states of all molecular fragments. In order to calculate polaritonic states, we extend our quasi-diabatic basis to include photonic states of a microcavity and derive and implement the couplings between the locally excited states and the cavity states and built a Tavis-Cummings Hamiltonian that incorporates the intermolecular excitonic couplings. Subsequently, we demonstrate the capability of our methodology by simulating the influence of the electric field polarization on the polaritonic spectra for a tetracene aggregate of 125 monomers. Furthermore, we investigate the dependence of the splitting of the upper and lower polaritonic branches on the system size by comparing the spectra of three different tetracene clusters. In addition, we investigate the polariton dispersion of a large tetracene aggregate for electric field polarizations in the x, y and z direction. Our new methodology can facilitate the future study of exciton dynamics in complex molecular systems, which consist of up to hundreds of molecules, that are influenced by strong light-matter coupling to microcavities.</description>

      <title>The "Simple" Photochemistry of Thiophene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The simple ultraviolet absorption spectrum of thiophene is investigated using a combination of a vibronic coupling model Hamiltonian with multi-configuration time-dependent Hartree quantum dynamics simulations. The model includes five states and all twenty-one vibrations, with potential surfaces calculated at the complete active space with second-order perturbation (CASPT2) level of theory. The model includes terms up to seventh-order to describe the diabatic potentials. The resulting spectrum is in excellent agreement to the experimentally measured spectrum of Holland et al [PCCP (2014) 16: 21629]. The, until now not understood, spectral features are assigned, with a combination of strongly coupled vibrations and vibronic coupling between the states giving rise to a progression of triplets on the rising edge of the broad spectrum. The analysis of the underlying dynamics indicates that population transfer between all states takes place on a sub-100 fs timescale, with ring-opening occurring at longer times. The model thus provides a starting point for further investigations into the complicated photo-excited dynamics of this key hetero-aromatic molecule.</description>

      <title>$\Delta$-Machine Learning to Elevate DFT-based Potentials and a Force Field to the CCSD(T) Level Illustrated for Ethanol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Progress in machine learning has facilitated the development of potentials that offer both the accuracy of first-principles techniques and vast increases in the speed of evaluation. Recently,"$\Delta$-machine learning" has been used to elevate the quality of a potential energy surface (PES) based on low-level, e.g., density functional theory (DFT) energies and gradients to close to the gold-standard coupled cluster level of accuracy. We have demonstrated the success of this approach for molecules, ranging in size from H$_3$O$^+$ to 15-atom acetyl-acetone and tropolone. These were all done using the B3LYP functional. Here we investigate the generality of this approach for the PBE, M06, M06-2X, and PBE0+MBD functionals, using ethanol as the example molecule. Linear regression with permutationally invariant polynomials is used to fit both low-level and correction PESs. These PESs are employed for standard RMSE analysis for training and test datasets, and then general fidelity tests such as energetics of stationary points, normal mode frequencies, and torsional potentials are examined. We achieve similar improvements in all cases. Interestingly, we obtained significant improvement over DFT gradients where coupled cluster gradients were not used to correct the low-level PES. Finally, we present some results for correcting a recent molecular mechanics force field for ethanol and comment on the possible generality of this approach.</description>

      <title>Exploring Quantum Active Learning for Materials Design and Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The meeting of artificial intelligence (AI) and quantum computing is already a reality; quantum machine learning (QML) promises the design of better regression models. In this work, we extend our previous studies of materials discovery using classical active learning (AL), which showed remarkable economy of data, to explore the use of quantum algorithms within the AL framework (QAL) as implemented in the MLChem4D and QMLMaterials codes. The proposed QAL uses quantum support vector regressor (QSVR) or a quantum Gaussian process regressor (QGPR) with various quantum kernels and different feature maps. Data sets include perovskite properties (piezoelectric coefficient, band gap, energy storage) and the structure optimization of a doped nanoparticle (3Al@Si11) chosen to compare with classical AL results. Our results revealed that the QAL method improved the searches in most cases, but not all, seemingly correlated with the roughness of the data. QAL has the potential of finding optimum solutions, within chemical space, in materials science and elsewhere in chemistry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the increasing attention to molecular machine learning, various innovations have been made in designing better models or proposing more comprehensive benchmarks. However, less is studied on the data preprocessing schedule for molecular graphs, where a different view of the molecular graph could potentially boost the model's performance. Inspired by the Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) algorithm, a subword tokenization method popularly adopted in Natural Language Processing, we propose GraphBPE, which tokenizes a molecular graph into different substructures and acts as a preprocessing schedule independent of the model architectures. Our experiments on 3 graph-level classification and 3 graph-level regression datasets show that data preprocessing could boost the performance of models for molecular graphs, and GraphBPE is effective for small classification datasets and it performs on par with other tokenization methods across different model architectures.</description>

      <title>Mesoscale properties of biomolecular condensates emerging from protein chain dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biomolecular condensates form by phase separation of biological polymers. The cellular functions of the resulting membraneless organelles are closely linked to their physical properties over a wide range of length- and timescales: From the nanosecond dynamics of individual molecules and their interactions, to the microsecond translational diffusion of molecules in the condensates, to their viscoelastic properties at the mesoscopic scale. However, it has remained unclear how to quantitatively link these properties across scales. Here we address this question by combining single-molecule fluorescence, correlation spectroscopy, microrheology, and large-scale molecular dynamics simulations on different condensates that are formed by complex coacervation and span about two orders of magnitude in viscosity and their dynamics at the molecular scale. Remarkably, we find that the absolute timescale of protein chain dynamics in the dense phases can be quantitatively and accurately related to translational diffusion and condensate viscosities by Rouse theory of polymer solutions including entanglement. The simulations indicate that the observed wide range of dynamics arises from different contact lifetimes between amino acid residues, which in the mean-field description of the polymer model cause differences in the friction acting on the chains. These results suggest that remarkably simple physical principles can relate the mesoscale properties of biomolecular condensates to their dynamics at the nanoscale.</description>

      <title>Optical Cycling and Sensitivity to the Electron's Electric Dipole Moment in Gold-Containing Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose diatomic molecules built from gold and carbon-group atoms as promising candidates for optical cycling and precision measurements. We show that this class of molecules (AuX, X = C, Si, Ge, Sn, Pb) features laser-accessible electronic transitions with nearly diagonal Franck-Condon factors. The $^2\Pi_{1/2}$ ground states can be easily polarized in the laboratory frame and have near-zero magnetic moments, valuable features for quantum science and precision measurement applications. The sensitivities of AuX molecules to the electron electric dipole moment (EDM) are found to be favorable, with effective electric fields of 10-30 GV/cm. Together, these features imply that AuX molecules may enable significantly improved searches for time-reversal symmetry violation.</description>

      <title>Multi-GPU RI-HF Energies and Analytic Gradients -- Towards High Throughput \textit{Ab Initio} Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article presents an optimized algorithm and implementation for calculating resolution-of-the-identity Hartree-Fock (RI-HF) energies and analytic gradients using multiple Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). The algorithm is especially designed for high throughput \emph{ab initio} molecular dynamics simulations of small and medium size molecules (10-100 atoms). Key innovations of this work include the exploitation of multi-GPU parallelism and a workload balancing scheme that efficiently distributes computational tasks among GPUs. Our implementation also employs techniques for symmetry utilization, integral screening and leveraging sparsity to optimize memory usage and computational efficiency. Computational results show that the implementation achieves significant performance improvements, including over $3\times$ speedups in single GPU AIMD throughput compared to previous GPU-accelerated RI-HF and traditional HF methods. Furthermore, utilizing multiple GPUs can provide super-linear speedup when the additional aggregate GPU memory allows for the storage of decompressed three-center integrals. Additionally, we report strong scaling efficiencies for systems up to 1000 basis functions and demonstrate practical applications through extensive performance benchmarks on up to quadruple-$\zeta$ primary basis sets, achieving floating-point performance of up to 47\% of the theoretical peak on a 4$\times$A100 GPU node.</description>

      <title>Julian Hirniak, an early proponent of periodic chemical reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we present and discuss the work and scientific legacy of Julian Hirniak, the Ukrainian chemist and physicist who published two articles in 1908 and 1911 about periodic chemical reactions. Over the last 110+ years, his theoretical work has often been cited favorably in connection with Alfred Lotka's theoretical model of an oscillating reaction system. Other authors have pointed out thermodynamic problems in Hirniak's reaction scheme. Based on English translations of his 1908 Ukrainian and 1911 German articles, we show that Hirniak's claim (that a cycle of inter-conversions of three chemical isomers in a closed reaction vessel can show damped periodic behavior) violates the \textit{Principle of Detailed Balance} (i.e., the Second Law of Thermodynamics), and that Hirniak was aware of this Principle. We also discuss his results in relation to Lotka's first model of damped oscillations in an open system of chemical reactions involving an auto-catalytic reaction operating far from equilibrium. Taking hints from both Hirniak and Lotka, we show that the mundane case of a kinase enzyme catalyzing the phosphorylation of a sugar can satisfy Hirniak's conditions for damped oscillations to its steady state flux (i.e., the Michaelis--Menten rate law), but that the oscillations are so highly damped as to be unobservable. Finally, we examine historical and factual misunderstandings related to Julian Hirniak and his publications.</description>

      <title>Stochastic migrations of Marangoni surfers between two lobes of a dumbbell-shaped confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report an experimental investigation on the stochastic migration dynamics of Marangoni surfers (camphor-infused paper disks) between the two lobes of a dumbbell-shaped chamber. We characterize the migration dynamics using survival analysis for a given configuration with a unique disk count in each lobe. Qualitatively, all the configurations exhibit stretched exponential decay with time, ascribed to a disk s aging. A given configuration s stability decreases with increasing pairwise interactions. The most stable configuration is always the one with equal partitioning of disks between the lobes, i.e., exactly one-half of disks in each lobe for even-numbered systems but with one extra disk in either of the lobes for odd-numbered systems. Furthermore, we model a camphor disk as a Chiral Active Particle (CAP), as initially proposed by Cruz et al. and show that decreasing motility (or aging) indeed causes the stretched exponential behavior.</description>

      <title>Two liquid states of distinguishable helium-4: the existence of another non-superfluid frozen by heating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07716v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that there can exist two liquid states in distinguishable helium-4 ($^4$He) obeying Boltzmann statistics by path integral centroid molecular dynamics (CMD) simulations. This is an indication of quantum liquid polyamorphism induced by nuclear quantum effect. For 0.08-3.3 K and 1-500 bar, we extensively conducted the isothermal-isobaric CMD simulations to explore not only possible states and state diagram but the state characteristics. The distinguishable $^4$He below 25 bar does not freeze down to 0.1 K even though it includes no Bosonic exchange effect and therefore no Bose condensation. One liquid state, low quantum-dispersion liquid (LQDL), is nearly identical to normal liquid He-I of real $^4$He. The other is high quantum-dispersion liquid (HQDL) consisting of atoms with longer quantum wavelength. This is another non-superfluid existing below 0.5 K or the temperatures of LQDL. The HQDL is also a low-entropy and fragile liquid to exhibit, unlike conventional liquids, rather gas-like relaxation of velocity autocorrelation function, while there the atoms diffuse without noticeable contribution from quantum tunneling. The LQDL-HQDL transition is not a thermodynamic phase transition but a continuous crossover accompanied by the change of the expansion factor of quantum wavelength. Freezing of HQDL into the low quantum-dispersion amorphous solid occurs by heating from 0.2 to 0.3 K at 40-50 bar, while this $P$-$T$ condition coincides with the Kim-Chan normal-supersolid phase boundary of real $^4$He. The obtained state diagram was compared with that of the confined subnano-scale $^4$He systems where Bosonic correlation is considerably suppressed.</description>

      <title>Scalable Ab Initio Electronic Structure Methods with Near Chemical Accuracy for Main Group Chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01400v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study evaluates the precision of widely recognized quantum chemical methodologies, CCSD(T), DLPNO-CCSD(T) and localized ph-AFQMC, for determining the thermochemistry of main group elements. DLPNO-CCSD(T) and localized ph-AFQMC, which offer greater scalability compared to canonical CCSD(T), have emerged over the last decade as pivotal in producing precise benchmark chemical data. Our investigation includes closed-shell, neutral molecules, focusing on their heat of formation and atomization energy sourced from four specific small molecule datasets. Firstly, we selected molecules from the G2 and G3 datasets, noted for their reliable experimental heat of formation data. Additionally, we incorporate molecules from the W4-11 and W4-17 sets, which provide high-level theoretical reference values for atomization energy at 0 K. Our findings reveal that both DLPNO-CCSD(T) and ph-AFQMC methods are capable of achieving a root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of less than 1 kcal/mol across the combined dataset, aligning with the threshold for chemical accuracy. Moreover, we make efforts to confine the maximum deviations within 2 kcal/mol, a degree of precision that significantly broadens the applicability of these methods in fields such as biology and materials science.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Influence of (n-1)d Subvalence Correlation and of Spin-Orbit Coupling on Chalcogen Bonding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05338v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article presents a comprehensive computational investigation into chalcogen bonding interactions, focusing specifically on elucidating the role of subvalence (n$-$1)d and (n$-$1)sp correlation. The incorporation of inner-shell (n$-$1)d correlation leads to a decrease in interaction energies for chalcogen-bonded systems (at least those studied herein), contradicting the observations regarding halogen bonding documented by Kesharwani et al. in \textit{J. Phys. Chem. A}, \textbf{2018}, 122 (8), 2184-2197. The significance of (n$-$1)sp subvalence correlation appears to be lower by an order of magnitude. Notably, among the various components of interaction energies computed at the PNO-LCCSD(T) or DF-CCSD levels, we identify the PNO-LMP2 or DF-MP2 component of the (n$-$1)d correlation as predominant. Furthermore, we delve into the impact of second-order spin-orbit coupling (SOC2) on these interactions. Specifically, for the Te complexes, SOC2 effects rival (n$-$1)d correlation in importance; for the Se complexes, SOC2 is much less important. Generally, SOC2 stabilizes monomers more than dimers, resulting in reduced binding of the latter. Notably, at equilibrium and stretched geometries, SOC2 and (n$-$1)d destabilize the complex; however, at compressed geometries, they exhibit opposing effects, with (n$-$1)d becoming stabilizing.</description>

      <title>Implementing Reactivity in Molecular Dynamics Simulations with Harmonic Force Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.14418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.14418v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The simulation of chemical reactions and mechanical properties including failure from atoms to the micrometer scale remains a longstanding challenge in chemistry and materials science. Bottlenecks include computational feasibility, reliability, and cost. We introduce a method for reactive molecular dynamics simulations using a clean replacement of non-reactive classical harmonic bond potentials with reactive, energy-conserving Morse potentials, called the Reactive INTERFACE Force Field (IFF-R). IFF-R is compatible with force fields for organic and inorganic compounds such as IFF, CHARMM, PCFF, OPLS-AA, and AMBER. Bond dissociation is enabled by three interpretable Morse parameters per bond type and zero energy upon disconnect. Use cases for bond breaking in molecules, failure of polymers, carbon nanostructures, proteins, composite materials, and metals are shown. The simulation of bond forming reactions was included via template-based methods. IFF-R maintains the accuracy of the corresponding non-reactive force fields and is about 30 times faster than prior reactive simulation methods.</description>

      <title>The interplay of shape and catalyst distribution in the yield of compressible flow microreactors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03944v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a semi-analytical model for transport in structured catalytic microreactors, where both reactant and product are compressible fluids. Making use of the lubrication and Fick-Jacobs approximations, we reduce the three-dimensional governing equations to an effective one-dimensional set of equations. Our model captures the effect of compressibility, of corrugations in the shape of the reactor, as well as of an inhomogeneous catalytic coating of the reactor walls. We show that in the weakly compressible limit (e.g., liquid-phase reactors), the distribution of catalyst does not influence the reactor yield, which we verify experimentally. Beyond this limit, we show that introducing inhomogeneities in the catalytic coating and corrugations to the reactor walls can improve the yield.</description>

      <title>Flow Perturbation to Accelerate Unbiased Sampling of Boltzmann distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10666v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Flow-based generative models have been employed for sampling the Boltzmann distribution, but their application to high-dimensional systems is hindered by the significant computational cost of obtaining the Jacobian of the flow. To overcome this challenge, we introduce the flow perturbation method, which incorporates optimized stochastic perturbations into the flow. By reweighting trajectories generated by the perturbed flow, our method achieves unbiased sampling of the Boltzmann distribution with orders of magnitude speedup compared to both brute force Jacobian calculations and the Hutchinson estimator. Notably, it accurately sampled the Chignolin protein with all atomic Cartesian coordinates explicitly represented, which, to our best knowledge, is the largest molecule ever Boltzmann sampled in such detail using generative models.</description>
