      <title>Time-Lagged Recurrence: a data-driven method to estimate the predictability of dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14865v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear dynamical systems are ubiquitous in nature and they are hard to forecast. Not only they may be sensitive to small perturbations in their initial conditions, but they are often composed of processes acting at multiple scales. Classical approaches based on the Lyapunov spectrum rely on the knowledge of the dynamic forward operator, or of a data-derived approximation of it. This operator is typically unknown, or the data are too noisy to derive its faithful representation. Here we propose a new data-driven approach to analyze the local predictability of dynamical systems. This method, based on the concept of recurrence, is closely linked to the well-established framework of local dynamical indices. When applied to both idealized systems and real-world datasets arising from large-scale atmospheric fields, our new approach proves its effectiveness in estimating local predictability. Additionally, we discuss its relationship with other local dynamical indices, and how it reveals the scale-dependent nature of predictability. Furthermore, we explore its link to information theory, its extension that includes a weighting strategy, and its real-time application. We believe these aspects collectively demonstrate its potential as a powerful diagnostic tool for complex systems.</description>

      <title>Diffractive Magic Cube Network with Super-high Capacity Enabled by Mechanical Reconfiguration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20693v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Free-space wavefront manipulation devices have emerged as powerful platforms for advanced optical information systems. In response to the challenges posed by the exponential growth of optical information, optical multiplexing and dynamic reconfigurable devices are being actively explored to the enhance system capacity. Among them, coarse-grained mechanically reconfigurable mechanism offers a cost-effective and low-complexity approach for capacity enhancement. However, the channel numbers achieved in current studies are insufficient for practical applications because of inadequate mechanical transformations and suboptimal optimization models. In this article, a diffractive magic cube network (DMCN) is proposed to advance the multiplexing capacity of mechanically reconfigurable system. We utilized the diffractive deep neural network (D2NN) model to jointly optimize the subset of channels generated by the combination of three mechanical operations, permutation, translation, and rotation. The 144-channel holograms, 108-channel single/double focus, 60-channel single/multi-mode OAM beam generation were experimentally demonstrated using diffractive optical elements (DOEs). An equivalent connectivity law was formulated to improve model scalability. Our strategy not only provides a novel paradigm to improve system capacity to super-high level with low crosstalk, but also paves the way for new advancements in optical storage, computing, communication, and photolithography.</description>
