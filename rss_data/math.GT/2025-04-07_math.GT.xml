      <title>Area Siegel--Veech constants for affine invariant submanifolds of REL zero</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the principal boundary of an arbitrary affine invariant submanifold of REL zero in terms of level graphs of the multi-scale compactification of strata of Abelian differentials with prescribed orders of zeros. We show that the area Siegel--Veech constant of the affine invariant submanifold can be obtained by using volumes of the principal boundary strata. As an application, we prove the conjectural formula in [CMS23a] that computes the area Siegel--Veech constant via intersection theory in the case of REL zero. In particular, the formula holds for strata of quadratic differentials with odd orders of zeros and for the gothic locus. We also explicitly describe the principal boundary components of the gothic locus and their individual contributions to the area Siegel--Veech constant</description>

      <title>A satellite formula for real Seiberg-Witten Floer homotopy types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a satellite formula for the real Seiberg-Witten Floer homotopy types of knots with odd patterns. Using this, we derive several applications to knot concordance theory. The satellite formula follows from a version of the excision theorem for real Floer homotopy types. Additionally, we show that the concordance invariants arising from real Seiberg-Witten theory depend only on the knot's zero-framed surgery.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we describe a class of subsets of the Euclidean plane which, with the induced length metric, are locally $CAT(0)$ spaces and we show that the gluing of two such subsets along a piece of their boundary is again a locally $CAT(0)$ space provided that the sum of the signed curvatures at every gluing point is non-positive. A generalization to subsets of smooth Riemannian surfaces of curvature $k\leq 0$ is given.</description>

      <title>Invariant sets for homeomorphisms of hyperbolic 3-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that under some assumptions on how points escape to infinity in the universal cover, homeomorphisms of hyperbolic 3-manifolds are forced to have several invariant sets (in particular, they cannot be minimal). For this, we use some shadowing techniques which, when the homeomorphism has positive speed with respect to a uniform foliation, allow us to obtain strong consequences on the structure of the invariant sets. We discuss also homological rotation sets and end the paper with some extensions to other manifolds as well as posing some general problems for the understanding of minimal homeomorphisms of 3-manifolds.</description>

      <title>Distance one surgeries on the lens space $L(n,1)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.06199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.06199v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that the lens space $L(s,1)$ for $s \neq 0 $ is obtained by a distance one surgery along a knot in the lens space $L(n,1)$ with $n \geq 5$ odd only if $n$ and $s$ satisfy one of the following cases: (1) $n \geq 5$ is any odd integer and $s=\pm 1, n, n \pm 1$ or $n \pm 4$; (2) $n=5$ and $s=-5$; (3) $n=5$ and $s=-9$; (4) $n=9$ and $s=-5$. As a corollary, we prove that the torus link $T(2,s)$ for $s \neq 0 $ is obtained by a band surgery from $T(2,n)$ with $n \geq 5$ odd only if $n$ and $s$ are as listed above. Combined with the result of Lidman, Moore and Vazquez, it immediately follows that the only nontrivial torus knot $T(2,n)$ admitting chirally cosmetic banding is $T(2,5)$. The key ingredient of our proof is the Heegaard Floer mapping cone formula.</description>

      <title>A comparison between $SL_n$ spider categories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.09289v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a conjecture of L\^{e} and Sikora by providing a comparison between various existing $SL_n$ skein theories. While doing so, we show that the full subcategory of the spider category, $\mathcal{S}p(SL_n)$, defined by Cautis-Kamnitzer-Morrison, whose objects are monoidally generated by the standard representation and its dual, is equivalent as a spherical braided category to Sikora's quotient category. This also answers a question from Morrison's Ph.D. thesis. Finally, we show that the skein modules associated to the CKM and Sikora's webs are isomorphic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.09110v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a framework to analyze knots and links in an unmarked solid torus. We discuss invariants that detect when such links are equivalent under an ambient homeomorphism, and show that the multivariable Alexander polynomial is such in invariant. We compute, for links with low wrapping number, bounds on the degree of a Dehn twist needed to transform one into the other that depend on the dichromatic Kauffman polynomial. Finally, we use this to give a classification of all non-split links up to 6 crossings in the unmarked solid torus.</description>

      <title>Taut foliations, braid positivity, and unknot detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00196v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study positive braid knots (the knots in the three-sphere realized as positive braid closures) through the lens of the L-space conjecture. This conjecture predicts that if $K$ is a non-trivial positive braid knot, then for all $r &lt; 2g(K)-1$, the 3-manifold obtained via $r$-framed Dehn surgery along $K$ admits a taut foliation. Our main result provides some positive evidence towards this conjecture: we construct taut foliations in such manifolds whenever $r&lt;g(K)+1$. As an application, we produce a novel braid positivity obstruction for cable knots by proving that the $(n,\pm 1)$-cable of a knot $K$ is braid positive if and only if $K$ is the unknot. We also present some curious examples demonstrating the limitations of our construction; these examples can also be viewed as providing some negative evidence towards the L-space conjecture. Finally, we apply our main result to produce taut foliations in some splicings of knot exteriors.</description>

      <title>Symmetry groups of hyperbolic links and their complements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17616v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explicitly construct a sequence of hyperbolic links $\{ L_{4n} \}$ where the number of symmetries of each $\mathbb{S}^{3} \setminus L_{4n}$ that are not induced by symmetries of the pair $(\mathbb{S}^{3}, L_{4n})$ grows linearly with n. Specifically, $[Sym(\mathbb{S}^{3} \setminus L_{4n}) : Sym(\mathbb{S}^{3}, L_{4n})] =8n \rightarrow \infty$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$. For this construction, we start with a family of minimally twisted chain links, $\{ C_{4n} \}$, where $Sym(\mathbb{S}^{3}, C_{4n})$ and $Sym(\mathbb{S}^{3} \setminus C_{4n})$ coincide and grow linearly with $n$. We then perform a particular type of homeomorphism on $\mathbb{S}^{3} \setminus C_{4n}$ to produce another link complement $\mathbb{S}^{3} \setminus L_{4n}$ where we can uniformly bound $|Sym(\mathbb{S}^{3}, L_{4n})|$ using a combinatorial condition based on linking number. A more general result highlighting how to control symmetry groups of hyperbolic links is provided, which has potential for further application.</description>

      <title>3-manifold spine cyclic presentations with seldom seen Whitehead graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17125v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a family of cyclic presentations and show that, subject to certain conditions on the defining parameters, they are spines of closed 3-manifolds. These are new examples where the reduced Whitehead graphs are of the same type as those of the Fractional Fibonacci presentations; here the corresponding manifolds are often (but not always) hyperbolic. We also express a lens space construction in terms of a class of positive cyclic presentations that are spines of closed 3-manifolds. These presentations then furnish examples where the Whitehead graphs are of the same type as those of the positive cyclic presentations of type $\mathfrak{Z}$, as considered by McDermott.</description>

      <title>Hard diagrams of split links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03372v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deformations of knots and links in ambient space can be studied combinatorially on their diagrams via local modifications called Reidemeister moves. While it is well-known that, in order to move between equivalent diagrams with Reidemeister moves, one sometimes needs to insert excess crossings, there are significant gaps between the best known lower and upper bounds on the required number of these added crossings. In this article, we study the problem of turning a diagram of a split link into a split diagram, and we show that there exist split links with diagrams requiring an arbitrarily large number of such additional crossings. More precisely, we provide a family of diagrams of split links, so that any sequence of Reidemeister moves transforming a diagram with $c$ crossings into a split diagram requires going through a diagram with $\Omega(\sqrt{c})$ extra crossings. Our proof relies on the framework of bubble tangles, as introduced by the first two authors, and a technique of Chambers and Liokumovitch to turn homotopies into isotopies in the context of Riemannian geometry.</description>

      <title>Dudeney's Dissection is Optimal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03865v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1907, Henry Ernest Dudeney posed a puzzle: ``cut any equilateral triangle \dots\ into as few pieces as possible that will fit together and form a perfect square'' (without overlap, via translation and rotation).
  Four weeks later, Dudeney demonstrated a beautiful four-piece solution, which today remains perhaps the most famous example of dissection.
  In this paper (over a century later), we finally solve Dudeney's puzzle, by proving that the equilateral triangle and square have no common dissection with three or fewer polygonal pieces.
  We reduce the problem to the analysis of discrete graph structures representing the correspondence between the edges and the vertices of the pieces forming each polygon.</description>
