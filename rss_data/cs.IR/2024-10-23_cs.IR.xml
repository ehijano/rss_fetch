      <title>Understanding the Effect of Algorithm Transparency of Model Explanations in Text-to-SQL Semantic Parsing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Explaining the decisions of AI has become vital for fostering appropriate user trust in these systems. This paper investigates explanations for a structured prediction task called ``text-to-SQL Semantic Parsing'', which translates a natural language question into a structured query language (SQL) program. In this task setting, we designed three levels of model explanation, each exposing a different amount of the model's decision-making details (called ``algorithm transparency''), and investigated how different model explanations could potentially yield different impacts on the user experience. Our study with $\sim$100 participants shows that (1) the low-/high-transparency explanations often lead to less/more user reliance on the model decisions, whereas the medium-transparency explanations strike a good balance. We also show that (2) only the medium-transparency participant group was able to engage further in the interaction and exhibit increasing performance over time, and that (3) they showed the least changes in trust before and after the study.</description>

      <title>STAR: A Simple Training-free Approach for Recommendations using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) offers promising new approaches for recommendation system (RecSys) tasks. While the current state-of-the-art methods rely on fine-tuning LLMs to achieve optimal results, this process is costly and introduces significant engineering complexities. Conversely, methods that bypass fine-tuning and use LLMs directly are less resource-intensive but often fail to fully capture both semantic and collaborative information, resulting in sub-optimal performance compared to their fine-tuned counterparts. In this paper, we propose a Simple Training-free Approach for Recommendation (STAR), a framework that utilizes LLMs and can be applied to various recommendation tasks without the need for fine-tuning. Our approach involves a retrieval stage that uses semantic embeddings from LLMs combined with collaborative user information to retrieve candidate items. We then apply an LLM for pairwise ranking to enhance next-item prediction. Experimental results on the Amazon Review dataset show competitive performance for next item prediction, even with our retrieval stage alone. Our full method achieves Hits@10 performance of +23.8% on Beauty, +37.5% on Toys and Games, and -1.8% on Sports and Outdoors relative to the best supervised models. This framework offers an effective alternative to traditional supervised models, highlighting the potential of LLMs in recommendation systems without extensive training or custom architectures.</description>

      <title>Coarse-to-fine Dynamic Uplift Modeling for Real-time Video Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rise of short video platforms, video recommendation technology faces more complex challenges. Currently, there are multiple non-personalized modules in the video recommendation pipeline that urgently need personalized modeling techniques for improvement. Inspired by the success of uplift modeling in online marketing, we attempt to implement uplift modeling in the video recommendation scenario. However, we face two main challenges: 1) Design and utilization of treatments, and 2) Capture of user real-time interest. To address them, we design adjusting the distribution of videos with varying durations as the treatment and propose Coarse-to-fine Dynamic Uplift Modeling (CDUM) for real-time video recommendation. CDUM consists of two modules, CPM and FIC. The former module fully utilizes the offline features of users to model their long-term preferences, while the latter module leverages online real-time contextual features and request-level candidates to model users' real-time interests. These two modules work together to dynamically identify and targeting specific user groups and applying treatments effectively. Further, we conduct comprehensive experiments on the offline public and industrial datasets and online A/B test, demonstrating the superiority and effectiveness of our proposed CDUM. Our proposed CDUM is eventually fully deployed on the Kuaishou platform, serving hundreds of millions of users every day. The source code will be provided after the paper is accepted.</description>

      <title>Bridging Search and Recommendation in Generative Retrieval: Does One Task Help the Other?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative retrieval for search and recommendation is a promising paradigm for retrieving items, offering an alternative to traditional methods that depend on external indexes and nearest-neighbor searches. Instead, generative models directly associate inputs with item IDs. Given the breakthroughs of Large Language Models (LLMs), these generative systems can play a crucial role in centralizing a variety of Information Retrieval (IR) tasks in a single model that performs tasks such as query understanding, retrieval, recommendation, explanation, re-ranking, and response generation. Despite the growing interest in such a unified generative approach for IR systems, the advantages of using a single, multi-task model over multiple specialized models are not well established in the literature. This paper investigates whether and when such a unified approach can outperform task-specific models in the IR tasks of search and recommendation, broadly co-existing in multiple industrial online platforms, such as Spotify, YouTube, and Netflix. Previous work shows that (1) the latent representations of items learned by generative recommenders are biased towards popularity, and (2) content-based and collaborative-filtering-based information can improve an item's representations. Motivated by this, our study is guided by two hypotheses: [H1] the joint training regularizes the estimation of each item's popularity, and [H2] the joint training regularizes the item's latent representations, where search captures content-based aspects of an item and recommendation captures collaborative-filtering aspects. Our extensive experiments with both simulated and real-world data support both [H1] and [H2] as key contributors to the effectiveness improvements observed in the unified search and recommendation generative models over the single-task approaches.</description>

      <title>Neural Collaborative Filtering Classification Model to Obtain Prediction Reliabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural collaborative filtering is the state of art field in the recommender systems area; it provides some models that obtain accurate predictions and recommendations. These models are regression-based, and they just return rating predictions. This paper proposes the use of a classification-based approach, returning both rating predictions and their reliabilities. The extra information (prediction reliabilities) can be used in a variety of relevant collaborative filtering areas such as detection of shilling attacks, recommendations explanation or navigational tools to show users and items dependences. Additionally, recommendation reliabilities can be gracefully provided to users: "probably you will like this film", "almost certainly you will like this song", etc. This paper provides the proposed neural architecture; it also tests that the quality of its recommendation results is as good as the state of art baselines. Remarkably, individual rating predictions are improved by using the proposed architecture compared to baselines. Experiments have been performed making use of four popular public datasets, showing generalizable quality results. Overall, the proposed architecture improves individual rating predictions quality, maintains recommendation results and opens the doors to a set of relevant collaborative filtering fields.</description>

      <title>Improving Pinterest Search Relevance Using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To improve relevance scoring on Pinterest Search, we integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) into our search relevance model, leveraging carefully designed text representations to predict the relevance of Pins effectively. Our approach uses search queries alongside content representations that include captions extracted from a generative visual language model. These are further enriched with link-based text data, historically high-quality engaged queries, user-curated boards, Pin titles and Pin descriptions, creating robust models for predicting search relevance. We use a semi-supervised learning approach to efficiently scale up the amount of training data, expanding beyond the expensive human labeled data available. By utilizing multilingual LLMs, our system extends training data to include unseen languages and domains, despite initial data and annotator expertise being confined to English. Furthermore, we distill from the LLM-based model into real-time servable model architectures and features. We provide comprehensive offline experimental validation for our proposed techniques and demonstrate the gains achieved through the final deployed system at scale.</description>

      <title>Optimizing LLMs with Direct Preferences: A Data Efficiency Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aligning the output of Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences (e.g., by means of reinforcement learning with human feedback, or RLHF) is essential for ensuring their effectiveness in real-world scenarios. Despite significant advancements in LLM alignment techniques, the impact of different type of preference data on model performance has yet to be systematically explored. In this study, we investigate the scalability, data efficiency, and effectiveness of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) in fine-tuning pre-trained LLMs, aiming to reduce their dependency on extensive amounts of preference data, which is expensive to collect. We (1) systematically compare the performance of models fine-tuned with varying percentages of a combined preference judgement dataset to define the improvement curve of DPO and assess its effectiveness in data-constrained environments; and (2) provide insights for the development of an optimal approach for selective preference data usage. Our study reveals that increasing the amount of data used for training generally enhances and stabilizes model performance. Moreover, the use of a combination of diverse datasets significantly improves model effectiveness. Furthermore, when models are trained separately using different types of prompts, models trained with conversational prompts outperformed those trained with question answering prompts.</description>

      <title>Distill-SynthKG: Distilling Knowledge Graph Synthesis Workflow for Improved Coverage and Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) generated by large language models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly valuable for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) applications that require knowledge-intensive reasoning. However, existing KG extraction methods predominantly rely on prompt-based approaches, which are inefficient for processing large-scale corpora. These approaches often suffer from information loss, particularly with long documents, due to the lack of specialized design for KG construction. Additionally, there is a gap in evaluation datasets and methodologies for ontology-free KG construction. To overcome these limitations, we propose SynthKG, a multi-step, document-level ontology-free KG synthesis workflow based on LLMs. By fine-tuning a smaller LLM on the synthesized document-KG pairs, we streamline the multi-step process into a single-step KG generation approach called Distill-SynthKG, substantially reducing the number of LLM inference calls. Furthermore, we re-purpose existing question-answering datasets to establish KG evaluation datasets and introduce new evaluation metrics. Using KGs produced by Distill-SynthKG, we also design a novel graph-based retrieval framework for RAG. Experimental results demonstrate that Distill-SynthKG not only surpasses all baseline models in KG quality -- including models up to eight times larger -- but also consistently excels in retrieval and question-answering tasks. Our proposed graph retrieval framework also outperforms all KG-retrieval methods across multiple benchmark datasets. We release the SynthKG dataset and Distill-SynthKG model publicly to support further research and development.</description>

      <title>Cutting Through the Confusion and Hype: Understanding the True Potential of Generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the nuanced landscape of generative AI (genAI), particularly focusing on neural network-based models like Large Language Models (LLMs). While genAI garners both optimistic enthusiasm and sceptical criticism, this work seeks to provide a balanced examination of its capabilities, limitations, and the profound impact it may have on societal functions and personal interactions. The first section demystifies language-based genAI through detailed discussions on how LLMs learn, their computational needs, distinguishing features from supporting technologies, and the inherent limitations in their accuracy and reliability. Real-world examples illustrate the practical applications and implications of these technologies. The latter part of the paper adopts a systems perspective, evaluating how the integration of LLMs with existing technologies can enhance productivity and address emerging concerns. It highlights the need for significant investment to understand the implications of recent advancements, advocating for a well-informed dialogue to ethically and responsibly integrate genAI into diverse sectors. The paper concludes with prospective developments and recommendations, emphasizing a forward-looking approach to harnessing genAI`s potential while mitigating its risks.</description>

      <title>Beyond Retrieval: Generating Narratives in Conversational Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent advances in Large Language Model's generation and reasoning capabilities present an opportunity to develop truly conversational recommendation systems. However, effectively integrating recommender system knowledge into LLMs for natural language generation which is tailored towards recommendation tasks remains a challenge. This paper addresses this challenge by making two key contributions.
  First, we introduce a new dataset (REGEN) for natural language generation tasks in conversational recommendations. REGEN (Reviews Enhanced with GEnerative Narratives) extends the Amazon Product Reviews dataset with rich user narratives, including personalized explanations of product preferences, product endorsements for recommended items, and summaries of user purchase history. REGEN is made publicly available to facilitate further research. Furthermore, we establish benchmarks using well-known generative metrics, and perform an automated evaluation of the new dataset using a rater LLM. Second, the paper introduces a fusion architecture (CF model with an LLM) which serves as a baseline for REGEN. And to the best of our knowledge, represents the first attempt to analyze the capabilities of LLMs in understanding recommender signals and generating rich narratives. We demonstrate that LLMs can effectively learn from simple fusion architectures utilizing interaction-based CF embeddings, and this can be further enhanced using the metadata and personalization data associated with items. Our experiments show that combining CF and content embeddings leads to improvements of 4-12% in key language metrics compared to using either type of embedding individually. We also provide an analysis to interpret how CF and content embeddings contribute to this new generative task.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Modality Gap: Dimension Information Alignment and Sparse Spatial Constraint for Image-Text Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many contrastive learning based models have achieved advanced performance in image-text matching tasks. The key of these models lies in analyzing the correlation between image-text pairs, which involves cross-modal interaction of embeddings in corresponding dimensions. However, the embeddings of different modalities are from different models or modules, and there is a significant modality gap. Directly interacting such embeddings lacks rationality and may capture inaccurate correlation. Therefore, we propose a novel method called DIAS to bridge the modality gap from two aspects: (1) We align the information representation of embeddings from different modalities in corresponding dimension to ensure the correlation calculation is based on interactions of similar information. (2) The spatial constraints of inter- and intra-modalities unmatched pairs are introduced to ensure the effectiveness of semantic alignment of the model. Besides, a sparse correlation algorithm is proposed to select strong correlated spatial relationships, enabling the model to learn more significant features and avoid being misled by weak correlation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of DIAS, achieving 4.3\%-10.2\% rSum improvements on Flickr30k and MSCOCO benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Answer Attribution for Faithful Text Generation with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing popularity of Large Language Models (LLMs) in recent years has changed the way users interact with and pose questions to AI-based conversational systems. An essential aspect for increasing the trustworthiness of generated LLM answers is the ability to trace the individual claims from responses back to relevant sources that support them, the process known as answer attribution. While recent work has started exploring the task of answer attribution in LLMs, some challenges still remain. In this work, we first perform a case study analyzing the effectiveness of existing answer attribution methods, with a focus on subtasks of answer segmentation and evidence retrieval. Based on the observed shortcomings, we propose new methods for producing more independent and contextualized claims for better retrieval and attribution. The new methods are evaluated and shown to improve the performance of answer attribution components. We end with a discussion and outline of future directions for the task.</description>

      <title>TELII: Temporal Event Level Inverted Indexing for Cohort Discovery on a Large Covid-19 EHR Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cohort discovery is a crucial step in clinical research on Electronic Health Record (EHR) data. Temporal queries, which are common in cohort discovery, can be time-consuming and prone to errors when processed on large EHR datasets. In this work, we introduce TELII, a temporal event level inverted indexing method designed for cohort discovery on large EHR datasets. TELII is engineered to pre-compute and store the relations along with the time difference between events, thereby providing fast and accurate temporal query capabilities. We implemented TELII for the OPTUM de-identified COVID-19 EHR dataset, which contains data from 8.87 million patients. We demonstrate four common temporal query tasks and their implementation using TELII with a MongoDB backend. Our results show that the temporal query speed for TELII is up to 2000 times faster than that of existing non-temporal inverted indexes. TELII achieves millisecond-level response times, enabling users to quickly explore event relations and find preliminary evidence for their research questions. Not only is TELII practical and straightforward to implement, but it also offers easy adaptability to other EHR datasets. These advantages underscore TELII's potential to serve as the query engine for EHR-based applications, ensuring fast, accurate, and user-friendly query responses.</description>

Abstract: Web agents have emerged as a promising direction to automate Web task completion based on user instructions, significantly enhancing user experience. Recently, Web agents have evolved from traditional agents to Large Language Models (LLMs)-based Web agents. Despite their success, existing LLM-based Web agents overlook the importance of personalized data (e.g., user profiles and historical Web behaviors) in assisting the understanding of users' personalized instructions and executing customized actions. To overcome the limitation, we first formulate the task of LLM-empowered personalized Web agents, which integrate personalized data and user instructions to personalize instruction comprehension and action execution. To address the absence of a comprehensive evaluation benchmark, we construct a Personalized Web Agent Benchmark (PersonalWAB), featuring user instructions, personalized user data, Web functions, and two evaluation paradigms across three personalized Web tasks. Moreover, we propose a Personalized User Memory-enhanced Alignment (PUMA) framework to adapt LLMs to the personalized Web agent task. PUMA utilizes a memory bank with a task-specific retrieval strategy to filter relevant historical Web behaviors. Based on the behaviors, PUMA then aligns LLMs for personalized action execution through fine-tuning and direct preference optimization. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of PUMA over existing Web agents on PersonalWAB.</description>

      <title>RecPrompt: A Self-tuning Prompting Framework for News Recommendation Using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10463v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: News recommendations heavily rely on Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods to analyze, understand, and categorize content, enabling personalized suggestions based on user interests and reading behaviors. Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 have shown promising performance in understanding natural language. However, the extent of their applicability to news recommendation systems remains to be validated. This paper introduces RecPrompt, the first self-tuning prompting framework for news recommendation, leveraging the capabilities of LLMs to perform complex news recommendation tasks. This framework incorporates a news recommender and a prompt optimizer that applies an iterative bootstrapping process to enhance recommendations through automatic prompt engineering. Extensive experimental results with 400 users show that RecPrompt can achieve an improvement of 3.36% in AUC, 10.49% in MRR, 9.64% in nDCG@5, and 6.20% in nDCG@10 compared to deep neural models. Additionally, we introduce TopicScore, a novel metric to assess explainability by evaluating LLM's ability to summarize topics of interest for users. The results show LLM's effectiveness in accurately identifying topics of interest and delivering comprehensive topic-based explanations.</description>

      <title>Generate and Instantiate What You Prefer: Text-Guided Diffusion for Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13428v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in generative recommendation systems, particularly in the realm of sequential recommendation tasks, have shown promise in enhancing generalization to new items. Among these approaches, diffusion-based generative recommendation has emerged as an effective tool, leveraging its ability to capture data distributions and generate high-quality samples. Despite effectiveness, two primary challenges have been identified: 1) the lack of consistent modeling of data distribution for oracle items; and 2) the difficulty in scaling to more informative control signals beyond historical interactions. These issues stem from the uninformative nature of ID embeddings, which necessitate random initialization and limit the incorporation of additional control signals. To address these limitations, we propose iDreamRec to involve more concrete prior knowledge to establish item embeddings, particularly through detailed item text descriptions and advanced Text Embedding Models (TEM). More importantly, by converting item descriptions into embeddings aligned with TEM, we enable the integration of intention instructions as control signals to guide the generation of oracle items. Experimental results on four datasets demonstrate that iDreamRec not only outperforms existing diffusion-based generative recommenders but also facilitates the incorporation of intention instructions for more precise and effective recommendation generation.</description>

      <title>Automatic Search of Multiword Place Names on Historical Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15586v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Historical maps are invaluable sources of information about the past, and scanned historical maps are increasingly accessible in online libraries. To retrieve maps from these large libraries that contain specific places of interest, previous work has applied computer vision techniques to recognize words on historical maps, enabling searches for maps that contain specific place names. However, searching for multiword place names is challenging due to complex layouts of text labels on historical maps. This paper proposes an efficient query method for searching a given multiword place name on historical maps. Using existing methods to recognize words on historical maps, we link single-word text labels into potential multiword phrases by constructing minimum spanning trees. These trees aim to link pairs of text labels that are spatially close and have similar height, angle, and capitalization. We then query these trees for the given multiword place name. We evaluate the proposed method in two experiments: 1) to evaluate the accuracy of the minimum spanning tree approach at linking multiword place names and 2) to evaluate the number and time range of maps retrieved by the query approach. The resulting maps reveal how places using multiword names have changed on a large number of maps from across history.</description>

      <title>A Text is Worth Several Tokens: Text Embedding from LLMs Secretly Aligns Well with The Key Tokens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17378v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text embeddings from large language models (LLMs) have achieved excellent results in tasks such as information retrieval, semantic textual similarity, etc. In this work, we show an interesting finding: when feeding a text into the embedding LLMs, the obtained text embedding will be able to be aligned with the key tokens in the input text. We first fully analyze this phenomenon on eight embedding LLMs and show that this phenomenon is universal and is not affected by model architecture, training strategy, and embedding method. With a deeper analysis, we then find that the main change in embedding space between the embedding LLMs and their original generative LLMs is in the first principal component. By adjusting the first principal component, we can align text embedding with the key tokens. Finally, we give several examples to demonstrate the vast application potential of this finding: (1) we propose a simple and practical sparse retrieval method based on the aligned tokens, which can achieve 80\% of the dense retrieval effect of the same model while reducing the computation significantly; (2) we show that our findings provide a fresh perspective to help understand fuzzy concepts (e.g., semantic relatedness vs. semantic similarity) and emerging technologies (e.g., instruction-following embedding) in this field.</description>

      <title>BRIGHT: A Realistic and Challenging Benchmark for Reasoning-Intensive Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12883v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing retrieval benchmarks primarily consist of information-seeking queries (e.g., aggregated questions from search engines) where keyword or semantic-based retrieval is usually sufficient. However, many complex real-world queries require in-depth reasoning to identify relevant documents that go beyond surface form matching. For example, finding documentation for a coding question requires understanding the logic and syntax of the functions involved. To better benchmark retrieval on such challenging queries, we introduce BRIGHT, the first text retrieval benchmark that requires intensive reasoning to retrieve relevant documents. Our dataset consists of 1,384 real-world queries spanning diverse domains, such as economics, psychology, mathematics, and coding. These queries are drawn from naturally occurring and carefully curated human data. Extensive evaluation reveals that even state-of-the-art retrieval models perform poorly on BRIGHT. The leading model on the MTEB leaderboard (Muennighoff et al., 2023), which achieves a score of 59.0 nDCG@10, produces a score of nDCG@10 of 18.3 on BRIGHT. We show that incorporating explicit reasoning about the query improves retrieval performance by up to 12.2 points. Moreover, incorporating retrieved documents from the top-performing retriever boosts question-answering performance by over 6.6 points. We believe that BRIGHT paves the way for future research on retrieval systems in more realistic and challenging settings.</description>

      <title>Research on Travel Route Planing Problems Based on Greedy Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13226v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The route planning problem based on the greedy algorithm represents a method of identifying the optimal or near-optimal route between a given start point and end point. In this paper, the PCA method is employed initially to downscale the city evaluation indexes, extract the key principal components, and then downscale the data using the KMO and TOPSIS algorithms, all of which are based on the MindSpore framework. Secondly, for the dataset that does not pass the KMO test, the entropy weight method and TOPSIS method will be employed for comprehensive evaluation. Finally, a route planning algorithm is proposed and optimised based on the greedy algorithm, which provides personalised route customisation according to the different needs of tourists. In addition, the local travelling efficiency, the time required to visit tourist attractions and the necessary daily breaks are considered in order to reduce the cost and avoid falling into the locally optimal solution.</description>
