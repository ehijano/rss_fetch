      <title>Lagrangian neural networks for nonholonomic mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lagrangian Neural Networks (LNNs) are a powerful tool for addressing physical systems, particularly those governed by conservation laws. LNNs can parametrize the Lagrangian of a system to predict trajectories with nearly conserved energy. These techniques have proven effective in unconstrained systems as well as those with holonomic constraints. In this work, we adapt LNN techniques to mechanical systems with nonholonomic constraints. We test our approach on some well-known examples with nonholonomic constraints, showing that incorporating these restrictions into the neural network's learning improves not only trajectory estimation accuracy but also ensures adherence to constraints and exhibits better energy behavior compared to the unconstrained counterpart.</description>

      <title>ViT-LCA: A Neuromorphic Approach for Vision Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent success of Vision Transformers has generated significant interest in attention mechanisms and transformer architectures. Although existing methods have proposed spiking self-attention mechanisms compatible with spiking neural networks, they often face challenges in effective deployment on current neuromorphic platforms. This paper introduces a novel model that combines vision transformers with the Locally Competitive Algorithm (LCA) to facilitate efficient neuromorphic deployment. Our experiments show that ViT-LCA achieves higher accuracy on ImageNet-1K dataset while consuming significantly less energy than other spiking vision transformer counterparts. Furthermore, ViT-LCA's neuromorphic-friendly design allows for more direct mapping onto current neuromorphic architectures.</description>

      <title>Cross-modal semantic segmentation for indoor environmental perception using single-chip millimeter-wave radar raw data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of firefighting and rescue operations, a cross-modal semantic segmentation model based on a single-chip millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar for indoor environmental perception is proposed and discussed. To efficiently obtain high-quality labels, an automatic label generation method utilizing LiDAR point clouds and occupancy grid maps is introduced. The proposed segmentation model is based on U-Net. A spatial attention module is incorporated, which enhanced the performance of the mode. The results demonstrate that cross-modal semantic segmentation provides a more intuitive and accurate representation of indoor environments. Unlike traditional methods, the model's segmentation performance is minimally affected by azimuth. Although performance declines with increasing distance, this can be mitigated by a well-designed model. Additionally, it was found that using raw ADC data as input is ineffective; compared to RA tensors, RD tensors are more suitable for the proposed model.</description>

      <title>Demystifying the use of Compression in Virtual Production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Virtual Production (VP) technologies have continued to improve the flexibility of on-set filming and enhance the live concert experience. The core technology of VP relies on high-resolution, high-brightness LED panels to playback/render video content. There are a number of technical challenges to effective deployment e.g. image tile synchronisation across the panels, cross panel colour balancing and compensating for colour fluctuations due to changes in camera angles. Given the complexity and potential quality degradation, the industry prefers "pristine" or lossless compressed source material for displays, which requires significant storage and bandwidth. Modern lossy compression standards like AV1 or H.265 could maintain the same quality at significantly lower bitrates and resource demands. There is yet no agreed methodology for assessing the impact of these standards on quality when the VP scene is recorded in-camera. We present a methodology to assess this impact by comparing lossless and lossy compressed footage displayed through VP screens and recorded in-camera. We assess the quality impact of HAP/NotchLC/Daniel2 and AV1/HEVC/H.264 compression bitrates from 2 Mb/s to 2000 Mb/s with various GOP sizes. Several perceptual quality metrics are then used to automatically evaluate in-camera picture quality, referencing the original uncompressed source content through the LED wall. Our results show that we can achieve the same quality with hybrid codecs as with intermediate encoders at orders of magnitude less bitrate and storage requirements.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In today's networked world, Digital Twin Networks (DTNs) are revolutionizing how we understand and optimize physical networks. These networks, also known as 'Digital Twin Networks (DTNs)' or 'Networks Digital Twins (NDTs),' encompass many physical networks, from cellular and wireless to optical and satellite. They leverage computational power and AI capabilities to provide virtual representations, leading to highly refined recommendations for real-world network challenges. Within DTNs, tasks include network performance enhancement, latency optimization, energy efficiency, and more. To achieve these goals, DTNs utilize AI tools such as Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), Reinforcement Learning (RL), Federated Learning (FL), and graph-based approaches. However, data quality, scalability, interpretability, and security challenges necessitate strategies prioritizing transparency, fairness, privacy, and accountability. This chapter delves into the world of AI-driven traffic analysis within DTNs. It explores DTNs' development efforts, tasks, AI models, and challenges while offering insights into how AI can enhance these dynamic networks. Through this journey, readers will gain a deeper understanding of the pivotal role AI plays in the ever-evolving landscape of networked systems.</description>

      <title>Community-Based Resilience: Digital Technologies for Living within Planetary Boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The world faces increasing challenges related to climate change and shifting geopolitical situations. The COVID 19 pandemic clearly illustrated the need for resilience not just within civil engineering but also within social and economic systems. While significant work has focused on applying digital technologies to solve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), less effort has been placed on the ability of digital technologies to enable humanity to continue to live effectively within the Planetary Boundaries. Within this paper, we perform a Systematic Literature Review using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta Analyses (PRISMA) methodology. Nine hundred and twenty papers were reviewed. Based on the Systematic Literature Review (SLR), we have outlined specific methods to apply digital technologies to enable humanity to live within PB. Critical capabilities provided by digital technologies, specifically the ability to create dynamic networks for enabling humanity to live within PB, are identified and illustrated in food and agriculture. The paper closes with a brief assessment of the concept's applicability to other Critical National Infrastructure.</description>

      <title>D-SELD: Dataset-Scalable Exemplar LCA-Decoder</title>

Abstract: Neuromorphic computing has recently gained significant attention as a promising approach for developing energy-efficient, massively parallel computing systems inspired by the spiking behavior of the human brain and natively mapping Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). Effective training algorithms for SNNs are imperative for increased adoption of neuromorphic platforms; however, SNN training continues to lag behind advances in other classes of ANN. In this paper, we reduce this gap by proposing an innovative encoder-decoder technique that leverages sparse coding and the Locally Competitive Algorithm (LCA) to provide an algorithm specifically designed for neuromorphic platforms. Using our proposed Dataset-Scalable Exemplar LCA-Decoder we reduce the computational demands and memory requirements associated with training SNNs using error backpropagation methods on increasingly larger training sets. We offer a solution that can be scalably applied to datasets of any size. Our results show the highest reported top-1 test accuracy using SNNs on the ImageNet and CIFAR100 datasets, surpassing previous benchmarks. Specifically, we achieved a record top-1 accuracy of 80.75% on ImageNet (ILSVRC2012 validation set) and 79.32% on CIFAR100 using SNNs.</description>

      <title>To Spike or Not to Spike, that is the Question</title>

Abstract: Neuromorphic computing has recently gained momentum with the emergence of various neuromorphic processors. As the field advances, there is an increasing focus on developing training methods that can effectively leverage the unique properties of spiking neural networks (SNNs). SNNs emulate the temporal dynamics of biological neurons, making them particularly well-suited for real-time, event-driven processing. To fully harness the potential of SNNs across different neuromorphic platforms, effective training methodologies are essential. In SNNs, learning rules are based on neurons' spiking behavior, that is, if and when spikes are generated due to a neuron's membrane potential exceeding that neuron's spiking threshold, and this spike timing encodes vital information. However, the threshold is generally treated as a hyperparameter, and incorrect selection can lead to neurons that do not spike for large portions of the training process, hindering the effective rate of learning. This work focuses on the significance of learning neuron thresholds alongside weights in SNNs. Our results suggest that promoting threshold from a hyperparameter to a trainable parameter effectively addresses the issue of dead neurons during training. This leads to a more robust training algorithm, resulting in improved convergence, increased test accuracy, and a substantial reduction in the number of training epochs required to achieve viable accuracy on spatiotemporal datasets such as NMNIST, DVS128, and Spiking Heidelberg Digits (SHD), with up to 30% training speed-up and up to 2% higher accuracy on these datasets.</description>
