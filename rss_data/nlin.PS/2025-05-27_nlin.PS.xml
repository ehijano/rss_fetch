      <title>Fractional Nonlinear Schrodinger Equation Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the space time fractional nonlinear Schrodinger equation (FNLSE) incorporating the modified Riemann Liouville derivative introduced by Jumari. The equation is characterized by two parameters: the fractional derivative parameter (alpha, which captures the memory effects) and the non linearity parameter a. We present analytical solutions via three complementary approaches: the fractional Riccati method, the Adomian decomposition method, and the scaling method. The FNLSE is formulated in terms of generalized Hamiltonian and momentum operators, allowing a unified framework to explore various solution structures. A continuity equation is derived, and a general class of solutions based on Mittag Leffler (ML) plane waves is proposed, from which generalized momentum and energy eigenvalues are systematically classified. Utilizing a generalized Wick rotation, we establish a connection between the FNLSE and a fractional Fokker Planck equation governing a dual stochastic process, revealing links to Q Gaussian statistics. Through separation of variables, we classify a family of solutions including chiral ML plane waves. Additionally, we construct Riccati type bright and dark solitons and assess their stability using a dynamical distance metric. As alpha changes, i.e. the memory effects are tuned, the bright solitons transform to dark solitons, which is equivalent to focusing defocusing transition. A series solution is developed via the Adomian decomposition technique, applied to both chiral and plane wave cases. Finally, we reduce the dimensionality of the FNLSE using the scaling arguments, leading to self similar solutions, and find pure phase as well as Adomian type solutions. Our results highlight the rich analytical landscape of the FNLSE and provide insights into its underlying physical and mathematical structure.</description>

      <title>Getting out of a tight spot: Cooperative unclogging of hydrogel particles in disordered porous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use event-driven pore network modeling to study the transport of hydrogel particles through disordered porous media -- a process that underlies diverse applications. By simulating particle advection, deformation, and clogging at the pore scale, we identify a dimensionless "squeezing parameter" that quantitatively predicts the depth to which particles penetrate into a given medium across diverse conditions. Our simulations also uncover a surprising cooperative effect: adding more particles enables them to penetrate deeper into the medium. This phenomenon arises because individual particles redirect fluid to adjacent throats, forcing nearby particles through tight pores that they would otherwise clog. Altogether, these results help to establish a quantitative framework that connects microscopic particle mechanics to macroscopic transport behavior.</description>

      <title>Resonances in Lifetimes of AdS Oscillon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Oscillons are classical oscillatory solutions with very long but finite lifetimes in real scalar field theories with appropriate potentials. An interesting feature is that resonances appear in the lifetimes of the oscillon for the initial size of the oscillon core $R_0$, which was discovered by Honda and Choptuik in the case of Minkowski space. In a previous work, oscillons in the global anti-de Sitter (AdS) space have been constructed, which we abbreviate as AdS oscillons. We present new resonance structures for the curvature radius $L$ and the core size $R_0$ in the lifetime of the AdS oscillon. We then compute exponents associated with the resonance peaks. Finally, we observe the bifurcation of the peaks due to the reflected waves.</description>

      <title>Pattern formation of bulk-surface reaction-diffusion systems in a ball</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06826v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Weakly nonlinear amplitude equations are derived for the onset of spatially extended patterns on a general class of n-component bulk-surface reaction-diffusion systems in a ball, under the assumption of linear kinetics in the bulk and coupling Robin-type boundary conditions. Linear analysis shows conditions under which various pattern modes can become unstable to either generalised pitchfork or transcritical bifurcations depending on the parity of the spatial wavenumber. Weakly nonlinear analysis is used to derive general expressions for the multi-component amplitude equations of different patterned states. These reduced-order systems are found to agree with prior normal forms for pattern formation bifurcations with O(3) symmetry and they provide information on the stability of bifurcating patterns of different symmetry types. The analysis is complemented with numerical results using a dedicated bulk-surface finite-element method. The theory is illustrated in two examples: a bulk-surface version of the Brusselator and a four-component bulk-surface cell-polarity model.</description>

      <title>On the Hamiltonian structure of the intrinsic evolution of a closed vortex sheet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13462v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the work of previous authors on vortex sheets and their applications, the intrinsic inviscid evolution equations of a closed vortex sheet in a plane, separating two piecewise constant density fluids, and their Hamiltonian form are investigated. The model has potential applications to problems involving the dynamics of interfaces of two immiscible fluids. A boundary Poisson bracket, which appears to be new and related to the KdV bracket, is obtained containing the curve-tangential derivative $\partial / \partial s$. Lagrangian invariants of the sheet motion by its self-induced velocity--the Cauchy principal value of the Biot-Savart integral--are also derived.</description>

      <title>Vortices and rotating solitons in ultralight dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02297v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of ultralight dark matter with non-negligible self-interactions are determined by a nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation rather than by the Vlasov equation of collisionless particles. This leads to wave-like effects, such as interferences, the formation of solitons, and a velocity field that is locally curl-free, implying that vorticity is carried by singularities associated with vortices. Using analytical derivations and numerical simulations in 2D, we study the evolution of such a system from stochastic initial conditions with nonzero angular momentum. Focusing on the Thomas-Fermi regime, where the de Broglie wavelength of the system is smaller than its size, we show that a rotating soliton forms in a few dynamical times. The rotation is not associated with a large orbital quantum number of the wave function. Instead, it is generated by a regular lattice of vortices that gives rise to a solid-body rotation in the continuum limit. Such rotating solitons have a maximal radius and rotation rate for a given central density, while the vortices follow the matter flow on circular orbits. We show that this configuration is a stable minimum of the energy at fixed angular momentum and we check that the numerical results agree with the analytical derivations. We expect most of these properties to extend to the 3D case where point vortices would be replaced by vortex rings.</description>

      <title>Neural Field Equations with random data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16343v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study neural field equations, which are prototypical models of large-scale cortical activity, subject to random data. We view this spatially-extended, nonlocal evolution equation as a Cauchy problem on abstract Banach spaces, with randomness in the synaptic kernel, firing rate function, external stimuli, and initial conditions. We determine conditions on the random data that guarantee existence, uniqueness, and measurability of the solution in an appropriate Banach space, and examine the regularity of the solution in relation to the regularity of the inputs. We present results for linear and nonlinear neural fields, and for the two most common functional setups in the numerical analysis of this problem. In addition to the continuous problem, we analyse in abstract form neural fields that have been spatially discretised, setting the foundations for analysing uncertainty quantification (UQ) schemes.</description>

      <title>Stochastic collocation schemes for Neural Field Equations with random data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16443v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop and analyse numerical schemes for uncertainty quantification in neural field equations subject to random parametric data in the synaptic kernel, firing rate, external stimulus, and initial conditions. The schemes combine a generic projection method for spatial discretisation to a stochastic collocation scheme for the random variables. We study the problem in operator form, and derive estimates for the total error of the schemes, in terms of the spatial projector. We give conditions on the projected random data which guarantee analyticity of the semi-discrete solution as a Banach-valued function. We illustrate how to verify hypotheses starting from analytic random data and a choice of spatial projection. We provide evidence that the predicted convergence rates are found in various numerical experiments for linear and nonlinear neural field problems.</description>
