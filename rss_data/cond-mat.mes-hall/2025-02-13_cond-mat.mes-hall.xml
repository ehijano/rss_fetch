      <title>Terahertz electroluminescence from Dirac-Landau polaritons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report intense terahertz electroluminescence from Dirac-Landau polaritons, representing a major step toward achieving stimulated cyclotron emission and polariton-based lasers. By strongly coupling the cyclotron transitions of two-dimensional Dirac fermions in HgTe quantum wells with optical cavity modes, we observe efficient emission near the lasing threshold. This work demonstrates that polariton condensation, a process that bypasses the need for electronic population inversion, can significantly reduce the emission threshold compared to conventional mechanisms requiring high electric fields. Moreover, this concept unlocks the potential for stimulated emission in previously unsuitable narrow-gap semiconductors, as well as Dirac materials with non-equidistant Landau levels. These results open a new way for the development of compact, tunable terahertz lasers based on Landau polaritons, offering new opportunities for solid-state laser technology and applications in the terahertz gap.</description>

      <title>Imaging van Hove Singularity Heterogeneity in Overdoped Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tuning the chemical potential of a solid to the vicinity of a van Hove singularity (vHS) is a well-established route to discovering emergent quantum phases. In monolayer graphene, the use of electron-donating metal layers has recently emerged as a method to dope the chemical potential to the nearest vHS, as evidenced by Angle-Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements. In this work, we study the spatial uniformity of the doping from this process using spectroscopic imaging scanning tunneling microscopy (SI-STM). Using molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), we achieve electron doping of graphene on SiC using Ytterbium (Yb-Graphene). We show using in-situ ARPES that the chemical potential is shifted to within 250 meV of the vHS. Using in-situ SI-STM, we establish that there exists significant inhomogeneity in the vHS position in overdoped graphene. We find two separate reasons for this. First, the spatial inhomogeneity of the intercalated Yb leads to local variations in the doping, with a length scale of inhomogeneity set by the screening length of ~ 3 nm. Second, we observe the presence of substitutional Yb dopants in the graphene basal plane. These Yb dopants cause a strong local shift of the doping, along with a renormalization of the quasiparticle amplitude. Theoretical calculations confirm that the Yb impurities effectively change the local potential, thus energetically shifting the position of the van Hove singularity. Our results point to the importance of considering the spatial structure of doping and its inextricable link to electronic structure.</description>

      <title>Superconducting Diode Effect in Selectively-Grown Topological Insulator based Josephson Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Josephson diode effect, where the critical current magnitude depends on its direction, arises when both time-reversal and inversion symmetries are broken - often achieved by a combination of spin-orbit interaction and applied magnetic fields. Taking advantage of the strong spin-orbit coupling inherent in three-dimensional topological insulators, we study this phenomenon in Nb/Bi$_{0.8}$Sb$_{1.2}$Te$_3$/Nb Josephson weak-link junctions. Under an in-plane magnetic field perpendicular to the current direction, we observe a pronounced Josephson diode effect with efficiencies up to 7%. A crucial component of this behavior is the non-sinusoidal current-phase relationship and an anomalous phase shift, which we attribute to the presence of a ballistic supercurrent component due to the surface states. These findings open up new avenues for harnessing and controlling the Josephson diode effect in topological material systems.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of the third-order nonlinear Hall effect in topological Dirac semimetal NiTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally investigate third-order nonlinear Hall effect for three-dimensional NiTe$_2$ single crystal samples. NiTe$_2$ is the recently discovered type-II Dirac semimetal, so both the inversion and the time-reversal symmetries are conserved in the bulk. As a result, the well known second-order nonlinear Hall effect does not expected for this material, which we confirm as negligibly small second-harmonic transverse Hall voltage response to the longitudinal ac electric current. As the main experimental result, we demonstrate the unsaturated third-harmonic Hall response in NiTe$_2$, which well corresponds to the theoretically predicted third-order nonlinear Hall effect in Dirac semimetals. We also demonstrate, that the third harmonic signal does not depend on the external magnetic field, in contrast to the field-depended first-order and second-order Hall effects.</description>

      <title>Chiral breakdown engineered by mesoscale Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction in biaxial magnetic nanotubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Curvilinear geometries in magnetic nanostructures provide a unique platform for exploring the interplay of symmetry, topology, and curvature in magnetization dynamics. In this work, we analytically study the static and dynamic properties of domain walls in biaxial magnetic nanotubes with intrinsic Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction of different symmetries. We show that geometry-driven local and nonlocal interactions govern domain profiles and dynamics, enabling precise control over the wall propagation and Walker breakdown field. Furthermore, the combination of bulk-type Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and curvature leads to chirality symmetry breaking and chiral breakdown in domain wall motion. These findings offer a framework for tailoring domain wall textures in cylindrical nanotubes, unlocking new functionalities for advanced applications in curvilinear magnonics and data storage technologies.</description>

      <title>Skyrmion motion in a synthetic antiferromagnet driven by asymmetric spin wave emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Skyrmions have been proposed as new information carriers in racetrack memory devices. To realise such devices, a small size; high speed of propagation; and minimal skyrmion Hall angle are required. Synthetic antiferromagnets (SAFs) present the ideal materials system to realise these aims. In this work, we use micromagnetic simulations to propose a new method for manipulating them using exclusively global magnetic fields. An out-of-plane microwave field induces oscillations in the skyrmions radius which in turn emits spin waves. When a static in-plane field is added, this breaks the symmetry of the skyrmions and causes asymmetric spin wave emission. This in turn drives motion of the skyrmions, with the fastest velocities observed at the frequency of the intrinsic out-of-phase breathing mode of the pair of skyrmions. This behaviour is investigated over a range of experimentally realistic antiferromagnetic interlayer exchange coupling strengths, and the results compared to previous works studying similar motion driven with an oscillating electric field. Through this the true effect of varying the exchange coupling strength is determined, and greater insight is gained into the mechanism of skyrmion motion. These results will help to inform the design of future novel computing architectures based on the dynamics of skyrmions in synthetic antiferromagnets.</description>

      <title>Highly efficient field-free switching by orbital Hall torque in a MoS2-based device operating at room temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Charge-to-spin and spin-to-charge conversion mechanisms in high spin-orbit materials are the new frontier of memory devices. They operate via spin-orbit torque (SOT) switching of a magnetic electrode, driven by an applied charge current. In this work, we propose a novel memory device based on the semiconducting two-dimensional centrosymmetric transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) MoS2, that operates as a SOT device in the writing process and a spin valve in the reading process. We demonstrate that stable voltage states at room temperature can be deterministically controlled by a switching current density as low as 3.2x10^4 A/cm^2 even in zero field. An applied field 50-100 Oe can be used as a further or alternative control parameter for the state switching. Ab initio calculations of spin Hall effect (SHE) and orbital Hall effect (OHE) indicate that the latter is the only one responsible for the generation of the SOT in the magnetic electrode. The large value of OHC in bulk MoS2 makes our device competitive in terms of energetic efficiency and could be integrated in TMD heterostructures to design memory devices with multiple magnetization states for non-Boolean computation.</description>

      <title>Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides under finite-pulse polarized radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in time-resolved angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy have enabled access to ultrafast electron states and their spin dynamics in solids. Atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenides are paradigmatic two-dimensional materials where electron momentum and spin degrees of freedom are coupled, being suitable candidates for time-resolved spectroscopy studies. In this work, we present a thorough study of the electron dynamics when these materials are subject to an intense finite-pulse driving radiation. We extend the scope of the conventional Floquet engineering and rely of the so-called $t-t^{\prime}$ formalism to deal with driving fields described with two distinct time scales, namely the envelope amplitude timescale and the time period of the external field. The interplay between the finite-pulse timescales and the intrinsic properties of the electrons gives rise to transient valley polarization and dynamical modifications of band structures, revealed by the time-dependent circular dichroism of the sample.</description>

      <title>Nanoscale Mapping of Magnetic Orientations with Complex X-ray Magnetic Linear Dichroism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compensated magnets are of increasing interest for both fundamental research and applications, with their net-zero magnetization leading to ultrafast dynamics and robust order. To understand and control this order, nanoscale mapping of local domain structures is necessary. One of the main routes to mapping antiferromagnetic order is X-ray magnetic linear dichroism (XMLD), which probes the local orientation of the N\'eel vector. However, XMLD imaging typically suffers from weak contrast and has mainly been limited to surface-sensitive techniques. Here, we harness coherent diffractive imaging to map the complex XMLD spectroscopically, and identify the phase linear dichroism as a high-contrast, high-resolution mechanism for imaging magnetic order. By applying X-ray spectroptychography to a model sample, we retrieve the full complex XMLD spectrum. Combining this with hierarchical clustering, we resolve the spatial distribution of probed domains by their distinct spectral signatures, providing a robust method for analyzing magnetic configurations with weak signals. Our results show that phase contrast is significantly stronger than the corresponding absorption contrast, offering higher spatial-resolution magnetic imaging. This approach establishes a reliable, element- and orbital-sensitive tool for studying compensated magnets.</description>

      <title>Correlations and Krylov spread for a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian: Ising chain with a complex-valued transverse magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Krylov complexity measures the spread of an evolved state in a natural basis, induced by the generator of the dynamics and the initial state. Here, we study the spread in Hilbert space of the state of an Ising chain subject to a complex-valued transverse magnetic field, initialized in a trivial product state with all spins pointing down. We demonstrate that Krylov spread reveals structural features of many-body systems that remain hidden in correlation functions that are traditionally employed to determine the phase diagram. When the imaginary part of the spectrum of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian is gapped, the system state asymptotically approaches the non-Hermitian Bogoliubov vacuum for this Hamiltonian. We find that the spread of this evolution unravels three different dynamical phases based on how the spread reaches its infinite-time value. Furthermore, we establish a connection between the Krylov spread and the static correlation function for the z-components of spins in the underlying non-Hermitian Bogoliubov vacuum, providing a full analytical characterization of correlations across the phase diagram. Specifically, for a gapped imaginary spectrum in a finite magnetic field, we find that the correlation function exhibits an oscillatory behavior that decays exponentially in space. Conversely, for a gapless imaginary spectrum, the correlation function displays an oscillatory behavior with an amplitude that decays algebraically in space; the underlying power law depends on the manifestation of two exceptional points within this phase.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Uncertainty Relations for Coherent Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a universal thermodynamic uncertainty relation for Fermionic coherent transport, which bounds the total rate of entropy production in terms of the mean and fluctuations of a single particle current. This bound holds for any multi-terminal geometry and arbitrary chemical and thermal biases, as long as no external magnetic fields are applied. It can further be saturated in two-terminal settings with boxcar-shaped transmission functions and reduces to its classical counterpart in linear response. Upon insertion of a numerical factor, our bound also extends to systems with broken time-reversal symmetry. As an application, we derive trade-off relations between the figures of merit of coherent thermoelectric heat engines and refrigerators, which show that such devices can attain ideal efficiency only at vanishing mean power or diverging power fluctuations. To illustrate our results, we work out a model of a coherent conductor consisting of a chain of quantum dots.</description>

      <title>Room-Temperature Deuterium Separation in van der Waals Gap Engineered Vermiculite Quantum Sieves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the demand for nuclear energy grows, enriching deuterium from hydrogen mixtures has become more important. However, traditional methods are either very energy-intensive because they require extremely cold temperatures, or they don't separate deuterium (D2) from regular hydrogen (H2) very well, with a D2/H2 selectivity of about 0.71. To achieve efficient deuterium separation at room temperature, we need materials with very tiny spaces, on an atomic scale. For the first time, we've successfully created a material with spaces just about 2.1 angstroms wide, which is similar in size to the wavelength of hydrogen isotopes at room temperature. This allows for efficient deuterium separation, with a much higher D2/H2 selectivity of about 2.20, meaning the material can separate deuterium from hydrogen much more effectively at room temperature. The smaller deuterium molecules are more likely to pass through these tiny spaces, showing that quantum effects play a key role in this process. In contrast, a material like graphene oxide, with larger spaces (around 4.0 angstroms) only shows a lower D2/H2 selectivity of approx 1.17, indicating weaker quantum effects. This discovery suggests that materials with very small, atomic-scale spaces could be key to the efficient separation of hydrogen isotopes at room temperature.</description>

      <title>Chiral Topological Phononic Quasiparticles in Enantiomeric Crystals SrSi$_2$ and BaSi$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chiral crystals have recently garnered significant interest in condensed matter physics due to their unique electronic and optical properties. In this paper, we explore the connection between the chirality of crystal structures and the chirality of topological quasiparticles. We specifically predict and analyze several chiral enantiomeric materials, such as SrSi$_2$ and BaSi$_2$, which crystallize in the chiral space groups $P4{_3}32$ and $P4{_1}32$. Based on first-principles calculations and theoretical analysis, we reveal that the phonon spectra of these materials host various topological phononic quasiparticles, including charge-2 triple points, charge-2 Dirac points, charge-2 Weyl points, and charge-1 Weyl points. Our paper shows that in these enantiomeric materials, the opposite chirality of the crystal structure results in topological quasiparticles with opposite chiral topological charges and distinct topological surface states. Our paper elucidates the intrinsic relationship between the chirality of crystal structures and the chirality of topological quasiparticles, providing promising theoretical guidance and material platform for investigating the physical properties of chiral crystals.</description>

      <title>Breakdown of Magic Numbers in Spherical Confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magic numbers in finite particle systems correspond to specific system sizes that allow configurations with low free energy, often exhibiting closed surface shells to maximize the number of nearest neighbors. Since their discovery in atomic nuclei, magic numbers have been essential for understanding the number-structure-property relationship in finite clusters across different scales. However, as system size increases, the significance of magic numbers diminishes, and the precise system size at which magic number phenomena disappear remains uncertain. In this study, we investigate colloidal clusters formed through confined self-assembly. Small magic number clusters display icosahedral symmetry with closed surface shells, corresponding to pronounced free energy minima. Our findings reveal that beyond a critical system size, closed surface shells disappear, and free energy minima become less pronounced. Instead, we observe a distinct type of colloidal cluster, termed football cluster, which retains icosahedral symmetry but features lower-coordinated facets disconnected by terraces. A sphere packing model demonstrates that forming closed surface shells becomes impossible beyond a critical system size, explaining the breakdown of magic numbers in large confined systems.</description>

Abstract: Tunable metasurfaces enable active and on-demand control over optical wavefronts through reconfigurable scattering of resonant nanostructures. Here, we present novel insights inspired by mechanical metamaterials to achieve giant tunability in mechano-optical metasurfaces where the mechanical metamaterial and optical metasurfaces are integrated in a single nanopatterned material. In a first design, judiciously engineered cuts in a flexible substrate enable large, strain-induced extension of the inter-particle spacing, tuning a high quality-factor resonance in a silicon nanoparticle array across a very broad spectral range. In a second design, we eliminate the substrate and demonstrate a nanopatterned silicon membrane that simultaneously functions as a mechanical metamaterial and an optical metasurface with large tunability. Our results highlight a promising route toward active metasurfaces, with potential applications in tunable filters, reconfigurable lenses, and dynamic wavefront shaping.</description>

      <title>Effects of correlated noise on the excitation of robust breathers in an ac-driven, lossy sine-Gordon system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermal noise and harmonic forcing have recently been shown to cooperatively excite sine-Gordon breathers robust to dissipation. Such a phenomenon has been found assuming a Gaussian noise source, delta-correlated both in time and space. In light of the potential implications of this generation technique, e.g., for the experimental observation of breathers in long Josephson junctions, it is physically motivated to investigate the effects of more realistic noise sources with finite correlation time and/or correlation length. Here, breathers are demonstrated to still emerge under this broader class of noise sources. The correlation time and the correlation length are found to offer control over the probability of observing breathers, as well on the typical timescale for their emergence. In particular, our results show that, as compared to the thermal case, the temporal and spatial correlations in the noise can lead to a larger breather-only occurrence frequency, i.e., the latter quantity behaves nonmonotonically versus both the correlation time and the correlation length. Overall, noise correlations represent a powerful tool for controlling the excitation of the elusive breather modes in view of experiments.</description>

      <title>Microscopic mechanism of electric field-induced superconductivity suppression in metallic thin films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supercurrent field-effect transistors made from thin metallic films are a promising option for next-generation high-performance computation platforms. Despite extensive research, there is still no complete quantitative microscopic explanation for how an external DC electric field suppresses superconductivity in thin films. This study aims to provide a quantitative description of superconductivity as a function of film thickness based on Eliashberg's theory. The calculation considers the electrostatics of the electric field, its realistic penetration depth in the film, and its effect on the Cooper pair, which is described as a standard s-wave bound state according to BCS theory. The estimation suggests that an external electric field of approximately $10^8$ V/m is required to suppress superconductivity in 10-30-nm-thick films, which aligns with experimental observations. Ultimately, the study offers "materials by design" guidelines for suppressing supercurrent when an external electric field is applied to the film surface. Furthermore, the proposed framework can be easily extended to investigate the same effects for ultrathin films.</description>

      <title>Non-Reciprocal Current-Phase Relation and Superconducting Diode Effect in Topological-Insulator-Based Josephson Junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Josephson junctions (JJ) are essential for superconducting quantum technologies and searches of self-conjugate quasiparticles, pivotal for fault-tolerant quantum computing. Measuring the current-phase relation (CPR) in JJ based on topological insulators (TI) can provide critical insights into unconventional phenomena in these systems, such as the presence of Majorana bound states (MBS) and the nature of non-reciprocal transport. However, reconstructing CPR as a function of magnetic field in such JJs has remained experimentally challenging. Here, we introduce a platform for precise CPR measurements in planar JJs composed of NbSe$_2$ and few layer thick Bi$_2$Se$_3$ (TI) as a function of magnetic field. When a single flux quantum $\Phi_\mathrm{0}$ threads the junction, we observe anomalous peak-dip-shaped CPR behaviour and non-reciprocal supercurrent flow. We demonstrate that these anomalies stem from the edge-amplified sloped supercurrent profile rather than MBS signatures often invoked to explain puzzles emerging near $\Phi_\mathrm{0}$ in TI-based JJ. Furthermore, we show that such a supercurrent profile gives rise to a previously overlooked, robust and tunable Josephson diode effect. These findings establish field-dependent CPR measurements as a critical tool for exploring topological superconducting devices and offer new design principles for non-reciprocal superconducting electronics.</description>

      <title>Broken symmetries associated with a Kagome chiral charge order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chirality or handedness manifests in all fields of science, ranging from cell biology, molecular interaction, and catalysis to different branches of physics. In condensed matter physics, chirality is intrinsic to enigmatic quantum phases, such as chiral charge density waves and chiral superconductivity. Here, the underlying chiral response is subtle and leads to broken symmetries in the ground state. Detection of subtle broken symmetries is the key to understand these quantum states but they are extremely challenging to expose leading to debate and controversy. Here, using second-order optical response, we uncover the broken symmetries of a chiral charge density wave in the Kagome lattice KV3Sb5, revealing the relevant broken symmetries of its charge order. KV3Sb5 undergoes a phase transition to a charge-ordered state at low temperatures. Our polarization-dependent mid-infrared photocurrent microscopy reveals an intrinsic, longitudinal helicity-dependent photocurrent associated with the charge order. Our measurements, supported by our theoretical analysis, provide direct evidence for broken inversion and mirror symmetries at the charge order transition, indicating a chiral charge ordered state. On the other hand, we do not observe a circular photogalvanic effect along the direction perpendicular to that of the incident light, imposing stringent constraints on the rotational and point group symmetries of the charge order. Our study not only visualizes the chiral nature of the Kagome charge order revealing its broken symmetries, but also highlights the nonlinear photogalvanic effect as a sensitive probe for detecting subtle symmetry breakings.</description>

Abstract: Moir\'e superlattices in twisted homo-bilayers have revealed exotic electronic states, including unconventional superconductivity and correlated insulating phases. However, their fabrication process often introduces moir\'e disorders, hindering reproducibility and experimental control. Here, we propose an alternative approach using gradient strain to construct moir\'e superlattices in untwisted bilayer graphene (gs-BLG). Through force-field and first-principles calculations, we show that gs-BLG exhibits kagome-like interlayer-spacing distributions and strain-tunable kagome electronic bands. The competition between interlayer coupling and in-plane strain relaxation leads to distinct structural deformations, giving rise to three forms of diatomic kagome lattices: subtle, pronounced, and distorted. Kagome electronic bands are identified near the Fermi level in their band structures. Modulating strain gradients enables tailoring bandwidths and signs of hopping parameters of these kagome bands, providing a versatile platform for studying exotic electronic phases. Our findings establish gradient strain as an alternative to twist engineering, opening an avenue for exploring emergent electronic phases in graphene-based systems.</description>

      <title>Spin-Valley Protected Kramers Pair in Bilayer Graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08143v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The intrinsic valley degree of freedom makes bilayer graphene (BLG) a unique platform for semiconductor qubits. The single-carrier quantum dot (QD) ground state exhibits a two-fold degeneracy, where the two states that constitute a Kramers pair, have opposite spin and valley quantum numbers. Because of the valley-dependent Berry curvature, an out-of-plane magnetic field breaks the time-reversal symmetry of this ground state and a qubit can be encoded in the spin-valley subspace. The Kramers states are protected against known spin- and valley-mixing mechanisms because mixing requires a simultaneous change of both quantum numbers. Here, we fabricate a tunable QD device in Bernal BLG and measure a spin-valley relaxation time for the Kramers states of ${38~\mathrm{s}}$, which is two orders of magnitude longer than the ${0.4~\mathrm{s}}$ measured for purely spin-blocked states. We also show that the intrinsic Kane-Mele spin-orbit splitting enables a Kramers doublet single-shot readout even at zero magnetic field with a fidelity above ${99\%}$. If these long-lived Kramers states also possess long coherence times and can be effectively manipulated, electrostatically defined QDs in BLG may serve as long-lived semiconductor qubits, extending beyond the spin qubit paradigm.</description>

      <title>Strong magneto-optical responses of an ensemble of defect-bound excitons in ambient exposed WS$_{2}$ and WSe$_{2}$ monolayers</title>

Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers present a singular coupling in their spin and valley degrees of freedom. Moreover, by applying an external magnetic field it is possible to break the energy degeneracy between their K and $-$K valleys. This valley Zeeman effect opens the possibility of controlling and distinguishing the spin and valley characters of charge carriers in TMDs by their optical transition energies, making these materials promising for the next generation of spintronic and photonic devices. However, the free excitons of pristine TMD monolayers present a moderate valley Zeeman splitting of $\approx 0.23$ meV/T. Therefore, alternative excitonic states with higher magnetic responses are mandatory for application purposes. Here, we investigate the magneto-optical properties of ambient exposed WS$_2$ and WSe$_2$ monolayers by circularly polarized magneto-photoluminescence experiments at cryogenic temperatures. A broad lower energy photoluminescence emission related to an ensemble of defects is observed, presenting remarkable valley-related splittings of $\approx 1.45$ meV/T and $\approx 1.11$ meV/T for WS$_2$ and WSe$_2$ monolayers, respectively. In addition, we report a significant valley polarization of charge carriers in the defect mid-gap states induced by the external magnetic field. We explain this valley-polarized population and enhanced valley-related splitting in terms of imbalanced intervalley relaxations, leading to a magnetic field-dependent distribution of charge carriers in multiple defect levels. This effect, together with the individual Zeeman shiftings of the mid-gap states, explains the strong magneto-optical responses observed. Our work uncovers the singular potential of manipulating the light emission of ambient exposed TMD monolayers by an external magnetic field.</description>

Abstract: The Kitaev chain can be engineered within a quantum dot-superconductor array, hosting Majorana zero modes at fine-tuned sweet spots. In this work, we propose and simulate the occurrence of Rabi and Ramsey oscillations to feasibly construct a minimal Majorana qubit in the quantum dot setup. Our real-time results incorporate realistic effects, e.g., charge noise and leakage, reflecting the latest experimental progress. We demonstrate that Majorana qubits with larger energy gaps exhibit significantly enhanced performance -- longer dephasing times, higher quality factors, reduced leakage probabilities, and improved visibilities -- compared to those with smaller gaps and with conventional quantum dot-based charge qubits. We introduce a method for reading out Majorana qubits via quantum capacitance measurements. Our work paves the way for future experiments on realizing Majorana qubits in quantum dot-superconductor arrays.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20320v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spin-based semiconductor qubits hold promise for scalable quantum computing, yet they require reliable autonomous calibration procedures. This study presents an experimental demonstration of online single-dot charge autotuning using a convolutional neural network integrated into a closed-loop calibration system. The autotuning algorithm explores the gates' voltage space to localize charge transition lines, thereby isolating the one-electron regime without human intervention. This exploration leverages the model's uncertainty estimation to find the appropriate gate configuration with minimal measurements while reducing the risk of failures. In 20 experimental runs, our method achieved a success rate of 95% in locating the target electron regime, highlighting the robustness of this approach against noise and distribution shifts from the offline training set. Each tuning run lasted an average of 2 hours and 9 minutes, primarily due to the limited speed of the current measurement. This work validates the feasibility of machine learning-driven real-time charge autotuning for quantum dot devices, advancing the development toward the control of large qubit arrays.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05700v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions, which exhibit Brownian motion in solid-state systems, are promising candidates as signal carriers for Brownian computing. However, successfully implementing such systems requires two critical components: a Hub to connect multiple wires and a C-join to synchronize the skyrmion signal carriers. While the former has been successfully addressed, the latter remains a significant challenge. In this study, we propose a novel solution by decomposing the C-join into two sub-circuits, the Join and Fork, and validate their functionality using a particle simulation approach. Our results demonstrate that the C-join can effectively synchronize skyrmion signals within 6.8{\mu}s with a 99.9% success rate at low temperatures. Additionally, we construct the Half-adder in a crossing-free architecture utilizing the C-join circuits. These findings pave the way for the realization of skyrmion-based Brownian computing systems.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Bloch States at Integer Flux Quanta Induced by Super-moir\'e Potential in Graphene Aligned with Twisted Boron Nitride</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07283v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-dimensional electron systems in both magnetic fields and periodic potentials are described by Hofstadter butterfly, a fundamental problem of solid-state physics. While moir\'e systems provide a powerful method to realize this spectrum, previous experiments, however, have been limited to fractional flux quanta regime due to the difficulty of building ~ 50 nm periodic modulations. Here, we demonstrate a super-moir\'e strategy to overcome this challenge. By aligning monolayer graphene (G) with 1.0{\deg} twisted hexagonal boron nitride (t-hBN), a 63.2 nm bichromatic G/t-hBN super-moir\'e is constructed, made possible by exploiting the electrostatic nature of t-hBN potential. Under magnetic field B, magnetic Bloch states at integer flux quanta (1-9) are achieved and observed as integer Brown-Zak oscillations, expanding the flux quanta from factions to integers. Theoretical analysis reproduces these experimental findings. This work opens new avenues to study unexplored Hofstadter butterfly, explore emergent topological order at integer flux quanta and engineer long-wavelength periodic modulations.</description>

      <title>Transient dynamical phase diagram of the spin-boson model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18561v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the real-time dynamics of the sub-Ohmic spin-boson model across a broad range of coupling strengths, using the numerically exact inchworm quantum Monte Carlo algorithm. From short- and intermediate-time dynamics starting from an initially decoupled state, we extract signatures of the zero-temperature quantum phase transition between localized and delocalized states. We show that the dynamical phase diagram thus obtained differs from the equilibrium phase diagram in both the values of critical couplings and the associated values of the critical exponent. We also identify and quantitatively analyze two competing mechanisms for the crossover between coherent oscillations and incoherent decay. Deep in the sub-Ohmic regime, the crossover is driven by the damping of the oscillation amplitude, while closer to the Ohmic regime the oscillation frequency itself drops sharply to zero at large coupling.</description>

      <title>Protecting Quantum Information via Many-Body Dynamical Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19228v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamically localized states in quantum many-body systems are fundamentally important in understanding quantum thermalization and have applications in quantum information processing. Here we explore many-body dynamical localization (MBDL) without disorders in a non-integrable quantum XY spin chain under periodical and quadratic kicks. We obtain the localization phase regimes with the MBDL and delocalized states and show dynamical observables to extract the phase regimes. For proper kick strengths in the MBDL phase, we reveal a local dynamical decoupling effect for persistent Rabi oscillation of certain spins. Furthermore, we propose the MBDL-protected quantum information at high temperatures, and present an analysis of the dynamical decoupling to obtain the required system parameters for quantum storage. Compared to other non-thermalized states, the disorder-free MBDL states require much fewer repetitions and resources, providing a promising way to protect and store quantum information robust against thermal noises.</description>

      <title>Genuine multipartite entanglement from many-electron systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11314v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that, contrary to common wisdom, genuine multipartite entanglement (GME) can be abundantly generated from simple non-correlated many-electron states. We show that the extracted GME can be maximized via spin-independent transformations derived from the quantum Fourier transform. We further demonstrate the possibility of maximizing the GME through localized orbitals in a variety of realistic systems and correlated states. Towards the exploitation of potentially useful entanglement, we rationalize system-specific and universal features of the extracted GME.</description>

      <title>Dynamical activity universally bounds precision of response in Markovian nonequilibrium systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20800v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The exploration of far-from-equilibrium systems has been at the forefront of nonequilibrium thermodynamics, with a particular focus on understanding the fluctuations and response of thermodynamic systems to external perturbations. In this study, we introduce a universal response kinetic uncertainty relation, which provides a fundamental trade-off between the precision of response for generic observables and dynamical activity in Markovian nonequilibrium systems. We demonstrate the practical applicability and tightness of the derived bound through illustrative examples. Our results are applicable to a broad spectrum of Markov jump processes, ranging from currents to non-current variables, from steady states to time-dependent driving, from continuous time to discrete time, and including Maxwell's demon or absolute irreversibility. Our findings not only enhance the theoretical foundation of stochastic thermodynamics but also may hold potential implications for far-from-equilibrium biochemical processes.</description>
