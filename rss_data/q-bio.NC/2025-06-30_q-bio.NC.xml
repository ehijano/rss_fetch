      <title>Finding Similar Objects and Active Inference for Surprise in Numenta Neocortex Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jeff Hawkins and his colleagues in Numenta have proposed the thousand-brains system. This is a model of the structure and operation of the neocortex and is under investigation as a new form of artificial intelligence. In their study, learning and inference algorithms running on the system are proposed, where the prediction is an important function. The author believes that one of the most important capabilities of the neocortex in addition to prediction is the ability to make association, that is, to find the relationships between objects. Similarity is an important example of such relationships. In our study, algorithms that run on the thousand-brains system to find similarities are proposed. Although the setting for these algorithms is restricted, the author believes that the case it covers is fundamental. Karl Friston and his colleagues have studied the free-energy principle that explains how the brain actively infers the cause of a Shannon surprise. In our study, an algorithm is proposed for the thousand-brains system to make this inference. The problem of inferring what is being observed from the sensory data is a type of inverse problem, and the inference algorithms of the thousand-brains system and free-energy principle solve this problem in a Bayesian manner. Our inference algorithms can also be interpreted as Bayesian or non-Bayesian updating processes.</description>

      <title>The Spatiotemporal Organization of Motor Cortex Activity Supporting Manual Dexterity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motor cortex (M1) is a crucial brain area for controlling voluntary movements, such as reaching and grasping for a cup of coffee. M1 is organized in a somatotopic manner, such that M1 output driving movement to different parts of the body is organized along the cortical surface. In primates, the arm and hand are represented in M1 as separate but overlapping territories. Unit activity recorded from the M1 forelimb representation comodulates with parameters related to reaching and/or grasping. The overall aim of this dissertation is to understand the spatiotemporal dynamics of M1 activity that produces reach-to-grasp movements. To address this goal, intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) is delivered along the precentral gyrus of two macaque monkeys to define the M1 motor map. Subsequently, cortical activity is recorded from the M1 forelimb representation using intrinsic signal optical imaging (ISOI) while macaques execute an instructed reach-to-grasp task. Results from imaging experiments produce spatial maps that define cortical territories with increased activity during reach-to-grasp movements. Next, unit activity was recorded from the M1 forelimb representation with a laminar multielectrode while macaques completed the same reach-to-grasp task. Recording site locations differed between sessions to comprehensively sample unit responses throughout the M1 forelimb representation. Imaging experiments reveal that activity supporting reach-to-grasp movements was concentrated in patches that comprise less than half of the M1 forelimb representation. Electrophysiology recordings reveal that activity related to reaching is spatially organized within M1 distinctly from activity related to grasping. The results support the idea that spatial organizing principles are inherent in M1 activity that supports reach-to-grasp movements.</description>

      <title>Recency effect disappears when information is integrated from independent perceptual sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decision-making often involves integrating discrete pieces of information from distinct sources over time, yet the cognitive mechanisms underlying this integration remain unclear. In this study, we examined how individuals accumulate and integrate discrete sensory evidence. Participants performed a task involving random dot motion stimuli presented in single- and double-pulse trials. These stimuli varied in motion coherence, source consistency of pulses (either the same or orthogonal directions), and temporal gaps between pulses. We found that participants effectively integrated information regardless of source type or temporal gaps. As expected, when both pulses originated from the same source, performance showed a sequence-dependent effect-accuracy was influenced by the order of pulse presentation. However, this effect disappeared when the pulses came from orthogonal sources. Confidence judgments were similarly unaffected by temporal gaps or pulse sequence but were higher when information originated from orthogonal sources. These findings highlight the specific role of perceptual independency on information integration and consequently, on decision-making.</description>

      <title>Fetal Sleep: A Cross-Species Review of Physiology, Measurement, and Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fetal sleep is a relatively underexplored yet vital aspect of prenatal neurodevelopment. Understanding fetal sleep patterns could provide insights into early brain maturation and help clinicians detect signs of neurological compromise that arise due to fetal hypoxia or fetal growth restriction. This review synthesizes over eight decades of research on the physiological characteristics, ontogeny, and regulation of fetal sleep. We compare sleep-state patterns in humans and large animal models, highlighting species-specific differences and the presence of sleep-state analogs. We review both invasive techniques in animals and non-invasive modalities in humans. Computational methods for sleep-state classification are also examined, including rule-based approaches (with and without clustering-based preprocessing) and state-of-the-art deep learning techniques. Finally, we discuss how intrauterine conditions such as hypoxia and fetal growth restriction can disrupt fetal sleep. This review provides a comprehensive foundation for the development of objective, multimodal, and non-invasive fetal sleep monitoring technologies to support early diagnosis and intervention in prenatal care.</description>

      <title>The Relationship between Cognition and Computation: "Global-first" Cognition versus Local-first Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17970v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: What fundamental research questions are essential for advancing toward brain-inspired AI or AGI capable of performing any intellectual task a human can? We believe the key question today is the relationship between cognition and computation (RCC). For example, the widely discussed question "Will artificial intelligence replace the human mind?" is, in essence and in scientific terms, an issue concerning RCC.
  We have chosen to classify RCC into four categories:
  1. The relationship between the primitives of cognition and the primitives of computation.
  2. The relationship between the anatomical structure of neural representation of cognition and the computational architecture of artificial intelligence.
  3. The relationship between emergents in cognition and emergents in computation.
  4. The relationship between the mathematical foundations of cognition and computation.
  The cumulative empirical evidence and theoretical analyses led us to formulate the "Global-first" principle, which highlights the contrast between "Global-first" cognition and local-first computation in RCC, offering a specific and well-defined starting point for understanding RCC.</description>

      <title>Wirelessly transmitted subthalamic nucleus signals predict endogenous pain levels in Parkinson's disease patients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21439v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Parkinson disease (PD) patients experience pain fluctuations that significantly reduce their quality of life. Despite the vast knowledge of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) role in PD, the STN biomarkers for pain fluctuations and the relationship between bilateral subthalamic nucleus (STN) activities and pain occurrence are still less understood. This observational study used data-driven methods by collecting annotated pain followed by a series of corresponding binary pain ratings and wirelessly transmitted STN signals, then leveraging the explainable machine learning algorithm to predict binary pain levels and sort the feature influence. The binary pain levels could be predicted among annotated pain reports corresponding to PD-related pain characteristics. The STN activity from both sides could impact pain prediction, with gamma and beta bands in the contralateral STN and delta and theta bands in the ipsilateral STN showing a prominent role. This study emphasizes the role of bilateral STN biomarkers on endogenous pain fluctuations.</description>
