      <title>Boundary Reconstruction for the Anisotropic Fractional Calder\'on Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we provide a boundary reconstruction result for the anisotropic fractional Calder\'on problem and its associated degenerate elliptic extension into the upper half plane. More precisely, considering the setting from \cite{FGKU21}, we show that the metric on the measurement set can be reconstructed from the source-to-solution data. To this end, we rely on the approach by Brown \cite{B01} in the framework developed in \cite{NT01} (see also \cite{KY02}) after localizing the problem by considering it through an extension perspective.</description>

      <title>An edge crack and a crack close to the vertex of a wedge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two model problems of an elastic wedge with an internal and edge crack are analyzed. The problem of an internal crack reduces to an order-4 vector Riemann-Hilbert problem whose matrix kernel entries are meromorphic functions and have exponential factors. When the internal crack is located along one of the wedge sides, an efficient method of solution is proposed. It requires a factorization of the order-2 matrix coefficient associated with the corresponding problem of an edge crack and the solution of an infinite system of linear algebraic system with an exponential rate of convergence of an approximate solution to the exact one. The order-2 Khrapkov's factorization is modified by splitting the matrix kernel into a scalar dominant function and a ``regular" matrix whose factorization is more convenient for numerical purposes. Expressions for the stress intensity coefficients and the potential energy released when the crack advances are derived. Asymptotic relations for the stress intensity coefficients and the potential energy when one of the crack tips is close the wedge vertex are obtained.</description>

      <title>Decoding the spatial spread of cyanobacterial blooms in an epilimnion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cyanobacterial blooms (CBs) pose significant global challenges due to their harmful toxins and socio-economic impacts, with nutrient availability playing a key role in their growth, as described by ecological stoichiometry (ES). However, real-world ecosystems exhibit spatial heterogeneity, limiting the applicability of simpler, spatially uniform models. To address this, we develop a spatially explicit partial differential equation model based on ES to study cyanobacteria in the epilimnion of freshwater systems. We establish the well-posedness of the model and perform a stability analysis, showing that it admits two linearly stable steady states, leading to either extinction or saturation. We use the finite elements method to numerically solve our system on a real lake domain derived from Geographic Information System (GIS) data and realistic wind conditions extrapolated from ERA5-Land. Our numerical results highlight the importance of lake shape and size in CB monitoring, while global sensitivity analysis using Sobol Indices identifies light attenuation and intensity as primary drivers of bloom variation, with water movement influencing early bloom stages and nutrient input becoming critical over time. This model supports continuous water-quality monitoring, informing agricultural, recreational, economic, and public health strategies for mitigating CBs.</description>

      <title>Local well-posedness for a system of modified KdV equations in modulation spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we consider the initial value problem (IVP) for a system of modified Korteweg-de Vries (mKdV) equations
  \begin{equation*}
  \begin{cases} \partial_t v + \partial_x^3 v+ \partial_x (v w^2) = 0, \hspace{0.98 cm} v(x,0)=\psi(x),\\ \partial_t w + \alpha \partial_x^3 w+\partial_x (v^2 w) = 0,\hspace{0.5 cm} w(x,0)=\phi(x). \end{cases} \end{equation*} The main interest is in addressing the well-posedness issues of the IVP when the initial data are considered in the modulation space $M_s^{2,p}(\mathbb{R})$, $p\geq 2$. In the case when $0&lt;\alpha\ne 1$, we derive new trilinear estimates in these spaces and prove that the IVP is locally well-posed for data in $M_s^{2,p}(\mathbb{R})$ whenever $s&gt; \frac14-\frac{1}{p}$ and $p\geq 2$.</description>

      <title>Global well-posedness and stability of three-dimensional isothermal Euler equations with damping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The global well-posedness and stability of solutions to the three-dimensional compressible Euler equations with damping is a longstanding open problem. This problem was addressed in \cite{WY, STW} in the isentropic regime (i.e. $\gamma&gt;1$) for small smooth solutions. In this paper, we prove the global well-posedness and stability of smooth solutions to the three-dimensional isothermal Euler equations ($\gamma=1$) with damping for some partially large initial values, i.e., $\|(\rho_0-\rho_*,u_0)\|_{L^2}$ could be large, but $\|D^3(\rho_0-\rho_*,u_0)\|_{L^2}$ is necessarily small. Moreover, the optimal algebraic decay rate is also obtained.
  The proof is based on the observation that the isothermal Euler equations with damping possess a good structure so that the equations can be reduced into a symmetrically hyperbolic system with partial damping, i.e., \eqref{au}. In the new system, all desired a priori estimates can be obtained under the assumption that $\int_0^T(\|\nabla \mathrm{ln}\rho\|_{L^{\infty}}+\|\nabla u\|_{L^{\infty}}) \mathrm{d}t $ is small. The assumption can be verified through the low-high frequency analysis via Fourier transformation under the condition that $\|D^3(\rho_0-\rho_*,u_0)\|_{L^2}$ is small, but $\|(\rho_0-\rho_*,u_0)\|_{L^2}$ could be large.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we first prove that the kernel of convolution operator, corresponding the composition of pseudo-differential operator and evolution system associated with the symbol depending on time, satisfies the H\"ormander's condition. Secondly, we prove that the convolution operator is a bounded linear operator from the Besov space on $\mathbb{R}^{d}$ into $L^{q}(\mathbb{R}^{d};V)$ for a Banach space $V$. Finally, by applying the Calder\'{o}n-Zygmund theorem for vector-valued functions, we prove the Littlewood-Paley type inequality for evolution systems associated with pseudo-differential operators.</description>

      <title>Dimension reduction for Willmore flows of tori: fixed conformal class and analysis of singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work studies Willmore flows of tori and their singularities via a dimension reduction approach. We introduce a Willmore flow that preserves the degenerate constraint of prescribed conformal class and, for rotationally symmetric initial data, we establish a strong relation with the length-preserving elastic flow in the hyperbolic plane. We provide a necessary condition for singularities and a criterion for the initial datum that allows to exclude them. Our results allow for initial data with arbitrarily large energy, in particular exceeding the usual Li-Yau threshold of $8\pi$. As an application, we obtain existence of a new class of conformally constrained Willmore tori. Moreover, we investigate singularities of the classical Willmore flow. For a class of tori, we identify a non-smooth object, the inverted catenoid, as the limit shape and we show that the flow can be restarted at this singular surface and converges to a round sphere.</description>

      <title>Small normalised solutions for a Schr\"odinger-Poisson system in expanding domains: multiplicity and asymptotic behaviour</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a smooth bounded domain $\Omega\subset \mathbb R^3$, we consider the following nonlinear Schr\"odinger-Poisson type system \begin{equation*}
  \left\{
  \begin{array}{ll}
  -\Delta u+ \phi u -\abs{u}^{p-2}u = \omega u &amp; \quad \text{in } \lambda\Omega,
  -\Delta\phi =u^{2}&amp; \quad \text{in }\lambda\Omega,
  u&gt;0 &amp;\quad \text{in }\lambda\Omega,
  u =\phi=0 &amp;\quad \text{on }\partial (\lambda\Omega),
  \int_{\lambda\Omega}u^{2} \,\text{d} x=\rho^2
  \end{array}
  \right. \end{equation*} in the expanding domain $\lambda\Omega\subset \mathbb R^{3}, \lambda&gt;1$ and $p\in (2,3)$, in the unknowns $(u,\phi,\omega)$.
  We show that, for arbitrary large values of the expanding parameter $\lambda$ and arbitrary small values of the mass $\rho&gt;0$, the number of solutions is at least the Ljusternick-Schnirelmann category of $\lambda\Omega$. Moreover we show that as $\lambda\to+\infty$ the solutions found converge to a ground state of the problem in the whole space $\mathbb R^{3}$.</description>

      <title>Using Sinkhorn in the JKO scheme adds linear diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The JKO scheme is a time-discrete scheme of implicit Euler type that allows to construct weak solutions of evolution PDEs which have a Wasserstein gradient structure. The purpose of this work is to study the effect of replacing the classical quadratic optimal transport problem by the Schr\"odinger problem (\emph{a.k.a.}\ the entropic regularization of optimal transport, efficiently computed by the Sinkhorn algorithm) at each step of this scheme. We find that if $\epsilon$ is the regularization parameter of the Schr\"odinger problem, and $\tau$ is the time step parameter, considering the limit $\tau,\epsilon \to 0$ with $\frac{\epsilon}{\tau} \to \alpha \in \mathbb{R}_+$ results in adding the term $\frac{\alpha}{2} \Delta \rho$ on the right-hand side of the limiting PDE. In the case $\alpha = 0$ we improve a previous result by Carlier, Duval, Peyr{\'e} and Schmitzer (2017).</description>

      <title>Space-Dependent Fractional Evolution Equations: A New Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the works of \cite{baz2} and \cite{kian}, this study develops an abstract framework for analyzing differential equations with space-dependent fractional time derivatives and bounded operators. Within this framework, we establish existence and uniqueness results for solutions in both linear and semilinear settings. Our findings provide deeper insights into how spatially varying fractional derivatives influence the behavior of differential equations, shedding light on their mathematical properties and potential applications.</description>

Abstract: We show that, by acting on a finite number of parameters of a compactly supported control force, we can increase the energy dissipation rate of any small solution of the Navier--Stokes equations in $\mathbb{R}^n$ . The magnitude of the control force is bounded by a negative Sobolev norm of the initial velocity. Its support can be chosen to be contained in an arbitrarily small region, in time or in space.</description>

      <title>Transonic Shocks for 2-D Steady Euler Flows with Large Gravity in an Almost Flat Nozzle for Polytropic Gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we are concerned with the existence of transonic shock solutions for two-dimensional (2-d) steady Euler flows of polytropic gases under vertical gravity in a horizontal nozzle. The acceleration g of the gravity is assumed to take a generic value. And a pressure condition is imposed at the exit of the nozzle to determine the position of the shock front, as proposed by R. Courant and K.O. Friedrichs in their monograp Supersonic Flow and Shock Waves. It is first shown that the existence of special transonic shock solutions with the flow states depending only on the variable in the gravity direction can be established if and only if the Mach number of the incoming flow satisfies certain conditions. However, the shock position of the special solutions admits shifting in the nozzle. Then we show that the shock position can be determined and the existence of transonic shock solution can be established as the boundary data are small perturbation of one of the special shock solutions and satisfy certain sufficient conditions. Mathematically, the perturbation problem can be formulated as a free boundary problem of a nonlinear mixed-type system, and the key difficulties in the analysis are mainly brought by the vertical gravity. Methods and techniques are developed in this paper to deal with these key difficulties. It finally turns out that the vertical gravity plays a dominant role in the mechanism determining the admissible shock position.</description>

      <title>Liouville type theorem and kinetic formulation for 2x2 systems of conservation laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We first study $\mathbf L^\infty$ vanishing viscosity solutions to $2\times 2$ systems of conservation laws obtained with the compensated compactness method. We show that, if a uniformly convex entropy exists, these solutions satisfy a pair of kinetic equations (nonlocal in velocity), which are then shown to characterize solutions with finite entropy production.
  Next, we prove a Liouville-type theorem for genuinely nonlinear systems, which is the main result of the paper. This implies in particular that for every finite entropy solution, every point $(t,x) \in \mathbb R^+\times \mathbb R\setminus J$ is of vanishing mean oscillation, where $J \subset \mathbb R^+\times \mathbb R$ is a set of Hausdorff dimension at most 1.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we are interested in the blowup of a geometric constant $\mathfrak{C}(\delta)$ appearing in the optimal quantitative unique continuation property for wave operators. In a particular geometric context we prove an upper bound for $\mathfrak{C}(\delta)$ as $\delta$ goes to $0$. Here $\delta&gt;0$ denotes the distance to the maximal unique continuation domain. As applications we obtain stability estimates for the unique continuation property up to the maximal domain. Using our abstract framework~\cite{FO25abstract} we also derive a stability estimate for a hyperbolic inverse problem. The proof is based on a global explicit Carleman estimate combined with the propagation techniques of Laurent-L\'eautaud.</description>

      <title>Global Existence and Nonlinear Stability of Finite-Energy Solutions of the Compressible Euler-Riesz Equations with Large Initial Data of Spherical Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The compressible Euler-Riesz equations are fundamental with wide applications in astrophysics, plasma physics, and mathematical biology. In this paper, we are concerned with the global existence and nonlinear stability of finite-energy solutions of the multidimensional Euler-Riesz equations with large initial data of spherical symmetry. We consider both attractive and repulsive interactions for a wide range of Riesz and logarithmic potentials for dimensions larger than or equal to two. This is achieved by the inviscid limit of the solutions of the corresponding Cauchy problem for the Navier-Stokes-Riesz equations. The strong convergence of the vanishing viscosity solutions is achieved through delicate uniform estimates in $L^p$. It is observed that, even if the attractive potential is super-Coulomb, no concentration is formed near the origin in the inviscid limit. Moreover, we prove that the nonlinear stability of global finite-energy solutions for the Euler-Riesz equations is unconditional under a spherically symmetric perturbation around the steady solutions. Unlike the Coulomb case where the potential can be represented locally, the singularity and regularity of the nonlocal radial Riesz potential near the origin require careful analysis, which is a crucial step. Finally, unlike the Coulomb case, a Gr\"onwall type estimate is required to overcome the difficulty of the appearance of boundary terms in the sub-Coulomb case and the singularity of the super-Coulomb potential. Furthermore, we prove the nonlinear stability of global finite-energy solutions for the compressible Euler-Riesz equations around steady states by employing concentration compactness arguments. Steady states properties are obtained by variational arguments connecting to recent advances in aggregation-diffusion equations.</description>

      <title>Connections between $\mathcal{S}$-operators and restriction estimates for spheres over finite fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new operator, $\mathcal{S}$, which is closely related to the restriction problem for spheres in $\mathbb{F}_q^d$, the $d$-dimensional vector space over the finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$ with $q$ elements. The $\mathcal{S}$ operator is considered as a specific operator that maps functions on $\mathbb{F}_q^d$ to functions on $\mathbb{F}_q^{d+1}$. We explore a relationship between the boundedness of the $\mathcal{S}$ operator and the restriction estimate for spheres in $\mathbb{F}_q^d$. Consequently, using this relationship, we prove that the $L^2$ restriction conjectures for spheres hold in all dimensions when the test functions are restricted to homogeneous functions of degree zero.</description>

      <title>Shape Derivatives of the Eigenvalues of the De Rham Complex for Lipschitz Deformations and Variable Coefficients: Part II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this second part of our series of papers, we develop an abstract framework suitable for de Rham complexes that depend on a parameter belonging to an arbitrary Banach space. Our primary focus is on spectral perturbation problems and the differentiability of eigenvalues with respect to perturbations of the involved parameters.
  As a byproduct, we provide a proof of the celebrated Hellmann-Feynman theorem for both simple and multiple eigenvalues of suitable families of self-adjoint operators in Hilbert spaces, even when these operators depend on possibly infinite-dimensional parameters. We then apply this abstract machinery to the de Rham complex in three dimensions, considering mixed boundary conditions and non-constant coefficients. In particular, we derive Hadamard-type formulas for Maxwell and Helmholtz eigenvalues.
  First, we compute the derivatives under minimal regularity assumptions - specifically, Lipschitz regularity - on both the domain and the perturbation, expressing the results in terms of volume integrals. Second, under more regularity assumptions on the domains, we reformulate these formulas in terms of surface integrals.</description>

      <title>Approximation theorems for stochastic integrals and stochastic differential equations concerning weak solutions with the spatial variable involved</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Watanabe's textbook, a classical approximation result indicates that if a solution exists to a stochastic differential equation, then by an approximation of the Wiener process, a sequence of deterministic equations with their corresponding solutions converges to the solution of the stochastic differential equation in probability. In the traditional approximation theorem of a stochastic differential equation, solutions of the sequence of approximating deterministic equations do not contain the spatial variable, but merely indexed by the time parameter. When consider the solution to each deterministic approximating equation a weak solution with the spatial variable involved, we may not be able to directly apply this classical approximation result. In this work, we extend the existing approximation result from Watanabe's textbook to the case when solutions to approximating deterministic equations are weak ones containing the spatial variable. We show that the sequence of these weak solutions converges to the solution of the stochastic differential equation in probability.</description>

      <title>Separation of time scales in weakly interacting diffusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study metastable behaviour in systems of weakly interacting Brownian particles with localised, attractive potentials which are smooth and globally bounded. In this particular setting, numerical evidence suggests that the particles converge on a short time scale to a "droplet state" which is $metastable$, i.e. persists on a much longer time scale than the time scale of convergence, before eventually diffusing to $0$.
  In this article, we provide rigorous evidence and a quantitative characterisation of this separation of time scales. Working at the level of the empirical measure, we show that (after quotienting out the motion of the centre of mass) the rate of convergence to the quasi-stationary distribution, which corresponds with the droplet state, is $O(1)$ as the inverse temperature $\beta \to \infty$. Meanwhile the rate of leakage away from its centre of mass is $O(e^{-\beta})$. Futhermore, the quasi-stationary distribution is localised on a length scale of order $O(\beta^{-\frac12})$. We thus provide a partial answer to a question posed by Carrillo, Craig, and Yao (Aggregation-Diffusion Equations: Dynamics, Asymptotics, and Singular Limits. In: Active Particles, Volume 2, 2019) in the microscopic setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the spectrum of the curl operator on a generic smoothly bounded domain in three-dimensional Euclidean space consists of simple eigenvalues. The main new ingredient in our proof is a formula for the variation of curl eigenvalues under a perturbation of the domain, reminiscent of Hadamard's formula for the variation of Laplace eigenvalues under Dirichlet boundary conditions. As another application of this variational formula, we simplify the derivation of a well-known necessary condition for a domain to minimize the first curl eigenvalue functional among domains of a given volume and derive similar necessary conditions for a domain extremizing higher eigenvalue functionals.</description>

Abstract: This article presents a convenient approach to Fourier analysis for the investigation of functions and distributions defined in $\mathbb{T}^m \times \mathbb{R}^n$. Our approach involves the utilization of a mixed Fourier transform, incorporating both partial Fourier series on the torus for the initial variables and partial Fourier transform in Euclidean space for the remaining variables. By examining the behaviour of the mixed Fourier coefficients, we achieve a comprehensive characterization of the spaces of fast decaying smooth functions and distributions in this context. Additionally, we apply our results to derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the Schwartz global hypoellipticity of a class of differential operators defined on $\mathbb{T} \times \mathbb{R}$, including all constant coefficient first order differential operators.</description>

Abstract: We are concerned with the global solution of the compressible Euler-Korteweg equations in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$. In the case of zero sound speed $P'(\rho^{\ast})=0$, it is found that the perturbation problem of irrotational fluids could be reformulated into a quasi-linear Schr$\ddot{o}$dinger equation. Based on techniques of dispersive estimates and methods of normal form, we construct a class of global scattering solutions for 3D case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10764v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hysteresis in the pressure-saturation relation in unsaturated porous media, which is due to surface tension on the liquid-gas interface, exhibits strong degeneracy in the resulting mass balance equation. Solutions to such degenerate equations have been recently constructed by the method of convexification even if the permeability coefficient depends on the hysteretic saturation. The model is extended here to the case that the solid matrix material is viscoelastic and that the system is coupled with a gravity driven moisture flux. The existence of a solution is proved by compact anisotropic embedding involving Orlicz spaces with respect to the time variable.</description>

      <title>Normalized solutions to a class of $(2, q)$-Laplacian equationsin the strongly sublinear regime</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the existence and multiplicity of normalized solutions for the following $(2, q)$-Laplacian equation \begin{equation}\label{Equation1}
  \left\{\begin{aligned}
  &amp;-\Delta u-\Delta_q u+\lambda u=g(u),\quad x \in \mathbb{R}^N,
  &amp;\int_{\mathbb{R}^N}u^2 d x=c^2,
  \end{aligned}\right. \tag{$\mathscr E_\lambda$} \end{equation} where $1&lt;q&lt;N$, $\Delta_q=\operatorname{div}\left(|\nabla u|^{q-2} \nabla u\right)$ is the $q$-Laplacian operator, $\lambda$ is a Lagrange multiplier and $c&gt;0$ is a constant. The nonlinearity $g:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is continuous and the behaviour of $g$ at the origin is allowed to be strongly sublinear, i.e., $\lim \limits _{s \rightarrow 0} g(s) / s=-\infty$, which includes the logarithmic nonlinearity
  $$
  g(s)= s \log s^2.
  $$ We consider a family of approximating problems that can be set in $H^1\left(\mathbb{R}^N\right)\cap D^{1, q}\left(\mathbb{R}^N\right)$ and the corresponding least-energy solutions. Then, we prove that such a family of solutions converges to a least-energy solution to the original problem. Additionally, under certain assumptions about $g$ that allow us to work in a suitable subspace of $H^1\left(\mathbb{R}^N\right)\cap D^{1, q}\left(\mathbb{R}^N\right)$, we prove the existence of infinitely many solutions of the above $(2, q)$-Laplacian equation.</description>

      <title>On a novel UCP result and its application to inverse conductive scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12360v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive a novel Unique Continuation Principle (UCP) for a system of second-order elliptic PDEs system and apply it to investigate inverse problems in conductive scattering. The UCP relaxes the typical assumptions imposed on the domain or boundary with certain interior transmission conditions. This is motivated by the study of the associated inverse scattering problem and enables us to establish several novel unique identifiability results for the determination of generalized conductive scatterers using a single far-field pattern, significantly extending the results in [12,18]. A key technical advancement in our work is the combination of Complex Geometric Optics (CGO) techniques from [12,18] with the Fourier expansion method to microlocally analyze corner singularities and their implications for inverse problems. We believe that the methods developed can have broader applications in other contexts.</description>

      <title>Mixed Local-Nonlocal Operators and Singularity: A Multiple-Solution Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19694v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the existence of multiple positive solutions for the following Dirichlet boundary value problem: \begin{equation*} \begin{aligned}
  -\Delta_p u + (-\Delta_p)^s u = \lambda \frac{f(u)}{u^{\beta}}\ \text{in} \ \Omega\newline
  u &gt;0\ \text{in} \ \Omega,\ u =0\ \text{in} \ \mathbb{R}^N \setminus \Omega \end{aligned} \end{equation*} where $\Omega$ is an arbitrary bounded domain in $\mathbb{R}^N$ with smooth boundary, $0\leq \beta&lt;1$ and $f$ is a non-decreasing $C^1$-function which is $p$-sublinear at infinity and satisfies $f(0)&gt;0$. By employing the method of sub- and supersolutions, we establish the existence of a positive solution for every $\lambda&gt;0$ and that of two positive solutions for a certain range of the parameter $\lambda$. In the non-singular case (i.e. when $\beta=0$) and in the linear case with singularity (i.e. when $p=2$ and $0&lt;\beta&lt;1$), we further apply Amann's fixed point theorem to show that the problem admits at least three positive solutions within this range of $\lambda$. The mixed local-nonlocal nature of the operator and the non-linearity pose challenges in constructing sub- and supersolutions, however, these are effectively addressed through the operator's homogeneity.</description>

Abstract: We show that M\"uller's $L\log L$ bound $$F(Du)\geq 0,\,Du\in L^p_{\mathrm{loc}}(\mathbb{R}^n)\implies F(Du)\in L\log L_{\mathrm{loc}}(\mathbb{R}^n)$$ for $F =\det$ and $p=n$ holds for quasiconcave $F$ which are homogeneous of degree $p&gt;1$. This contrasts similar Hardy space bounds which hold only for null Lagrangians.</description>

      <title>Multilevel Picard algorithm for general semilinear parabolic PDEs with gradient-dependent nonlinearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12545v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce a multilevel Picard approximation algorithm for general semilinear parabolic PDEs with gradient-dependent nonlinearities whose coefficient functions do not need to be constant. We also provide a full convergence and complexity analysis of our algorithm. To obtain our main results, we consider a particular stochastic fixed-point equation (SFPE) motivated by the Feynman-Kac representation and the Bismut-Elworthy-Li formula. We show that the PDE under consideration has a unique viscosity solution which coincides with the first component of the unique solution of the stochastic fixed-point equation. Moreover, the gradient of the unique viscosity solution of the PDE exists and coincides with the second component of the unique solution of the stochastic fixed-point equation. Furthermore, we also provide a numerical example in up to $300$ dimensions to demonstrate the practical applicability of our multilevel Picard algorithm.</description>

      <title>Improved $L^\infty$ bounds for eigenfunctions under random perturbations in negative curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13739v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been known since the work of Avakumov\'ic, H\"ormander and Levitan that, on any compact smooth Riemannian manifold, if $-\Delta_g \psi_\lambda = \lambda \psi_\lambda$, then $\|\psi_\lambda\|_{L^\infty} \leq C \lambda^{\frac{d-1}{4}} \|\psi_\lambda\|_{L^2}$. It is believed that, on manifolds of negative curvature, such a bound can be largely improved; however, only logarithmic improvements in $\lambda$ have been obtained so far. In the present paper, we obtain polynomial improvements over the previous bound in a generic setting, by adding a small random pseudodifferential perturbation to the Laplace-Beltrami operator.</description>

      <title>Pointwise convergence of solutions of the Schr\"odinger equation along general curves on Damek-Ricci spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14020v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the most celebrated problems in Euclidean Harmonic analysis is the Carleson's problem: determining the optimal regularity of the initial condition $f$ of the Schr\"odinger equation given by \begin{equation*} \begin{cases}
  i\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} =\Delta u\:,\: (x,t) \in \mathbb{R}^n \times \mathbb{R} \newline
  u(0,\cdot)=f\:, \text{ on } \mathbb{R}^n \:,
  \end{cases} \end{equation*} in terms of the index $\beta$ such that $f$ belongs to the inhomogeneous Sobolev space $H^\beta(\mathbb{R}^n)$, so that the solution of the Schr\"odinger operator $u$ converges pointwise to $f$, \begin{equation*} \displaystyle\lim_{t \to 0+} u(x,t)=f(x), \text{ almost everywhere}. \end{equation*} Recently, the author considered the Carleson's problem for the Schr\"odinger equation with radial initial data on Damek-Ricci spaces and obtained the sharp bound up to the endpoint $\beta \ge 1/4$.
  Interpreting the above as convergence along vertical lines, in this article, we consider the problem of pointwise convergence via more general approach paths. By constructing a counter-example on the $3$-dimensional Real Hyperbolic space, we show that the solutions of the Schr\"odinger equation, unlike Harmonic functions or solutions of the Heat equation, do not admit any natural wide approach region. We then study their pointwise convergence properties on Damek-Ricci spaces along general curves that satisfy certain H\"older conditions and bilipschitz conditions in the distance from the identity and again obtain the sharp bound up to the endpoint $\beta \ge 1/4$. Certain Euclidean analogues are also obtained.</description>

      <title>Space of ancient caloric functions on some manifolds beyond volume doubling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09711v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Under a condition that breaks the volume doubling barrier, we obtain a time polynomial structure result on the space of ancient caloric functions with polynomial growth on manifolds.
  As a byproduct, it is shown that the finiteness result for the space of harmonic functions with polynomial growth on manifolds in \cite{CM97} and \cite{Li97} are essentially sharp, except for the multi-end cases, addressing an issue raised in \cite{CM98} and removing all {\it local} topological or geometric conditions on the manifold with respect to a reference point.</description>
