      <title>Spatially Selected and Dependent Random Effects for Small Area Estimation with Application to Rent Burden</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Area-level models for small area estimation typically rely on areal random effects to shrink design-based direct estimates towards a model-based predictor. Incorporating the spatial dependence of the random effects into these models can further improve the estimates when there are not enough covariates to fully account for spatial dependence of the areal means. A number of recent works have investigated models that include random effects for only a subset of areas, in order to improve the precision of estimates. However, such models do not readily handle spatial dependence. In this paper, we introduce a model that accounts for spatial dependence in both the random effects as well as the latent process that selects the effects. We show how this model can significantly improve predictive accuracy via an empirical simulation study based on data from the American Community Survey, and illustrate its properties via an application to estimate county-level median rent burden.</description>

      <title>A Multivariate Copula-based Bayesian Framework for Doping Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Doping control is an essential component of anti-doping organizations for protecting clean sports competitions. Since 2009, this mission has been complemented worldwide by the Athlete Biological Passport (ABP), used to monitor athletes' individual profiles over time. The practical implementation of the ABP is based on a Bayesian framework, called ADAPTIVE, intended to identify individual reference ranges outside of which an observation may indicate doping abuse. Currently, this method follows a univariate approach, relying on simultaneous univariate analysis of different markers. This work extends the ADAPTIVE method to a multivariate testing framework, making use of copula models to couple the marginal distribution of biomarkers with their dependency structure. After introducing the proposed copula-based hierarchical model, we discuss our approach to inference, grounded in a Bayesian spirit, and present an extension to multidimensional predictive reference regions. Focusing on the hematological module of the ABP, we evaluate the proposed framework in both data-driven simulations and real data.</description>

      <title>Integer Programming for Learning Directed Acyclic Graphs from Non-identifiable Gaussian Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of learning directed acyclic graphs from continuous observational data, generated according to a linear Gaussian structural equation model. State-of-the-art structure learning methods for this setting have at least one of the following shortcomings: i) they cannot provide optimality guarantees and can suffer from learning sub-optimal models; ii) they rely on the stringent assumption that the noise is homoscedastic, and hence the underlying model is fully identifiable. We overcome these shortcomings and develop a computationally efficient mixed-integer programming framework for learning medium-sized problems that accounts for arbitrary heteroscedastic noise. We present an early stopping criterion under which we can terminate the branch-and-bound procedure to achieve an asymptotically optimal solution and establish the consistency of this approximate solution. In addition, we show via numerical experiments that our method outperforms three state-of-the-art algorithms and is robust to noise heteroscedasticity, whereas the performance of the competing methods deteriorates under strong violations of the identifiability assumption. The software implementation of our method is available as the Python package \emph{micodag}.</description>

      <title>Gaussian dependence structure pairwise goodness-of-fit testing based on conditional covariance and the 20/60/20 rule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel data-oriented statistical framework that assesses the presumed Gaussian dependence structure in a pairwise setting. This refers to both multivariate normality and normal copula goodness-of-fit testing. The proposed test clusters the data according to the 20/60/20 rule and confronts conditional covariance (or correlation) estimates on the obtained subsets. The corresponding test statistic has a natural practical interpretation, desirable statistical properties, and asymptotic pivotal distribution under the multivariate normality assumption. We illustrate the usefulness of the introduced framework using extensive power simulation studies and show that our approach outperforms popular benchmark alternatives. Also, we apply the proposed methodology to commodities market data.</description>

      <title>Why not a thin plate spline for spatial models? A comparative study using Bayesian inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatial modelling often uses Gaussian random fields to capture the stochastic nature of studied phenomena. However, this approach incurs significant computational burdens (O(n3)), primarily due to covariance matrix computations. In this study, we propose to use a low-rank approximation of a thin plate spline as a spatial random effect in Bayesian spatial models. We compare its statistical performance and computational efficiency with the approximated Gaussian random field (by the SPDE method). In this case, the dense matrix of the thin plate spline is approximated using a truncated spectral decomposition, resulting in computational complexity of O(kn2) operations, where k is the number of knots. Bayesian inference is conducted via the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm of the probabilistic software Stan, which allows us to evaluate performance and diagnostics for the proposed models. A simulation study reveals that both models accurately recover the parameters used to simulate data. However, models using a thin plate spline demonstrate superior execution time to achieve the convergence of chains compared to the models utilizing an approximated Gaussian random field. Furthermore, thin plate spline models exhibited better computational efficiency for simulated data coming from different spatial locations. In a real application, models using a thin plate spline as spatial random effect produced similar results in estimating a relative index of abundance for a benthic marine species when compared to models incorporating an approximated Gaussian random field. Although they were not the more computational efficient models, their simplicity in parametrization, execution time and predictive performance make them a valid alternative for spatial modelling under Bayesian inference.</description>

      <title>A Fourier Approach to the Parameter Estimation Problem for One-dimensional Gaussian Mixture Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, we propose a novel algorithm for estimating parameters in one-dimensional Gaussian mixture models (GMMs). The algorithm takes advantage of the Hankel structure inherent in the Fourier data obtained from independent and identically distributed (i.i.d) samples of the mixture. For GMMs with a unified variance, a singular value ratio functional using the Fourier data is introduced and used to resolve the variance and component number simultaneously. The consistency of the estimator is derived. Compared to classic algorithms such as the method of moments and the maximum likelihood method, the proposed algorithm does not require prior knowledge of the number of Gaussian components or good initial guesses. Numerical experiments demonstrate its superior performance in estimation accuracy and computational cost. Second, we reveal that there exists a fundamental limit to the problem of estimating the number of Gaussian components or model order in the mixture model if the number of i.i.d samples is finite. For the case of a single variance, we show that the model order can be successfully estimated only if the minimum separation distance between the component means exceeds a certain threshold value and can fail if below. We derive a lower bound for this threshold value, referred to as the computational resolution limit, in terms of the number of i.i.d samples, the variance, and the number of Gaussian components. Numerical experiments confirm this phase transition phenomenon in estimating the model order. Moreover, we demonstrate that our algorithm achieves better scores in likelihood, AIC, and BIC when compared to the EM algorithm.</description>

      <title>A Guide to Feature Importance Methods for Scientific Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While machine learning (ML) models are increasingly used due to their high predictive power, their use in understanding the data-generating process (DGP) is limited. Understanding the DGP requires insights into feature-target associations, which many ML models cannot directly provide, due to their opaque internal mechanisms. Feature importance (FI) methods provide useful insights into the DGP under certain conditions. Since the results of different FI methods have different interpretations, selecting the correct FI method for a concrete use case is crucial and still requires expert knowledge. This paper serves as a comprehensive guide to help understand the different interpretations of FI methods. Through an extensive review of FI methods and providing new proofs regarding their interpretation, we facilitate a thorough understanding of these methods and formulate concrete recommendations for scientific inference. We conclude by discussing options for FI uncertainty estimation and point to directions for future research aiming at full statistical inference from black-box ML models.</description>

      <title>Sparse Variable Selection on High Dimensional Heterogeneous Data with Tree Structured Responses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.08265</link>
      <description>arXiv:1711.08265v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of sparse variable selection on high dimension heterogeneous data sets, which has been taking on renewed interest recently due to the growth of biological and medical data sets with complex, non-i.i.d. structures and huge quantities of response variables. The heterogeneity is likely to confound the association between explanatory variables and responses, resulting in enormous false discoveries when Lasso or its variants are na\"ively applied. Therefore, developing effective confounder correction methods is a growing heat point among researchers. However, ordinarily employing recent confounder correction methods will result in undesirable performance due to the ignorance of the convoluted interdependency among response variables. To fully improve current variable selection methods, we introduce a model, the tree-guided sparse linear mixed model, that can utilize the dependency information from multiple responses to explore how specifically clusters are and select the active variables from heterogeneous data. Through extensive experiments on synthetic and real data sets, we show that our proposed model outperforms the existing methods and achieves the highest ROC area.</description>

      <title>A tutorial on spatiotemporal partially observed Markov process models via the R package spatPomp</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.01157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2101.01157v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe a computational framework for modeling and statistical inference on high-dimensional stochastic dynamic systems. Our primary motivation is the investigation of metapopulation dynamics arising from a collection of spatially distributed, interacting biological populations. To make progress on this goal, we embed it in a more general problem: inference for a collection of interacting partially observed nonlinear non-Gaussian stochastic processes. Each process in the collection is called a unit; in the case of spatiotemporal models, the units correspond to distinct spatial locations. The dynamic state for each unit may be discrete or continuous, scalar or vector valued. In metapopulation applications, the state can represent a structured population or the abundances of a collection of species at a single location. We consider models where the collection of states has a Markov property. A sequence of noisy measurements is made on each unit, resulting in a collection of time series. A model of this form is called a spatiotemporal partially observed Markov process (SpatPOMP). The R package spatPomp provides an environment for implementing SpatPOMP models, analyzing data using existing methods, and developing new inference approaches. Our presentation of spatPomp reviews various methodologies in a unifying notational framework. We demonstrate the package on a simple Gaussian system and on a nontrivial epidemiological model for measles transmission within and between cities. We show how to construct user-specified SpatPOMP models within spatPomp.</description>

      <title>CP Factor Model for Dynamic Tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.15517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.15517v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Observations in various applications are frequently represented as a time series of multidimensional arrays, called tensor time series, preserving the inherent multidimensional structure. In this paper, we present a factor model approach, in a form similar to tensor CP decomposition, to the analysis of high-dimensional dynamic tensor time series. As the loading vectors are uniquely defined but not necessarily orthogonal, it is significantly different from the existing tensor factor models based on Tucker-type tensor decomposition. The model structure allows for a set of uncorrelated one-dimensional latent dynamic factor processes, making it much more convenient to study the underlying dynamics of the time series. A new high order projection estimator is proposed for such a factor model, utilizing the special structure and the idea of the higher order orthogonal iteration procedures commonly used in Tucker-type tensor factor model and general tensor CP decomposition procedures. Theoretical investigation provides statistical error bounds for the proposed methods, which shows the significant advantage of utilizing the special model structure. Simulation study is conducted to further demonstrate the finite sample properties of the estimators. Real data application is used to illustrate the model and its interpretations.</description>

      <title>Direct Bayesian Regression for Distribution-valued Covariates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.06434v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we study the problem of scalar-on-distribution regression; that is, instances where subject-specific distributions or densities, or in practice, repeated measures from those distributions, are the covariates related to a scalar outcome via a regression model. We propose a direct regression for such distribution-valued covariates that circumvents estimating subject-specific densities and directly uses the observed repeated measures as covariates. The model is invariant to any transformation or ordering of the repeated measures. Endowing the regression function with a Gaussian Process prior, we obtain closed form or conjugate Bayesian inference. Our method subsumes the standard Bayesian non-parametric regression using Gaussian Processes as a special case. Theoretically, we show that the method can achieve an optimal estimation error bound. To our knowledge, this is the first theoretical study on Bayesian regression using distribution-valued covariates. Through simulation studies and analysis of activity count dataset, we demonstrate that our method performs better than approaches that require an intermediate density estimation step.</description>
