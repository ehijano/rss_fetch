      <title>Electron dynamics and SiO2 etching profile evolution in capacitive Ar/CHF3 discharges driven by sawtooth-tailored voltage waveforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electron dynamics and SiO2 etching profile evolution in capacitively coupled Ar/CHF3 plasmas driven by sawtooth-waveforms are investigated based on a one-dimensional fluid/Monte-Carlo (MC) model coupled with an etching profile evolution model. The effects of the sawtooth-waveforms synthesized from different numbers of consecutive harmonics, N, of a fundamental frequency of 13.56 MHz on the electron dynamics, ion and neutral transport, as well as the etching profile evolution are revealed in different mixtures of Ar/CHF3. By increasing N, a reduction in electronegativity, a decrease of the DC self-bias voltage, and a transition of the discharge mode from the Drift-Ambipolar (DA) to an {\alpha}-DA hybrid mode is observed accompanied by an enhanced plasma asymmetry. As the CHF3 gas admixture increases, the electronegativity initially increases and then decreases, following a similar trend as the absolute value of the DC self-bias voltage. This is mainly caused by the change in ionization, attachment and de-attachment reaction rates. The obtained results show that placing the substrate on the grounded electrode and using a higher number of harmonic frequencies (N) can achieve a faster etching rate, since higher ion fluxes can be obtained in these scenarios. Additionally, the Ar/CHF3 gas mixing ratio impacts the neutral surface coverage, which in turn affects the etching rate. Therefore, selecting an appropriate gas mixture is also essential for optimizing etching results.</description>

      <title>Ion Temperature Measurements in the MAST-U Divertor During Steady State Plasmas and ELM Burn Through Phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents ion temperature (\(T_i\)) measurements in the MAST-U divertor, using a Retarding Field Energy Analyzer (RFEA). Steady state measurements were made during an L-Mode plasma with the strike point on the RFEA. ELM measurements were made with the strike point swept over the RFEA. The scenarios are characterized by a plasma current (\(I_p\)) of 750 kA, line average electron density (\(n_e\)) between \(1.6 \times 10^{19}\) and \(4.5 \times 10^{19}\,\text{m}^{-3}\), and Neutral Beam Injection (NBI) power ranging from 1.1 MW to 1.6 MW. The ion temperatures, peaking at approximately 10 eV in steady state, were compared with electron temperatures (\(T_e\)) obtained from Langmuir probes (LP) at the same radial positions. Preliminary findings reveal a \(T_i/T_e\) ratio in the divertor region less than 1 for shot 48008. High temporal resolution measurements captured the dynamics of Edge Localized Modes (ELMs) Burn Through, providing \(T_i\) data as a radial distance from the probe peaking around 20 eV.</description>

      <title>Relaxation of weakly collisional plasma: continuous spectra, discrete eigenmodes, and the decay of echoes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07992v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The relaxation of a weakly collisional plasma, which is of fundamental interest to laboratory and astrophysical plasmas, can be described by the Boltzmann-Poisson equations with the Lenard-Bernstein collision operator. We perform a perturbative analysis of these equations, and obtain exact analytic solutions that resolve long-standing controversies regarding the impact of weak collisions on the continuous spectra, discrete Landau eigenmodes, and the decay of plasma echoes. We retain both damping and diffusion terms in the collision operator. We find that the linear response is a temporal convolution of a continuum that depends on the continuous velocities of particles (crucial for the plasma echo) and discrete modes that describe coherent oscillations of the entire system. The discrete modes are exponentially damped over time due to collective effects or wave-particle interactions (Landau damping) as well as collisional dissipation. The continuum is also damped by collisions, but somewhat differently. Up to a collision time, the inverse of the collision frequency $\nu_{\mathrm{c}}$, the continuum decay is driven by the diffusion of particle velocities and occurs cubic exponentially over a timescale $\sim \nu^{-1/3}_{\mathrm{c}}$. After a collision time, however, the continuum decay is driven by the damping of velocities and diffusion of positions, and occurs exponentially over a timescale $\sim \nu_{\mathrm{c}}$. This slow exponential decay damps perturbations the most on scales $\lambda$ comparable to the mean free path $\lambda_{\mathrm{c}}$, but very slowly on larger scales. This establishes local thermal equilibrium, the essence of the fluid limit, and enhances the detectability of the plasma echo. The long-term decay is driven by the discrete modes for $\lambda&lt;\lambda_{\mathrm{c}}$, but, by the slowly decaying continuum and the least damped mode for $\lambda&gt;\lambda_{\mathrm{c}}$.</description>

      <title>Larmor radius effect on the control of chaotic transport in tokamaks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15963v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of the finite Larmor radius on the dynamics of guiding-center test particles subjected to an $\mathbf{E} \times \mathbf{B}$ drift in a large aspect-ratio tokamak. For that, we adopt the drift-wave test particle transport model presented by W. Horton [Physics of Plasmas \textbf{5}, 3910 (1998)] and introduce a second-order gyro-averaged extension, which accounts for the finite Larmor radius effect that arises from a spatially varying electric field. Using this extended model, we numerically examine the influence of the finite Larmor radius on chaotic transport and the formation of transport barriers. For non-monotonic plasma profiles, we show that the twist condition of the dynamical system, i.e.,\ KAM theorem's non-degeneracy condition for the Hamiltonian, is violated along a special curve, which, under non-equilibrium conditions, exhibits significant resilience to destruction, thereby inhibiting chaotic transport. This curve acts as a robust barrier to transport and is usually called shearless transport barrier. While varying the amplitude of the electrostatic perturbations, we analyze bifurcation diagrams of the shearless barriers and escape rates of orbits to explore the impact of the finite Larmor radius on controlling chaotic transport. Our findings show that increasing the Larmor radius enhances the robustness of transport barriers, as larger electrostatic perturbation amplitudes are required to disrupt them. Additionally, as the Larmor radius increases, even in the absence of transport barriers, we observe a reduction in the escape rates, indicating a decrease in chaotic transport.</description>

      <title>Evolution of the electron distribution function during gas ionization by a sub-nanosecond microwave pulse of hundreds MW power</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04720v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The electron velocity distribution function in the plasma, formed by gas ionization with a sub-nanosecond, hundreds of megawatts power level microwave pulse, is studied by a theoretical model and by numerical 3D simulations, the results of which agree well and show that the distribution varies along the pulse as a decreasing power-law function at the rear of the pulse. Experiments performed in a waveguide filled with helium gas confirm that energetic (from several keV to several tens of keV) electrons remain in plasma long after the pulse has crossed the experimental volume. These electrons continue the gas ionization over extended times up to tens of nanoseconds.</description>

      <title>Universal non-thermal power-law distribution functions from the self-consistent evolution of collisionless electrostatic plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07127v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Distribution functions of collisionless systems are known to show non-thermal power law tails. Interestingly, collisionless plasmas in various physical scenarios, (e.g., the ion population of the solar wind) feature a $v^{-5}$ tail in the velocity ($v$) distribution, whose origin has been a long-standing mystery. We show this power law tail to be a natural outcome of the self-consistent collisionless relaxation of driven electrostatic plasmas. We perform a quasilinear analysis of the perturbed Vlasov-Poisson equations to show that the coarse-grained mean distribution function (DF), $f_0$, follows a quasilinear diffusion equation with a diffusion coefficient $D(v)$ that depends on $v$ through the plasma dielectric constant. If the plasma is isotropically forced on scales much larger than the Debye length with a white noise-like electric field, then $D(v)\sim v^4$ for $\sigma&lt;v&lt;\omega_{\mathrm{P}}/k$, with $\sigma$ the thermal velocity, $\omega_{\mathrm{P}}$ the plasma frequency and $k$ the maximum wavenumber of the perturbation; the corresponding $f_0$, in the quasi-steady state, develops a $v^{-\left(d+2\right)}$ tail in $d$ dimensions ($v^{-5}$ tail in 3D), while the energy ($E$) distribution develops an $E^{-2}$ tail irrespective of the dimensionality of space. Any redness of the noise only alters the scaling in the high $v$ end. Non-resonant particles moving slower than the phase-velocity of the plasma waves ($\omega_{\mathrm{P}}/k$) experience a Debye-screened electric field, and significantly less (power law suppressed) acceleration than the near-resonant particles. Thus, a Maxwellian DF develops a power law tail. The Maxwellian core ($v&lt;\sigma$) eventually also heats up, but over a much longer timescale than that over which the tail forms. We definitively show that self-consistency (ignored in test-particle treatments) is crucial for the development of the universal $v^{-5}$ tail.</description>
