      <title>$c=1$, $R=1$ and $N\gg 1$: ZZ instantons in 2D String Theory and Matrix Integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the non-perturbative aspects of $c=1$ string with compactified Euclidean time, its $0+0$ dimensional matrix model duals (at self-dual radius), and $0+1$ dimensional Matrix Quantum Mechanics (free fermion) description. We calculate the instanton normalizations, disk two-point function, and annulus one-point function in worldsheet formalism using string field theory insights. We further match them with the corresponding predictions from the matrix model descriptions. We also have some results and remarks regarding the multi ZZ instanton normalizations and the general $(1,n)$ ZZ instanton normalization for $c=1$ string at both self-dual and generic radius.</description>

      <title>Smoothness of Classical Limit in KMOC Formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit the smoothness of the classical limit of inclusive observables in the formalism developed by Kosower, Maybee and O'Connell (KMOC). Building on the earlier work [1-3], we prove that the classical limit of three classes of inclusive observables, namely scattering angle, radiative field and angular impulse is smooth and does not suffer from any so-called superclassical divergences at all orders in perturbation. Our analysis goes some way in showing that KMOC formalism can be used to compute classical radiation by simply focussing on all the terms that scale as $\hbar^0$ as all the terms that scale with inverse power of $\hbar$ vanish.</description>

      <title>Stochastic quantization with discrete fictitious time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new approach to stochastic quantization \`a la Parisi-Wu with a discrete fictitious time. The noise average is modified by weights, which results in the equivalence in the large time limit to the correlation function of the corresponding quantum field theory {\it without taking any continuum limit of fictitious time}. We test our method in a zero-dimensional toy model both perturbatively and numerically.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note we provide a gentle introduction to the concepts and intuition behind the recent breakthrough results on the mathematically rigorous construction of a non-trivial 2D conformal field theory, namely the so-called Liouville theory. This gives us the opportunity to review Segal's axioms for conformal field theories and to discuss in some detail how the free field fits into them.</description>

      <title>Non-Invertible $SO(2)$ Symmetry of 4d Maxwell from Continuous Gaugings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the self-duality symmetries for 4d Maxwell theory at any value of the coupling $\tau$ via topological manipulations that include gauging continuous symmetries with flat connections. Moreover, we demonstrate that the $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ duality of Maxwell can be realized by trivial gauging operations. Using a non-compact symmetry topological field theory (symTFT) to encode continuous global symmetries of the boundary theory, we reproduce the symTFT for Maxwell and find within this framework condensation defects that implement the non-invertible $SO(2)$ self-duality symmetry. These defects are systematically constructed by higher gauging subsets of the bulk $\mathbb{R}\times \mathbb{R}$ symmetry with appropriate discrete torsion.</description>

      <title>Two-Loop Master Integrals for Mixed QCD-EW Corrections to $gg \to H$ Through $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^2)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider mixed strong-electroweak corrections to Higgs production via gluon fusion, in which the Higgs boson couples to the top quark. Using the method of differential equations, we compute all of the master integrals that contribute to this process at two loops through $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^2)$ in the dimensional regularization parameter $\epsilon = (d-4)/2$, keeping full analytic dependence on the top quark, Higgs, W, and Z boson masses. We present the results for these master integrals in terms of iterated integrals whose kernels depend on elliptic curves.</description>

      <title>Memory and supertranslations on plane wave spacetimes: an on-shell perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we revisit the computation of the classical gravitational waveform for a particle moving in a plane wave background using on-shell amplitudes. We emphasize the relationship between gravitational memory and the boundary conditions of external scattering states, which were neglected in previous works. We then provide the first tree-level expression for the waveform that captures all memory effects. The waveform is presented in terms of Synge's world function, with explicit tail terms, and a smooth weak memory limit. We also discuss the choice of BMS frame for the waveform on a plane wave background. In flat space, this corresponds to a choice of soft dressing of the initial state. We show that on a plane wave background, this dressing becomes a supertranslation of the waveform, in addition to a phase shift in the waveshape of the background.</description>

      <title>Dirac equation in a gauge-field background in the Moyal plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Starting with the Dirac equation for an electron in a constant electromagnetic background on a noncommutative (NC) plane, we obtain a gauge invariant description of the system. Surprisingly, the dynamics of the system is dictated by the standard form of Lorentz force law, once the effective magnetic and electric fields $\left( B^{NC}, \, E^{NC} \right)$ correct up to leading order in the NC parameter are identified. The Hall effect is studied using the NC corrected fields in the non-relativistic (NR) limit. This shows that noncommutativity affects the cyclotron frequency, but leaves the Hall conductivity unaffected at least to first order in the NC parameter. Owing to the NC corrected magnetic field, the hyperfine splitting of Hydrogen atom spectrum also shows a first order correction which helps establish an upper bound on the spatial NC parameter.</description>

      <title>HEFT Numerators from Kinematic Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The kinematic numerator factors for heavy-mass effective field theory are derived from a field theory limit of the string theory vertex operator kinematic algebra introduced in arXiv:1806.09584. The kinematic numerators are correlators of nested commutators of gluon vertex operators evaluated between massive tachyonic vertex operators. The resulting numerators are given by products of structure constants of the vertex operator algebra which are gauge invariant expressions. The computation of the nested commutators leads to a natural organisation in the form of rooted trees, endowed with an order that facilitates the enumeration of the various contributions. This kinematic algebra gives a string theory understanding of the field theory fusion rules for constructing the heavy-mass effective field theory numerator of arXiv:2104.11206 and arXiv:2111.15649.</description>

      <title>Vacuum configuration of winding superstrings from non-standard semiclassical quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semiclassical quantization techniques are unreliable, if the magnitude of the quantum fluctuations becomes comparable with a classical background scale. This is the case, for example, for superstrings at temperatures close to the Hagedorn temperature. Here, we propose a non-standard treatment which aims to extend the semiclassical approach for type-II superstrings to such cases. This allows us to provide a well-posed reformulation of recent computations of the Hagedorn temperature in a large class of confining gauge theories. Along the way, we fill a gap in the literature by proving that the standard semiclassical one-loop partition function of the Green-Schwarz superstring can be made finite, by means of a suitable choice of integration measures, for any background worldsheet in a target spacetime satisfying the (type-IIA) supergravity field equations.</description>

      <title>Generalized $T\bar{T}$-like flows for scalar theories in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the necessary condition for $SO(N) \times SO(N)$ duality invariance manifests as a partial differential equation in two-dimensional scalar theories. This condition, expressed as a partial differential equation, corresponds precisely to the integrability condition. We derive a general perturbation solution to this partial differential equation, which includes both a root $T\bar{T}$ flow equation and an irrelevant $T\bar{T}$-like flow equation. Additionally, we identify a general form for these flow equations that commute with each other.</description>

      <title>Effects of the Lorentz symmetry violation on relativistic neutral scalar bosons: Scattering and bound states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we investigate the effects of Lorentz symmetry violation on a relativistic neutral scalar boson within the framework of the Klein-Gordon formalism. We consider a tensor $(K_F)_{\mu \nu \alpha \beta}$ out of the Standard Model Extension, which describes the field configuration consisting of a constant magnetic field $\vec{B}=B\hat{z}$ and a cylindrical electric field $\vec{E}=\frac{\lambda}{r}\hat{r}$. We analyze and discuss the effects of Lorentz symmetry violation on the equation of motion and show that the presence of a specific Lorentz symmetry violation parameter is essential to obtain analytical solutions for scattering and bound states. Employing the partial wave approach in cylindrical coordinates, we calculate the relativistic phase shift, scattering amplitude and $S$-matrix, and discuss the effects of Lorentz symmetry violation on the phase shift. Furthermore, we obtain bound-state solutions by examining the poles of the $S$-matrix and compare our findings with those reported in the literature. Our results reveal that bound-state solutions are only feasible for a restrict range of Lorentz symmetry violation parameters, which contradict previous studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Macdonald finite-difference Hamiltonian is lifted to a super-generalization. In addition to canonical bosonic time variables $p_k$ new Grassmann time variables $\theta_k$ are introduced, and the Hamiltonian is represented as a differential operator acting on a space of functions of both types of variables $p_k$ and $\theta_k$. Eigenfunctions for this Hamiltonian are a suitable generalization of Macdonald polynomials to super-Macdonald polynomials discussed earlier in the literature. Peculiarities of the construction in comparison to the canonical bosonic case are discussed.</description>

      <title>Growing black-hole hair in nonminimally coupled biscalar gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Black holes offer a unique laboratory for fundamental physics and are crucial for probing theories beyond Einstein's theory of General Relativity. In this paper, we consider 4D effective field theories with scalar fields. We focus on axi-dilaton gravity, a quadratic gravity theory with two kinetically coupled scalar fields, an axion and a dilaton. To evolve these fields around black holes, we introduce Canuda-AxiDil, the first open-source, parameterized numerical relativity code for quadratic and bi-scalar gravity. Using this code, we perform single black hole simulations to show the dynamical formation of axion and dilaton hairs. Through these simulations, we measure the impact of black-hole spin and curvature coupling strength on the axion and dilaton, and show that a kinetic coupling between the fields increases the observed deviations from General Relativity. Furthermore, we simulate the axion and dilaton fields around a binary black hole coalescence demonstrating the growth of axion hair during the inspiral and the production of radiative modes for both fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the $N_f=2$ Schwinger model with the massive staggered fermions in the presence of a $2\pi$ periodic $\theta$ term, using the Grassmann tensor renormalization group. Thanks to the Grassmann tensor network formulation, there is no difficulty in dealing with the massive staggered fermions. We study the $\theta$ dependence of the free energy in the thermodynamic limit. Our calculation provides consistent results with the analytical solution in the large mass limit. The results also suggest that the $N_f=2$ Schwinger model on a lattice has a different phase structure from that described by the continuum theory.</description>

      <title>The two-vertex model of loop quantum gravity: anisotropic reduced sectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The so-called two-vertex model of loop quantum gravity has been analytically studied in the past within a U($N$) symmetry-reduced sector leading to a cosmological interpretation. In this work we study the simplest non-trivial two-vertex model (with four edges, i.e., $N=4$), using the spinorial formalism and twisted geometries to isolate the degrees of freedom and derive a canonical parametrization. We identify eight geometric parameters describing the polyhedral configurations and four twist angles characterizing the system's dynamics. Going beyond the U($N$) symmetry-reduced sector which can be interpreted as homogeneous and isotropic, we find three additional stable symmetry-reduced sectors: the privileged-direction sector, the bi-twist sector, and the inhomogeneous bi-twist sector. Each sector introduces degrees of anisotropy or inhomogeneity and expand the potential cosmological interpretations of the two-vertex model.</description>

      <title>On Measures in Ion Trap Quantum Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate quantum information measures in ion traps by utilizing the harmonic oscillator model to characterize trapped potentials and ion dynamics. Our findings confirm that, in the steady-state case, mutual information and synchronization measures exhibit similar behaviors. Additionally, we explore how these measures change in the quench model and how they are influenced by coupling and external noise, such as an external magnetic field. Moreover, for a proposed target ground state, we determine the circuit depth and analyze the effects of the external magnetic field and coupling constant, highlighting their dynamic evolution over time. We also discuss the coherent state of a single ion in a trap, noting an inverse relationship between complexity and fidelity-where increased fidelity corresponds to decreased system complexity, indicating a more ordered state with improved control and optimization. However, at higher system frequencies, complexity increases due to intricate interactions and rapid state changes, necessitating advanced control mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Bipartite Current Fluctuations in Quantum Wires through Charge Fractionalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum information measures of many-body systems often imply a measure with multi- or two regions such as bipartite charge fluctuations within the ground state revealing the logarithmic profile of the entanglement entropy in a quantum wire. Here, we introduce a new method from the bipartite current fluctuations and the divergence theorem. They reveal the fractional charges related to ground-state energetics and the proximity to Mott physics in the same ballistic quantum wires. This also encodes the behavior of the electron Green's function in space. With metallic gates on both sides of an interface to implement the protocol introducing the two macroscopic domains, bipartite current fluctuations can reveal an additional localized bound state associated to the topological Jackiw-Rebbi model, coexisting with the fractional charges. Through the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) algorithm we introduce a quantum spin chain analogue.</description>

      <title>Dynamical features and shadows of quantum Schwarzschild black hole in effective field theories of gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of the Schwarzschild black hole geometry involving leading one-loop long-distance quantum effects, which arise within the framework of effective field theories of gravity. Our analysis reveals that geodesic trajectories of both massive and massless particles can assume completely different behaviors depending on the sign assumed by the quantum contributions, in spite of their smallness. Moreover, we find that the positions of stable and unstable circular orbits are determined by an algebraic quartic equation, which we solve by developing a straightforward and analytic method. Additionally, we examine black hole shadows and rings by means of two different emission profile models, which account for quantum corrections to the innermost stable circular orbit and photon sphere radii. The Hawking temperature and the entropy of the black hole are also derived. Finally, we draw our conclusions.</description>

      <title>On Formation of Primordial Naked Singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The density fluctuations in the nearly homogeneous background in the very early universe are argued to be the origin of the cosmic structures we observe in our present universe. Along with many other structures, these fluctuations would have also given rise to primordial black holes at the end of unhindered gravitational collapse of high density matter blobs that developed due to fluctuations. We study here such a collapse in the inflationary epoch which has been assumed earlier to form primordial black holes. The potentials for inflation are chosen to be a general polynomial in its scalar field $V(\phi) \propto \phi^n$. Examining the dynamics of such a collapse, we find the parameter range where the apparent horizon does not form, thus resulting in the visibility of the final singularity of collapse for faraway external observers. This treatment is within the classical limits, dictated by Planck's constraints. The slow-roll parameters are analysed here to keep the relic abundance of the inflationary field high enough so that the abundance of produced primordial naked singularities (PNaSs) fall within the range of resolution of possible observational probes.

      <title>Dualities between 2+1d fusion surface models from braided fusion categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fusion surface models generalize the concept of anyon chains to 2+1 dimensions, utilizing fusion 2-categories as their input. We investigate bond-algebraic dualities in these systems and show that distinct module tensor categories $\mathcal{M}$ over the same braided fusion category $\mathcal{B}$ give rise to dual lattice models. This extends the 1+1d result that dualities in anyon chains are classified by module categories over fusion categories. We analyze two concrete examples: (i) a $\text{Rep}(S_3)$ model with a constrained Hilbert space, dual to the spin-$\tfrac{1}{2}$ XXZ model on the honeycomb lattice, and (ii) a bilayer Kitaev honeycomb model, dual to a spin-$\tfrac{1}{2}$ model with XXZ and Ising interactions. Unlike regular $\mathcal{M}=\mathcal{B}$ fusion surface models, which conserve only 1-form symmetries, models constructed from $\mathcal{M} \neq \mathcal{B}$ can exhibit both 1-form and 0-form symmetries, including non-invertible ones.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.16570v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Page curve exhibits a sharp peak at the Page time corresponding to a phase transition from an empty quantum extremal surface to a non-empty one. This study delves into the impact of this phase transition on the informational content of black hole radiation through constructing a smooth Page curve which represents a gradual transition instead. We utilize replica trick, apply holography in a specific form, and introduce mathematical identities inherent to the curve's smoothness. Our results suggest that a gradual transition could lead to a significant increase in the informational content of the radiation.</description>

Abstract: These notes are an extended version of the talks given by the authors at the XIV International Workshop on Lie Theory and Its Applications in Physics, Sofia, Bulgaria, 20-26 June 2021. The concise version published in the proceedings of the workshop contains additional discussions for the $q$-deformed scenario:
  \noindent\href{https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-19-4751-3_23}{https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-19-4751-3\_23}.
  In these notes we identify KLT kernel with the Shapovalov form on Verma module with its highest/lowest weight given by the reference momentum and rest of the momenta as roots. We then take a step forward and show how the Feynman diagrams emerge naturally as the Shapovalov duals of the Verma module basis vectors. We show such algebraic construct offers a compact expression for the BCJ numerators. Explicit examples are shown for the nonlinear sigma model and the HEFT pre-numerators.</description>

      <title>Hidden zeros are equivalent to enhanced ultraviolet scaling and lead to unique amplitudes in Tr($\phi^3$) theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04234v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the hidden amplitude zeros discovered by Arkani-Hamed et al., which describe a non-trivial vanishing of scattering amplitudes on special external kinematics. We first prove that every type of hidden zero is equivalent to what we call a "subset" enhanced scaling under Britto-Cachazo-Feng-Witten shifts, for any rational function built from planar Lorentz invariants $X_{ij}{=}(p_i{+}p_{i+1}{+}\ldots{+}p_{j-1})^2$. This directly applies to Tr($\phi^3$), non-linear sigma model, or Yang-Mills-scalar amplitudes, revealing a novel type of enhanced UV scaling in these theories. We also use this observation to prove the conjecture that Tr($\phi^3$) amplitudes are uniquely fixed by the zeros, up to an overall normalization, when assuming an ordered and local propagator structure and trivial numerators. In the case of Yang-Mills theory, we conjecture the zeros, combined with the Bern-Carrasco-Johansson color-kinematic duality in the form of amplitude relations, uniquely fix the $\lfloor n/2\rfloor$ distinct polarization structures of $n$-point gluon amplitudes. Our approach opens a new avenue for understanding previous similar uniqueness results, and also extending them beyond tree level for the first time.</description>

Abstract: A coordinate-free formulation of first order effective field theory, in which Nambu-Goldstone fields are described as sections on associated bundle, is presented. This construction, which is based only on symmetry considerations, allows for a direct derivation of number and types of Nambu-Goldstone fields in a classical field theory without any reference to effective Lagrangian. A central role in classification is shown to be played by Lorentz-symmetry breaking order parameter which induces symplectic structure in the field space of the theory.</description>

      <title>Black hole singularity resolution in unimodular gravity from unitarity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03006v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the quantum dynamics of an interior planar AdS (anti-de Sitter) black hole, requiring unitarity in the natural time coordinate conjugate to the cosmological "constant of motion" appearing in unimodular gravity. Both the classical singularity and the horizon are replaced by a non-singular highly quantum region; semiclassical notions of spacetime evolution are only valid in an intermediate region. For the singularity, our results should be applicable to general black holes: unitarity in unimodular time always implies singularity resolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06668v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider spinors on the total space of a Kaluza-Klein model with fuzzy sphere fibre and geometrically realised Dirac operator on the product. We show that a single massless spinor on the product appears on spacetime as multiplets of spinors with a particular signature of differing masses and $SU(2)$ Yang-Mills charges. For example, for the reduced fuzzy sphere isomorphic to $M_2(\mathbb{C})$, a massless spinor appears as two $SU(2)$ doublets and an $SU(2)$ quadruplet in mass ratios $1:5/3:7/3$. Although such signatures do not appear to exactly match the Standard Model, the paper provides proof of concept of the approach, which can be applied to other noncommutative fibre algebras.</description>

      <title>Unmixing sub-leading Regge trajectories of $\mathcal{N} = 4$ Super-Yang-Mills</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07529v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the conformal field theory data (CFT-data) of planar 4D $\mathcal{N} = 4$ Super-Yang-Mills theory in the strong 't Hooft coupling limit. This regime explores the physics of massive short strings in the flat-space limit of the dual AdS. We focus on the CFT-data of the massive short strings exchanged in the operator product expansion (OPE) of the four-point function dual to the Virasoro-Shapiro amplitude. This CFT-data arranges itself into Regge trajectories in the flat-space limit. Using inputs from recent advances in the computation of the AdS Virasoro-Shapiro amplitude, integrability, and a stipulation based on analyticity of the CFT-data in spin, we are able to fix all the CFT-data on the four unique sub-leading Regge trajectories, at leading non-trivial order, as a function of the string-mass level. One of our predictions is that one of the four unique sub-leading Regge trajectories decouples from the OPE in the flat-space limit. This hints at an emergent selection rule in the flat-space limit, similar to our previous results in arXiv:2310.06041. Our procedure should be applicable in a variety of similar setups like for the AdS Veneziano amplitude or in ABJM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08903v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by string theory scenarios, we study the optical aspect of AdS black holes in Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton theory. Concretely, we investigate and examine the shadows and the deflection angle of light rays by such cosmological black holes. Concerning the shadows, we first deal with the non-rotating solutions. As expected, we obtain perfect circular shadows where their sizes are controlled by the involved parameter including the charge and the cosmological constant. Combining the Newman-Janis formalism and the Hamilton-Jacobi algorithm, we approach the rotating black hole shadows using one dimensional real curves. Among others, we observe that the size and the shape shadows depend on certain parameters including the rotating one. To make contact with Event Horizon Telescope observational data, we show that certain constrains should be imposed on such parameters. Then, we study the behaviors of the light rays near such cosmological black holes by computing the deflection angle in terms of Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton theory parameters. Specifically, we reveal that the effect of the cosmological constant on the deflection angle depends on the coupling between the black hole parameters. Introducing the rotating parameter, we observe this effect becomes similar to that of the cosmological constant in ordinary AdS black holes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10036v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study $\mathbb{Z}_N$ one-form center symmetries in four-dimensional gauge theories using the symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT). In this context, the associated TFT in the five-dimensional bulk is the BF model. We revisit its canonical quantization and construct topological boundary states on several important classes of four manifolds that are spin, non-spin and torsional. We highlight a web of four-dimensional dualities, which can be naturally interpreted within the SymTFT framework. We also point out an intriguing class of four-dimensional gauge theories that exhibit mixed 't Hooft anomaly between one-form symmetries. In the second part of this work, we extend the SymTFT to account for various quantities protected by supersymmetry (SUSY) in SUSY gauge theories. We proposed that their behaviour under various symmetry operations are entirely captured by the topological boundary of the SymTFT, resulting in strong constraints. Concrete examples are considered, including the Witten index, the lens space index and the Donaldson-Witten and Vafa-Witten partition functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12906v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 't Hooft anomalies of discrete global symmetries and gaugings thereof have rich mathematical structures and far-reaching physical consequences. We examine each subgroup $G$, up to automorphisms, of the permutation group $S_4$ that acts on the four legs of the affine $D_4$ quiver diagram, which is mirror dual to the 3d $\mathcal{N}=4$ $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ gauge theory with four flavours. These actions are studied in terms of how each permutation cycle acts on the superconformal index of the theory in question. We present a prescription for refining the index with respect to the fugacities associated with the Abelian discrete symmetries that are subgroups of $G$. This allows us to study sequential gauging of various subgroups of $G$ and construct symmetry webs. We study the effects of 't Hooft anomalies and non-invertible symmetries that arise from discrete gauging on the index. When the whole symmetry $G$ is gauged, our results are in perfect agreement with a type of discrete operations on the quiver, known as wreathing, discussed in the literature. We provide a general prescription for computing the index for any wreathed quivers that contain unitary or special unitary gauge groups. We demonstrate this in an example of the 3d $\mathcal{N}=4$ $\mathrm{U}(N)$ gauge theory with $n$ flavours and compare the results with gauging the charge conjugation symmetry associated with the flavour symmetry of such a theory.</description>

Abstract: Integrating out supersymmetric M2 branes wrapped on two-cycles in Calabi-Yau manifolds is an important calculation: it allows the determination of, and in some ways defines, the free energy of topological strings. In these notes, based on a short course aimed at graduate students, we go through various aspects of this calculation in detail. The end result is a recently proposed new formula for the topological string free energy.</description>

RG flows leaving unbroken a subcategory of non-invertible symmetries are associated with anomaly-matching conditions that we employ systematically to map the space of flows between Virasoro Minimal models beyond the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetric proposed recently in the literature. We introduce a family of non-linear integral equations that appear to encode the exact finite-size, ground-state energies of these flows, including non-integrable cases, such as the recently proposed $\mathcal{M}(k q + I,q) \to \mathcal{M}(k q - I,q)$. Our family of NLIEs encompasses and generalises the integrable flows known in the literature: $\phi_{(1,3)}$, $\phi_{(1,5)}$, $\phi_{(1,2)}$ and $\phi_{(2,1)}$. This work uncovers a new interplay between exact solvability and non-invertible symmetries. Furthermore, our non-perturbative description provides a non-trivial test for all the flows conjectured by anomaly matching conditions, but so far not-observed by other means.</description>

      <title>A Non-perturbative General Approximation Scheme (NGAS) for Interacting Quantum Systems with Perturbation Theory for Arbitrary Strength of Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.12508</link>
      <description>arXiv:1909.12508v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A non-perturbative general approximation scheme (NGAS) is presented which is potentially applicable for arbitrary strength of interaction in quantum theory. The scheme utilizes an input Hamiltonian, which is exactly solvable. The effects of interaction are incorporated into this input Hamiltonian through a non-linear feedback mechanism by imposing self-consistency conditions. The method is nonperturbative, yet improvable in a new formulation of perturbation theory, designated as: mean field perturbation theory (MFPT). We apply the scheme to anharmonic interactions in one dimension employing the harmonic-approximation and obtain uniformly accurate results by Borel summation, for the quartic-, sextic-, octic-anharmonic oscillators and to the quartic double-well oscillator (QDWO) for {\emph{arbitrary strength of coupling}}. The {\it{flexibility}} of the scheme to the choice of the input is demonstrated by producing results of comparable accuracy by employing the infinite-square Hamiltonian as input. Application to the {\lambda}{\phi}^4-quantum field theory leads to the equivalence of the present method to the Gaussian-effective potential approach in the harmonic approximation. Additionally,however the underlying condensate structure of the effective vacuum is shown to emerge and the instability of the perturbative ground state is established. The results for the QDWO may be contrasted with those from the standard formulation of perturbation theory , where Borel-summation {\it{fails}} for any value of the coupling strength.</description>

      <title>Particle exchange statistics beyond fermions and bosons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05203v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is commonly believed that there are only two types of particle exchange statistics in quantum mechanics, fermions and bosons, with the exception of anyons in two dimension. In principle, a second exception known as parastatistics, which extends outside of two dimensions, has been considered but was believed to be physically equivalent to fermions and bosons. In this paper we show that nontrivial parastatistics inequivalent to either fermions or bosons can exist in physical systems. These new types of identical particles obey generalized exclusion principles, leading to exotic free-particle thermodynamics distinct from any system of free fermions and bosons. We formulate our theory by developing a second quantization of paraparticles, which naturally includes exactly solvable non-interacting theories, and incorporates physical constraints such as locality. We then construct a family of exactly solvable quantum spin models in one and two dimensions where free paraparticles emerge as quasiparticle excitations, and their exchange statistics can be physically observed and is notably distinct from fermions and bosons. This demonstrates the possibility of a new type of quasiparticle in condensed matter systems, and, more speculatively, the potential for previously unconsidered types of elementary particles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01836v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish robust relations between Transverse Momentum Dependent distributions (TMDs) and collinear distributions. We define weighted integrals of TMDs that we call Transverse Momentum Moments (TMMs) and prove that TMMs are equal to collinear distributions evaluated in some minimal subtraction scheme. The conversion to the modified minimal subtraction ($\bar{MS}$) scheme, can be done by a calculable factor, which we derive up to three loops for some cases. We discuss in detail the zeroth, the first, and the second TMMs and provide phenomenological results for them based on the current extractions of TMDs. The results of this paper open new avenues for theoretical and phenomenological investigation of the three-dimensional and collinear hadron structures.</description>

      <title>The Kramers escape rate of phase transitions for the 6-dimensional Gauss-Bonnet AdS black hole with triple phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20512v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we obtain specific picture of the phase transitions for the 6-dimensional Gauss-Bonnet Anti-de Sitter (AdS) black hole with triple phases, using the generalized free energy we constructed and Kramers escape rate in stochastic motion. There are six possible phase transition processes between the three different stable states (small, medium, and large black hole states). During these phase transitions, there are two key temperatures. One is the temperature at which the medium black hole state emerges, and the other is the temperature at which the small black hole state annihilates. Meanwhile, two dynamic equilibrium processes are formed. One is a dynamic equilibrium of the transition from the medium black hole state to the large black hole state and the transition from the small black hole state to the medium black hole state. The other is a dynamic equilibrium of the transition from the small black hole state to the medium black hole state and the transition from the medium black hole state to the small black hole state.</description>

      <title>A note on the deformation of 1D ferromagnetic domain walls due to double exchange interaction with a free electron gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16638v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using an S-matrix formulation we evaluate the thermodynamic potential and conductance of a Bloch or N\'eel magnetic wall interacting with a one dimensional free electron gas via a double exchange interaction. The minimization of the elastic magnetic energy plus electronic thermodynamic potential indicates that for chemical potential larger than the magnetic interaction the domain wall is generally deformed to a thin wall, while for magnetic interaction larger than the chemical potential tends towards wide walls. In contrast, for a double wall configuration the deformation is always towards wide walls. For the single as well as the double magnetic wall configurations the conductance monotonically decreases with decreasing wall width. The thermodynamic potential and conductance of Bloch and N\'eel magnetic domain walls are identical within this prototype model.</description>

      <title>Does the oscillatory behavior of the Momentum Spectrum depend on the basis in the Post-Transient Stage?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16321v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pair creation by a spatially homogeneous, time-dependent electric field is studied within the framework of scalar quantum electrodynamics. We employ the standard Bogoliubov transformation approach to compute the single-particle distribution function in an adiabatic basis. We analyzed the distribution function of created particles in two different adiabatic bases (related by a unitary transformation). A novel dynamical scaling is observed while analyzing the oscillatory momentum spectrum of the pairs created by the Sauter pulsed field at intermediate times, calculated using the two adiabatic bases. In these bases, the same oscillatory momentum spectra are observed but at different times. However, when we scale the time by the point marking the end of the transient stage of dynamical evolution for each case of central momentum, the respective momentum spectra overlap. Furthermore, we study the time evolution of the momentum spectrum in the multi-photon regime and find that the spectra show a multi-modal profile structure at finite times for both choices of basis.</description>

      <title>Gross-Neveu-Yukawa SO(2) and SO(3) tensorial criticality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16842v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the relativistic SO(2)- and SO(3)-invariant Gross-Neveu-Yukawa field theories for real, rank-two, symmetric, traceless tensor order parameters coupled to $N_{\text{f}}$ flavors of two-component Dirac fermions. These field theories arise as an effective description of fractionalized spin-orbital liquids. The two theories are the simplest and special cases of the more general class of field theories with SO($N$) symmetric tensor order parameter coupled to Dirac fermions, in which the symmetry is low enough to allow only one, and not the usual two quartic self-interaction terms. Using two-loop renormalization group near the upper critical dimension, we demonstrate that the theory exhibits a new critical fixed point for $N=3$ and the concomitant continuous phase transition for any value of $N_{\text{f}}$. For $N=2$ the theory is equivalent to the chiral XY model. We discuss the crucial role of the symmetry-allowed sextic self-interactions in the selection of the ground state configuration in the case of SO(3). The universal quantities such as the the anomalous dimensions of order parameters and fermions, the correlation length exponent, and the mass gap ratio between order parameter and fermion masses are computed up to $\epsilon^{2}$ order.</description>

      <title>Parastatistics and a secret communication challenge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13360v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the most unconventional features of topological phases of matter is the emergence of quasiparticles with exotic statistics, such as non-Abelian anyons in two dimensional systems. Recently, a different type of exotic particle statistics that is consistently defined in any dimension, called parastatistics, is also shown to be possible in a special family of topological phases. However, the physical significance of emergent parastatistics still remains elusive. Here we demonstrate a distinctive physical consequence of parastatistics by proposing a challenge game that can only be won using physical systems hosting paraparticles, as passing the challenge requires the two participating players to secretly communicate in an indirect way by exploiting the nontrivial exchange statistics of the quasiparticles. The winning strategy using emergent paraparticles is robust against noise, as well as the most relevant class of eavesdropping via local measurements. This provides both an operational definition and an experimental identity test for paraparticles, alongside a potential application in secret communication.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20219v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this letter we propose a new interpretation of the Casimir effect. Concretely, we show that the Casimir energy can be written as the quantum ``Von Neumann'' entropy associated to a 2-qubit, mixed pseudo-density matrix of the relevant quantum fluctuations. The quantum entropy we introduce draws parallels to the concept of quantum inseparability found in quantum information theory. Our results suggest that the Casimir energy is a measure of the quantum entropy of the vacuum fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Quantal analysis of the effects of coordinate noncommutativity on bi-dimensional harmonic motion under parametric variations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09043v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Influence of coordinate noncommutativity on 2D quantum oscillatory motion, which undergoes parameter variations, is investigated. We first derive quantum solutions of the system described with time-independent parameters considering the noncommutativity of coordinates as a preliminary step. And then, we extend our study, framed with noncommutative phase-space formalism, to obtain relevant solutions of the system with time-dependent parameters. This system, which we focus on, is nonstationary due to variation of parameters in time. While the left and right circular annihilation and creation operators are utilized in the quantal management of the basic stationary system, the Schr\"odinger equation of the nonstationary system is solved using the Lewis-Riesenfeld invariant theory and the invariant-related unitary transformation procedure. The outcome of our analysis is useful in understanding the effects of noncommutativity from quantum perspectives, especially in conjunction with the impact of parameter variations.</description>
