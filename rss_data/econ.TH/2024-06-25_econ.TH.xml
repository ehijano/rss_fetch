      <title>A Mechanism for Optimizing Media Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A mechanism is described that addresses the fundamental trade off between media producers who want to increase reach and consumers who provide attention based on the rate of utility received, and where overreach negatively impacts that rate. An optimal solution can be achieved when the media source considers the impact of overreach in a cost function used in determining the optimal distribution of content to maximize individual consumer utility and participation. The result is a Nash equilibrium between producer and consumer that is also Pareto efficient. Comparison with the literature on Recommender systems highlights the advantages of the mechanism.The review suggests advancements over that literature including identifying an optimal content volume for the consumer and improvements for handling multiple objectives A practical algorithm to generate the optimal distribution for each consumer is provided.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Monetarism: influence of Entropic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces an approach to gas-like models, from the concept of entropy, using the money stock data of two economic agents, in this case of two countries, which carry out market actions (trading) in two theoretical scenarios: in the absence of debt and with debt. The exercise deals exclusively with a no debt scenario and the data and results show that the bounded model generates low $P_{(m)}$, values that the results of the regressions between the two countries show an advantageous position of the stock country $m_i$ over the stock country $m_j$. About the rationale, it is found that these models can provide meaningful information regarding the behavior of monetary variables, -- taking into account the different conceptual positions proposed in the manuscript -- using analogies derived from other fields of study ranging from molecules in rarefied gases or particles collisions, bringing the data to the interaction of economic actors.</description>

      <title>Calibrated Forecasting and Persuasion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How should an expert send forecasts to maximize her utility subject to passing a calibration test? We consider a dynamic game where an expert sends probabilistic forecasts to a decision maker. The decision maker uses a calibration test based on past outcomes to verify the expert's forecasts. We characterize the optimal forecasting strategy by reducing the dynamic game to a static persuasion problem. A distribution of forecasts is implementable by a calibrated strategy if and only if it is a mean-preserving contraction of the distribution of conditionals (honest forecasts). We characterize the value of information by comparing what an informed and uninformed expert can attain. Moreover, we consider a decision maker who uses regret minimization, instead of the calibration test, to take actions. We show that the expert can achieve the same payoff against a regret minimizer as under the calibration test, and in some instances, she can achieve strictly more.</description>

      <title>Money Creation and Banking: Theory and Evidence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.15096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.15096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the role of banks' money creation in monetary transmission. I develop a monetary-search model where demand for the monetary base and the money multiplier are endogenously determined through banks' money creation. The model and data show that reserves are not independent of interest rate policy, even with ample reserves. Furthermore, short-term rates and interest on reserves play distinct roles in monetary transmission. I evaluate the theory by matching it with data, and the calibrated model can account for the evolution of reserves, excess reserves, and the money multiplier</description>

      <title>Collective Sampling: An Ex Ante Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05758v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I study collective dynamic information acquisition. Players determine when to end sequential sampling via a collective stopping rule. With two players, collective stopping is determined either unilaterally or unanimously. I develop a methodology to characterize equilibria using an ex ante perspective on posterior distributions. Under unilateral stopping, each player chooses a mean-preserving contraction of the other's posterior distribution; under unanimous stopping, they choose mean-preserving spreads. Equilibrium sampling regions are determined via concavification. Preference misalignment generates Pareto inefficiency: there is too little learning under unilateral stopping and possibly too much under unanimous stopping. Learning inefficiencies are amplified when players' preferences become less aligned. I demonstrate the value of my methodology in three applications: committee search, dynamic persuasion, and competition in persuasion.</description>

      <title>Game Transformations That Preserve Nash Equilibria or Best-Response Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.00076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.00076v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate under which conditions normal-form games are (guaranteed to be) strategically equivalent. First, we show for N-player games (N &gt;= 3) that
  (A) it is NP-hard to decide whether a given strategy is a best response to some strategy profile of the opponents, and that
  (B) it is co-NP-hard to decide whether two games have the same best-response sets.
  Combining that with known results from the literature, we move our attention to equivalence-preserving game transformations.
  It is a widely used fact that a positive affine (linear) transformation of the utility payoffs neither changes the best-response sets nor the Nash equilibrium set. We investigate which other game transformations also possess either of the following two properties when being applied to an arbitrary N-player game (N &gt;= 2):
  (i) The Nash equilibrium set stays the same;
  (ii) The best-response sets stay the same.
  For game transformations that operate player-wise and strategy-wise, we prove that (i) implies (ii) and that transformations with property (ii) must be positive affine. The resulting equivalence chain highlights the special status of positive affine transformations among all the transformation procedures that preserve key game-theoretic characteristics.</description>
