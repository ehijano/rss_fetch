      <title>A Curationary Tale: Logarithmic Regret in DeFi Lending via Dynamic Pricing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lending within decentralized finance (DeFi) has facilitated over $100 billion of loans since 2020. A long-standing inefficiency in DeFi lending protocols such as Aave is the use of static pricing mechanisms for loans. These mechanisms have been shown to maximize neither welfare nor revenue for participants in DeFi lending protocols. Recently, adaptive supply models pioneered by Morpho and Euler have become a popular means of dynamic pricing for loans. This pricing is facilitated by agents known as curators, who bid to match supply and demand. We construct and analyze an online learning model for static and dynamic pricing models within DeFi lending. We show that when loans are small and have a short duration relative to an observation time $T$, adaptive supply models achieve $O(\log T)$ regret, while static models cannot achieve better than $\Omega(\sqrt{T})$ regret. We then study competitive behavior between curators, demonstrating that adaptive supply mechanisms maximize revenue and welfare for both borrowers and lenders.</description>

      <title>Global Profits, Local Decisions: Why Global Cooperation Falters in Multi-level Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Global cooperation often falters despite shared objectives, as misaligned interests and unequal incentives undermine collective efforts, such as those in international climate change collaborations. To tackle this issue, this paper introduces a multi-level game-theoretic model to analyze the dynamics of complex interactions within hierarchical systems. The model consists of global, local, and pairwise games, and two strategy types, binary and level-based strategies, are explored under varying parameter conditions. Using computational simulations and numerical analysis, we examine how factors across different levels influence player decisions, game dynamics and population phase transitions during the evolutionary process. Our findings reveal that although the increase of profit rates at local and pairwise games enhances cooperation within the population, the global game exerts minimal influence on player decisions and population states under both strategy settings. Particularly, analytical and simulation results show that, under binary strategies, global profit does not influence localized decision-making of players, while under level-based strategies, players cooperating at the global level are eventually outcompeted due to the evolutionary disadvantage even when global profit is substantial. These insights contribute to a theoretical understanding of cooperation dynamics in multi-level systems and may offer implications for fostering global collaboration on challenges like climate change.</description>

      <title>On Nash Equilibria in Play-Once and Terminal Deterministic Graphical Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider finite $n$-person deterministic graphical games and study the existence of pure stationary Nash-equilibrium in such games. We assume that all infinite plays are equivalent and form a unique outcome, while each terminal position is a separate outcome. It is known that for $n=2$ such a game always has a Nash equilibrium, while that may not be true for $n &gt; 2$.
  A game is called {\em play-once} if each player controls a unique position and {\em terminal} if any terminal outcome is better than the infinite one for each player. We prove in this paper that play-once games have Nash equilibria.
  We also show that terminal games have Nash equilibria if they have at most three terminals.</description>

      <title>NFTs as a Data-Rich Test Bed: Conspicuous Consumption and its Determinants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conspicuous consumption occurs when a consumer derives value from a good based on its social meaning as a signal of wealth, taste, and/or community affiliation. Common conspicuous goods include designer footwear, country club memberships, and artwork; conspicuous goods also exist in the digital sphere, with non-fungible tokens (NFTs) as a prominent example. The NFT market merits deeper study for two key reasons: first, it is poorly understood relative to its economic scale; and second, it is unusually amenable to analysis because NFT transactions are publicly available on the blockchain, making them useful as a test bed for conspicuous consumption dynamics. This paper introduces a model that incorporates two previously identified elements of conspicuous consumption: the \emph{bandwagon effect} (goods increase in value as they become more popular) and the \emph{snob effect} (goods increase in value as they become rarer). Our model resolves the apparent tension between these two effects, exhibiting net complementarity between others' and one's own conspicuous consumption. We also introduce a novel dataset combining NFT transactions with embeddings of the corresponding NFT images computed using an off-the-shelf vision transformer architecture. We use our dataset to validate the model, showing that the bandwagon effect raises an NFT collection's value as more consumers join, while the snob effect drives consumers to seek rarer NFTs within a given collection.</description>

      <title>Coarse-Grained Games: A Framework for Bounded Perception in Game Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In everyday life, we frequently make coarse-grained judgments. When we say that Olivia and Noah excel in mathematics, we disregard the specific differences in their mathematical abilities. Similarly, when we claim that a particular automobile manufacturer produces high-quality cars, we overlook the minor variations among individual vehicles. These coarse-grained assessments are distinct from erroneous or deceptive judgments, such as those resulting from student cheating or false advertising by corporations. Despite the prevalence of such judgments, little attention has been given to their underlying mathematical structure. In this paper, we introduce the concept of coarse-graining into game theory, analyzing games in which players may perceive different payoffs as identical while preserving the underlying order structure. This framework allows us to examine the rational inference processes that arise when players equate distinct micro-level payoffs at a macro level, and to explore how Nash equilibria are preserved or altered as a result. Our key findings suggest that coarse-grained games possess several desirable properties that make them suitable for modeling phenomena in the social sciences. This paper demonstrates two such applications: first, in cases of overly minor product updates, consumers may encounter an equilibrium selection problem, resulting in market behavior that is not driven by objective quality differences; second, the lemon market can be analyzed not only through objective information asymmetry but also through asymmetries in perceptual resolution or recognition ability.</description>

      <title>Shapley-Guided Utility Learning for Effective Graph Inference Data Valuation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in various graph-based machine learning tasks, yet evaluating the importance of neighbors of testing nodes remains largely unexplored due to the challenge of assessing data importance without test labels. To address this gap, we propose Shapley-Guided Utility Learning (SGUL), a novel framework for graph inference data valuation. SGUL innovatively combines transferable data-specific and modelspecific features to approximate test accuracy without relying on ground truth labels. By incorporating Shapley values as a preprocessing step and using feature Shapley values as input, our method enables direct optimization of Shapley value prediction while reducing computational demands. SGUL overcomes key limitations of existing methods, including poor generalization to unseen test-time structures and indirect optimization. Experiments on diverse graph datasets demonstrate that SGUL consistently outperforms existing baselines in both inductive and transductive settings. SGUL offers an effective, efficient, and interpretable approach for quantifying the value of test-time neighbors.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Finding Local Saddle Points in Two-Player Zero-Sum Black-Box Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Saddle point optimization is a critical problem employed in numerous real-world applications, including portfolio optimization, generative adversarial networks, and robotics. It has been extensively studied in cases where the objective function is known and differentiable. Existing work in black-box settings with unknown objectives that can only be sampled either assumes convexity-concavity in the objective to simplify the problem or operates with noisy gradient estimators. In contrast, we introduce a framework inspired by Bayesian optimization which utilizes Gaussian processes to model the unknown (potentially nonconvex-nonconcave) objective and requires only zeroth-order samples. Our approach frames the saddle point optimization problem as a two-level process which can flexibly integrate existing and novel approaches to this problem. The upper level of our framework produces a model of the objective function by sampling in promising locations, and the lower level of our framework uses the existing model to frame and solve a general-sum game to identify locations to sample. This lower level procedure can be designed in complementary ways, and we demonstrate the flexibility of our approach by introducing variants which appropriately trade off between factors like runtime, the cost of function evaluations, and the number of available initial samples. We experimentally demonstrate these algorithms on synthetic and realistic datasets in black-box nonconvex-nonconcave settings, showcasing their ability to efficiently locate local saddle points in these contexts.</description>

      <title>EconEvals: Benchmarks and Litmus Tests for LLM Agents in Unknown Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop benchmarks for LLM agents that act in, learn from, and strategize in unknown environments, the specifications of which the LLM agent must learn over time from deliberate exploration. Our benchmarks consist of decision-making tasks derived from key problems in economics. To forestall saturation, the benchmark tasks are synthetically generated with scalable difficulty levels. Additionally, we propose litmus tests, a new kind of quantitative measure for LLMs and LLM agents. Unlike benchmarks, litmus tests quantify differences in character, values, and tendencies of LLMs and LLM agents, by considering their behavior when faced with tradeoffs (e.g., efficiency versus equality) where there is no objectively right or wrong behavior. Overall, our benchmarks and litmus tests assess the abilities and tendencies of LLM agents in tackling complex economic problems in diverse settings spanning procurement, scheduling, task allocation, and pricing -- applications that should grow in importance as such agents are further integrated into the economy.</description>

      <title>Preference Restrictions in Computational Social Choice: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.09092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.09092v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Social choice becomes easier on restricted preference domains such as single-peaked, single-crossing, and Euclidean preferences. Many impossibility theorems disappear, the structure makes it easier to reason about preferences, and computational problems can be solved more efficiently. In this survey, we give a thorough overview of many classic and modern restricted preference domains and explore their properties and applications. We do this from the viewpoint of computational social choice, letting computational problems drive our interest, but we include a comprehensive discussion of the economics and social choice literatures as well. Particular focus areas of our survey include algorithms for recognizing whether preferences belong to a particular preference domain, and algorithms for winner determination of voting rules that are hard to compute if preferences are unrestricted.</description>

      <title>When Effort May Fail: Equilibria of Shared Effort with a Threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01513v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: People, robots, and companies mostly divide time and effort between projects, and \defined{shared effort games} model people investing resources in public endeavors and sharing the generated values. In linear $\theta$ sharing (effort) games, a project's value is linear in the total contribution, thus modelling predictable, uniform, and scalable activities. The threshold $\theta$ for effort defines which contributors win and receive their share, equal share modelling standard salaries, equity-minded projects, etc. Thresholds between 0 and 1 model games such as paper co-authorship and shared assignments, where a minimum positive contribution is required for sharing in the value. We constructively characterise the conditions for the existence of a pure equilibrium for $\theta\in\{0,1\}$, and for two-player games with a general threshold, and find the prices of anarchy and stability. We also provide existence and efficiency results for more than two players, and use generalised fictitious play simulations to show when a pure equilibrium exists and what its efficiency is. We propose a novel method for studying solution concepts by defining a new concept and proving its equivalence to a previously known on a large subclass of games. This means that the original concept narrows down to a more demanding concepts on certain games, providing new insights and opening a path to study both concepts conveniently. We also prove mixed equilibria always exist and bound their efficiency.</description>

      <title>Verifying Equilibria in Finite-Horizon Probabilistic Concurrent Game Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14690v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Finite-horizon probabilistic multiagent concurrent game systems, also known as finite multiplayer stochastic games, are a well-studied model in computer science due to their ability to represent a wide range of real-world scenarios involving strategic interactions among agents over a finite amount of iterations (given by the finite-horizon). The analysis of these games typically focuses on evaluating (verifying) and computing (synthesizing/realizing) which strategy profiles (functions that represent the behavior of each agent) qualify as equilibria. The two most prominent equilibrium concepts are the Nash equilibrium and the subgame perfect equilibrium, with the latter considered a conceptual refinement of the former. However, computing these equilibria from scratch is often computationally infeasible. Therefore, recent attention has shifted to the verification problem, where a given strategy profile must be evaluated to determine whether it satisfies equilibrium conditions. In this paper, we demonstrate that the verification problem for subgame perfect equilibria lies in PSPACE, while for Nash equilibria, it is EXPTIME-complete. This is a highly counterintuitive result since subgame perfect equilibria are often seen as a strict strengthening of Nash equilibria and are intuitively seen as more complicated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16781v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a variant of Nim, named StrNim. Whereas a position in Nim is a tuple of non-negative integers, that in StrNim is a string, a sequence of characters. In every turn, each player shrinks the string, by removing a substring repeating the same character. As a first study on this new game, we present some sufficient conditions for the positions to be P-positions.</description>
