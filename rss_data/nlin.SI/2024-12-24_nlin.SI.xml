      <title>Shielding of breathers for the focusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a deterministic gas of breathers for the Focusing Nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation. The gas of breathers is obtained from a $N$-breather solution in the limit $N\to \infty$.\\ The limit is performed at the level of scattering data by letting the $N$-breather spectrum to fill uniformly a suitable compact domain of the complex plane in the limit $N\to\infty$. The corresponding norming constants are interpolated by a smooth function and scaled as $1/N$. For particular choices of the domain and the interpolating function, the gas of breathers behaves as finite breathers solution. This extends the shielding effect discovered in "M. Bertola, T. Grava, and G. Orsatti - Physical Review Letters, 130.12 (2023): 1" for a soliton gas also to a breather gas.</description>

      <title>Spaces of initial conditions for quartic Hamiltonian systems of Painlev\'e and quasi-Painlev\'e type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The geometric approach for Painlev\'e and quasi-Painlev\'e differential equations in the complex plane is applied to non-autonomous Hamiltonian systems, quartic in the dependent variables. By computing their defining manifolds (analogue of the Okamoto's space of initial conditions in the quasi-Painlev\'e case), we provide a classification of such systems. We distinguish the various cases by the possible leading-order behaviour at the movable singularities of the solutions, which are algebraic poles or ordinary poles. The principal cases are categorised by the initial base points of the system in the extended phase space $\mathbb{CP}^2$ and their multiplicities, arising from the coalescence of $4$ simple base points in the generic case. Through a successive degeneration (by setting certain coefficient functions in the Hamiltonian to $0$) and further coalescence of base points, all possible sub-cases of quartic Hamiltonian systems with the quasi-Painlev\'e property are obtained, and are characterised by their corresponding Newton polygons. As particular sub-cases we recover certain systems equivalent to known Painlev\'e equations, or variants thereof.</description>

      <title>Analytic 3D vector non-uniform Fourier crystal optics in arbitrary $\bar{\bar{\varepsilon}}$ dielectric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To find a suitable incubator for nonlinear crystal optics(NCO), we have revisited linear crystal optics(LCO). At the methodological level, three widely used plane wave bases are compared in terms of eigenanalysis in reciprocal space and light field propagation in real space. Inspired by complex ray tracing, we expand M.V. Berry's 2003 uniform plane wave model to non-uniform Fourier crystal optics(FCO) and ultimately derive the explicit form of its 3$\times$2 transition matrix, bridging the two major branches of crystal optics(CO) in reciprocal space, where either ray direction $\hat{k}$ or spatial frequency $\bar{k}_{\mathrm{\rho}}$ serves as the input variable. Using this model, we create the material-matrix tetrahedral compass(M-M TC) to conduct a detailed analysis of how the four fundamental characteristics of materials (linear/circular birefringence/dichroism) influence the eigensystems of the vector electric field in two-dimensional(2D) spatial frequency $\bar{k}_{\mathrm{\rho}}$ domain and its distribution in three-dimensional(3D) $\bar{r}$ space with a crystal-2f system. Along this journey, we have uncovered new territories in LCO in both real and reciprocal space, such as infinite singularities arranged in disk-, ring-, and heart-like shapes, generalized haunting theorem, double conical refraction, and optical knots it induces. We also present our model's early applications in focal engineering and NCO.</description>

      <title>Super volumes and KdV tau functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weil-Petersson volumes of the moduli space of curves are deeply related to the Kontsevich-Witten KdV tau function. They possess a Virasoro symmetry which comes out of recursion relations between the volumes due to Mirzakhani. Similarly, the super Weil-Petersson volumes of the moduli space of super curves with Neveu-Schwarz punctures are related to the Br\'ezin-Gross-Witten (BGW) tau function of the KdV hierarchy and satisfy a recursion due to Stanford and Witten, analogous to Mirzakhani's recursion. In this paper we prove that by also allowing Ramond punctures, the super Weil-Petersson volumes are related to the generalised BGW KdV tau function, which is a one parameter deformation of the BGW tau function. This allows us to prove that these new super volumes also satisfy the Stanford-Witten recursion.</description>

      <title>Narayana numbers in "explicit sufficient invariants for an interacting particle system ( by Itoh, Mallows, and Shepp)"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14777v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider an interacting particle system on star graphs. As in the case of the Kdv equation, we have infinitely many invariants ( here, martingale invariants). It enables us to obtain the limiting distribution of the Markov chain. Each of the martingale invariants is a homogeneous polynomial with coefficients of Narayana numbers.The identity for the enumeration of plane unlabeled trees, which gives Narayana numbers, becomes the key identity to obtain the probability of death states by a change of variables.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07537v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We review applications of factorization methods to the problem of finding stationary point vortex patterns in two-dimensional fluid mechanics. Then we present a new class of patterns related to periodic analogs of Schrodinger operators from the ``even" bi-spectral family. We also show that patterns related to rational and soliton solutions of the KdV hierarchy constitute complete solution of the problem for certain classes of vortex systems.</description>

      <title>Solutions of Tetrahedron Equation from Quantum Cluster Algebra Associated with Symmetric Butterfly Quiver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08814v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a new solution to the tetrahedron equation by further pursuing the quantum cluster algebra approach in our previous works. The key ingredients include a symmetric butterfly quiver attached to the wiring diagrams for the longest element of type $A$ Weyl groups and the implementation of quantum $Y$-variables through the $q$-Weyl algebra. The solution consists of four products of quantum dilogarithms. By exploring both the coordinate and momentum representations, along with their modular double counterparts, our solution encompasses various known three-dimensional (3D) $R$-matrices. These include those obtained by Kapranov-Voevodsky (1994) utilizing the quantized coordinate ring, Bazhanov-Mangazeev-Sergeev (2010) from a quantum geometry perspective, Kuniba-Matsuike-Yoneyama (2023) linked with the quantized six-vertex model, and Inoue-Kuniba-Terashima (2023) associated with the Fock-Goncharov quiver. The 3D $R$-matrix presented in this paper offers a unified perspective on these existing solutions, coalescing them within the framework of quantum cluster algebra.</description>

      <title>Orthosymplectic $R$-matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16720v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a formula for trigonometric orthosymplectic $R$-matrices associated with any parity sequence, and establish their factorization into the ordered product of $q$-exponents parametrized by positive roots in the corresponding reduced root systems. The latter is crucially based on the construction of orthogonal bases of the positive subalgebra through $q$-bracketings and combinatorics of dominant Lyndon words, as developed in [Clark, Hill, Wang, "Quantum shuffles and quantum supergroups of basic type", Quantum Topol. 7 (2016), no.3, 553-638]. We further evaluate the affine orthosymplectic $R$-matrices, establishing their intertwining property as well as matching them with those obtained through the Yang-Baxterization technique of [Ge, Wu, Xue, "Explicit trigonometric Yang-Baxterization", Internat. J. Modern Phys. A 6 (1991), no.21, 3735-3779]. This reproduces the celebrated formulas of [Jimbo, "Quantum $R$ matrix for the generalized Toda system", Comm. Math. Phys. 102 (1986), no.4, 537-547] for classical BCD types and the formula of [Mehta, Dancer, Gould, Links, "Generalized Perk-Schultz models: solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation associated with quantized orthosymplectic superalgebras", J. Phys. A 39 (2006), no.1, 17-26] for the standard parity sequence.</description>

      <title>Global Well-Posedness and Soliton Resolution for the Half-Wave Maps Equation with Rational Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03351v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the energy-critical half-wave maps equation: \[ \partial_t \mathbf{u} = \mathbf{u} \times |D| \mathbf{u} \] for $\mathbf{u} : [0, T) \times \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{S}^2$. Our main result establishes the global existence and uniqueness of solutions for all rational initial data $\mathbf{u}_0 : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{S}^2$. This demonstrates global well-posedness for a dense subset within the scaling-critical energy space $\dot{H}^{1/2}(\mathbb{R}; \mathbb{S}^2)$. Furthermore, we prove soliton resolution for a dense subset of initial data in the energy space, with uniform bounds for all higher Sobolev norms $\dot{H}^s$ for $s &gt; 0$.
  Our analysis utilizes the Lax pair structure of the half-wave maps equation on Hardy spaces in combination with an explicit flow formula. Extending these results, we establish global well-posedness for rational initial data (along with a soliton resolution result) for a generalized class of matrix-valued half-wave maps equations with target spaces in the complex Grassmannians $\mathbf{Gr}_k(\mathbb{C}^d)$. Notably, this includes the complex projective spaces $ \mathbb{CP}^{d-1} \cong \mathbf{Gr}_1(\mathbb{C}^d)$ thereby extending the classical case of the target $\mathbb{S}^2 \cong \mathbb{CP}^1$.</description>
