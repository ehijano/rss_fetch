      <title>CO$_2$ collision-induced line parameters for the $\nu_3$ band of $^{12}$CH$_4$ measured using a hard-collision speed-dependent line shape and the relaxation matrix formalism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ten high resolution Fourier transform spectra of the pentad region near 3.3 {\mu}m of methane diluted in carbon dioxide at total pressures up to 800 hPa have been recorded at 296.5(5) K. Including a high resolution spectrum of pure methane at low pressure, these spectra have been analyzed using multi-spectrum fitting techniques. The methane lines were modeled using hard-collision speed-dependent line profiles and line mixing was included in the strongest absorption regions, considering the first order Rosenkranz approximation and the relaxation matrix formalism. CO$_2$ broadening and shift coefficients have been measured, together with the speed dependence of broadening. Results obtained using the two line mixing models are intercompared and compared with previous work.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the Rankine attraction term in an equation-of-state based on the London dispersion force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The attraction term in an equation of state for gases, $-a c^2$, proposed by Rankine in 1854, is generally related to the London dispersion force via a calculation of the second virial coefficient, $B_2$, by an equation $B_2 = 2\pi N_0 \int_0^\infty \left(1- \exp \left(\omega / kT\right)\right) r^2 \text{d}r$, where $\omega$ is the potential of the attraction between two molecules in the gas. Here we present an alternative approach that does not use this equation, and does not a-priori assume that the function is quadratic in concentration, $c$. Still, the quadratic dependence on concentration is also found. We analyze a gas consisting of argon at temperatures between 200 and 700 K. From the numerical calculations, we derive that the attraction parameter depends on temperature according to a -1/6 power scaling, and thus the attraction component to the second virial coefficient, $B_2$, scales with a -7/6 power to temperature. For the same conditions, the virial equation presented above results in a square root scaling of $B_2$ with temperature, which is less accurate.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Electrodynamical Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory Description of Molecules Interacting with Light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study light-mediated interactions between spatially separated molecules using real-time quantum electrodynamical time-dependent density functional theory based on the Pauli-Fierz Hamiltonian. An ultrashort delta-kick excitation selectively perturbs a single molecule, while a second, distant molecule remains initially unexcited. In free space, the excitation stays localized and no response is observed in the second molecule. In contrast, when both molecules are coupled to the same cavity mode, the initial excitation induces coherent dynamics in the distant molecule through the shared quantized electromagnetic field.</description>

      <title>Regularity Priors for the Linear Atomic Cluster Expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine-learned interatomic potentials enable large systems to be simulated for long time scales at near ab-initio accuracy. This accuracy is achieved by fitting extremely flexible model architectures to high quality reference data. In practice, this flexibility can cause unwanted behavior such as jagged predicted potential energy surfaces and generally poor out-of-distribution behavior. We investigate a general strategy for incorporating prior beliefs on the regularity of the target energy into linear ACE models and explore to what extent this approach improves the quality of the fitted models. Our main focus is an over-regularisation that replicates the Gaussian broadening used in SOAP descriptors within the ACE framework.</description>

      <title>Elementary excitations in dilute gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In solids, elementary excitations of atomic vibrations are identified in reciprocal space by their frequency and wavevector as phonons. At the opposite end of the matter spectrum, dynamics of dilute gases is conventionally described in terms of atomic or molecular collisions and translations in real space and time. These two formalisms are apparently incompatible, leading to difficulties in understanding atomic dynamics in intermediate matter. In this work, we demonstrate that normal modes, often synonymously considered as phonons in solids, provide a microscopic description of various transport processes, including thermal conductivity, diffusion coefficient, and shear viscosity, in a prototypical dilute gas, argon. Our results reveal that normal modes constitute elementary excitations in dilute gases, extending their physical relevance far beyond vibrational excitations in solids.</description>

      <title>New water oxidation mechanism in Photosystem II resolves major experimental controversies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Light driven oxygen formation in Photosystem II protein is a fundamental process that sustains our biosphere and serves as a blue print to future clean energy solutions due to its high energy conversion efficiency. Last decade of intense research by advanced physical techniques delivered new insights on the structure and function of the Mn4CaO5 cluster a center of the oxygen evolving complex (OEC). However, discrepancies in experimental observations and computational models persist impeding the understanding of the O-O bond formation and the role of the protein environment in the process. Here we show that i) assignment of the OEC unique oxygen O3 ligated by histidine (His337) via dynamic H-bond as a slow exchanging substrate and ii) its coupling with O6 oxygen generated at Mn1 in the S2 to S3 transition give the O-O bond formation mechanism most consistent with all currently available experimental data. Proposal shows how protein environment can steer the O-O bond formation by charge control via H-bond and open coordination of Mn1. Obtained O3-O6 peroxide is at lower energy than peroxides in the most studied O5-O6 bond formation pathway. His337 appears to be similar to distal His in globins used for management of the O2 and H2O2 intermediates. The new mechanism breaks the prior impasse and will undoubtedly invigorate future detailed studies uncovering its further details.</description>

      <title>High-Resolution Electron Paramagnetic Resonance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) is a valuable tool for physics, chemistry, biology and medicine, providing complementary spectroscopic information to NMR. It has long been known that EPR at high magnetic fields offers greater spectral resolution, but limitations in the THz instrumentation have prevented the full realization of these opportunities. Here we describe an EPR spectrometer at the high magnetic field of 14 T using 396 GHz excitation, which adapts techniques from liquid-state NMR to obtain sharp EPR resonances with a width of 210 ppb (full-width half-maximum). We use this to measure resonance positions, and hence g-factors, with a precision that reaches $\pm$16 ppb. Our use of in-situ liquid-state NMR of our solvent within the same sample improves the accuracy of these measurements: it allows us to reference our EPR measurement back to dilute gas 3He NMR for which quantum calculations are accurate. We measure the g-factor of N@C60 in deuterated toluene as g = 2.002 099 09 (3), where the 3 in brackets means that the uncertainty on the last digit is $\pm$3.</description>

      <title>Ionic transport in spontaneously ion-intercalated van der Waals layered structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding ionic transport under strong confinement is crucial for the design of next-generation energy, catalytic, and information-processing materials; however, repeated field-driven ion motion often degrades conventional solid electrolytes. Van der Waals layered materials offer an alternative by providing structurally resilient ion-transport channels, yet the microscopic origins of their nonequilibrium transport behavior remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate field-driven ionic conduction in sodium-intercalated layered MnO$_2$ as a model self-intercalated van der Waals solid, using all-atom nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations that explicitly capture ion-water correlations and layer morphology. We demonstrate that ionic conductivity depends nonlinearly on the applied electric field, interlayer spacing, water content, and lattice flexibility. The applied electric field induces spatial segregation of water coupled to distortions of the MnO$_2$ sheets, producing coexisting regions populated by highly hydrated and weakly hydrated ions with suppressed conductivity. Concurrently, ionic transport exhibits a nonmonotonic dependence on the total amount of intercalated water, with boundary domains of weakly hydrated ions displaying relatively higher mobility. In fluctuation-free layers, ion transport transitions from single-particle motion to a collective conduction regime characterized by elongated, same-charge ionic clusters that violate Nernst-Einstein behavior. Together, these findings provide a molecular-level mechanism linking confinement-induced electrostatic correlations and structural response to the emergent nonlinear transport observed experimentally in ion-intercalated MnO$_2$, and suggest general design principles for robust, water-assisted ionic conductors.</description>

Abstract: We compute quasi-exact \emph{ab initio} path-integral Monte Carlo results for the Matsubara Green's function of the uniform electron gas (UEG) at finite temperature over a broad range of coupling strengths ($r_s=1,\dots,10)$. This allows us to present approximation-free results for the static self-energy $\Sigma_\infty(p)$ and spectral function $A(p,\omega)$, and to benchmark previous approximate results for the UEG. In addition, our work opens up intriguing avenues to study the single-particle spectrum and density of states of real warm dense matter systems based on truly first principles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.15253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present QDK/Chemistry, a software toolkit for quantum chemistry workflows targeting quantum computers. The toolkit addresses a key challenge in the field: while quantum algorithms for chemistry have matured considerably, the infrastructure connecting classical electronic structure calculations to quantum circuit execution remains fragmented. QDK/Chemistry provides this infrastructure through a modular architecture that separates data representations from computational methods, enabling researchers to compose workflows from interchangeable components. In addition to providing native implementations of targeted algorithms in the quantum-classical pipeline, the toolkit builds upon and integrates with widely used open-source quantum chemistry packages and quantum computing frameworks through a plugin system, allowing users to combine methods from different sources without modifying workflow logic. This paper describes the design philosophy, current capabilities, and role of QDK/Chemistry as a foundation for reproducible quantum chemistry experiments.</description>

      <title>Nodal error behind discrepancies between coupled cluster and diffusion Monte Carlo in hydrogen-bonded systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17937v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The small magnitude and long-range character of non-covalent interactions pose a significant challenge for computational quantum chemical and electronic-structure methods alike. State-of-the-art coupled cluster (CC) theory and benchmark-grade diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) are ideally positioned to tackle these problems, but concerning differences between both methods have been reported in numerous studies of the interaction energy of non-covalently bound dimers. Given that the basic theoretical frameworks underpinning both methods are exact in principle, the error must arise from one or several of the approximations required to make the calculations computationally tractable. Here, we carry out a rigorous and systematic examination of the effect of each of these approximations using the acetic acid dimer and water-peptide systems as convenient testing grounds. Thanks to the use of stringently optimized backflow wave functions we are able to find that the significant discrepancies are dominated by the fixed-node error incurred by the Slater-Jastrow DMC result, while errors in the CC calculations do not significantly alter the result. This finding, likely applicable to other hydrogen-bonded systems, helps establish that CC should be regarded as the benchmark for these systems, and can potentially guide the search for pragmatic solutions to the fixed-node problem in the future.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast electron diffractive imaging of the dissociation of pre-excited molecules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13479v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gas phase ultrafast electron diffraction (GUED) has become a powerful technique to directly observe the structural dynamics of photoexcited molecules. GUED reveals information about the nuclear motions that is complementary to the information on the electronic states provided by spectroscopic measurements. GUED experiments so far have utilized a single laser pulse to excite the molecules and an electron pulse to probe the dynamics. This limits the excited states which can be studied to only those that can be reached by absorption of a photon from the ground state or in some cases simultaneous absorption of multiple photons. A broader class of experiments and dynamics can be accessed using two time-delayed laser pulses to access unexplored regions of the potential energy surfaces. As a proof-of-principle experiment using a double excitation, we studied the photodissociation of trifluoroiodomethane molecules that are pre-excited with an infrared (800 nm) femtosecond laser pulse before photo-dissociation is triggered with an ultraviolet (266 nm) femtosecond laser pulse. We have observed significant differences in the dissociation dynamics, with pre-excitation resulting in a slower dissociation process. This new capability can offer new insights on the evolution of nuclear wavepackets in regions of the excited potential energy surface which are inaccessible in single photon excitation. We present a methodology to carry out the measurement, analyze and interpret the data that could be applied to a broad class of experiments.</description>

      <title>A Non Linear Spectral Graph Neural Network Simulator for More Stable and Accurate Rollouts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.05860v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are a central tool in science and engineering enabling the study of dynamical behavior and the link between microscopic structure and macroscopic function. Their high computational cost, however, has motivated extensive efforts to develop accelerated alternatives. A promising approach is the use of machine-learning-based simulators that allow for substantially larger time steps than conventional MD. Among these, graph neural network (GNN)-based methods have been found to be especially attractive given that they naturally encode the inductive bias of interacting particle systems, however current architectures remain limited in accuracy and stability. In particular, standard message-passing schemes struggle to efficiently propagate long-range information. Here, we investigate whether spectral-GNN simulators can overcome these limitations by explicitly representing a simulated system in a global eigenmode basis, and therefore better capture long-range and collective behavior. Focusing on disordered elastic networks, model systems for complex materials and biological structures such as proteins, we compare spatial, linear spectral, and nonlinear spectral GNN architectures. We find that while spectral representations alone are not sufficient, nonlinear spectral models substantially outperform alternatives. By learning both the time-dependent dynamics and the mixing of eigenmodes, these models more accurately capture the system's slow, global modes, which dominate macroscopic behavior. This leads to a marked reduction in systematic particle-position error and significantly improved prediction of global physical properties.</description>

      <title>Inferring intermediate states by leveraging the many-body Arrhenius law</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18574v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Metastable states appear as long-lived intermediate states in various natural transport phenomena which are governed by energy landscapes. As such, these intermediate metastable states dominate the system's dynamics at coarse grained times. Moreover, they can strongly influence the overall pathways through which the energy landscape is explored. Thus, quantifying these metastabilities is crucial for uncovering the key details of the underlying landscape. Here, we introduce a robust method based on a generalized many-body Arrhenius law to identify metastable states in escape problems involving interacting particles with excluded volume. Experimental platforms such as colloidal transport or macromolecular translocation through biological pores can offer promising settings to validate our predictions.</description>

Abstract: A disordered quasi-liquid layer of water is thought to cover the ice surface, but many issues, such as its onset temperature, its thickness, or its actual relation to bulk liquid water have been a matter of unsettled controversy for more than a century. In this perspective article, current computer simulations and experimental results are discussed under the light of a suitable theoretical framework. It is found that using a combination of wetting physics, the theory of intermolecular forces, statistical mechanics and out of equilibrium physics a large number of conflicting results can be reconciled and collected into a consistent description of the ice surface. This helps understand the crucial role of surface properties in a range of important applications, from the enigmatic structure of snow crystals to the slipperiness of ice.</description>
