      <title>Supervisory Control of a Flexible Manufacturing Unit for the Production of Two Products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this diploma thesis, the mathematical model of a multi-product manufacturing unit will be presented. The unit consists of a set of three conveyors, a robot, a lathe, a milling machine, an assembly machine, and a painting machine. Finally, the connection of the above elements is carried out via one slot buffer. The products can be divided into two distinct sets according to the route they will follow through the machines of the unit. The mathematical models of the individual subsystems of the plant using finite deterministic automata will be presented. The two different routes that the products can follow will be presented. The desired product flow will be presented in the form of desired regular languages. The properties of the desired languages with respect the overall automaton of the system will be investigated. A supervisory architecture will be designed based on the desired regular languages.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Language Theory with Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12569v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Regular languages -- the languages accepted by deterministic finite automata -- are known to be precisely the languages recognized by finite monoids. This characterization is the origin of algebraic language theory. In this paper, we generalize the correspondence between automata and monoids to automata with generic computational effects given by a monad, providing the foundations of an effectful algebraic language theory. We show that, under suitable conditions on the monad, a language is computable by an effectful automaton precisely when it is recognizable by (1) an effectful monoid morphism into an effect-free finite monoid, and (2) a monoid morphism into a monad-monoid bialgebra whose carrier is a finitely generated algebra for the monad, the former mode of recognition being conceptually completely new. Our prime application is a novel algebraic approach to languages computed by probabilistic finite automata. Additionally, we derive new algebraic characterizations for nondeterministic probabilistic finite automata and for weighted finite automata over unrestricted semirings, generalizing previous results on weighted algebraic recognition over commutative rings.</description>

      <title>Graph and wreath products of cellular automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.10186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.10186v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the set of subgroups of the automorphism group of a two-sided full shift is closed under countable graph products. We introduce the notion of a group action without $A$-cancellation (for an abelian group $A$), and show that when $A$ is a finite abelian group and $G$ is a group of cellular automata whose action does not have $A$-cancellation, the wreath product $A \wr G$ embeds in the automorphism group of a full shift. We show that all free abelian groups and free groups admit such cellular automata actions. In the one-sided case, we prove variants of these results with reasonable alphabet blow-ups.</description>

      <title>A note on the power sums of the number of Fibonacci partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12724v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For every nonnegative integer $n$, let $r_F(n)$ be the number of ways to write $n$ as a sum of Fibonacci numbers, where the order of the summands does not matter. Moreover, for all positive integers $p$ and $N$, let \begin{equation*} S_{F}^{(p)}(N) := \sum_{n = 0}^{N - 1} \big(r_F(n)\big)^p . \end{equation*} Chow, Jones, and Slattery determined the order of growth of $S_{F}^{(p)}(N)$ for $p \in \{1,2\}$. We prove that, for all positive integers $p$, there exists a real number $\lambda_p &gt; 1$ such that \begin{equation*} S^{(p)}_F(N) \asymp_p N^{(\log \lambda_p) /\!\log \varphi} \end{equation*} as $N \to +\infty$, where $\varphi := (1 + \sqrt{5})/2$ is the golden ratio. Furthermore, we show that \begin{equation*} \lim_{p \to +\infty} \lambda_p^{1/p} = \varphi^{1/2} . \end{equation*} Our proofs employ automata theory and a result on the generalized spectral radius due to Blondel and Nesterov.</description>
