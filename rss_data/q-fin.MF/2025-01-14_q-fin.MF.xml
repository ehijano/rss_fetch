      <title>Sequential Portfolio Selection under Latent Side Information-Dependence Structure: Optimality and Universal Learning Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the investment problem of constructing an optimal no-short sequential portfolio strategy in a market with a latent dependence structure between asset prices and partly unobservable side information, which is often high-dimensional. The results demonstrate that a dynamic strategy, which forms a portfolio based on perfect knowledge of the dependence structure and full market information over time, may not grow at a higher rate infinitely often than a constant strategy, which remains invariant over time. Specifically, if the market is stationary, implying that the dependence structure is statistically stable, the growth rate of an optimal dynamic strategy, utilizing the maximum capacity of the entire market information, almost surely decays over time into an equilibrium state, asymptotically converging to the growth rate of a constant strategy.
  Technically, this work reassesses the common belief that a constant strategy only attains the optimal limiting growth rate of dynamic strategies when the market process is identically and independently distributed. By analyzing the dynamic log-optimal portfolio strategy as the optimal benchmark in a stationary market with side information, we show that a random optimal constant strategy almost surely exists, even when a limiting growth rate for the dynamic strategy does not. Consequently, two approaches to learning algorithms for portfolio construction are discussed, demonstrating the safety of removing side information from the learning process while still guaranteeing an asymptotic growth rate comparable to that of the optimal dynamic strategy.</description>

      <title>Pricing American options under rough volatility using deep-signatures and signature-kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the signature-based primal and dual solutions to the optimal stopping problem recently introduced in [Bayer et al.: Primal and dual optimal stopping with signatures, to appear in Finance &amp; Stochastics 2025], by integrating deep-signature and signature-kernel learning methodologies. These approaches are designed for non-Markovian frameworks, in particular enabling the pricing of American options under rough volatility. We demonstrate and compare the performance within the popular rough Heston and rough Bergomi models.</description>

      <title>How low-cost AI universal approximators reshape market efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The efficient market hypothesis (EMH) famously stated that prices fully reflect the information available to traders. This critically depends on the transfer of information into prices through trading strategies. Traders optimise their strategy with models of increasing complexity that identify the relationship between information and profitable trades more and more accurately. Under specific conditions, the increased availability of low-cost universal approximators, such as AI systems, should be naturally pushing towards more advanced trading strategies, potentially making it harder and harder for inefficient traders to profit. In this paper, we leverage on a generalised notion of market efficiency, based on the definition of an equilibrium price process, that allows us to distinguish different levels of model complexity through investors' beliefs, and trading strategies optimisation, and discuss the relationship between AI-powered trading and the time-evolution of market efficiency. Finally, we outline the need for and the challenge of describing out-of-equilibrium market dynamics in an adaptive multi-agent environment.</description>

      <title>Discrete-time weak approximation of a Black-Scholes model with drift and volatility Markov switching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a continuous-time financial market with an asset whose price is modeled by a linear stochastic differential equation with drift and volatility switching driven by a uniformly ergodic jump Markov process with a countable state space (in fact, this is a Black-Scholes model with Markov switching). We construct a multiplicative scheme of series of discrete-time markets with discrete-time Markov switching. First, we establish that the discrete-time switching Markov chains weakly converge to the limit continuous-time Markov process. Second, having this in hand, we apply conditioning on Markov chains and prove that the discrete-time market models themselves weakly converge to the Black-Scholes model with Markov switching. The convergence is proved under very general assumptions both on the discrete-time net profits and on a generator of a continuous-time Markov switching process.</description>

      <title>Follow the Leader: Enhancing Systematic Trend-Following Using Network Momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic, trend-following strategy, applied to commodity futures markets, that combines univariate trend indicators with cross-sectional trend indicators that capture so-called {\em momentum spillover}, which can occur when there is a lead-lag relationship between the trending behaviour of different markets. Our strategy utilises two methods for detecting lead-lag relationships, with a method for computing {\em network momentum}, to produce a novel trend-following indicator. We use our new trend indicator to construct a portfolio whose performance we compare to a baseline model which uses only univariate indicators, and demonstrate statistically significant improvements in Sharpe ratio, skewness of returns, and downside performance, using synthetic bootstrapped data samples taken from time-series of actual prices.</description>

      <title>Optimal Consumption--Investment Problems under Time-Varying Incomplete Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00266v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main objective of this paper is to develop a martingale-type solution to optimal consumption--investment choice problems ([Merton, 1969] and [Merton, 1971]) under time-varying incomplete preferences driven by externalities such as patience, socialization effects, and market volatility. The market is composed of multiple risky assets and multiple consumption goods, while in addition there are multiple fluctuating preference parameters with inexact values connected to imprecise tastes. Utility maximization is a multi-criteria problem with possibly function-valued criteria. To come up with a complete characterization of the solutions, first we motivate and introduce a set-valued stochastic process for the dynamics of multi-utility indices and formulate the optimization problem in a topological vector space. Then, we modify a classical scalarization method allowing for infiniteness and randomness in dimensions and prove results of equivalence to the original problem. Illustrative examples are given to demonstrate practical interests and method applicability progressively. The link between the original problem and a dual problem is also discussed, relatively briefly. Finally, using Malliavin calculus with stochastic geometry, we find optimal investment policies to be generally set-valued, each of whose selectors admits a four-way decomposition involving an additional indecisiveness risk-hedging portfolio. Our results touch on new directions for optimal consumption--investment choices in the presence of incomparability and time inconsistency, also signaling potentially testable assumptions on the variability of asset prices. Simulation techniques for set-valued processes are studied for how solved optimal policies can be computed in practice.</description>

      <title>A Mean-Field Game of Market Entry: Portfolio Liquidation with Trading Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10441v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider both $N$-player and mean-field games of optimal portfolio liquidation in which the players are not allowed to change the direction of trading. Players with an initially short position of stocks are only allowed to buy while players with an initially long position are only allowed to sell the stock. Under suitable conditions on the model parameters we show that the games are equivalent to games of timing where the players need to determine the optimal times of market entry and exit. We identify the equilibrium entry and exit times and prove that equilibrium mean-trading rates can be characterized in terms of the solutions to a highly non-linear higher-order integral equation with endogenous terminal condition. We prove the existence of a unique solution to the integral equation from which we obtain the existence of a unique equilibrium both in the mean-field and the $N$-player game.</description>

      <title>Pontryagin-Guided Policy Optimization for Merton's Portfolio Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13101v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a Pontryagin-Guided Direct Policy Optimization (PG-DPO) framework for Merton's portfolio problem, unifying modern neural-network-based policy parameterization with the adjoint viewpoint from Pontryagin's maximum principle (PMP). Instead of approximating the value function (as done in deep BSDE methods), we track a policy-fixed BSDE for the adjoint processes, which allows each gradient update to align with continuous-time PMP conditions. This setup yields locally optimal consumption and investment policies that are closely tied to classical stochastic control. We further incorporate an alignment penalty that nudges the learned policy toward Pontryagin-derived solutions, enhancing both convergence speed and training stability. Numerical experiments confirm that PG-DPO effectively handles both consumption and investment, achieving strong performance and interpretability without requiring large offline datasets or model-free reinforcement learning.</description>
