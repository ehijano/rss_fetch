      <title>Regular Grammars for Graph Sets of Tree-Width $\leq2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Regular and context-free languages form a central pillar of formal language theory. This is because a variety of formalisms are known that define these classes of languages. For example, we have that finite automata, monoids, algebraic recognizability, regular expressions, regular grammars, monadic-second order logic, etc., can be used to represent regular word languages. However, the situation is less clear for formal languages over graphs, and open problems persist. This is because generalizing notions from words to graphs has been more successful for some of the cited formalisms than for the other ones. Bruno Courcelle has introduced hyper-edge replacement (\hr) algebras for generalizing the notion of context-free languages from words to graphs. At the same time, \hr-algebras support the generalization of algebraic recognizability from words to graphs, a notion that has been proven to be equivalent to definability in (counting) monadic-second order logic (\cmso) over graphs of bounded tree-width. In this paper, we deal with generalizing regular word grammars to graphs. We propose regular grammars for (unordered and unranked) trees, series-parallel graphs, and graphs of tree-width $\le 2$, where the qualifier regular is justified because these grammars define exactly the recognizable resp. \cmso-definable subsets of the respective graph classes.</description>

      <title>A Session Type System for Asynchronous Unreliable Broadcast Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.01353</link>
      <description>arXiv:1902.01353v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Session types are formal specifications of communication protocols, allowing protocol implementations to be verified by typechecking. Up to now, session type disciplines have assumed that the communication medium is reliable, with no loss of messages. However, unreliable broadcast communication is common in a wide class of distributed systems such as ad-hoc and wireless sensor networks. Often such systems have structured communication patterns that should be amenable to analysis by means of session types, but the necessary theory has not previously been developed. We introduce the Unreliable Broadcast Session Calculus, a process calculus with unreliable broadcast communication, and equip it with a session type system that we show is sound. We capture two common operations, broadcast and gather, inhabiting dual session types. Message loss may lead to non-synchronised session endpoints. To further account for unreliability we provide with an autonomous recovery mechanism that does not require acknowledgements from session participants. Our type system ensures soundness, safety, and progress between the synchronised endpoints within a session. We demonstrate the expressiveness of our framework by implementing Paxos, the textbook protocol for reaching consensus in an unreliable, asynchronous network.</description>
