      <title>Search for exotic Higgs boson decays H $\to$ $\mathcal{AA}$ with $\mathcal{AA}$ $\to$ $\gamma\gamma$ in events with a semi-merged topology in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A search for exotic Higgs boson decays H $\to$ $\mathcal{AA}$, with $\mathcal{A}$ $\to$ $\gamma\gamma$ is presented, using events with a semi-merged topology. One of the hypothetical particles, $\mathcal{A}$, is assumed to decay promptly into a semi-merged diphoton system reconstructed as a single photon-like object, while the other $\mathcal{A}$ decays into two resolved photons. The search is performed using proton-proton collision data collected by the CMS experiment at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 138 fb$^{-1}$. The data agree with the standard model background expectation. Upper limits are set on the product of the Higgs boson production cross section and the branching fraction, $\sigma$(pp $\to$ H)$\mathcal{B}$(H $\to$ $\mathcal{AA}$ $\to$ 4$\gamma$), which range from 0.264 to 0.005 pb at 95% confidence level, for $\mathcal{A}$ masses in the range 1 $\lt$ $m_\mathcal{A}$ $\lt$ 15 GeV. These limits are the most stringent to date in the 1$-$5 GeV $m_\mathcal{A}$ range.</description>

      <title>Improved liquid argon ionization model and its impact on the DarkSide low-mass WIMP search programme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: DarkSide-50 achieved leading WIMP limits down to 1.2 GeV/c2 with an ionization-only analysis, despite its small active mass of 46 kg compared to multi-ton noble-liquid detectors. Accurate modelling of the nuclear-recoil ionization yield (Qy) is central to interpreting such searches. A new global fit combining nuclear-recoil response measurements from DarkSide-50, ARIS, SCENE, and the recent ReD experiment constrains Qy between 0.4 and 150 keV within the Thomas-Imel box framework. The dependence on screening potentials is addressed through a Bayesian model comparison, which rejects the ZBL and Moli\`ere functions and strongly favours the Lenz-Jensen one. The resulting model improves DarkSide-50 sensitivity below 3 GeV/c2 and refines the DarkSide-20k sensitivity accordingly.</description>

      <title>GPT-like transformer model for silicon tracking detector simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulating physics processes and detector responses is essential in high energy physics and represents significant computing costs. Generative machine learning has been demonstrated to be potentially powerful in accelerating simulations, outperforming traditional fast simulation methods. The efforts have focused primarily on calorimeters. This work presents the very first studies on using neural networks for silicon tracking detectors simulation. The GPT-like transformer architecture is determined to be optimal for this task and applied in a fully generative way, ensuring full correlations between individual hits. Taking parallels from text generation, hits are represented as a flat sequence of feature values. The resulting tracking performance, evaluated on the Open Data Detector, is comparable with the full simulation.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Hadronic Models in Geant4 for Detector Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The construction of modern detectors used in high-energy physics experiments is typically guided by modeling with the Geant4 toolkit to evaluate detector performance in terms of geometrical acceptance and detection efficiency. Several hadronic models are available in Geant4 for modeling nuclear reactions induced by fast nucleons. It is shown that they result in different multiplicity and charge distributions of secondary particles and nuclear fragments. The impact of these differences on modeling the Highly-Granular Neutron Detector (HGND) prototype for the BM@N experiment at Nuclotron-based Ion Collider fAcility (NICA) is evaluated.</description>

      <title>Can the FCC-hh prove the B-L gauge symmetry?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a phenomenological study of the discovery potential at the FCC-hh for a new heavy neutral vector boson, Z', predicted by the $U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge symmetry. Focusing on the parameter space currently not excluded by Large Hadron Collider data, we analyze the dilepton production channel $p p \rightarrow Z^{\prime} \rightarrow l^{+} l^{-}$ ($l^{\pm} = e^{\pm}, \mu^{\pm}$) at a center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s} = 100$ TeV. Full Monte Carlo simulations was performed for different ($M_{Z'}$, $g_{B-L}$) BSM scenarios and relevant Standard Model backgrounds (including irreducible Drell-Yan, diboson, single top-quark and top-quark pair productions) identifying optimal kinematic and angular selection cuts to guide future searches for this type resonance. We estimate the FCC-hh reach for an integrated luminosity of $\mathcal{L}_{int}$ = 3~$ab^{-1}$. Our results demonstrate that the FCC-hh can exclude Z' masses up to $\sim 40$ TeV with 95\% C.L. for couplings of $g_{B-L} \sim 1$, and up to $\sim 15$ TeV for $g_{B-L} \sim 0.1$. We find the kinematic and angular cuts that optimize the signal over background ratio and achieve a $5\sigma$ signal up to Z' masses of $\sim 30$ TeV. These findings highlight the FCC-hh potential to uncover new physics signals in the high-mass regime.</description>

      <title>Search for a Doubly Charged Scalar at the LHC and FCC-hh</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Doubly charged scalars frequently emerge in many well-motivated extensions of the Standard Model, particularly in frameworks that aim to explain the origin of neutrino masses. Their distinct electric charge and clean leptonic signatures make them especially compelling from the standpoint of experimental searches. In this work, we explore the sensitivity of the LHC full run II, including photon-photon fusion, and Future Circular Collider in its hadron-hadron configuration (FCC-hh) to such states, assuming they decay promptly and exclusively into charged leptons either conserving or violating lepton flavor. We find that the FCC-hh, operating at 100 TeV, is uniquely positioned to probe doubly charged scalars with masses up to 7 TeV and possibly establish the mechanism behind neutrino masses.</description>

      <title>Light-tight skipper-CCDs for X-ray detection in space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Skipper Charge-Coupled Devices (skipper-CCDs) are pixelated silicon detectors with deep sub-electron resolution. Their radiation hardness and capability to reconstruct energy deposits with unprecedented precision make them a promising technology for space-based X-ray astronomy. In this scenario, optical and near-infrared photons may saturate the sensor, distorting the reconstructed signal. We present a light-tight shield for skipper-CCDs to suppress optical backgrounds while preserving X-ray detection efficiency. We deposited thin aluminum layers on the CCD surface using an e-beam evaporator and evaluated their blinding performance across wavelengths from 650 to 1000 nm using a monochromator, as well as the X-ray transmission using an $^{55}$Fe source. We find that 50 and 100\,nm layers provide &gt;99.6\% light suppression, with no efficiency loss for 5.9 and 6.4\,keV X-rays. In addition, we used Geant4 simulations to extend these results to a broader energy range and quantify the efficiency loss for different aluminum thicknesses. Results show that thin aluminum coatings are an effective, low-cost solution for optical suppression in skipper-CCDs intended for X-ray detection and space instrumentation.</description>

      <title>KATRIN experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the discovery of neutrino oscillations, it is known that neutrinos have small but non-zero masses. The neutrino mass scale, which is of fundamental importance for cosmology, astrophysics and particle physics, can be measured directly from the kinematics of weak decays. The Karlsruhe tritium neutrino experiment KATRIN measures the end point region of the tritium \b{eta}-spectrum with unrivalled t statistics and an unprecedented precision. This world-leading direct neutrino mass search experiment is characterised by a windowless, gaseous molecular tritium source and a giant MAC- E filter-type spectrometer. The precision measurement of the tritium \b{eta}-spectrum also allows the search for many other phenomena beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. The KATRIN experiment is about to reach its target sensitivity of the neutrino mass of less than 300 meV and will then turn its attention to the search for sterile keV neutrinos before the neutrino mass sensitivity is to be significantly increased once again by applying quantum read-out technology combined with an atomic tritium source with KATRIN++.</description>

      <title>Seesaw-I and II Hybrid $T^{\prime}$ Symmetric Neutrino Masses with Mass Selection Rule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The present manuscript studies a recently proposed new neutrino mixing scheme with a neutrino mass selection rule, $m_{\nu}^{13} + m_{\nu}^{22} + m_{\nu}^{31} = 0$, among a neutrino mass matrix elements. The neutrino mass matrix texture is achieved by means of $T^{\prime}$ flavor discrete symmetry extension of the Standard Model gauge group. The model realizing the neutrino mixing pattern consists of a combination of type-I and II seesaw mechanisms in the minimal possible extension of the Standard Model. Stringent predictions are obtained for normal and inverted neutrino mass orderings. Some important predictions include $\alpha_2 \approx 2\pi$ (best fit), $m_{\text{lightest}} \approx 3 - 4 \times 10^{-4}\,\text{eV}$, and $m_{ee}^{0\nu\beta\beta} \approx 3 \times 10^{-3}\,\text{eV}$ for normal neutrino mass ordering; $110^\circ &lt; \alpha_1 &lt; 170^\circ$, $40(220)^\circ &lt; \alpha_2 &lt; 60(240)^\circ$, $240^\circ &lt; \delta_{\text{Dirac}} &lt; 310^\circ$, and $m_{\text{lightest}} \approx 2 \times 10^{-5} - 7 \times 10^{-3}\,\text{eV}$ for inverted neutrino mass ordering.</description>

      <title>Anatomy of RHN DM relic in the vanilla scotogenic neutrino mass model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The scotogeneic neutrino mass models are very popular choices to generate light neutrino masses via radiative mechanism. In these models, the particles running in the loop are distinguished from the standard model due to an imposed $\mathcal{Z}_2$ symmetry under which the loop particles are odd. Therefore, the lightest particle running in the loop can be a viable dark matter candidate. In this paper, we revisit the minimal scotogenic neutrino mass model and study the anatomy of right handed neutrino (RHN) DM relic, taking into account contributions from self-annihilation, co-annihilation, conversion-driven processes, as well as production via the freeze-in mechanism. We impose the constraints from direct detection and collider searches of DM including anomalous magnetic moment of muon, charged lepton flavor violation and low-energy neutrino oscillation data to show that the lightest RHN can be a viable DM in the mass range: $M_{h}/2\lesssim M_{\rm DM}\lesssim2000 {\rm GeV}$ (thermal DM) and $0.1 ~{\rm GeV}\lesssim M_{\rm DM}\lesssim 1000 {\rm GeV}$ (non-thermal DM), where $M_h$ denotes the Standard Model Higgs mass and $M_{\rm DM}$ is the RHN dark matter mass. We also find the displaced vertex signatures of long lived particles which can be probed at future colliders.</description>

Abstract: We study the non-leptonic decays of $\Omega_{b}\rightarrow \Omega_{c} P (V)$ with eight pseudoscalar and vector mesons using the QCD factorization approach. We analyze all relevant topologies (the tree-level, color-suppressed, and penguin) of these decays and calculate the decay amplitude for each separately. We determine the decay rates, branching ratios and compare our results with those from other theoretical predictions. The results obtained may be useful for the analysis of the related data in both ongoing and future experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-energy colliders, such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, are genuine quantum machines, so, in line with Richard Feynman's original motivation for Quantum Computing, the scattering processes that take place there are natural candidates to be simulated on a quantum system. Potential applications range from quantum machine learning methods for collider data analysis, to faster and more precise evaluations of intricate multiloop Feynman diagrams, more efficient jet clustering, improved simulations of parton showers, and many other tasks. In this work, the focus will be on two specific applications: first, the identification of the causal structure of multiloop vacuum amplitudes, a key ingredient of the Loop-Tree Duality and an area with deep connections to graph theory; and second, the integration and sampling of high-dimensional functions. The latter constitutes a first step toward the realization of a fully fledged quantum event generator operating at high perturbative orders.</description>

      <title>Neutrino yield and neutron shielding calculations for a high-power target installed in an underground setting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10211v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the ever increasing beam power at particle accelerator-based facilities for nuclear and particle physics, radioactive isotope production, and nuclear engineering, targets that can withstand this power, and shielding of secondary particles are becoming increasingly important. Here we present Monte Carlo (MC) calculations using the well-established Geant4 software to optimise and predict the antineutrino yield of a $^8$Li Decay-At-Rest (DAR) source. The source relies on 600~kW of beam power from a continuous wave proton beam impinging on a beryllium target, where spallation neutrons capture on $^7$Li to produce the $^8$Li. We further present an in-depth treatment of the neutron shielding surrounding this target. We show that we can produce the high antineutrino flux needed for the discovery-level experiment IsoDAR, searching for ``sterile'' neutrinos (predicted new fundamental particles) and other beyond standard model physics, while maintaining a neutron flux in the detector that is below natural backgrounds. The methods presented in this paper are easily transferable to other high-power targets and their associated shielding.</description>

      <title>Single-Point Search for eV-scale Axion-like particles with Variable-Angle Three-Beam Stimulated Resonant Photon Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00410v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report a laboratory search for axion-like particles (ALPs) in the eV-mass range using a variable-angle three-beam stimulated resonant photon collider. The scheme independently focuses and collides three laser beams, providing a cosmology- and astrophysics-independent test. By varying the angles of incidence, the center-of-mass energy can be scanned continuously across the eV range. In this work, we operated the collider in a vacuum chamber at a large-angle configuration, verified the spacetime overlap of the three short pulses, and performed a first search centered at $m_a\simeq 2.27~\mathrm{eV}$. No excess was observed. We thus set a $95\%$ C.L.\ upper limit on the pseudoscalar two-photon coupling, with a minimum sensitivity of $g/M\simeq 4.2\times 10^{-10}~\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$ at $m_a=2.27~\mathrm{eV}$. This provides the first model-independent upper limit on the coupling that reaches the KSVZ benchmark in the eV regime and demonstrates the feasibility of eV-scale mass scans in the near future.</description>

Abstract: Super-Kamiokande has observed $^{8}\text{B}$ solar neutrino elastic scattering at recoil electron kinetic energies ($E_{kin}$) as low as 3.49 MeV to study neutrino flavor conversion within the sun. At SK-observable energies, these conversions are dominated by the Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein effect. An upturn in the electron neutrino survival probability in which vacuum neutrino oscillations become dominant is predicted to occur at lower energies, but radioactive background increases exponentially with decreasing energy. New machine learning approaches provide substantial background reduction below 3.49 MeV such that statistical extraction of solar neutrino interactions becomes feasible. This article presents an analysis of the solar neutrino interaction rate at $E_{kin}$ &lt; 3.49 MeV with the full SK-IV period, using data from a wideband intelligent trigger when available and with a boosted decision tree for event selection. A solar neutrino signal is observed between 2.99 MeV &lt; $E_{kin}$ &lt; 3.49 MeV with $2.76\sigma$ significance and a data to unoscillated MC ratio of $0.307^{+0.112}_{-0.111}$. This additional low energy data has a negligible effect on the $1\sigma$ intervals of the fits to the solar neutrino energy spectrum but has a noticeable effect on the best fit when using the exponential parameterization.</description>

      <title>Right handed neutrino production from $Z^\prime$ interactions in forward search experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10734v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study two general $U(1)$ extensions of the Standard Model (SM) those generate tiny neutrino masses via the seesaw mechanism after general $U(1)$ breaking. These models predict a new neutral gauge boson ($Z'$) and right-handed neutrinos (RHNs), the latter introduced for anomaly cancellation and neutrino mass generation. In both scenarios, left- and right-handed fermions couple differently to the $Z'$, and RHNs mix with light neutrinos, enabling variety of decay modes. Focusing on the high-luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) and the future FASER2 experiment, we explore RHN pair production from $Z'$ decays in two cases: (i) long-lived $Z'$ decays to visible modes and long-lived RHNs, and (ii) short-lived $Z'$ decays to long-lived RHNs, which further decay visibly inside FASER2. We estimate projected limits on the general $U(1)$ gauge coupling, $Z'$ mass, RHN mass, and light-heavy neutrino mixing for various $U(1)$ charge assignments, and compare them with current experimental bounds.</description>

      <title>Setting limits on blazar-boosted dark matter with xenon-based detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07265v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dual-phase xenon time projection chambers achieve optimal sensitivity for dark matter in the 10 to 1000 GeV/c$^2$ mass range, but sub-GeV dark matter particles lack sufficient energy to produce nuclear recoils above detection thresholds in these detectors. Blazar-boosted dark matter offers a way to overcome this limitation. Relativistic jets in active galactic nuclei can accelerate light dark matter in their host-galaxy halos to energies that can leave detectable nuclear recoil signals in xenon-based detectors on Earth. We present the first blazar-boosted dark matter search that incorporates detector response modeling, using public data from XENON1T and LZ for the blazar TXS 0506+056. We model dark matter-proton scattering in the jet environment, covering the full process from jet acceleration through to detector response, and we explore how the host-galaxy dark matter density profile impacts the analysis. We set model-dependent exclusion regions on the dark-matter-nucleon scattering cross section for m$_{\chi}$ approximately 1 MeV dark matter, between 5.8$\times 10^{-31}$ cm$^2$ and 6.3$\times 10^{-29}$cm$^2$ using XENON1T data, and between 9.9$\times 10^{-32}$ cm$^2$ and 2.5$\times 10^{-28}$ cm$^2$ from LZ effective field theory (EFT) dark matter searches. Our results show that astrophysical uncertainties, especially those in the dark-matter distribution near the supermassive black hole, are the main limitation of this search rather than detector effects. The limits are therefore model-dependent and should be seen as exploratory, highlighting both the potential and the present uncertainties of blazar-boosted dark matter as a probe of light dark matter.</description>

      <title>Searching for leptophilic composite asymmetric dark sector at $e^+e^-$ colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12504v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Composite asymmetric dark matter (ADM) models provide a well-motivated paradigm that simultaneously explains dark matter (DM) relic density and matter-antimatter asymmetry. In these models, the mass of the DM candidate (the lightest dark baryon) is generated through the dark confinement scale dynamics. Although the leptophilic composite ADM model offers a viable framework, comprehensive studies of its collider phenomenology are absent. This work systematically explores novel signatures from the leptophilic composite asymmetric dark sector at both low-energy and high-energy $e^+e^-$ colliders as well as other existing collider constraints. We demonstrate detectability of TeV-scale mediators along with sub-GeV to GeV-scale lightest dark mesons at Belle II and its proposed far detector, GAZELLE, as well as Circular Electron Positron Collider/Future Circular Collider-electron-positron experiments. Moreover, these experiments exhibit complementary coverage of the model parameter space.</description>
