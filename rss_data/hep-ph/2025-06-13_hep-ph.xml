      <title>The LHC as an Axion-Photon Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assuming the existence of an axion-like particle (ALP), beams of relativistic particles emit fluxes of quasi-real ALPs, analogous to the photon fluxes described by Weizs\"acker-Williams-type approximations. Consequently, analogously to photon collisions, ALP-ALP and ALP-photon collisions can occur at the LHC. We initiate the study of the LHC as an ALP collider, and show that ALP collisions provide competitive probes of certain ALP couplings. We show that ALP fluxes from heavy ions are suppressed relative to those from protons, unlike their photon counterpart. As a result, the most likely processes are ALP-photon collisions occurring in the proton-ion ($p$A) ultraperipheral collisions. Using our implementation of ALP fluxes in simulation tools, we show that ALP-photon collisions in $p$Pb efficiently probe ALP couplings to third generation fermions. LHC data with realistic $p$Pb luminosity can constrain the product of ALP couplings to nucleons and top quarks at the level of $O(0.01$ TeV$^{-1})$. Notably, ALP-photon collisions naturally provide the leading probe of ALP flavor-violating couplings to the top quark. We suggest that the 2016 $p$Pb dataset collected at CMS, ATLAS, and LHCb should be explored for evidence of such collisions.</description>

      <title>Light Dark Matter Detection with Sub-eV Transition-Edge Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of high-resolution transition-edge sensors (TESs) as a quantum sensing platform for detecting dark matter (DM). Operating near the thermodynamic noise limit with sub-eV energy resolution, TESs offer a powerful approach for probing light DM in the sub-GeV mass range. Optical TESs, realized on superconducting films with critical temperatures below 150 mK, achieve energy thresholds below 100 meV and enable precise calorimetric detection of individual energy depositions. We model TES response by incorporating fundamental noise sources and applying optimal filtering techniques, and evaluate their sensitivity across a range of DM interaction channels, accounting for in-medium effects in the target material. We show that even ng-month-scale exposures can reach previously unexplored DM-electron scattering cross sections below $10^{-27}$ cm$^2$ for sub-MeV masses, and can probe the MeV-scale mass range for DM-nucleon couplings. Combining high energy resolution, photon-number sensitivity, and scalability, optical TESs provide a compelling quantum sensing platform for rare-event searches at the intersection of particle physics and quantum metrology.</description>

      <title>Topological defects as effective dynamical dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we consider the possibility that the dynamical dark energy hinted at by recent DESI data may be mimicked by the effects of additional components in the universe, potentially arising from topological defects. We find that the data does not show a particular preference for the existence of cosmic strings. However, a domain wall contribution at the percent level can improve the fit, yielding a $\Delta \chi^2= -1.72$ compared to the $\Lambda \rm{CDM}$ model. The improvement indicates that topological defects remain a viable and interesting extension to $\Lambda\rm{CDM}$, meriting further investigation with future cosmological data.</description>

      <title>RG evolution and effect of intermediate new physics on $\Delta B=2$ six-quark operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent identification of possible 11 neutron-antineutron ($n$-$\bar{n}$) oscillation candidate events at Super-Kamiokande has renewed the interest in $\Delta B = 2$ transitions. In this work, we analyze the Renormalization Group (RG) running of mass dimension-9 six-quark operators, in $\bar{MS}$ scheme, that generate processes like $nn\to \pi^0\pi^0$, deuteron decay, $n$-$\bar{n}$ oscillations etc, evolving them from the electroweak scale to baryon number violating scale ($\mathcal{O}(10^3~\text{TeV})$). Our goal is to systematically account for the influence of potential new physics at intermediate energies ($\gtrsim \mathcal{O}(10~ \text{TeV})$), especially given the fact that {\it Large Hadron Collider} has not ruled out new physics beyond $\sim 10~\text{TeV}$. To comprehensively investigate their influence, we consider two scenarios: (i) a minimal setup with only Standard Model degrees of freedom up to the high scale at $\mathcal{O}(10^3~\text{TeV})$, and (ii) an extended framework involving scalar and vector bosons above $\sim 10~\text{TeV}$ up till BNV scale. To facilitate further studies, we also provide a Python script that performs RG evolution of the BNV Wilson coefficients in the presence of generic bosonic new physics at any intermediate energy scale. It can be modified easily to meet the needs of the user to investigate the running of the BNV Wilson coefficients. We then compare the result with the experimental bound from the neutron-antineutron oscillation process and constrain the scale of baryon number violating new physics.</description>

      <title>Matter symmetries in supersymmetric standard models from non-invertible selection rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss phenomenological implications of non-invertible selection rules in the framework of the supersymmetric standard model. We find that a remnant $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry of fusion algebras which holds at all-loop order plays the role of $R$-parity, forbidding baryon and lepton violating operators. In addition, a combination of Standard Model gauge symmetry and the non-invertible selection rules lead to baryon triality and proton hexality that can protect the proton from decay. In general, our finding selection rules can not realize the same results as conventional $\mathbb{Z}_N$ symmetries in the supersymmetric standard model. We also clarify the assignments of matter fields under the fusion algebras that are consistent with $SU(4) \times SU(2) \times SU(2)$, $SU(5)$, and $SO(10)$ grand unified theories.</description>

      <title>On the interplay between the BFKL resummation and high-energy factorization in Mueller-Navelet dijet production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the interplay between the high-energy resummation based on the BFKL equation and initial state radiation effects, taken into account within the framework of the high-energy factorization, in the production of Mueller-Navelet dijets at hadron colliders. We use the solution of the NLO BFKL equation built out of eigenfunctions perturbatively constructed up to NLO to avoid the need for a special renormalization scale setting. We demonstrate that the various data sets from the FNAL Tevatron and CERN LHC can be described in this way and both the initial state radiation effects of the high-energy factorization and the NLL BFKL resummation are crucial for the uniform description of the data across all values of rapidity difference between the jets.</description>

      <title>Systematic study of charm meson M1 radiative transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by recent experimental advancements in the study of radiative decays of charmed mesons, we investigate the magnetic (transition) moments of vector mesons by applying the effective mass scheme, obtained from the one-gluon exchange interaction between quark-antiquark pairs. By incorporating high-precision experimental data from both heavy and light flavor sectors, we accurately account for the strong hyperfine interaction contributions to the quark and antiquark masses within mesons. We calculate the $V \to P$ effective transition magnetic moments to reliably predict M1 decay widths. Furthermore, to enhance the completeness of our analysis, we employ the non-relativistic potential model to calculate bound state isomultiplet masses and to predict the M1 decay widths of charmed mesons.</description>

      <title>Evading Dark Matter Bounds through NLSP-Assisted Freeze-Out with Long-Lived Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we explore a conversion-driven freeze-out scenario, where the next-to-lightest stable particle (NLSP) sets the dark matter (DM) abundance through the process ``NLSP SM $\leftrightarrow$ DM SM". Although DM is produced via a freeze-out mechanism, its interaction strength with the visible sector can range from weak to feeble couplings. This results in a vast, largely unexplored parameter space that evades current direct, indirect, and collider bounds, while remaining testable in the near future. We study this mechanism in the context of an alternative $U(1)_{B-L}$ model, where four chiral fermions are required to cancel gauge anomalies, unlike the usual case with three right-handed neutrinos. The observed relic abundance is successfully reproduced within this framework. The viable parameter space can be probed by future direct detection experiments, while remaining inaccessible to indirect searches. Our results show that the DM relic density is highly sensitive to the NLSP-SM interaction strength and the mass difference between the NLSP and DM, but not to the DM-SM direct interaction. For certain parameter choices, the NLSP decays to DM via two or three body processes involving an extra gauge boson and SM particles, leading to long-lived decays outside the CMS or ATLAS detectors at the LHC. In contrast, if the decay proceeds via a CP-odd Higgs, it occurs promptly within the detector. We investigate prospects for detecting such long-lived NLSPs at the proposed MATHUSLA detector, with similar expectations for the ongoing FASER experiment. Finally, we find that choosing arbitrarily small values of the gauge coupling or BSM fermionic mixing angle can violate successful BBN predictions.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Roy-Steiner-equation analysis of pion-kaon scattering from lattice QCD data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A comprehensive analysis of $\pi K\rightarrow \pi K$ and $\pi\pi\rightarrow K\bar K$ amplitudes at large unphysical pion mass for all important partial waves is presented. A set of crossing-symmetric partial-wave hyperbolic dispersion relations is used to describe lattice QCD data at $m_\pi=391~$MeV. In the present analysis, the amplitudes for the $S$- and $P$-waves are formulated by combining the constraints of analyticity, unitarity, and crossing symmetry, fulfilling Roy-Steiner-type equations. We use these results to investigate the low-lying strange-meson resonances and resolve the instability problem tied to analytic continuation in prior lattice QCD studies based on the $K$-matrix formalism. At $m_\pi=391~$MeV, the rigorous Roy-Steiner-type equation approach allows us to determine the $S$-wave scattering lengths, $m_\pi a_0^{1/2}=\left(0.92_{-0.28}^{+0.06}\right)$, $m_\pi a_0^{3/2}=-\left(0.32_{-0.02}^{+0.05}\right)$, and the $\kappa$ (also known as $K_0^*(700)$) pole position, $\sqrt{s_\kappa}=\left(966_{-24}^{+41}-i 198_{-17}^{+38}\right)~$MeV. We also provide a detailed analysis of the complex validity domain of the Roy-Steiner-type equations.</description>

      <title>Personal Memories of 50 Years of Quarkonia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The world of particle physics was revolutionised in November 1974 by the discovery of the J/psi particle, the first particle to be identified as a quarkonium state composed of charm quarks and antiquarks. The charmonium interpretation of the J/psi was cemented by the subsequent observations of a spectrum of related c \bar c states, and finally by the discovery of charmed particles in 1976. The discovery of charmonium was followed in 1977 by the discovery of bottomonium mesons and particles containing bottom quarks. Toponium bound states of top quark and antiquarks were predicted to exist in principle but, following the discovery of the top quark in 1995, most physicists thought that its observation would have to wait for next-generation e^+ e^- collider. However, in the second half of 2024 the CMS Collaboration reported an excess of events near the threshold for \bar t t production at the LHC that is most plausibly interpreted as the lowest-lying toponium state. These are the personal recollections of an eyewitness who followed closely these 50 years of quarkonium discoveries.</description>

      <title>Regge factorization of tree-level QCD amplitudes using a minimal set of lightcone variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We represent the multi-leg tree-level amplitudes of quarks and gluons using a minimal set of lightcone variables, which incorporate all on-shell and momentum conservation conditions and naturally captures the separate longitudinal and transverse momentum components. These variables make it easy to eliminate spurious poles and consider multi-Regge kinematic limits. In this framework we examine the factorization of tree-level amplitudes in rapidity and extract all two, three and four parton Multi-Regge Emission Vertices (MREVs), both central and peripheral, and summarise them in a Mathematica library, MREV. We investigate in detail how relations between amplitudes translate into relations between MREVs. These relations, along with factorization properties in further kinematic limits, provide robust consistency checks of the results.</description>

      <title>Baryon and Meson Excited States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The masses of fifteen baryon sets and twenty-four meson sets of three or more equal-quantum excited states are fitted by a simple two-parameter logarithm function, $M_n = \alpha Ln(n) + \beta$, where $n$ is the level of radial excitation. The conjecture is made that accurately measured masses using Breat-Wigner PDG2024 data at fixed $J^P$ for baryons and $J^{PC}$ for mesons of all equal-quantum baryons (including LHCb exotic $P_{c\bar{c}}^+$s) and meson (including $s\bar{s}$, $s\bar{c}$, $c\bar{c}$, $c\bar{b}$, and $b\bar{b}$) excited states are related by the logarithm function used here; at least for the mass range of currently known excited states. Thus, a universal mass equation for equal-quantum excited-states sets is presented. The masses of twelve baryon sets and sixteen meson sets, with only two equal-quantum excited states in each set, using Breit-Wigner PDG2024 masses and their uncertainties, are fitted by thr universal mass equation.</description>

      <title>Studies on the $\pi^+ p$ elastic scattering via the von Neumann entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the $\pi^+ p$ elastic scattering process using an effective Lagrangian approach that incorporates the $s$-, $u$-, and $t$-channel amplitudes, including $\Delta^{++,0}(1232)$, neutron, and $\rho^0$ contributions. By constructing the spin-density matrices (SDMs) from helicity amplitudes, we derive the von Neumann (entanglement) entropy associated with the spin degrees of freedom of the initial and final state particles. We compute the entropy by performing a partial trace over the spin subsystems, and its behavior is analyzed as a function of the center-of-mass energy $W$ and scattering angle $\theta$. We find that the entropy exhibits nontrivial angular and energy dependence, reflecting the interplay among resonance contributions and background amplitudes. In particular, the $\Delta^{++}$ region shows relatively low entanglement, suggesting spin coherence dominated by the specific resonant contribution, while the background contributions increase entropy due to mixed spin configurations. These results indicate that entanglement entropy can serve as a novel probe into the quantum structure of hadronic scattering amplitudes, providing complementary insights beyond conventional cross-section analyses.</description>

      <title>Reaching the Ultimate Quantum Precision Limit at Colliders: Conditions and Case Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate whether collider experiments can reach the quantum limit of precision, defined by the quantum Fisher information (QFI), using only classical observables such as particle momenta. As a case study, we focus on the $\tau^+\tau^-$ system and the decay channel $\tau \to \pi \nu$, which offers maximal spin-analyzing power and renders the decay a projective measurement. We develop a general framework to determine when collider measurements can, in principle, saturate the QFI in an entangled biparticle system, and this framework extends naturally to other such systems. Within this framework, QFI saturation occurs if and only if the symmetric logarithmic derivative (SLD) commutes with a complete set of orthonormal separable projectors associated with collider-accessible measurements. This separability condition, reflecting the independence of decay amplitudes, is highly nontrivial. To meet this condition, a key requirement is that the spin density matrix be rank-deficient, allowing the SLD sufficient freedom. We show that the classical Fisher information asymptotically saturates the QFI for magnetic dipole moments and CP-violating Higgs interactions in selected phase-space regions, but not for electric dipole moments. These results bridge quantum metrology and collider physics, providing a systematic method to identify quantum-optimal sensitivity in collider experiments.</description>

Abstract: The neutron skin thickness in neutron-rich nuclei has traditionally been measured using elastic fixed target electron-nucleus scattering since the 1970s. In this paper, we propose a novel probe of the neutron skin thickness through deep inelastic scattering in electron-ion collisions, leveraging the intrinsic correlation between final-state jet charge distribution and initial-state partonic distributions in nucleons. Specifically, we demonstrate the sensitivity of jet charge distribution to the neutron skin thickness in $e$+Pb collisions with varying centralities, and in isobar collisions of $e$+Ru and $e$+Zr. We predict a strong suppression of positive jet charge distribution and an enhancement for negative jet charge distribution in peripheral electron-ion collisions, revealing the neutron skin effect. This proposal can also be extended to photon and Z-boson tagged jet charge distribution in proton-nucleus collisions at the Large Hadron Collider, providing an alternative access to neutron skin thickness.</description>

      <title>On string tension and initial temperature from transverse momentum spectra of heavy quarkonia in proton-proton collisions at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The string tension ($\kappa$) in the Schwinger mechanism and the effective temperature ($T$) in Bose-Einstein statistics are extracted from the transverse momentum ($p_T$) spectra of heavy quarkonia produced in proton-proton (p+p) collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Here, $T$ derived from the heavy quarkonium $p_T$ spectra also represents the initial temperature of the collision system, as transverse flow has not yet formed when heavy quarkonia are produced. The related parameters ($\kappa$ and $T$) are obtained by fitting the experimental $p_T$ spectra of $J/\psi$ and $\Upsilon(nS)$ ($n=1$, 2, and 3) within various rapidity intervals, produced in p+p collisions at center-of-mass energies of $\sqrt{s}=13$ and 8 TeV, as measured by the LHCb Collaboration. It is found that the multi-component distribution structured within the framework of the Schwinger mechanism or Bose-Einstein statistics can effectively describe the heavy quarkonium $p_T$ spectra in small collision systems. With decreasing rapidity in the forward region, both $\kappa$ and $T$ increase, indicating a directly proportional relationship between them. Based on $\kappa$, the average minimum strong force radius of participant quarks is determined.</description>

      <title>Double neutral-current corrections to NLO electroweak leptonic cross sections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method for improving next-to-leading order electroweak (EW) predictions for lepton-scattering processes by consistently including double neutral-current corrections arising from vector-boson-fusion topologies, which are formally of higher order. By combining, in a process-independent manner, exact fixed-order results, collinear resummation of QED radiation, and a subtraction procedure, we obtain results which are gauge invariant and valid in the entire phase space, retain any dependence on the masses of electroweak bosons, and can be systematically improved, while avoiding the need for complete next-to-next-to-leading order calculations. This paper is devoted to the development and validation of the formalism; phenomenological applications are presented in a companion study, where we also discuss and motivate why our approach is superior to the one based on EW parton distribution functions for targeting percent-level precision at multi-TeV lepton colliders.</description>

      <title>Precision phenomenology at multi-TeV muon colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future lepton colliders, such as those based on linear $e^+e^-$ or circular $\mu^+\mu^-$ accelerators, are expected to attain centre-of-mass energies in the multi-TeV range. In this regime the impact of QED and of weak radiation, in both the initial and the final state, can become a leading effect. By employing a general framework presented in a companion paper - suitable for any flavour of colliding leptons - we improve next-to-leading order electroweak predictions by including higher-order contributions, which encompass, but are not limited to, vector-boson-fusion processes. We apply this approach to the study of $t\bar{t}$ and $W^+W^-$ production at a muon collider operating at centre-of-mass energies up to 10 TeV. We show that such an approach, where both QED and weak contributions are included at fixed order, in addition to the all-order resummation of initial-state QED effects, can provide predictions for arbitrary observables in all of the phase space which are precise at the percent level.</description>

      <title>Impact of improved energy resolution on DUNE sensitivity in presence of a light sterile neutrino</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) primarily aims to measure the yet unknown parameters of the standard three neutrino framework, i.e., the determination of Dirac CP phase ($\delta_{13}$), neutrino mass hierarchy (MH) and octant of $\theta_{23}$. In the present work, we consider the standard three neutrino paradigm (referred to as the $(3+0)$ case) and beyond with an additional light sterile neutrino (referred to as the $(3+1)$ case). We consider two configurations : standard energy resolution as in DUNE Technical Design Report (TDR) and improved energy resolution and study the impact of energy resolution in the $(3+0)$ and $(3+1)$ cases. In general, inclusion of subdominant new physics effects spoils the sensitivities. However, improved energy resolution leads to enhancement in sensitivities to the three unknowns in both $(3+0)$ and $(3+1)$ cases.</description>

      <title>Electric conductivity and flavor diffusion in a viscous, resistive quark-gluon plasma for weak and strong magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a microscopic calculation of the electric conductivity and net-particle diffusion coefficients for a viscous and resistive ultra-relativistic plasma. Our results might be of interest for several astrophysical and cosmological problems, but the main physical application we have in mind is the hot deconfined matter produced in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Accordingly, as charged particles of the medium we take three species (flavors) of light (massless for the sake of simplicity) quarks -- $u$, $d$ and $s$ -- and antiquarks, entailing the existence of three macroscopic conserved charges: baryon number ${\cal B}$, electric charge $Q$ and strangeness $S$. Our results are valid both in a weakly and in a strongly-magnetized plasma, where the energy stored in the magnetic field is comparable to the one carried by the medium particles. Actually, for a conformal fluid, the behavior of the system only depends on the ratio between the thermal and the magnetic pressure, the so-called plasma beta-parameter, acting as a scaling variable. Our calculation, starting from a relativistic Boltzmann-Vlasov equation, is based on a generalized Chapman-Enskog approach in which space-time gradients and the local electric field are treated as first-order quantities in a perturbative expansion, while terms containing magnetic corrections are considered of zeroth order and hence self-consistently resummed. We find that, also in the strong-field limit, for each conserved charge a generalized Wiedemann-Franz law, connecting charge conductivity and diffusion coefficient, exists. However these transport coefficients acquire a non-trivial tensor structure, reflecting the development of a longitudinal, a transverse and a Hall current as a response to electric fields or density gradients.</description>

      <title>Threshold resummation for $W$-boson pair production at NNLO+NNLL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present results for threshold resummation of the invariant mass distribution, for on-shell production of a pair of $W$-bosons at next-to-next-to-leading order + next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic (NNLO+NNLL) accuracy in QCD. Owing to its sensitivity to the self-interactions between gauge bosons, this process is important to investigate at the energies of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). We achieve this resummation by exploiting the factorization properties of the soft and virtual parts of the partonic cross-section. Our analysis has been carried out for the invariant mass distribution up to $Q$ = 2500 GeV. At this highest $Q$ we find that, for 13.6 TeV LHC, the NNLL resummation enhances the NNLO cross-sections by about $6.3\%$ and reduces the conventional scale uncertainties from 6.8\% at NNLO to 4.1\% at NNLO+NNLL. We also estimate the intrinsic uncertainties due to the non-perturbative parton distribution functions at the highest perturbative order, for both fixed-order and resummed results, to be around 3\% for $Q \sim$ 2000 GeV.</description>

      <title>Two coincidences are a clue: Probing a GeV-scale dark QCD sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The similarity between dark matter and baryon energy densities suggests the existence of a dark sector analogous to the visible QCD sector. In addition, small-scale structure issues can be addressed by dark matter self-interactions with a cross section comparable to that of QCD. Both observations point to a GeV-scale dark QCD sector. In this letter, guided by these two coincidences, we investigate how a chiral dark QCD model with a MeV-scale dark photon can resolve the core-cusp problem. A potential third coincidence, associated with the latest measurement of $N_{\rm eff}$ being lower than the Standard Model prediction, is also discussed. Current constraints leave a finite window in the parameter space, which can be tested by future experiments such as Gamma Factory.</description>

      <title>Core-Corona Decomposition of Very Compact (Neutron) Stars: Accounting for Current Data of XTE J1814-338</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A core-corona decomposition of compact (neutron) star models was compared with the current mass-radius data of the outlier XTE~J1814-338. The corona (which may also be dubbed the envelope, halo or outer crust) is assumed to be of Standard Model matter, with an equation of state that is supposed to be faithfully known and accommodates nearly all other neutron star data. The core, solely parameterized by its mass, radius and transition pressure, presents a challenge regarding its composition. We derived a range of core parameters needed to describe the current data of XTE J1814-338.</description>

      <title>Locating the QCD critical point with neutron-star observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a probabilistic model for the QCD critical endpoint (CEP) and the equation of state (EOS) at $\beta$-equilibrium, constrained by neutron-star observations. Using a hybrid framework that combines the holographic V-QCD model with an effective van der Waals description of nuclear matter, we generate a large ensemble of EOSs incorporating nuclear theory uncertainties. Constraining this ensemble with neutron-star mass-radius data and tidal deformability measurements from gravitational waves, we identify a strong first-order deconfinement transition at zero temperature, with a transition strength of $\Delta n_{\rm{PT}}/n_0 = 3.75^{+0.70}_{-0.53}$ and onset density $n_{\rm{PT}}/n_0 = 4.9^{+1.33}_{-1.17}$. The resulting posterior yields $95\%$ credible intervals for the CEP location: $\mu_{\rm{crit}} = 626^{+90}_{-179}\,\rm{MeV}$, $T_{\rm{crit}} = 119^{+14}_{-6}\,\rm{MeV}$.</description>

      <title>A novel method to trace the dark matter density profile around supermassive black holes with AGN reverberation mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new method to determine the dark matter density profile in the vicinity of distant supermassive black holes (SMBH) using reverberation mapping measurements of active galactic nuclei (AGN). For some AGN, the mapping of multiple emission lines allows us to measure the enclosed mass within different radii from the central SMBH, which allows us to infer or constrain the dark matter density profile on sub-pc scales. We find that for five out of fourteen AGN in our identified sample, the observed enclosed mass grows with radii, hinting evidence for the presence of a dark matter component at the 1-2 $\sigma$ level. For these sources, we find global evidence for a universal dark matter profile with a preferred radial steepness of index $\gamma \sim 1.6$, consistent with the scenario expected for a dark matter spike mildly relaxed by stellar heating processes. For the remaining AGN in our sample, we are able to derive upper limits on the dark matter density profile parameters. Interestingly, the strongest evidence for a dark matter component arises from the farthest object considered, 3C 390. This new method allows us to measure or constrain for the first time the dark matter density in the vicinity of extragalactic SMBHs, which is crucial to our understanding of the dynamics and nature of dark matter.</description>

      <title>Exploring Nonperturbative Behaviour of Moments and Cumulants in Quantum Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of quantum fields become nonperturbative when their interactions are probed by a large number of particles. To explore this regime we study correlation functions which involve a large number of fields, focussing on massive scalar theories that feature arbitrary self-interactions, $\phi^{2p}$. Treating quantum fields as operator-valued distributions, we investigate $n$-point correlation functions at ultra-short distances and compute moments and cumulants of fields, using a semiclassical saddle point approximation in the double scaling limit of weak coupling, $\lambda \to 0$, large quantum number, $n \to \infty$, while keeping $\lambda n$ constant. Addressing the nonperturbative regime, where $\lambda n \gtrsim 1$, requires a resummation of the effective saddle point to all orders in $\lambda n$. We perform this resummation in zero and one dimensions, and show that the moments, corresponding to correlation functions including disconnected contributions, grow exponentially with $n$. This growth is significantly reduced for higher-order self-interactions, i.e. for larger $p$. On the other hand, we argue that the cumulants, which represent connected correlation functions, grow even more rapidly and are mostly independent of $p$.</description>

      <title>Analytical solutions of CPT-odd Maxwell equations in Schwarzschild spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present the CPT-violating (CPTV) Maxwell equations in curved spacetime using the Newman-Penrose (NP) formalism. We obtain a semi-analytical solution to the Maxwell equations in Schwarzschild spacetime under the assumption that the CPT-odd $\left(k_{AF}\right)^\mu$ term exhibits spherical symmetry in the Schwarzschild background. Retaining only terms up to linear order in the $\left(k_{AF}\right)^\mu$ coefficient, we obtain perturbative solutions by treating the solutions of the Lorentz-invariant Maxwell equations as the zeroth-order approximation and incorporating the $\left(k_{AF}\right)^\mu$ terms as an additional source term alongside the external charge current. Each resulting NP scalar field can be factorized into two components: the radial component is expressed in terms of hypergeometric functions, while the angular component is described by spin-weighted spherical harmonics.</description>

      <title>Differential Space of Feynman Integrals: Annihilators and $\mathcal{D}$-module</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel algorithm for constructing differential operators with respect to external variables that annihilate Feynman-like integrals and give rise to the associated $\mathcal{D}$-modules, based on Griffiths-Dwork reduction. By leveraging the Macaulay matrix method, we derive corresponding relations among partial differential operators, including systems of Pfaffian equations and Picard-Fuchs operators. Our computational approach is applicable to twisted period integrals in projective coordinates, and we showcase its application to Feynman graphs and Witten diagrams. The method yields annihilators and their algebraic relations for generic regulator values, explicitly avoiding contributions from surface terms. In the cases examined, we observe that the holonomic rank of the $\mathcal{D}$-modules coincides with the dimension of the corresponding de Rham co-homology groups, indicating an equivalence relation between them, which we propose as a conjecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note we explore the chaotic behavior of non-integrable QFTs and compare them to integrable ones. We choose as prototypes the double sine-Gordon and the sine-Gordon models. We analyze their discrete spectrum determined by a truncation method. We examine the map of the corresponding energy eigenvalues to the eigenvalues of the random matrix theory (RMT) Gaussian orthogonal ensemble (GOE). This is done by computing the following properties: (a) The distribution of the adjacent spacings and their ratios (b) Higher order spacings and ratios (c) Pair correlations (d) Spectral form factors and (e) Spectral rigidity. For these properties we determine the differences between the integrable and non-integrable theories and verify that the former admits a Poisson behavior and the latter GOE (apart from the spectral rigidity).</description>

Abstract: Symbol letters are crucial for analytically calculating Feynman integrals in terms of iterated integrals. We present a novel method to construct the symbol letters for a given integral family without prior knowledge of the canonical differential equations. We provide a program package implementing our algorithm, and demonstrate its effectiveness in solving non-trivial problems with multiple loops and legs. Using our method, we successfully bootstrap the canonical differential equations for a two-loop five-point family with two external masses and for a three-loop four-point family with two external masses, which were previously unknown in the literature. We anticipate that our method can be applied to a wide range of cutting-edge calculations in the future.</description>

      <title>Supernovae Time Profiles as a Probe of New Physics at Neutrino Telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09781v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutrino telescopes, including IceCube, can detect galactic supernova events by observing the collective rise in photomultiplier count rates with a sub-second time resolution. Leveraging precise timing, we demonstrate the ability of neutrino telescopes to explore new weakly coupled states emitted from supernovae and subsequently decaying to neutrinos. Our approach utilizes publicly available packages, \texttt{ASTERIA} and \texttt{SNEWPY}, for simulating detector responses and parametrizing neutrino fluxes originating from Standard Model and new physics. We present results for two beyond the Standard Model scenarios and introduce the tool developed for testing a diverse range of new physics models.</description>

      <title>Analysis on Neutrino Masses and Leptogenesis in the CP-Violating Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10621v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article extends the CP-violating Standard Model (CPVSM) from the quark sector to the lepton sector to investigate leptogenesis and neutrino masses. Using the identity $\Delta_{hm} + \Delta_{ml} = \Delta_{hl}$, where $\Delta_{ij} = (m^2_i - m^2_j)$ denoting the mass-squared difference (MSD) between fermions $i$ and $j$, and $h$, $m$, and $l$ labeling the heaviest, middle, and lightest fermions of a given type, respectively, we predict the third neutrino MSD from two experimental inputs: $\Delta_a = 2.51 \times 10^{-3}$ eV$^2$ and $\Delta_b = 7.42 \times 10^{-5}$ eV$^2$. Of six possible assignments of these values to the three $\Delta_{hm}, \Delta_{ml}$, and $\Delta_{hl}$, four consistent cases remain and are grouped into two classes. All four predict similar heaviest and lightest neutrino masses ($m_h = 5.01 \times 10^{-2}$ eV and $m_l = 6.09098 \times 10^{-3}$ eV), but differ in the middle mass: $m_m = 4.97283 \times 10^{-2}$ eV in Class 1, and $m_m = 1.05499 \times 10^{-2}$ eV in Class 2. In a complementary analysis, treating the mass ratio $g = m_h / m_m$ as a variable, we examine how $m_h$, $m_m$, $m_l$, and $g'$ evolve with $g$. Of particular interest are the ranges of $g$ bounded by MSD-based values derived in Subsection III-A (blue points) and values derived from a previously predicted $m_l = 8.61 \times 10^{-3}$ eV (green points). Finally, using the leptonic Jarlskog measure of CPV $\Delta_{CP(l)} = J_{(l)} (\Delta_{ij} \Delta_{jk} \Delta_{ki})_{(\ell)} (\Delta_{ij} \Delta_{jk} \Delta_{ki})_{(\nu)}$, we find that leptogenesis is at least 71 orders of magnitude weaker than baryogenesis in the CPVSM. This striking discrepancy suggests that new physics beyond the Standard Model is required for leptogenesis to account for the observed BAU.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07180v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of the finite temperature CP-asymmetry factor needed in the semi-classical treatment of leptogenesis originating from Majorana fermion decays into a lepton and a scalar particle. The imaginary part of the relevant one-loop integrals are evaluated using both the real time and the imaginary time formalisms of thermal quantum field theory. In the former we consider the retarded-advanced approach as well as the original thermal cutting method developed by Kobes and Semenoff. Specific care is directed towards showing the consistency between the various approaches. We show that the final physical result of the calculation is linear in the statistical factors and is consistent with what is obtained in the Kadanoff-Baym approach. We also present analytic expressions for the full CP-asymmetry factor in the form of well-behaved triple-integrals, and provide numerical benchmark predictions in a specific particle physics model.</description>

      <title>Suppression of Spin Transfer to $\Lambda$ Hyperon in Deep-Inelastic Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06205v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate $\Lambda$ production in semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering using a polarized lepton beam and find that the spin transfer is significantly suppressed by target fragmentation. As further demonstrated by a model estimation, experimental data can be well described once the target fragmentation is taken into account, which alleviates the tension with calculations solely based on current fragmentation. Our findings suggest that, at the energies of existing fixed-target experiments, the separation of current and target fragmentation regions is not distinct. Spin transfer as well as other spin effects offers a sensitive probe into the origin of the produced hadron.</description>

      <title>Axion framework with color-mediated Dirac neutrino masses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13156v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a KSVZ-type axion framework in which vector-like quarks (VLQ) and colored scalars generate Dirac neutrino masses radiatively. The global Peccei-Quinn symmetry (under which the exotic fermions are charged) addresses the strong CP problem and ensures the Dirac nature of neutrinos. The axion also accounts for the observed cosmological dark matter. We systematically explore all viable VLQ representations. Depending on the specific scenario, the framework predicts distinct axion-to-photon couplings, testable through haloscope and helioscope experiments, as well as potentially significant flavor-violating quark-axion interactions.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Moduli and Non-perturbative Production of Axions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17229v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cosmological moduli generically come to dominate the energy density of the early universe, and thereby trigger an early matter dominated era. Such non-standard cosmological histories are expected to have profound effects on the evolution and production of axion cold dark matter and dark radiation, as well as their prospects for detection. We consider moduli-axion couplings and investigate the early history of the coupled system, considering closely the evolution of the homogeneous modulus field, the back-reaction from the axion, and the energy densities of the two fields. A particular point of interest is the enhancement of axion production from modulus decay, due to tachyonic and parametric resonant instabilities, and the implications of such production on the cosmological moduli problem, axion dark radiation, and the available parameter space for axion dark matter. Using an effective field theory approach, WKB-based semi-analytical analysis, and detailed numerical estimates of the co-evolution of the system, we evaluate the expected decay efficiency of the modulus to axions. The effects of higher-order operators are studied and implications for UV-complete frameworks such as the Large Volume Scenarios in Type IIB string theory are considered in detail.</description>

      <title>Precision tools for the simulation of double-Higgs production via vector-boson fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09112v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present two precision tools for the simulation of Higgs-pair production via vector-boson fusion in the kappa framework for the parameterization of non-standard Higgs couplings. A new implementation of the process is developed in the framework of the POWHEG BOX program that can be used to provide predictions at the next-to-leading order (NLO) of QCD matched to parton showers (PS). In addition, the existing proVBFHH program for the computation of next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) QCD and next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order QCD corrections is extended to account for values of the Higgs couplings different from the expectation of the Standard Model. We systematically compare and analyse predictions obtained with the two programs and find that the NLO+PS predictions provide a good approximation of the NNLO results for observables of the tagging jets and Higgs bosons. The results turn out to be very sensitive to the values of the modified Higgs couplings. Finally we study the non-factorizable NNLO QCD corrections to the process in the presence of anomalous couplings. We find that the size of the non-factorizable corrections is very sensitive to the anomalous couplings.</description>

      <title>The charmonium-like exotic hadron productions in $e^+e^-$ collisions at the BESIII energy with the PACIAE model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16822v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by the BESIII observation of exotic hadron $G$(3900) in $e^+e^-\rightarrow D\bar D$ process [PRL 133(2024)081901], we use the parton and hadron cascade model PACIAE to simulate the productions of charmonium-like exotic hadrons including $X(3872)$, $Z_{c}(3900)^0$ and $G(3900)$ in the $e^+e^-$ annihilations at $\sqrt s$=4.95 GeV. The charmonium-like candidates are recombined by Dynamically Constrained Phase-space Coalescence model using component mesons $D\bar D$ (for $G(3900)$) or $D\bar D^*/\bar DD^*$ (for $X(3872)$, $Z_{c}(3900)^0$ and $G(3900)$) in the PACIAE simulated final hadronic state. We then calculate, for the first time, the charmonium-like candidate's orbital angular momentum quantum number in its rest frame and perform the spectral classification for each of the above candidates. For $G(3900)$, as its $J^{PC}$ is $1^{--}$, it is identified as the $P$-wave $D\bar D$ or $D\bar D^*/\bar DD^*$ state. Meanwhile, for $X(3872)$ and $Z_{c}(3900)^0$, as their $J^{PC}$s are, respectively, $1^{++}$ and $1^{+-}$, they are identified as the $S$-wave $D\bar D^*/\bar DD^*$ candidates. It is observed that the yield of the $P$-wave $G(3900)$ composed of $D\bar D^*/\bar DD^*$ is significantly larger than that composed of $D\bar D$. Moreover, in the $D\bar D^*/\bar DD^*$ channel, the yield of the $P$-wave $G(3900)$ is around three times as large as the yield of the $S$-wave $Z_{c}(3900)^0$, and it is around two orders of magnitude as large as the yield of the $S$-wave $X(3872)$. Finally, significant discrepancies are observed in the transverse momentum spectra and the rapidity distributions among the $X(3872)$, $Z_{c}(3900)^0$ and $G(3900)$ states. These discrepancies are proposed as valuable criteria for identifying the different charmonium-like exotic hadrons from each other.</description>

      <title>Spin 1 Transverse Momentum Dependent Tensor Structure Functions in CLAS12</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20044v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose to analyze CLAS12 RG-C data to study the tensor transverse-momentum-dependent parton distribution functions (TMDs) on deuteron data. The deuteron is the lightest nucleus with spin-1, in essence a weakly bound system of two spin-1/2 nucleons. However, one of the most intriguing characteristics of the deuteron is that the tensor polarized structure provides direct access to the quark and gluon distribution of light nuclear system, which cannot be naively constructed from the proton and neutron. We will study the tensor polarized structure functions with the Semi-inclusive Deep Inelastic Scattering (SIDIS) $eD \arrow eP_{h}X$ and Inclusive processes in the available data on deuterated ammonia (ND3) target. We will perform the first ever SIDIS analysis extraction of the tensor structure functions, which can be interpreted in term of completely unexplored tensor polarized TMDs. Our analysis will focus on the extraction of the tensor structure functions b1 from inclusive process, and $F_{U(LL),T}$ and $F^{cos 2\phi_{h}}_{U(LL)}$ from SIDIS. These last two structure functions carry information related to two tensor-polarized TMDs, $f_{1LL}$ and $h^{\perp}_{1LL}$. These initial exploratory measurements of tensor-polarized structure functions will enable the first extraction of spin-1 TMDs and motivate more precise future measurements.</description>

      <title>Parton distribution functions of ground state mesons composed of $c$ or $b$ quarks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07055v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The valence quark parton distribution functions (PDFs) of all ground state heavy mesons that composed of $b$ or $c$ quarks, are discussed; namely, the pseudoscalar $\eta_c(1S)$, $\eta_b(1S)$ and $B_c$, together with the corresponding vector ones, $J/\psi$, $\Upsilon(1S)$ and $B_c^\ast$. We use a QCD-inspired constituent quark model, which has been applied with success to conventional heavy mesons, so that one advantage here is that all parameters have already been fixed by previous studies. The wave functions of the heavy mesons in the rest frame are obtained by solving the Schr\"odinger equation, then boosted to its light-front based on Susskind's Lorentz transformation. The PDFs at the hadron scale, are then obtained by integrating out the transverse momenta of the modulus square of the light-front wave function. Our study shows how the valence quark distributions differ between pseudoscalar and vector mesons, as well as among charmonia, bottomonia and bottom-charmed mesons. Comparisons with other theoretical calculations demonstrate that the PDFs obtained herein are in general narrower but align well with the expected patterns. Moreover, each PDF's point-wise behavior is squeezed with respect to the scale-free parton-like PDF.</description>

      <title>Domain wall evolution beyond quartic potentials: The Sine-Gordon and Christ-Lee potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11323v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Domain walls are the simplest type of topological defects formed at cosmological phase transitions, and one of the most constrained. Their studies typically assume a quartic double well potential, but this model is not fully representative of the range of known or plausible particle physics models. Here we study the cosmological evolution of domain walls in two other classes of potentials. The Sine-Gordon potential allows several types of walls, interpolating between different pairs of minima (which demands specific numerical algorithms to separately measure the relevant properties of each type). The Christ-Lee potential parametrically interpolates between sextic and quartic behavior. We use multiple sets of simulations in two and three spatial dimensions, for various cosmological epochs and under various choices of initial conditions, to discuss the scaling properties of these networks. In the Sine-Gordon case, we identify and quantify deviations from the usual scaling behavior. In the Christ-Lee case, we discuss conditions under which walls form (or not), and quantify how these outcomes depend on parameters such as the energy difference between the false and true vacua and the expansion rate of the Universe. Various biased initial conditions are also addressed in appendices. Finally, we briefly comment on the possible cosmological implications of our results.</description>

Abstract: Collective neutrino oscillations exhibit instabilities that induce appreciable flavor conversion, with crucial astrophysical implications. While the importance of initial phase-space distributions is well-established, a general instability criterion for distributions dependent on both energy and emission angle has been lacking. We identify and analyze the sufficient (and necessary) conditions for a generic collective neutrino flavor instability.</description>

      <title>Anomalies in Hadronic $B$ Decays: an Update</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11492v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, $B\to PP$ decays ($B = \{B^0, B^+, B_s^0\}$, $P = \{ \pi, K \}$) were analyzed under the assumption of flavor SU(3) symmetry (SU(3)$_F$). Although the individual fits to $\Delta S=0$ or $\Delta S=1$ decays are good, it was found that the combined fit is very poor: there is a $3.6\sigma$ disagreement with the SU(3)$_F$ limit of the standard model (SM$_{\rm{SU(3)}_F}$). One can remove this discrepancy by adding SU(3)$_F$-breaking effects, but 1000\% SU(3)$_F$ breaking is required. In this paper, we extend this analysis to include decays in which there is an $\eta$ and/or $\eta'$ meson in the final state. We now find that the combined fit exhibits a $4.1\sigma$ discrepancy with the SM$_{\rm{SU(3)}_F}$, and 1000\% SU(3)$_F$-breaking effects are still required to explain the data. These results are rigorous, group-theoretically -- no theoretical assumptions have been made. But when one adds some theoretical input motivated by QCD factorization, the discrepancy with the SM$_{\rm{SU(3)}_F}$ grows to $4.9\sigma$.</description>

      <title>Implications of the evidence for direct $\mathbf{CP}$ violation in $D\to \pi^+\pi^-$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24338v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The observation of CP violation in the difference of CP asymmetries between $D\to K^+K^-$ and $D\to \pi^+\pi^-$ has raised a debate whether the observed asymmetries can be regarded as a signal of physics beyond the standard model (SM). In this letter we show that the measured observables for $D\to \pi\pi$ unambiguously imply a very large penguin contribution that is larger than $10\%$ of the amplitude for $D^0\to\pi^+ \pi^-$ at a significance greater than $3.3\sigma$. We present arguments based only on unitarity of re-scattering amplitudes to show that large penguins are unlikely to arise from re-scattering and likely indicate physics beyond the SM. In a model independent approach, we show how a very small contribution from physics beyond the SM with a large weak phase alleviates the problem.</description>

      <title>Bayesian inference of the magnetic field and chemical potential on holographic jet quenching in heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00340v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Jet quenching is studied in a background magnetic field and a finite baryon chemical potential. The production of energetic partons is calculated using the next-to-leading order (NLO) perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (pQCD) parton model, while the parton energy loss formula is obtained from the AdS/CFT correspondence incorporating the magnetic field and baryon chemical potential effects. Using Bayesian inference, we systemically compare the theoretical calculations with experimental data for the nuclear modification factor $R_{AA}$ of the large transverse momentum hadrons in different-centrality nucleus-nucleus collisions at 0.2, 2.76 and 5.02 TeV, respectively. The form of the holographic energy loss leads to a strong negative correlation between the magnetic field and the chemical potential after the calibration, from which we discussed the sensitivity of jet quenching phenomena to magnetic field and baryon chemical potential.</description>

      <title>Four-point correlation functions in axion inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02331v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study parity violation in the early universe by examining the four-point correlation function within the axion inflation model. Using an open quantum system formalism from our previous work, we calculate the influence functional to fourth order, from which we then derive the inflaton four-point correlation function. When we decompose this function using isotropic basis functions, the expansion coefficients $\zeta_{\ell',\ell'',\ell'''}$ naturally split into parity-even and parity-odd components. In the large $\xi$ approximation, which enhances the production of right-handed photons in the model, the derivation of these coefficients simplifies. We work out the lowest-order nonvanishing parity-odd $\zeta_{234}$ term which clearly indicates the presence of parity violation. Moreover, our derived values of the coefficients are consistent with recent observational data from galaxy surveys.</description>

      <title>Exotic multistrange-anticharm baryon systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09262v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study exotic baryon systems composed of anticharmed mesons and strange baryons using the extended local hidden gauge approach. By solving the coupled-channel Bethe-Salpeter equation with interaction kernels from vector meson exchange, we explore the formation of hadronic molecular states in sectors with strangeness $S = -1$, $-2$, $-3$ and $-4$. A bound state with a mass of 2888 MeV is found in the $S = -1$ sector with the channels $\bar{D}_s N, ~\bar{D} \Lambda, ~\bar{D} \Sigma$. In the $S = -2$ sector, a bound state appears at 3057 MeV with the channels $\bar{D}_s \Lambda, ~\bar{D} \Xi$. No bound states are generated in the $S = -3$ ($\bar{D}_s \Xi$) and in the $S=-4$ sector ($\bar{D}_s \Omega$) because the interaction is repulsive in both cases. We also investigate vector-baryon systems with $\bar{D}^*$ and $\bar{D}_s^*$ mesons, finding similar but more deeply bound states. The results show that bound exotic states are more likely when one or two strange quarks are present. These results highlight the strangeness dependence of the molecular formation mechanism and provide theoretical predictions that can guide future experimental searches for exotic multistrange-anticharm baryon systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.12861v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the light and heavy quark mass dependence of the low-lying charmed mesons in the framework of one-loop HH$\chi$PT. The low energy constants are determined by analyzing the available lattice data from different LQCD simulations. Model selection tools are implemented to determine the relevant parameters as required by data with a higher precision. Discretization and other effects due to the charm quark mass setting are discussed.</description>

      <title>Stairway to equilibrium entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04529v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the time evolution of the non-equilibrium entropy in the homogeneous isotropization dynamics of the 1RCBH model, which has a critical point in its conformal phase diagram defined at finite temperature and R-charge density. We also evaluate the time evolution of the pressure anisotropy and the scalar condensate of the medium. We disclose a new feature (not present in the Bjorken flow dynamics analyzed in previous works), which is observed for all the analyzed initial data: the formation of a periodic sequence of several close plateaus in the form of a stairway for the entropy density near thermodynamic equilibrium. We find that the period of plateau formation in the stairway is half the period of oscillations of the slowest quasinormal mode of the system, which is therefore strongly tied to the late time dissipative dynamics of the system associated to the irreversibility of entropy production. For the particular case of the purely thermal SYM plasma at zero density and vanishing scalar condensate, we find that the period of the stairway is half the period of oscillations of the slowest quasinormal mode associated to the late time equilibration of the pressure anisotropy of the fluid, while at finite chemical potential the slowest quasinormal mode of the system is associated to the late time equilibration of the scalar condensate.</description>

      <title>Unraveling Trace Anomaly of Supradense Matter via Neutron Star Compactness Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05025v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The trace anomaly $\Delta\equiv 1/3-P/\varepsilon=1/3-\phi$ quantifies the possibly broken conformal symmetry in supradense matter under pressure $P$ at energy density $\varepsilon$. Perturbative QCD (pQCD) predicts a vanishing $\Delta$ at extremely high energy or baryon densities when the conformal symmetry is realized but its behavior at intermediate densities reachable in neutron stars (NSs) are still very uncertain. The extraction of $\Delta$ from NS observations strongly depends on the employed model for nuclear Equation of State (EOS). Using the IPAD-TOV method based on an Intrinsic and Perturbatively Analysis of the Dimensionless (IPAD) Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations that are further verified numerically by using $10^5$ EOSs generated randomly with a meta-model in a very broad EOS parameter space constrained by terrestrial nuclear experiments and astrophysical observations, here we first show that the compactness $\xi\equiv GM_{\rm{NS}}/Rc^2\equiv M_{\rm{NS}}/R$ of a NS with mass $M_{\rm{NS}}$ and radius $R$ scales very accurately with $\overline{\Pi}_{\rm{c}}\equiv\Pi_{\rm{c}}\cdot(1+18\x/25)\equiv\x/(1+3\x^2+4\x)\cdot(1+18\rm{X}/25)$ where $\x\equiv\phi_{\rm{c}}= P_{\rm{c}}/\varepsilon_{\rm{c}}$ is the ratio of pressure over energy density at NS centers. The scaling of NS compactness thus enables one to readily read off the central trace anomaly $\Delta_{\rm{c}}=1/3-\x$ directly from the observational data of either the mass-radius or red-shift measurements. We then demonstrate indeed that the available NS data themselves from recent X-ray and gravitational wave observations can determine model-insensitively the trace anomaly as a function of energy density in NS cores, providing a stringent test of existing NS models and a clear guidance in a new direction for further understanding the nature and EOS of supradense matter.</description>

      <title>Searching for Axion-Like Particles with X-ray Observations of Alpha Centauri</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16065v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the production of axion-like particles (ALPs) in stellar cores, where they interact with electromagnetic fields and electrons, with typical masses between $\mathcal O(0.1)$ and $\mathcal O(10)$ keV. These low-energy ALPs are gravitationally trapped in the orbits of stars and subsequently decay into two photons that we detect as monochromatic X-ray lines. We propose to search for these gravitationally trapped ALPs in the Alpha Centauri binary system, our closest stellar neighbor, using sensitive X-ray detectors like Chandra and eROSITA. Our search for ALP decay signals in the energy range of $0.2$ keV to $10$ keV yielded null results, thus establishing the most stringent limits on ALP interactions to date. In the case of ALP-electron coupling $g_{aee}\leq 10^{-15}$, we have improved the limits on the ALP-photon coupling $g_{a\gamma\gamma}$ in ALP mass range between $0.25~\keV$ and $5~\keV$, compared to previous measurements, including those from GW170817, SN 2023ixf, and other sources, and specially the improvement reaches about 2 orders of magnitude at the mass of 2 keV. Even tighter constraints are set for larger $g_{aee}$.</description>

      <title>Combining strongly lensed and unlensed fast radio bursts: To be a more precise late-universe probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03126v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Macquart relation and time-delay cosmography are now two promising ways to fast radio burst (FRB) cosmology. In this work, we propose a joint method that combines strongly lensed and unlensed FRBs for improving cosmological parameter estimation by using simulated FRB data from the future sensitive coherent all-sky monitor survey, which is expected to detect a large number of FRBs including galaxy-galaxy strongly lensed events. We find that using a detectable sample of 100,000 localized FRBs including $40$ lensed events can simultaneously constrain the Hubble constant and the equation of state of dark energy, with high precision of $\varepsilon(H_0)=0.4\%$ and $\varepsilon(w)=4.5\%$ in the simplest dynamical dark energy model. The joint analysis of unlensed and lensed FRBs significantly improves the constraint on $H_0$, which could be more effective than combining either the unlensed FRBs with future gravitational wave (GW) standard sirens or the lensed FRBs with CMB. Furthermore, combining the full FRB sample with the CMB+BAO+SNe data yields $\sigma(H_0)=0.29~{\rm km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}$, $\sigma(w_0)=0.046$, and $\sigma(w_a)=0.15$ in the two-parameter dynamical dark energy model, which outperform the results from the CMB+BAO+SNe+GW data. This reinforces the cosmological implications of a multi-wavelength observational strategy in optical and radio bands. We conclude that the future FRB observations will shed light on the nature of dark energy and also the Hubble tension if enough events with long-duration lensing are incorporated.</description>

      <title>Sphere free energy of scalar field theories with cubic interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14086v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dimensional continuation approach to calculating the free energy of $d$-dimensional Euclidean CFT on the round sphere $S^d$ has been used to develop its $4-\epsilon$ expansion for a number of well-known non-supersymmetric theories, such as the $O(N)$ model. The resulting estimate of the sphere free energy $F$ in the 3D Ising model has turned out to be in good agreement with the numerical value obtained using the fuzzy sphere regularization. In this paper, we develop the $6-\epsilon$ expansions for CFTs on $S^d$ described by scalar field theory with cubic interactions and use their resummations to estimate the values of $F$. In particular, we study the theories with purely imaginary coupling constants, which describe non-unitary universality classes arising when certain conformal minimal models are continued above two dimensions. The Yang-Lee model $M(2,5)$ is described by a field theory with one scalar field, while the $D$-series $M(3,8)$ model is described by two scalar fields. We also study the $OSp(1|2)$ symmetric cubic theory of one commuting and two anti-commuting scalar fields, which appears to describe the critical behavior of random spanning forests. In the course of our work, we revisit the calculations of beta functions of marginal operators containing the curvature. We also use another method for approximating $F$, which relies on perturbation theory around the bilocal action near the long-range/short-range crossover. The numerical values it gives for $F$ tend to be in good agreement with other available methods.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing neutrinoless double beta decay event kinematics in a xenon gas detector with vertex tagging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10198v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: If neutrinoless double beta decay is discovered, the next natural step would be understanding the lepton number violating physics responsible for it. Several alternatives exist beyond the exchange of light neutrinos. Some of these mechanisms can be distinguished by measuring phase-space observables, namely the opening angle $\cos\theta$ among the two decay electrons, and the electron energy spectra, $T_1$ and $T_2$. In this work, we study the statistical accuracy and precision in measuring these kinematic observables in a future xenon gas detector with the added capability to precisely locate the decay vertex. For realistic detector conditions (a gas pressure of 10 bar and spatial resolution of 4 mm), we find that the average $\overline{\cos\theta}$ and $\overline{T_1}$ values can be reconstructed with a precision of 0.19 and 110 keV, respectively, assuming that only 10 neutrinoless double beta decay events are detected.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19704v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the Gross-Llewellyn Smith sum rule, i.e. the lowest odd moment of the parity-violating structure function, $F_3$, of the nucleon from a lattice QCD calculation of the Compton amplitude. Our calculations are performed on $48^3 \times 96$ lattices at the $SU(3)$ symmetric point for two lattice spacings. We extract the moments for several values of the current momenta in the range $0.5 \lesssim Q^2 \lesssim 10 \; {\rm GeV}^2$, covering both the nonperturbative and perturbative regimes. We compare our moments to the Gross-Llewellyn Smith sum rule and discuss the implications for higher-twist effects, a determination of $\alpha_s(Q^2)$ from a hadronic quantity complementing the phenomenological and other lattice approaches, and electroweak box contributions crucial for Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix unitarity studies.</description>

Abstract: The secondary/primary cosmic-ray ratios and the diffuse backgrounds of gamma rays and neutrinos provide us with complementary information about the transport of Galactic cosmic rays~(CRs). We used the recent measurement of the diffuse gamma ray background in the $\sim \rm TeV -\rm PeV$ range by LHAASO and of the very high-energy diffuse neutrino background from the Galactic disc by IceCube to show that CRs may be accumulating an approximately energy independent grammage $X\sim 0.4\, \rm g \, \rm cm^{-2}$, in regions where gamma rays and neutrinos are produced with a hard spectrum, resembling the source spectrum. We speculate that this grammage reflects the early stages of cosmic ray transport around sources, in what are referred to as cocoons, where particles spend $\sim 0.3\, \rm Myr$ before starting their journey in the Galactic environment.</description>

      <title>New constraints on interacting dark energy from DESI DR2 BAO observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23225v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In its second data release (DR2), the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) publicly released measurements of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) from over 13.1 million galaxies and 1.6 million quasars, covering the redshift range $0.295 \leq z \leq 2.330$. In this work, we investigate the impact of this new dataset on dark sector interaction models, which are motivated by non-gravitational interactions between dark energy (DE) and dark matter (DM), commonly referred to as interacting dark energy models (IDE). We focus on two frameworks: the traditional IDE model and the recently proposed sign-switching Interacting model (S-IDE), aiming to derive new and robust constraints on both scenarios. After carefully selecting the sample for the joint analysis, ensuring compatibility among the data without significant tension, our main results indicate that both models can alleviate the $H_0$ tension, reducing it to moderate tension approximately $2.7\sigma$. The IDE model shows compatibility with the latest $S_8$ constraints from cosmic shear surveys, while the S-IDE model predicts lower values of $S_8$, which align with alternative perspectives on the $S_8$ tension. For the traditional IDE model, we derive new bounds for the coupling parameter, marking the strongest constraints to date through geometric measurements. This highlights the crucial role that supernova samples can play in refining these constraints. For the S-IDE model, we find mild evidence (over $2\sigma$) for a non-zero coupling, once the PantheonPlus dataset calibrated with Cepheid-based magnitude measurements is included in the analysis.</description>
