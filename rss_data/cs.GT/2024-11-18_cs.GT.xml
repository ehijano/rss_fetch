      <title>To Optimize Human-in-the-loop Learning in Repeated Routing Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Today navigation applications (e.g., Waze and Google Maps) enable human users to learn and share the latest traffic observations, yet such information sharing simply aids selfish users to predict and choose the shortest paths to jam each other. Prior routing game studies focus on myopic users in oversimplified one-shot scenarios to regulate selfish routing via information hiding or pricing mechanisms. For practical human-in-the-loop learning (HILL) in repeated routing games, we face non-myopic users of differential past observations and need new mechanisms (preferably non-monetary) to persuade users to adhere to the optimal path recommendations. We model the repeated routing game in a typical parallel transportation network, which generally contains one deterministic path and $N$ stochastic paths. We first prove that no matter under the information sharing mechanism in use or the latest routing literature's hiding mechanism, the resultant price of anarchy (PoA) for measuring the efficiency loss from social optimum can approach infinity, telling arbitrarily poor exploration-exploitation tradeoff over time. Then we propose a novel user-differential probabilistic recommendation (UPR) mechanism to differentiate and randomize path recommendations for users with differential learning histories. We prove that our UPR mechanism ensures interim individual rationality for all users and significantly reduces $\text{PoA}=\infty$ to close-to-optimal $\text{PoA}=1+\frac{1}{4N+3}$, which cannot be further reduced by any other non-monetary mechanism. In addition to theoretical analysis, we conduct extensive experiments using real-world datasets to generalize our routing graphs and validate the close-to-optimal performance of UPR mechanism.</description>

      <title>Game Theoretic Liquidity Provisioning in Concentrated Liquidity Market Makers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated marker makers (AMMs) are a class of decentralized exchanges that enable the automated trading of digital assets. They accept deposits of digital tokens from liquidity providers (LPs); tokens can be used by traders to execute trades, which generate fees for the investing LPs. The distinguishing feature of AMMs is that trade prices are determined algorithmically, unlike classical limit order books. Concentrated liquidity market makers (CLMMs) are a major class of AMMs that offer liquidity providers flexibility to decide not only \emph{how much} liquidity to provide, but \emph{in what ranges of prices} they want the liquidity to be used. This flexibility can complicate strategic planning, since fee rewards are shared among LPs. We formulate and analyze a game theoretic model to study the incentives of LPs in CLMMs. Our main results show that while our original formulation admits multiple Nash equilibria and has complexity quadratic in the number of price ticks in the contract, it can be reduced to a game with a unique Nash equilibrium whose complexity is only linear. We further show that the Nash equilibrium of this simplified game follows a waterfilling strategy, in which low-budget LPs use up their full budget, but rich LPs do not. Finally, by fitting our game model to real-world CLMMs, we observe that in liquidity pools with risky assets, LPs adopt investment strategies far from the Nash equilibrium. Under price uncertainty, they generally invest in fewer and wider price ranges than our analysis suggests, with lower-frequency liquidity updates. We show that across several pools, by updating their strategy to more closely match the Nash equilibrium of our game, LPs can improve their median daily returns by \$116, which corresponds to an increase of 0.009\% in median daily return on investment.</description>

      <title>Fair Division via the Cake-Cutting Share</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the classic fair division problem of allocating $m$ divisible items to $n$ agents with linear valuations over the items. We define novel notions of fair shares from the perspective of individual agents via the cake-cutting process. These shares generalize the notion of proportionality by taking into account the valuations of other agents via constraints capturing envy. We study what fraction (approximation) of these shares are achievable in the worst case, and present tight and non-trivial approximation bounds as a function of $n$ and $m$. In particular, we show a tight approximation bound of $\Theta(\sqrt{n})$ for various notions of such shares. We show this bound via a novel application of dual fitting, which may be of independent interest. We also present a bound of $O(m^{2/3})$ for a strict notion of share, with an almost matching lower bound. We further develop weaker notions of shares whose approximation bounds interpolate smoothly between proportionality and the shares described above. We finally present empirical results showing that our definitions lead to more reasonable shares than the standard fair share notion of proportionality.</description>

      <title>Space-Air-Ground Integrated MEC-Assisted Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems: An Online Decentralized Optimization Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cloud computing and edge/fog computing are playing a pivotal role in driving the transformation of industrial cyber-physical systems (ICPS) towards greater intelligence and automation by providing high-quality computation offloading services to Internet of Things devices (IoTDs). Recently, space-air-ground integrated multi-access edge computing (SAGIMEC) is emerging as a promising architecture combining edge computing and cloud computing, which has the potential to be integrated with ICPS to accelerate the realization of the above vision. In this work, we first present an SAGIMEC-assisted ICPS architecture that incorporates edge computing and cloud computing through seamless connectivity supported by satellite networks to achieve determinism in connectivity, networked computing, and intelligent networked control. Then, we formulate a joint satellite selection, computation offloading, communication resource allocation, computation resource allocation, and UAV trajectory control optimization problem (JSC4OP) to maximize the quality of service (QoS) of IoTDs. This problem considers both the dynamics and uncertainties of the system environment, as well as the limited resources and energy of UAVs. Given the complexity of JSC4OP, we propose an online decentralized optimization approach (ODOA) to solve the problem. Specifically, JSC4OP is first transformed into a real-time decision-making optimization problem (RDOP) by leveraging Lyapunov optimization. Then, to solve the RDOP, we introduce an online learning-based latency prediction method to predict the uncertain system environment and a game theoretic decision-making method to make real-time decisions. Finally, theoretical analysis confirms the effectiveness of the ODOA, while the simulation results demonstrate that the proposed ODOA outperforms other alternative approaches in terms of overall system performance.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Envy-Free Permanency in Child Welfare Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09817v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Caseworkers in foster care systems seek to place waiting children in the most suitable homes. Furthermore, social work guidelines prioritize heterogeneous attributes of children and homes when deliberating placements. We use insights from market design and dynamic matching to characterize a class of dynamically envy-free mechanisms that incentivize expedient placements when children and homes arrive to the market over time and homes may accept or decline placements. The mechanisms have robustness against justified envy and costly patience. We analyze strategic incentives and efficiency properties of dynamic envy-freeness. Finally, we conduct empirical simulations that affirm that our mechanisms drastically increase placements and reduce waiting costs while maintaining robustness to prediction error versus a naive mechanism that always sequentially runs Deferred Acceptance. Practitioners can implement our mechanisms through assigning priority to child-home matches.</description>

      <title>Optimal Capacity Modification for Strongly Stable Matchings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the Hospital/Residents (HR) problem in the presence of ties in preference lists. Among the three notions of stability, viz. weak, strong, and super stability, we focus on the notion of strong stability. Strong stability has many desirable properties both theoretically and practically; however, its existence is not guaranteed.
  In this paper, our objective is to optimally increase the quotas of hospitals to ensure that a strongly stable matching exists in the modified instance. First, we show that if ties are allowed in residents' preference lists, it may not be possible to augment the hospital quotas to obtain an instance that admits a strongly stable matching. When residents' preference lists are strict, we explore two natural optimization criteria: (i) minimizing the maximum capacity increase for any hospital (MINMAX), and (ii) minimizing the total capacity increase across all hospitals (MINSUM). We show that the MINMAX problem is NP-hard in general. When hospital preference lists can have ties of length at most $\ell+1$, we give a polynomial-time algorithm that increases each hospital's quota by at most $\ell$, ensuring the resulting instance admits a strongly stable matching.
  We show that the MINSUM problem admits a polynomial-time algorithm. However, when each hospital incurs a cost for each capacity increase, the problem becomes NP-hard, even if the costs are 0 or 1. This also implies that the problem cannot be approximated to any multiplicative factor. We also consider a related problem under the MINSUM objective. Given an HR instance and a forced pair $(r^*,h^*)$, the goal is to decide if it is possible to increase hospital quotas (if necessary) to obtain a strongly stable matching that matches the pair $(r^*,h^*)$. We show a polynomial-time algorithm for this problem.</description>

      <title>Static network structure cannot stabilize cooperation among Large Language Model agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to model human social behavior, with recent research exploring their ability to simulate social dynamics. Here, we test whether LLMs mirror human behavior in social dilemmas, where individual and collective interests conflict. Humans generally cooperate more than expected in laboratory settings, showing less cooperation in well-mixed populations but more in fixed networks. In contrast, LLMs tend to exhibit greater cooperation in well-mixed settings. This raises a key question: Are LLMs about to emulate human behavior in cooperative dilemmas on networks? In this study, we examine networked interactions where agents repeatedly engage in the Prisoner's Dilemma within both well-mixed and structured network configurations, aiming to identify parallels in cooperative behavior between LLMs and humans. Our findings indicate critical distinctions: while humans tend to cooperate more within structured networks, LLMs display increased cooperation mainly in well-mixed environments, with limited adjustment to networked contexts. Notably, LLM cooperation also varies across model types, illustrating the complexities of replicating human-like social adaptability in artificial agents. These results highlight a crucial gap: LLMs struggle to emulate the nuanced, adaptive social strategies humans deploy in fixed networks. Unlike human participants, LLMs do not alter their cooperative behavior in response to network structures or evolving social contexts, missing the reciprocity norms that humans adaptively employ. This limitation points to a fundamental need in future LLM design -- to integrate a deeper comprehension of social norms, enabling more authentic modeling of human-like cooperation and adaptability in networked environments.</description>

      <title>On complete classes of valuated matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.06961v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We characterize a rich class of valuated matroids, called R-minor valuated matroids that includes the indicator functions of matroids, and is closed under operations such as taking minors, duality, and induction by network. We exhibit a family of valuated matroids that are not R-minor based on sparse paving matroids. Valuated matroids are inherently related to gross substitute valuations in mathematical economics. By the same token we refute the Matroid Based Valuation Conjecture by Ostrovsky and Paes Leme (Theoretical Economics 2015) asserting that every gross substitute valuation arises from weighted matroid rank functions by repeated applications of merge and endowment operations. Our result also has implications in the context of Lorentzian polynomials: it reveals the limitations of known construction operations.</description>
