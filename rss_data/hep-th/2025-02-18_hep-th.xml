      <title>Higher-Dimensional Fermionic SYK Model in IR Region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the 2D fermionic SYK model with Majorana fermions, featuring a kinetic term with a quartic expression and a $2q$-body interaction with Gaussian disorder. By minimizing the effective action or solving the SD equation for $q=1$, we determine that the appropriate ansatz involves zero spins. Our computation of the Lyapunov exponent shows violations of chaos and unitarity bounds. The gravitational dual corresponds to AdS$_3$ Einstein gravity with a finite radial cut-off even if we lose the non-zero spins. We also extend the SYK model to higher dimensions while maintaining a similar SD equation in the IR.</description>

      <title>Holographic timelike entanglement and $c$ theorem for supersymmetric QFTs in ($ 0+1 $)d</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a holographic set up that computes timelike Entanglement Entropy (tEE) in $ (0+1) $d QFTs preserving some amount of SUSY. The first example we consider is that of $\mathcal{N}=2$ matrix models with massive deformations. These are dual to non-Abelian T-dual of $AdS_5 \times S^5$ that asymptotes to \emph{smeared} D0 branes. The second example, that we consider is of $ \mathcal{N}=4 $ superconformal quantum mechanical quivers in ($ 0+1 $)d that are dual to a class of type IIB backgrounds with an $ AdS_2 $ factor. In both of these examples, tEE reveals a remarkable similarity with holographic $ c $ function pertaining to a RG flow. We further compute the complexity in these models, which also reveals an identical behaviour indicating the fact that tEE is a measure of number of degrees of freedom for these ($ 0+1 $)d SQFTs in a RG flow from UV to deep IR.</description>

      <title>Classical elasticity meets quantum complexity: A connection from the holographic lens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the effects of shear deformations in a wide class of holographic amorphous solids. It is found that both the shear stress and the complexity of formation grow with the increase of the shear strain. Notably, in the regime of very large shear, they exhibit coordinated behavior and adhere to a universal scaling relation, uncovering a surprising connection between two seemingly unrelated aspects of amorphous systems. Furthermore, our findings also provide a counterexample to the previous understanding that the complexity scales linearly with the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy for large static black holes.</description>

      <title>The Holography of the 2D inhomogeneously deformed CFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We systematically study inhomogeneous Hamiltonians in two-dimensional conformal field theories within the framework of the AdS/CFT correspondence by relating them to two-dimensional curved backgrounds. We propose a classification of inhomogeneous Hamiltonians based on the Virasoro coadjoint orbit. The corresponding bulk dual geometries are described by the generalized Ba$\tilde{\text{n}}$ados solutions, for which we introduce a generalized Roberts mapping to facilitate their study. Our classification provides previously underexplored classes of deformations, offering fresh insights into their holographic properties. Revisiting the well-known example of the M$\ddot{\text{o}}$bius Hamiltonian, we establish a connection to the 3D C-metric, which describes three-dimensional accelerating solutions. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to KdV-type asymptotic boundary conditions, revealing a broader class of solvable inhomogeneous Hamiltonians that are not linear combinations of Virasoro charges but instead involve KdV charges.</description>

      <title>Tunnels Under Geometries (or Instantons Know Their Algebras)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the tight binding model with multiple degenerate vacua we might treat wave function overlaps as instanton tunnelings between different wells (vacua). An amplitude for such a tunneling process might be constructed as $\mathsf{T}_{i\to j}\sim e^{-S_{\mathrm{ inst}}}{\mathbf{v}}_j^{+}{\mathbf{v}}_i^{-}$, where there is canonical instanton action suppression, and $\mathbf{v}_i^{-}$ annihilates a particle in the $i^{\mathrm{th}}$ vacuum, whereas $\mathbf{v}_j^{+}$ creates a particle in the $j^{\mathrm{th}}$ vacuum. Adiabatic change of the wells leads to a Berry-phase evolution of the couplings, which is described by the zero-curvature Gauss-Manin connection i.e. by a quantum $R$-matrix. Zero-curvature is actually a consequence of level repulsion or topological protection, and its implication is the Yang-Baxter relation for the $R$-matrices. In the simplest case the story is pure Abelian and not very exciting. But when the model becomes more involved, incorporates supersymmetry, gauge and other symmetries, such amplitudes obtain more intricate structures. Operators $\mathbf{v}_i^{-}$, $\mathbf{v}_j^{+}$ might also evolve from ordinary Heisenberg operators into a more sophisticated algebraic object -- a ``tunneling algebra''. The result for the tunneling algebra would depend strongly on geometry of the QFT we started with, and, unfortunately, at the moment we are unable to solve the reverse engineering problem. In this note we revise few successful cases of the aforementioned correspondence: quantum algebras $U_q(\mathfrak{g})$ and affine Yangians $Y(\hat{\mathfrak{g}})$. For affine Yangians we demonstrate explicitly how instantons ``perform'' equivariant integrals over associated quiver moduli spaces appearing in the alternative geometric construction.</description>

      <title>On the relevance of GIKS instability of charged N=4 SYM plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently Gladden, Ivo, Kovtun, and Starinets (GIKS) identified a novel instability of ${\cal N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills plasma with a diagonal $U(1)$ $R$-symmetry chemical potential. Since ${\cal N}=4$ SYM plasma has $R$-charged matter fields, it might suffer from the standard superconducting instability. We show that while the superconducting instability is indeed present, it happens at a lower critical temperature compare to that of the GIKS instability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The horizon of black hole is surrounded by the photon sphere and an outside observer cannot easily examine the geometry inside the photon sphere. In this note, we propose a way to investigate the region from dual conformal field theory by making use of AdS/CFT correspondence. We first construct gravaster geometry as an asymptotic anti-de Sitter spacetime, where the region inside the photon sphere is replaced by a horizon-less geometry. It is known that bulk-cone singularities in the retarded Green function in dual conformal field theory can encode the bulk null geodesics. We then compute numerically the retarded Green function from the bulk theory and observe bulk-cone singularities corresponding to null geodesics traveling into the interior region. In this way, we show that it is possible to examine the region inside the photon sphere from bulk-cone singularities of dual conformal field theory.</description>

Abstract: This is the writeup of lectures delivered in Asian Pacific introductory school on superstring and the related topics in Beijing (2006) and the expanded version of these lectures in the 3rd summer school on strings, fields and holography in Nanjing (2023). It intends to give a historical as well as a pedagogical account of the development in finding the 1/2 BPS extended string solitons in the early stage of the so-called second string revolution before which those objects were thought to be unrelated to strings. Non-susy solutions which are related to brane/anti brane systems or non-BPS systems are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Entanglement and Effective Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of geometric phases in chiral transformations within gauge theories coupled to fermions. We begin by analyzing the Schwinger model in (1+1) dimensions, where chiral symmetry is explicitly modified due to the dynamical generation of a photon mass. This model provides a controlled setting to study the interplay between anomalies and vacuum structure.
  Building on these insights, we extend our analysis to four-dimensional QED by promoting the vacuum angle $\theta$ to a dynamical field $\theta(x)$. This generalization allows us to explore how the axial anomaly and the presence of a nontrivial vacuum structure modify the conventional chiral symmetry.
  Using the adiabatic approximation, we demonstrate that chiral transformations are modified by the emergence of a nontrivial Berry phase, which introduces a geometric correction that depends on the topological properties of the vacuum. This result suggests that chiral transformations acquire an effective gauge structure in parameter space, in the presence of a dynamical $\theta(x)$ field, leading to new physical consequences at low energies.
  This framework establishes a novel connection between chiral symmetries, anomalies, and geometric phases, offering a unified approach to describing topological effects, vacuum structure, and infrared modifications in gauge theories with fermions. Moreover, our results suggest that Berry phases play a crucial role in the infrared structure of QED, potentially providing a mechanism for regularizing infrared divergences in theories with axial anomalies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A nearest-neighbor, frustration-free spin $\frac{1}{2}$ chain can be constructed {\it via} projectors of various ranks \'{a} la Bravyi-Gosset. We show that in the rank 1 case this system is gapped and has two ground states resembling ferromagnetic states. These states spontaneously break the non-invertible symmetry connecting them. The latter is proved using the machinery of algebraic quantum theory. The non-invertible symmetries of this system do not come from a duality.</description>

      <title>Multipoint conformal integrals in $D$ dimensions. Part I: Bipartite Mellin-Barnes representation and reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a systematic approach to calculating $n$-point one-loop parametric conformal integrals in $D$ dimensions which we call the reconstruction procedure. It relies on decomposing a conformal integral over basis functions which are generated from a set of master functions by acting with the cyclic group $\mathbb{Z}_n$. In order to identify the master functions we introduce a bipartite Mellin-Barnes representation by means of splitting a given conformal integral into two additive parts, one of which can be evaluated explicitly in terms of multivariate generalized hypergeometric series.
  For the box and pentagon integrals (i.e. $n=4,5$) we show that a computable part of the bipartite representation contains all master functions. In particular, this allows us to evaluate the parametric pentagon integral as a sum of ten basis functions generated from two master functions by the cyclic group $\mathbb{Z}_5$. The resulting expression can be tested in two ways. First, when one of propagator powers is set to zero, the pentagon integral is reduced to the known box integral, which is also rederived through the reconstruction procedure. Second, going to the non-parametric case, we reproduce the known expression for the pentagon integral given in terms of logarithms derived earlier within the geometric approach to calculating conformal integrals.
  We conclude by considering the hexagon integral ($n=6$) for which we show that those basis functions which follow from the computable part of the bipartite representation are not enough and more basis functions are required. In the second part of our project we will describe a method of constructing a complete set of master/basis functions in the $n$-point case.</description>

      <title>RG-stable parameter relations of a scalar field theory in absence of a symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stability of tree-level relations among the parameters of a quantum field theory with respect to renormalization group (RG) running is typically explained by the existence of a symmetry. We examine a toy model of a quantum field theory of two real scalars in which a tree-level relation among the squared-mass parameters of the scalar potential appears to be RG-stable without the presence of an appropriate underlying symmetry. The stability of this relation with respect to renormalization group running can be explained by complexifying the original scalar field theory. It is then possible to exhibit a symmetry that guarantees the relations of relevant beta functions of squared-mass parameters of the complexified theory. Among these relations, we can identify equations that are algebraically identical to the corresponding equations that guarantee the stability of the relations among the squared-mass parameters of the original real scalar field theory where the symmetry of the complexified theory is no longer present.</description>

      <title>Heavy-flavor multimodal fragmentation to $S$-wave pentacharms at next-generation hadron colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the leading-power fragmentation of fully charmed pentaquark states ($S$-wave $|c\bar{c}ccc\rangle$ pentacharms) at hadron colliders. We introduce a new set of hadron-structure-oriented, multimodal collinear fragmentation functions, named PQ5Q1.0. They rely on an enhanced calculation of the initial-scale input for the constituent heavy-quark fragmentation channel, making them well suited to describe the short-distance emission of either a compact multicharm state or a dicharm-charm-dicharm configuration. To explore phenomenological implications, we use the (sym)JETHAD multimodular interface to study NLL/NLO$^+$ semi-inclusive production rates for pentacharm-plus-jet systems at the forthcoming HL-LHC and the future FCC. Our analysis represents a further step toward bridging the domains of hadronic structure, precision QCD, and exotic matter.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate that introducing a deformed algebra with a minimum length modifies the field equations for an inhomogeneous spacetime, resulting in the emergence of acceleration. Specifically, we examine the analytic effects of the Generalized Uncertainty Principle on the classical field equations of the Szekeres system. Our findings show that the deformed algebra leads to a modified Szekeres system capable of describing cosmic acceleration. Moreover, the spatial curvature of the spacetime is influenced by the presence of the minimum length.</description>

      <title>Natural weak mixing angle under $\text{U}(1, 3)$ colored gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Colored gravity, based on $\text{U}(1,3)$ symmetry, emerges naturally in the complexification of Lorentzian manifolds and integrates U(1) electromagnetism as a subcase. This work explores the viability of also including strong and electroweak interactions under the $\text{U}(1,3)$ gauge group of colored gravity. We identify specific generators linked to leptonic and quark interactions and embed the standard Higgs mechanism. Crucially, the weak mixing angle ($\sin^2\theta_W$) is predicted to exhibit about $\sim0.231$ for lepton-lepton interactions (close to observations) and $\sim0.222$ for hadron-lepton interactions, which is in 3$\sigma$ tension with some observations. These findings open pathways for reconciling experimental data with colored gravity and suggest avenues for quantum correction studies.</description>

      <title>Into the vortex: quasinormal and quasibound spectra of rotating acoustic geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strong-field gravity simulators are laboratory experiments that can investigate a wide range of both classical and quantum phenomena occurring in nature. In this work, we introduce an effective geometry that captures most of the characteristics of the strong-field regime of astrophysical, rotating black holes. This geometry can represent a vortex made from a variety of fluid and superfluid profiles with zero viscosity, making it a promising finite-temperature quantum-field-theory simulator for rotating curved spacetimes. Our geometry includes not only the typical radial flow which gives rise to an acoustic horizon, but also azimuthal circulation of the fluid. We compute the quasinormal modes, semi-analytically, and the exact quasibound states of acoustic excitations interacting with this effective geometry. The resulting spectra can be identified for both co-rotating and counter-rotating surface acoustic waves. In particular, the behavior of our acoustic geometry with circulation aligns with the phenomenology observed in recent experiments that include superfluids.</description>

      <title>Gravitational lensing by charged black hole with global monopole in strong field limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate gravitational lensing near a charged black hole with a global monopole in the strong field regime, focusing on two key observables: the angular separation between the first and subsequent images, and the ratio of the flux intensity of the first image to the cumulative flux intensity of all other images. By deriving analytical expressions for these observables, we explore the combined effects of the global monopole and black hole charge both analytically and numerically. Our results reveal that the dependence of the angular separation on charge is intricately tied to the deficit angle caused by the global monopole. In particular, we identify three critical values of the global monopole parameter that determine whether the angular separation increases monotonically, decreases monotonically, or exhibits extrema as the charge varies. A similar complex dependence is found for the flux ratio as a function of the deficit angle. These behaviors contrast sharply with the monotonic changes observed in the absence of either a global monopole or charge. Our findings highlight that the effects of the charge and global monopole on gravitational lensing cannot be described as simple additive contributions. Instead, their combined effects lead to a rich and interdependent behavior that enhances our understanding of strong-field gravitational lensing. While the charge and global monopole are expected to be small in typical astrophysical contexts, the results presented here could be experimentally explored in analogue gravity systems, where these parameters are not constrained. This opens the door to potential experimental verification of the phenomena predicted in this study.</description>

      <title>The sinusoidal valley: a recipe for high peaks in the scalar and induced tensor spectra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adding a sine-type interaction to inflationary models with two fields can evoke a classical trajectory with many turns in field space. Under conditions we discuss, the enhancement of the spectrum of adiabatic fluctuations resulting from each turn adds up. A special range of scales away from the CMB-constrained region can then be enhanced by several orders of magnitude, allowing for interesting phenomenological possibilities, such as induced gravitational waves or primordial black holes. A localized version of this interaction can also be used as an add-on to conventional inflationary models, thus allowing the injection of the large peak in their power spectra. The intuition and the conclusions drawn from this simple model remain relevant for more complicated applications that usually include extra terms that obscure the simplicity of the mechanism.</description>

      <title>Axisymmetric black hole in a non-commutative gauge theory: classical and quantum gravity effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work explores both classical and quantum aspects of an axisymmetric black hole within a non-commutative gauge theory. The rotating solution is derived using a modified Newman-Janis procedure. The analysis begins with the horizon structure, ergospheres, and angular velocity. The thermodynamic properties are examined through surface gravity, focusing on the Hawking temperature, entropy, and heat capacity. In addition, the remnant mass is calculated. The Hawking radiation is treated as a tunneling process for bosonic and fermionic particles, along with the corresponding particle creation density. Geodesic motion is explored, emphasizing null geodesics, radial accelerations, the photon sphere, and black hole shadows. Finally, the gravitational lensing in the strong deflection limit is investigated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, several papers have claimed that superhorizon curvature perturbations are not conserved at the one-loop level in single-field inflation models if there is a transient ultra-slow-roll period. In this work, we point out that the contributions from the counterterms were overlooked in the recent papers. We show that the counterterm contributions play a crucial role in canceling the one-loop power spectrum of superhorizon curvature perturbations in the comoving gauge.</description>

      <title>General Lagrangian Formulation for Higher Spin Fields with Arbitrary Index Symmetry. I. Bosonic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1110.5044</link>
      <description>arXiv:1110.5044v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a Lagrangian description of irreducible integer higher-spin representations of the Poincare group with an arbitrary Young tableaux having k rows, on a basis of the universal BRST approach. Starting with a description of bosonic mixed-symmetry higher-spin fields in a flat space of any dimension in terms of an auxiliary Fock space associated with special Poincare module, we realize a conversion of the initial operator constraint system (constructed with respect to the relations extracting irreducible Poincare-group representations) into a first-class constraint system. For this purpose, we find, for the first time, auxiliary representations of the constraint subalgebra, to be isomorphic due to Howe duality to sp(2k) algebra, and containing the subsystem of second-class constraints in terms of new oscillator variables. We propose a universal procedure of constructing unconstrained gauge-invariant Lagrangians with reducible gauge symmetries describing the dynamics of both massless and massive bosonic fields of any spin. It is shown that the space of BRST cohomologies with a vanishing ghost number is determined only by the constraints corresponding to an irreducible Poincare-group representation. As examples of the general procedure, we formulate the method of Lagrangian construction for bosonic fields subject to arbitrary Young tableaux having 3 rows and derive the gauge-invariant Lagrangian for new model of massless rank-4 tensor field with spin $(2,1,1)$ and second-stage reducible gauge symmetries.</description>

Abstract: We consider the XXZ spin chain in the scaling limit in the Matsubara direction. The main result of this paper is new representations for the functions $\Psi(l, \kappa)$ and $\Theta(l, m; \kappa, \alpha)$ associated with the function $\omega(\zeta, \xi; \kappa, \kappa)$ found in the expression for the correlation function of the generators of the fermionic basis for the XXZ spin chain. The final result incorporates the case of particle-hole excitations which is needed for the relation of the fermionic basis to the Virasoro basis of the CFT descendants.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16029v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent experiments strongly indicate deep connections between transports of strange metal and high $T_c$ superconductors. For instance, it is known that the dependence of the zero-temperature phase stiffness on the critical superconducting temperature becomes linear in underdoped materials. In this paper, we investigate relation meticulously between the phase stiffness and the critical superconducting temperature for the Gubser-Rocha holographic superconductor model in the probe limit. The superfluid density (or phase stiffness) can be extracted from the low-frequency dependence of the AC conductivity. More importantly, we find linear dependence of zero-temperature superfluid density on the critical superconducting temperature, which has a similarity to a recent experiment in a film cuprate. In addition, we also provide some approximate formulas for the critical temperatures and the AC conductivity.</description>

Abstract: AdS supergravity admits supersymmetric solutions that describe BPS defects. Here, we investigate such solutions in AdS$_3$ supergravity, which is formulated as a Chern-Simons theory on $\mathrm{OSp}(2|1)\,\times\, \mathrm{OSp}(2|1)$. We compute the Killing spinor equation on the BTZ geometry in different ways, looking for BPS solutions on the entire space of parameters. We focus our attention on defects that represent geometries with integer angular excesses; these correspond to specific negative values of the BTZ mass. We compare our solutions with other results in the literature, finding exact agreement. We argue that, in the semiclassical limit, the BPS defects can be associated to degenerate representations of the Virasoro symmetry at the boundary. The case of non-diagonal representations, describing stationary, non-static defects, is also discussed.</description>

Abstract: We propose a microscopic definition of finite cut-off JT quantum gravity on the disk, both in the discretized and in the continuum points of view. The discretized formulation involves a new model of so-called self-overlapping random polygons. The measure is not uniform, implying that the degrees of freedom are not in one-to-one correspondence with the shape of the boundary. The continuum formulation is based on a boundary $\text{CFT}_{1}$ from which we predict some critical exponents of the self-overlapping polygon model. The coupling to an arbitrary bulk matter CFT is also discussed.</description>

Abstract: We study the first law for non-stationary perturbations of a stationary black hole whose event horizon is a Killing horizon, that relates the first-order change in the mass and angular momentum to the change in the entropy of an arbitrary horizon cross-section. Recently, Hollands, Wald and Zhang [1] have shown that the dynamical black hole entropy that satisfies this first law, for general relativity, is $S_{\text{dyn}}=(1-v\partial_v)S_{\text{BH}}$, where $v$ is the affine parameter of the null horizon generators and $S_{\text{BH}}$ is the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, and for general diffeomorphism covariant theories of gravity $S_{\text{dyn}}=(1-v\partial_v)S_{\text{Wall}}$, where $S_{\text{Wall}}$ is the Wall entropy. They obtained the first law by applying the Noether charge method to non-stationary perturbations and arbitrary cross-sections. In this formalism, the dynamical black hole entropy is defined as an ``improved'' Noether charge, which is unambiguous to first order in the perturbation. In the present article we provide a pedagogical derivation of the physical process version of the non-stationary first law for general relativity by integrating the linearised Raychaudhuri equation between two arbitrary horizon cross-sections. Moreover, we generalise the derivation of the first law in [1] to non-minimally coupled matter fields that are smooth on the horizon, using boost weight arguments rather than Killing field arguments, and we relax some of the gauge conditions on the perturbations by allowing for non-zero variations of the horizon Killing field and surface gravity. Finally, for $f(\text{Riemann})$ theories of gravity we show explicitly using Gaussian null coordinates that the improved Noether charge is $S_{\text{dyn}}=(1-v\partial_v)S_{\text{Wall}}$, which is a non-trivial check of [1].</description>

      <title>Permutation invariant matrix quantum thermodynamics and negative specific heat capacities in large N systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13150v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the thermodynamic properties of the simplest gauged permutation invariant matrix quantum mechanical system of oscillators, for general matrix size $N$. In the canonical ensemble, the model has a transition at a temperature $T$ given by $x = e^{ -1/ T } \sim x_c=e^{-1/T_c}=\frac{\log N}{N}$, characterised by a sharp peak in the specific heat capacity (SHC), which separates a high temperature from a low temperature region. The peak grows and the low-temperature region shrinks to zero with increasing $N$. In the micro-canonical ensemble, for finite $N$, there is a low energy phase with negative SHC and a high energy phase with positive SHC. The low-energy phase is dominated by a super-exponential growth of degeneracies as a function of energy which is directly related to the rapid growth in the number of directed graphs, with any number of vertices, as a function of the number of edges. The two ensembles have matching behaviour above the transition temperature. We further provide evidence that these thermodynamic properties hold in systems with $U(N)$ symmetry such as the zero charge sector of the 2-matrix model and in certain tensor models. We discuss the implications of these observations for the negative specific heat capacities in gravity using the AdS/CFT correspondence.</description>

Abstract: We outline a general derivation of holographic duality between "TQFT gravity" - the path integral of a 3d TQFT summed over different topologies - and an ensemble of boundary 2d CFTs. The key idea is to place the boundary ensemble on a Riemann surface of very high genus, where the duality trivializes. The duality relation at finite genus is then obtained by genus reduction. Our derivation is generic and does not rely on an explicit form of the bulk or boundary partition functions. It guarantees unitarity and suggests that the bulk sum should include all possible topologies. In the case of Abelian Chern-Simons theory with compact gauge group we show that the weights of the boundary ensemble are equal, while the bulk sum reduces to a finite sum over equivalence classes of topologies, represented by handlebodies with possible line defects.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we bootstrap the 4-point correlators on the 1D celestial circle using 3D symmetries in the Aharony-Bergman-Jafferis-Maldacena theory as constraints. We find that the dual inversion property is strong enough to replace the crossing symmetry condition (or cyclic invariant condition) when bootstrapping. We also give some results about the conformal block expansion coefficients which contain the spectrum and the leading multi-OPE of this celestial CFT. Furthermore, we find a non-local 2-particle operator from the multi-OPE at the leading OPE. Although we studied a specific theory, the methods used are valid for general cases.</description>

      <title>Analytic trajectory bootstrap for matrix models</title>

Abstract: We revisit the large $N$ two-matrix model with $\text{tr}[A,B]^2$ interaction and quartic potentials by the analytic trajectory bootstrap, where $A$ and $B$ represent the two matrices. In the large $N$ limit, we can focus on the single trace moments associated with the words composed of the letters $A$ and $B$. Analytic continuations in the lengths of the words and subwords lead to analytic trajectories of single trace moments and intriguing intersections of different trajectories. Inspired by the one-cut solutions of one-matrix models, we propose some simple ansatzes for the singularity structure of the two-matrix generating functions and the corresponding single trace moments. Together with the self-consistent constraints from the loop equations, we determine the free parameters in the ansatzes and obtain highly accurate solutions for the two-matrix model at a low computational cost. For a given length cutoff $L_\text{max}$, our results are within and more accurate than the positivity bounds from the relaxation method, such as about 6-digit accuracy for $L_\text{max}=18$. The convergence pattern suggests that we achieve about $8$-digit accuracy for $L_\text{max}=22$. As the singularity structure is closely related to the eigenvalue distributions, we further present the results for various types of eigenvalue densities. In the end, we study the symmetry breaking solutions using more complicated ansatzes.</description>

      <title>SymTFT for (3+1)d Gapless SPTs and Obstructions to Confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05585v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study gapless phases in (3+1)d in the presence of 1-form and non-invertible duality symmetries. Using the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) approach, we classify the gapless symmetry-protected (gSPT) phases in these setups, with particular focus on intrinsically gSPTs (igSPTs). These are symmetry protected critical points which cannot be deformed to a trivially gapped phase without spontaneously breaking the symmetry. Although these are by now well-known in (1+1)d, we demonstrate their existence in (3+1)d gauge theories. Here, they have a clear physical interpretation in terms of an obstruction to confinement, even though the full 1-form symmetry does not suffer from 't Hooft anomalies. These igSPT phases provide a new way to realize 1-form symmetries in CFTs, that has no analog for gapped phases. The SymTFT approach allows for a direct generalization from invertible symmetries to non-invertible duality symmetries, for which we study gSPT and igSPT phases as well. We accompany these theoretical results with concrete physical examples realizing such phases and explain how obstruction to confinement is detected at the level of symmetric deformations.</description>

      <title>Higher-order gaugino condensates on a twisted $\mathbb T^4$: In the beginning was semi-classics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16058v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the gaugino condensates, $\left\langle \prod_{i=1}^k \text{tr}(\lambda\lambda)(x_i) \right\rangle $ for $1$ $\leq$ $k$ $\le$ $N-1$, in $SU(N)$ super Yang-Mills theory on a small four-dimensional torus $\mathbb{T}^4$, subject to 't Hooft twisted boundary conditions. Two recent advances are crucial to performing the calculations and interpreting the result: the understanding of generalized anomalies involving $1$-form center symmetry and the construction of multi-fractional instantons on the twisted $\mathbb T^4$. These self-dual classical configurations have topological charge $k/N$ and can be described as a sum over $k$ closely packed lumps in an instanton liquid. Using the path integral formalism, we perform the condensate calculations in the semi-classical limit and find, assuming gcd$(k,N)=1$, $\left\langle \prod_{i=1}^k \text{tr}(\lambda\lambda)(x_i) \right\rangle = {\bf n}^{-1} \; N^2\left(16\pi^2 \Lambda^3\right)^k$, where $\Lambda$ is the strong-coupling scale and ${\bf n}$ is a normalization constant. We determine the normalization constant, using path integral, as ${\bf n} = N^2$, which is $N$ times larger than the normalization used in our earlier publication arXiv:2210.13568. This finding resolves the extra-factor-of-$N$ discrepancy encountered there, aligning our results with those obtained through direct supersymmetric methods on $\mathbb R^4$. The normalization constant ${\bf n}$ can be understood within the Euclidean path-integral framework as the Witten index $I_W$. From the Hamiltonian approach, it is well-established that $I_W = N$. While the value ${\bf n} = N^2$ correctly reproduces the condensate result, this discrepancy between the Hamiltonian and path-integral formulations calls for reconciliation. We attempt to provide a potential solution we outline in our discussion.</description>

      <title>Topological zero modes and bounded modes at smooth domain walls: Exact solutions and dualities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16466v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topology describes global quantities invariant under continuous deformations, such as the number of elementary excitations at a phase boundary, without detailing specifics. Conversely, differential laws are needed to understand the physical properties of these excitations, such as their localization and spatial behavior. For instance, topology mandates the existence of solitonic zero-energy modes at the domain walls between topologically inequivalent phases in topological insulators and superconductors. However, the spatial dependence of these modes is only known in the idealized (and unrealistic) case of a sharp domain wall. Here, we find the analytical solutions of these zero-modes by assuming a smooth and exponentially-confined domain wall. This allows us to characterize the zero-modes using a few length scales: the domain wall width, the exponential decay length, and oscillation wavelength. These quantities define distinct regimes: featureless modes with "no hair" at sharp domain walls, and nonfeatureless modes at smooth domain walls, respectively, with "short hair", i.e., featureless at long distances, and "long hair", i.e., nonfeatureless at all length scales. We thus establish a universal relation between the bulk excitation gap, decay rate, and oscillation momentum of the zero modes, which quantifies the bulk-boundary correspondence in terms of experimentally measurable physical quantities. Additionally, we reveal an unexpected duality between topological zero modes and Shockley modes, unifying the understanding of topologically-protected and nontopological boundary modes. These findings shed some new light on the localization properties of edge modes in topological insulators and Majorana zero modes in topological superconductors and on the differences and similarities between topological and nontopological zero modes in these systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03723v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Zero-point fluctuations in the background of a cosmic string provide an opportunity to study the effects of topology in quantum field theory. We use a scattering theory approach to compute quantum corrections to the energy density of a cosmic string, using the "ballpoint pen" and "flowerpot" models to allow for a nonzero string radius. For computational efficiency, we consider a massless field in $2+1$ dimensions. We show how to implement precise and unambiguous renormalization conditions in the presence of a deficit angle, and make use of Kontorovich-Lebedev techniques to rewrite the sum over angular momentum channels as an integral on the imaginary axis.</description>

Abstract: We study holographic solutions describing RG flows across dimensions from five-dimensional $N=2$ SCFT to SCFTs in three and two dimensions using matter-coupled $F(4)$ gauged supergravity with $ISO(3)\times U(1)$ gauge group. By performing topological twists implemented by $SO(2)$, $SO(2)\times SO(2)$ and $SO(3)$ gauge fields, we find a number of $AdS_4\times H^2$ and $AdS_3\times H^3$ solutions preserving eight and four supercharges. These geometries are identified with conformal fixed points in three and two dimensions, respectively. The corresponding flow solutions are obtained numerically and can be interpreted as black membranes and black strings in asymptotically $AdS_6$ space. In addition, we have constructed charged domain wall solutions with $AdS_2\times S^3$ and $AdS_3\times S^2$ slicing. These solutions are supported by a non-vanishing two-form field and describe conformal line and surface defects within the $N=2$ SCFT in five dimensions, respectively. All of these solutions can be uplifted to type IIB theory via consistent truncations on $S^2\times \Sigma$ with $\Sigma$ being a Riemann surface.</description>

      <title>The Cusp Limit of Correlators and A New Graphical Bootstrap for Correlators/Amplitudes to Eleven Loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09859v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the universal behavior of half-BPS correlators in $\mathcal{N}=4$ super-Yang-Mills in the cusp limit where two consecutive separations $x_{12}^2,x_{23}^2$ become lightlike. Through the Lagrangian insertion procedure, the Sudakov double-logarithmic divergence of the $n$-point correlator is related to the $(n+1)$-point correlator where the inserted Lagrangian "pinches" to the soft-collinear region of the cusp. We formulate this constraint as a new graphical rulefor the $f$-graphs of the four-point correlator, which turns out to be the most constraining rule known so far. By exploiting this single graphical rule, we bootstrap the planar integrand of the four-point correlator up to ten loops ($n=14$) and fix all 22024902 but one coefficient at eleven loops ($n=15$); the remaining coefficient is then fixed using the triangle rule. We verify the "Catalan conjecture" for the coefficients of the family of $f$-graphs known as "anti-prisms" where the coefficient of the twelve-loop ($n=16$) anti-prism is found to be $-42$ by a local analysis of the bootstrap equations. We also comment on the implication of our graphical rule for the non-planar contributions.</description>

      <title>Eigenvalue systems for integer orthogonal bases of multi-matrix invariants at finite N</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13631v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-matrix invariants, and in particular the scalar multi-trace operators of $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM with $U(N)$ gauge symmetry, can be described using permutation centraliser algebras (PCA), which are generalisations of the symmetric group algebras and independent of $N$. Free-field two-point functions define an $N$-dependent inner product on the PCA, and bases of operators have been constructed which are orthogonal at finite $N$. Two such bases are well-known, the restricted Schur and covariant bases, and both definitions involve representation-theoretic quantities such as Young diagram labels, multiplicity labels, branching and Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for symmetric groups. The explicit computation of these coefficients grows rapidly in complexity as the operator length increases. We develop a new method for explicitly constructing all the operators with specified Young diagram labels, based on an $N$-independent integer eigensystem formulated in the PCA. The eigensystem construction naturally leads to orthogonal basis elements which are integer linear combinations of the multi-trace operators, and the $N$-dependence of their norms are simple known dimension factors. We provide examples and give computer codes in SageMath which efficiently implement the construction for operators of classical dimension up to 14. While the restricted Schur basis relies on the Artin-Wedderburn decomposition of symmetric group algebras, the covariant basis relies on a variant which we refer to as the Kronecker decomposition. Analogous decompositions exist for any finite group algebra and the eigenvalue construction of integer orthogonal bases extends to the group algebra of any finite group with rational characters.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we consider a Carroll magnetic limit of a one-loop scalar effective action. We work on general static backgrounds and compute both divergent and finite parts of the effective action in this limit. We show, that the divergent part can be removed by adding local counterterms. The finite part is related to an effective action in a lower dimensional theory which however does not coincide in general with the one obtained by a Carroll limit in the classical counterpart.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we investigate off-shell supersymmetric string configurations in Euclidean Ad$\mathbb{S}_5\times \mathbb{S}^5$ background. By extending the Green-Schwarz supersymmetric equations using the pure spinor formalism, we demonstrate that while the solutions to the Green-Schwarz equations are necessarily minimal surfaces, the solutions to the extended equations form infinite-dimensional families, even with fixed boundary conditions, thus preventing direct derivations of exact results via supersymmetric localization. For concreteness, we have selected a supercharge that localizes the off-shell supersymmetric configurations to an Ad$\mathbb{S}_4 \times \mathbb{S}^2$ slice and observed that the corresponding action functional reduces to an integral of a two-form.</description>

Abstract: The confinement of quarks is analyzed by establishing a correspondence between the effective actions inside a black hole and the QCD action, formulated as a scalar field theory in the Carrollian regime. We first demonstrate that both QCD (in the instanton-dominance limit) and the interior of a black hole can be described at one-loop as the effective action of a soliton in the Carrollian limit. At one-loop, QCD confinement is shown to be entirely analogous to confinement within a black hole, with the event horizon acting as the hadron radius. Higher-order corrections to the effective action do not destabilize the solitons but may produce subtle observable effects, such as deconfinement or a partial resolution to the information loss problem.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the multi-partite entanglement structure of an evaporating black hole and its Hawking radiation by dividing the radiation into finer subsystems. We approximate an evaporating black hole and its radiation with a Haar-random state for this purpose. Using the multi-entropy of these configurations, we define a black hole multi-entropy curve, which describes how the multi-entropy changes during the black hole evaporation. This black hole multi-entropy curve is a natural generalization of the Page curve since the multi-entropy reduces to the entanglement entropy for the bi-partite case. The multi-entropy curve keeps increasing in the early time. It reaches the maximum value at the multi-entropy time, which is later than the Page time, and starts to decrease. However, it does not decrease to zero at the end of the black hole evaporation. This non-zero value of the multi-entropy represents the secret entanglement between Hawking particles.</description>

Abstract: We investigate symmetry and causality constraints on interacting Fermi liquids. Whereas Galilean or Lorentz boost symmetry leads to a well-known constraint on the first Landau parameter $F_1$, we show that scale invariance similarly constrains $F_0$. In the case of conformal Fermi liquids, we show that causality constraints on the particle-hole continuum and on zero sound strongly restrict the available parameter space for interacting Fermi liquids. We also consider nonlinear response, which we show is sensitive to additional ``generalized Landau parameters'' even at lowest orders in the long wavelength limit. We impose Galilean, Lorentz and scale symmetry on these generalized Landau parameters, obtaining further nonlinear constraints. We test our constraints in several microscopic models that enter a Fermi liquid phase.</description>

      <title>On symmetries of gravitational on-shell boundary action at null infinity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07136v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the gravitational boundary action at null infinity of asymptotically flat spacetimes. We fix the corner ambiguities in the boundary action by using the constraint that (exponential of) the on-shell action leads to tree-level 5-point amplitude in eikonal approximation in a generic supertranslated vacuum. The subleading soft graviton theorem follows naturally from the on-shell action when the BMS group is extended to include superrotations. An infinite tower of Goldstone modes is proposed by `generalizing' the Geroch tensor to incorporate a set of divergence-free symmetric traceless tensors on the sphere. This generalization leads to $\text{sub}^{n}$-leading soft insertions in the tree-level $\mathcal{S}$ matrix, thus paving the way to understanding the infinite tower of tree-level symmetries within this framework.</description>

      <title>Higher Representations and Quark Confinement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09069v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The concept of a (de)confined phase in QFT is well-defined in the presence of $1$-form symmetries and their spontaneous symmetry breaking. However, in scenarios where such symmetries are absent, confinement is not a well-defined phase property. In this work, we propose that, when restricting to a specific submanifold of the parameter space -- namely at zero temperature and fixed quark mass -- the confined and adjoint Higgs phases of scalar QCD can be distinguished through the different organization of their spectra, as seen from the perspective of the baryon symmetry. The analysis is performed in terms of an appropriate higher-categorical representation theory, recently developed for generalized symmetries. Consistent with expectations, we find that the confined phase permits only particles with integer baryon charges, while the Higgs phase is characterized by the coexistence of bare quarks and center vortices, exhibiting a non-trivial Aharonov-Bohm effect between these excitations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05135v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent technical and conceptual advancements in the asymptotic safety approach to quantum gravity have enabled studies of the UV completion of Lorentzian Einstein gravity, emphasizing the role of the state dependence. We present here the first complete investigation of the flow equations of the Einstein-Hilbert action within a cosmological spacetime, namely de Sitter spacetime. Using the newly derived graviton propagator for general gauges and masses in de Sitter spacetime, we analyze the dependence on the gauge and on finite renormalization parameters. Our results provide evidence of a UV fixed point for the most commonly used gauges.</description>

      <title>A Non-Relativistic Limit for Heterotic Supergravity and its Gauge Lagrangian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08711v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the non-relativistic (NR) limit of $D=10$ heterotic supergravity has a finite gauge Lagrangian due to non-trivial cancellations of divergent parts coming from the Chern-Simons terms in the curvature of the $\hat B$-field and the Yang-Mills Lagrangian. This is similar to what happens in bosonic supergravity between the Ricci scalar, $\hat R$, and the $- \frac{1}{12} \hat H^2$ term after taking the same limit. In this work we present the explicit form of the gauge transformations and curvatures after considering the NR limit and we compute the finite gauge Lagrangian in its covariant form. As an interesting property, the Green-Schwarz mechanism for the two-form can be trivialized in this limit. Terms equivalent to Chern-Simons contributions naturally arise from the previous property.</description>

      <title>A nested sequence of inequivalent Rindler vacua : Universal Relic Thermality of Planckian origin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.03406v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Bogoliubov transformation connecting the standard inertial frame mode functions to the standard mode functions defined in the Rindler frame $R_0$, leads to the result that the inertial vacuum appears as a thermal state with temperature $T_0=a_0/2\pi$ where $a_0$ is the acceleration parameter of $R_0$. We construct an infinite family of nested Rindler-like coordinate systems $R_1, R_2, ...$ within the right Rindler wedge, with time coordinates $\tau_1, \tau_2, ...,$ and acceleration parameters $a_1, a_2, ...$ by shifting the origin along the inertial $x$-axis by amounts $\ell_1, \ell_2,\cdots$. We show that, apart from the inertial vacuum, the \textit{Rindler vacuum} of the frame $R_n$ also appears to be a thermal state in the frame $R_{n+1}$ with the temperature $a_{n+1}/2\pi$. \textit{In fact, the Rindler frame $R_{n+1}$ attributes to all the Rindler vacuum states of $R_1, R_2, ... R_n$, as well as to the inertial vacuum state, the same temperature $a_{n+1}/2\pi$.} We further show that our result is discontinuous in an essential way in the coordinate shift parameters. For a Rindler frame $R_i$, this thermality {\it turns on} with smallest non-zero $\ell_i$ allowed in the semiclassical framework and remains insensitive to $(\ell_i,a_{i-1})$ thereafter, indicating its universal Planckian origin. Similar structures can be introduced in the right wedge of any spacetime with bifurcate Killing horizon, like, for e.g., Schwarzschild spacetime. Apart from providing unsuppressed observables capturing Planck scale effects, these results have important implications for quantum gravity when flat spacetime is treated as the ground state of quantum gravity.

      <title>A reconstruction of quantum theory for spinning particles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2202.13364v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As part of a probabilistic reconstruction of quantum theory (QT), we show that spin is not a purely quantum mechanical phenomenon, as has long been assumed. Rather, this phenomenon occurs before the transition to QT takes place, namely in the area of the quasi-classical (here better quasi-quantum) theory. This borderland between classical physics and QT can be reached within the framework of our reconstruction by the replacement $p \rightarrow M (q, t)$, where $p$ is the momentum variable of the particle and $M(q, t)$ is the momentum field in configuration space. The occurrence of spin, and its special value $1/2$ , is a consequence of the fact that $M(q,t)$ must have exactly three independent components $M_{k}(q,t)$ for a single particle because of the three-dimensionality of space. In the Schr\"odinger equation for a "particle with spin zero", the momentum field is usually represented as a gradient of a single function $S$. This implies dependencies between the components $M_{k}(q,t)$ for which no explanation exists. In reality, $M(q,t)$ needs to be represented by three functions, two of which are rotational degrees of freedom. The latter are responsible for the existence of spin. All massive structureless particles in nature must therefore be spin-one-half particles, simply because they have to be described by $4$ real fields, one of which has the physical meaning of a probability density, while the other three are required to represent the momentum field in three-dimensional space. We derive the Pauli-Schr\"odinger equation, the correct value $g=2$ of the gyromagnetic ratio, the classical limit of the Pauli-Schr\"odinger equation, and clarify some other open questions in the borderland between classical physics and QT.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Freedom at the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless Transition without Fine-Tuning Using a Qubit Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06117v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a two-dimensional hard-core loop-gas model as a way to regularize the asymptotically free massive continuum quantum field theory that emerges at the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition. Without fine-tuning, our model can reproduce the universal step-scaling function of the classical lattice XY model in the massive phase as we approach the phase transition. This is achieved by lowering the fugacity of Fock-vacuum sites in the loop-gas configuration space to zero in the thermodynamic limit. Some of the universal quantities at the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition show smaller finite size effects in our model as compared to the traditional XY model. Our model is a prime example of qubit regularization of an asymptotically free massive quantum field theory in Euclidean space-time and helps understand how asymptotic freedom can arise as a relevant perturbation at a decoupled fixed point without fine-tuning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.09105v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: What if gravity is classical? If true, a consistent co-existence of classical gravity and quantum matter requires that gravity exhibit irreducible fluctuations. These fluctuations can mediate classical correlations, but not quantum entanglement, between the quantized motion of the gravitationally interacting matter. We use a consistent theory of quantum-classical dynamics in the Newtonian limit of gravity to show that experimentally relevant observables can conclusively test the hypothesis that gravity is classical. This can be done for example by letting highly coherent source masses interact with each other gravitationally, and performing precise measurements of the cross-correlation of their motion. Theory predicts a characteristic phase response that distinguishes classical gravity from quantum gravity, and from naive sources of decoherence. Such experiments are imminently viable.</description>

      <title>Sampling reduced density matrix to extract fine levels of entanglement spectrum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16709v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-lying entanglement spectrum provides the quintessential fingerprint to identify the highly entangled quantum matter with topological and conformal field-theoretical properties. However, when the entangling region acquires long boundary with the environment, such as that between long coupled chains or in two or higher dimensions, there unfortunately exists no universal yet practical method to compute the entanglement spectra with affordable computational cost. Here we propose a new scheme to overcome such difficulty and successfully extract the low-lying fine entanglement spectrum (ES). We trace out the environment via quantum Monte Carlo simulation and diagonalize the reduced density matrix to gain the ES. We demonstrate the strength and reliability of our method through long coupled spin chains and answer its long-standing controversy. Our simulation results, with unprecedentedly large system sizes, establish the practical computation scheme of the entanglement spectrum with a huge freedom degree of environment.</description>

      <title>$f(Q,L_m)$ gravity, and its cosmological implications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00989v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the present work, we extend the $f(Q)$ symmetric teleparallel gravity by introducing an arbitrary coupling between the non-metricity $Q$ and matter Lagrangian $L_m$ in the Lagrangian density $f$ of the theory, which thus leads to the $f\left(Q,L_m\right)$ theory. This generalisation encompasses Coincident General Relativity (CGR), and the Symmetric Teleparallel Equivalent to GR (STEGR). Using the metric formalism, we derive the field equation of the theory, which generalizes the field equations of $f(Q)$ gravity. From the study of the covariant divergence of the field equations, it follows that the presence of the geometry-matter coupling leads to the non-conservation of the matter energy-momentum tensor. The cosmological implications of the theory are investigated in the case of a flat, homogeneous, and isotropic Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker geometry. As a first step in this direction, we obtain the modified Friedmann equations for the $f(Q,L_m)$ gravity in a general form. Specific cosmological models are investigated for several choices of $f(Q,L_m)$, including $f(Q,L_m)=-\alpha Q + 2L_m + \beta$, and $f(Q,L_m)=- \alpha Q + (2L_m)^2 + \beta$, respectively. Comparative analyses with the standard $\Lambda$ CDM paradigm are carried out, and the observational implications of the models are investigated in detail.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02909v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unimodular gravity (UG) is classically considered identical to General Relativity (GR). However, due to restricted diffeomorphism symmetry, the Bianchi identites do not lead to the conservation of energy-momentum tensor. Thus, the conservation of energy-momentum tensor needs to be separately assumed in order to reconcile with GR. Relaxing this assumption, one finds that the conservation violation can lead to differences with GR, which can be subsequently examined in astrophysical and cosmological scenarios. To this end, we examine the predictions of UG in the context of binary systems emitting gravitational radiation. Primarily, we show how the field equations involve a diffusion function which quantifies the measure of non-conservation. Due to this violation, the dispersion relation is modified. Incorporating these changes, we provide an expression for the energy loss by the binaries, which reduces to Peters-Mathews result in the GR limit. Using binary pulsar data, we constrain the theory parameter $\zeta$ (which signifies non-conservation) by determining the rate of orbital decay. The strongest constrain on $\zeta$ comes out to be $\vert \zeta \vert \leq 5\times 10^{-4}$ which is better by an order of magnitude than an existing equivalent constraint coming from the tidal deformability of the neutron stars.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09110v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, the complete landscape of three-family supersymmetric Pati-Salam models from intersecting D6-branes on a type IIA $\mathbb{T}^6/(\mathbb{Z}_2\times \mathbb{Z}_2)$ orientifold has been enumerated consisting of 33 independent models with distinct gauge coupling relations at the string scale. Here, we study the phenomenology of all such models by providing the detailed particle spectra and the analysis of the possible 3-point and the 4-point Yukawa interactions in order to accommodate all standard-model fermion masses and mixings. We find that only 17 models contain viable Yukawa textures to explain quarks masses, charged-leptons' masses, neutrino-masses, quarks' mixings and leptons' mixings. These viable models split into four classes, viz. a single model with 3 Higgs fields from the bulk and sixteen models with either 6, 9 or 12 Higgs from the $\mathcal{N}=2$ sector. The models perform successively better with the increasing number of Higgs pairs. Remarkably, the class of models with 12 Higgs naturally predicts the Dirac-type neutrino masses in normal ordering consistent with both the experimental constraints as well as the bounds from the swampland program.</description>

      <title>A Unified Framework for Analyzing Gravitational Wave Effects in Modified Gravity Theories Based on the Isaacson Picture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11838v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Isaacson picture is established on two sets of basic equations and provides a necessary foundation for discussing gravitational wave effects without ambiguity. It is typically derived by expanding the field equations to second-order perturbations. In addition to the above method, the perturbation action method can also serve as an alternative derivation method. In this paper, we elaborate on this method, establishing its foundations more rigorously. Especially, the second-order perturbation action in the Minkowski background encapsulates all the required information for constructing the Isaacson picture far from the source. This approach provides a method that, in principle, allows for the construction of a model-independent parametric framework, encompassing the vast majority of modified gravitational theories. It enables a unified and generalized analysis of various gravitational wave effects across these theories, including the polarization modes, velocity dispersion relations, effective energy-momentum tensor, and memory effects. These properties have garnered significant attention due to their close connection with observable effects and are expected to be identified by the next generation of gravitational wave detectors, which aim to test potential modifications to gravity theory. We demonstrate this method using the most general second-order vector-tensor theory, including parity-violation terms, as an example, and specifically analyze the polarization modes of gravitational waves in this theory.</description>

      <title>Numerical determination of the width and shape of the effective string using Stochastic Normalizing Flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15937v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Flow-based architectures have recently proved to be an efficient tool for numerical simulations of Effective String Theories regularized on the lattice that otherwise cannot be efficiently sampled by standard Monte Carlo methods. In this work we use Stochastic Normalizing Flows, a state-of-the-art deep learning architecture based on non-equilibrium Monte Carlo simulations, to study different effective string models. After testing the reliability of this approach through a comparison with exact results for the Nambu-Got\={o} model, we discuss results on observables that are challenging to study analytically, such as the width of the string and the shape of the flux density. Furthermore, we perform a novel numerical study of Effective String Theories with terms beyond the Nambu-Got\={o} action, including a broader discussion on their significance for lattice gauge theories. The combination of these findings enables a quantitative description of the fine details of the confinement mechanism in different lattice gauge theories. The results presented in this work establish the reliability and feasibility of flow-based samplers for Effective String Theories and pave the way for future applications on more complex models.</description>

Abstract: Detections of gravitational waves since GW150914 has gained renewed interest in potential quantum-classical correspondences between GWs and gravitons. While a complete quantum theory of gravity remains elusive, graviton fluctuations have been hypothesized as sources of stochastic noise in gravitational interactions. This study heuristically models a coalescing binary as a rotating, contracting Gaussian volume, treating gravitons within the gravitational bulk as an effectively thermal gas. Applying the Einstein-Langevin equation, we establish a scaling relation where quanta dissipation depends inversely with the contracting volume. Using an Euler iteration scheme, we simulate gravitonic Brownian motion throughout coalescence, revealing stochastic fluctuations that qualitatively resemble macroscopic GW waveforms. While inherently heuristic, this approach provides a computational framework for exploring graviton-scale perturbations in GW formation, with reproducible implementations in Wolfram Mathematica and equivalent Python code in the appendix.</description>

      <title>Fake Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11937v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present exact solutions describing a fake Schwarzschild black hole that cannot be distinguished from the Schwarzschild black hole by observations. They are constructed by attaching a spherically symmetric dynamical interior solution with a matter field to the Schwarzschild exterior solution at the event horizon without a lightlike thin shell. The dynamical region inside a Killing horizon of a static spherically symmetric perfect-fluid solution obeying an equation of state $p=\chi\rho$ for $\chi\in[-1/3,0)$ can be the interior of a fake Schwarzschild black hole. The matter field inside such a black hole is an anisotropic fluid that violates at least the weak energy condition and can be interpreted as a spacelike (tachyonic) perfect fluid. While the author constructed the first model of fake Schwarzschild black holes using Semiz's solution for $\chi=-1/5$, we present another one using Whittaker's solution for $\chi=-1/3$ in this paper. We also present a model of fake Kerr black holes whose interior is filled with a different matter field violating only the dominant energy condition near the event horizon. Whether a fake Schwarzschild or Kerr black hole can be realized under the dominant energy condition is an open question.</description>

      <title>Dark universe inspired by the Kaluza-Klein gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14176v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the potential implications of Kaluza-Klein (KK) gravity in unifying the dark sector of the Universe. Through dimensional reduction in KK gravity, the 5D spacetime framework can be reformulated in terms of a 4D spacetime metric, along with additional scalar and vector fields. From the 4D perspective, this suggests the existence of a tower of particle states, including KK gravitons with massive spin-0 and spin-1 states, in addition to the massless spin-2 gravitons of general relativity (GR). The key idea in the present paper is the analogy with superconductivity theory. By assuming a minimal coupling between an additional complex scalar field and the gauge field, a "mass" term emerges for the spin-1 gravitons. This, in turn, leads to long-range gravitational effects that could modify Newton's law of gravity through Yukawa-type corrections. Assuming an environment-dependent mass for the spin-1 graviton, near the galactic center the repulsive force from this spin-1 graviton is suppressed by an additional attractive component from Newton's constant corrections, resulting in a Newtonian-like, attraction-dominated effect. In the galaxy's outer regions, the repulsive force fades due to its short range, making dark matter appear only as an effective outcome of the dominant attractive corrections. This approach also explains dark matter's emergence as an apparent effects on cosmological scales while our model is equivalent to the scalar-vector-tensor gravity theory. Finally, we examine the impact of dark matter on the primordial gravitational wave (PGW) spectrum and show that it is sensitive to dark matter effects, providing an opportunity to test this theory through future GW observatories.</description>

      <title>Exploring cosmological imprints of phantom crossing with dynamical dark energy in Horndeski gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00931v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the current era of precision cosmology, the persistence of cosmological tensions, most notably the Hubble tension and the $S_8$ tension, challenges the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. To reconcile these tensions via late-time modifications to expansion history, various features such as phantom crossing in the dark energy equation of state, a negative energy density at high redshifts, etc., are favoured. However, these scenarios cannot be realized within the framework of GR without introducing ghost or gradient instabilities. In this work, we investigate a dynamical dark energy scenario within the framework of Horndeski gravity, incorporating nonminimal coupling to gravity and self-interactions. We highlight that the model can exhibit novel features like phantom crossing and negative dark energy densities at high redshifts without introducing any instabilities. For this specific Horndeski model, we perform a comprehensive analysis of the background evolution along with the effects on perturbations, examining observables like growth rate, matter and CMB power spectrum. To check the consistency of the model with the observational data, we employ MCMC analysis using BAO/$f\sigma_8$, Supernovae, and CMB data. While the model does not outperform the standard $\Lambda$CDM framework in a combined likelihood analysis, there remains a preference for non-zero values of the model parameters within the data. This suggests that dynamical dark energy scenarios, particularly those with non-minimal couplings, merit further exploration as promising alternatives to GR, offering rich phenomenology that can be tested against a broader range of current and upcoming observational datasets.</description>

      <title>Repulsive quantum gravitoelectric-gravitomagnetic interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02470v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate, in the framework of linearized quantum gravity, the quantum gravitational interaction between a gravitoelectrically polarizable object and a gravitomagnetically polarizable object. This interaction originates from the coupling between the instantaneous mass quadrupole moment and the mass-current quadrupole moment of the objects, induced by fluctuating gravitoelectric and gravitomagnetic fields in a vacuum. Using leading-order perturbation theory, we derive the explicit expression of the quantum gravitoelectric-gravitomagnetic interaction energy, which shows a distance dependence of $r^{-8}$ in the near regime and $r^{-11}$ in the far regime, where $r$ is the distance between the two objects. Remarkably, this interaction energy is positive, indicating that the force is repulsive. Since interactions between objects polarizable in the same gravitoelectric or gravitomagnetic manner are inherently attractive, for objects which are both gravitoelectrically and gravitomagnetically polarizable, the overall quantum gravitational interaction potential is reduced when the repulsive quantum gravitoelectric-gravitomagnetic interaction is taken into account. However, for two isotropically polarizable objects with identical gravitoelectric and gravitomagnetic polarizabilities and energy level spacing, the repulsive quantum interaction cannot surpass the attractive interactions.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Correction to the Magnetic Moment of the Charged Lepton</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07610v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The general Hamiltonian expression, up to the first-order relativistic correction, was derived by breaking the four-component Dirac equation into the two-component Dirac-Pauli equation. This Hamiltonian incorporates the first-order relativistic correction to the electromagnetic interaction with the spin and orbital magnetic moments of the charged lepton, distinguishing it from other generic Hamiltonians. The first-order relativistic adjustment to the Land\'e g-factor, or equivalently to the magnetic moment, was calculated using this generalized Hamiltonian for hydrogen-like atoms in the presence of an external magnetic field. It turns out that when we impose specific states, the formulations found in the literature match this relativistic correction. Furthermore, we have shown that the relativistic effect-induced energy shift of order $\alpha^2$ depends on the square of the azimuthal quantum number $m_j^2$, as well as on both the principal and total quantum numbers, denoted respectively by $n$ and $j$. This is in contrast to the case in the absence of an external magnetic field, where the energy shift depends only on $n$.</description>

      <title>The foot, the fan, and the cuprate phase diagram: Fermi-volume-changing quantum phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16417v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Fermi liquid with a 'large' Fermi surface (FL) can have a quantum phase transition to a spin density wave state (SDW) with reconstructed 'small' Fermi pockets. Both FL and SDW phases obey the Luttinger constraints on the volume enclosed by the Fermi surfaces. Critical spin fluctuations lead to spin-singlet $d$-wave pairing, as observed in the cuprates. Studies of the influence of spatial disorder on the FL-SDW quantum phase transition predict an extended quantum-critical Griffiths-type phase at low temperatures on the large Fermi surface side. These computations agree with the 'foot' of strange metal transport, and recent low temperature neutron scattering observations on La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$.
  However, this theory cannot explain the higher temperature pseudogap and the 'fan' of strange metal behavior of the hole-doped cuprates. Here we need to consider underlying Fermi-volume-changing quantum phase transitions without symmetry breaking. Then the small Fermi surface phase does not obey the Luttinger constraint, and the pseudogap metal is described by thermal fluctuations above a 'fractionalized Fermi liquid' (FL*) or a 'holon metal', with the descriptions related by a duality on a background spin liquid. The quantum critical fan is described using a field theory for an underlying FL-FL* quantum phase transition in the presence of spatial disorder. This field theory can be mapped to a form which can be analyzed using the methods of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model. Such an analysis successfully models linear-in-temperature resistivity, optical conductivity and thermopower observations in the quantum critical fan.
  The confinement crossover connecting these lower and higher temperature descriptions is also discussed.</description>

Abstract: Tensor-network methods enable probing dynamics of strongly interacting quantum many-body systems, including gauge theories, via Hamiltonian simulation, hence bypassing sign problems. They also have the potential to inform efficient quantum-simulation algorithms of the same theories. We develop and benchmark a matrix-product-state ansatz for the SU(2) lattice gauge theory using the loop-string-hadron formulation. This formulation has been demonstrated to be advantageous in Hamiltonian simulation of non-Abelian gauge theories. It is applicable to both SU(2) and SU(3) gauge groups, to periodic and open boundary conditions, and to 1+1 and higher dimensions. In this work, we report on progress in computing static and dynamical observables in a SU(2) gauge theory in (1+1)D, pushing the boundary of existing studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08707v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the superhorizon-limit curvature perturbations are conserved at one-loop level in single-field inflation models with a transient non-slow-roll period. We take the spatially-flat gauge, where the backreaction plays a crucial role for the conservation of superhorizon curvature perturbations unless the counter terms are tuned. We calculate the backreaction with the in-in formalism. In addition, we explicitly show the renormalization of the UV divergences with the counter terms.</description>

      <title>The Statistical Mechanics of Hawking Radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08816v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hawking radiation and black hole thermodynamics are well understood in the frameworks of quantum field theory and general relativity, with contemporary extensions in string theory, AdS/CFT, and loop quantum gravity. However, an open question remains: Can Hawking radiation be consistently described using statistical mechanics? This challenge arises due to the ambiguous quantum nature of Hawking particles and constraints imposed by information conservation. This study develops a heuristic statistical model using a worldine Lagrangian formalism, treating Hawking particles as timelike with an effective mass and following an arbitrary statistical distribution. The flow of information is modeled as a transfer of microstates from the event horizon to the radiation background within a closed ensemble. From this framework, the Hawking particle mass $m_H=\hbar/(2\pi r_S)$ is recovered, and the worldline Lagrangian yields the black hole's thermal energy, $E=\hbar/(8\pi GM)$. Beyond preserving conventional insights, reinforcing the statistical nature of black hole evaporation, this approach introduces novel perspectives: modeling the black hole as a structured energy well containing microstates, quantifying the evaporation rate of individual microstates, and determining the total number of microstates from the horizon's surface area. This study leaves the door open for a stochastic mechanical analysis, which is introduced in the Discussion section.</description>
