      <title>Co-existence of branching populations in random environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider two branching processes living in a joint random environment. Assuming that both processes are critical we address the following question: What is the probability that both populations survive up to a large time $n$? We show that this probability decays as $n^{-\theta}$ with $\theta&gt;0$ which is determined by the random environment. Furthermore, we prove the corresponding conditional limit theorem. One of the main ingredients in the proof is a qualitative bound for the entropic repulsion for two-dimensional random walks conditioned to stay in the positive quadrant. We believe that this bound is also of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Tight Bounds on the Binomial CDF, and the Minimum of i.i.d Binomials, in terms of KL-Divergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide finite sample upper and lower bounds on the Binomial tail probability which are a direct application of Sanov's theorem. We then use these to obtain high probability upper and lower bounds on the minimum of i.i.d. Binomial random variables. Both bounds are finite sample, asymptotically tight, and expressed in terms of the KL-divergence.</description>

      <title>The Offended Voter Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a variant of the voter model on a coevolving network in which interactions of two individuals with differing opinions only lead to an agreement on one of these opinions with a fixed probability $q$. Otherwise, with probability $1-q$, both individuals become offended in the sense that they never interact again, i.e.\ the corresponding edge is removed from the underlying network. Eventually, these dynamics reach an absorbing state at which there is only one opinion present in each connected component of the network. If globally both opinions are present at absorption we speak of ``segregation'', otherwise of ``consensus''. We rigorously show that segregation and a weaker form of consensus both occur with positive probability for every $q \in (0,1)$ and that the segregation probability tends to $1$ as $q \to 0$. Furthermore, we establish that, if $q \to 1$ fast enough, with high probability the population reaches consensus while the underlying network is still densely connected. We provide results from simulations to assess the obtained bounds and to discuss further properties of the limiting state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a generalized version of the Poisson-type process by time-changing it with the geometric counting process. Our work generalizes the work done by Meoli (2023) \cite{meoli2023some}. We defined the geometric subordinated Poisson process (GSPP), the geometric subordinated compound Poisson process (GSCPP) and the geometric subordinated multiplicative Poisson process (GSMPP) by time-changing the subordinated Poisson process, subordinated compound Poisson process and subordinated multiplicative Poisson process with the geometric counting process, respectively. We derived several distributional properties and many special cases from the above-mentioned processes. We calculate the asymptotic behavior of the correlation structure. We have discussed applications of time-changed generalized compound Poisson in shock modelling.</description>

      <title>Variational representation and estimates for the free energy of a quenched charged polymer model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Random walks with a disordered self-interaction potential may be used to model charged polymers. In this paper we consider a one-dimensional and directed version of the charged polymer model that was introduced by Derrida, Griffiths and Higgs. We prove new results for the associated quenched free energy, including a variational formula based on a quenched large deviation principle established by Birkner, Greven and den Hollander. We also take the occasion to (i) provide detailed proofs for state-of-the-art results pointing towards the existence of a freezing transition and (ii) proceed with minor corrections for two results previously obtained by the present author with Caravenna, den Hollander and P{\'e}tr{\'e}lis for the undirected model.</description>

      <title>Stationary distribution of node2vec random walks on household models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The node2vec random walk has proven to be a key tool in network embedding algorithms. These random walks are tuneable, and their transition probabilities depend on the previous visited node and on the triangles containing the current and the previously visited node. Even though these walks are widely used in practice, most mathematical properties of node2vec walks are largely unexplored, including their stationary distribution. We study the node2vec random walk on community-structured household model graphs. We prove an explicit description of the stationary distribution of node2vec walks in terms of the walk parameters. We then show that by tuning the walk parameters, the stationary distribution can interpolate between uniform, size-biased, or the simple random walk stationary distributions, demonstrating the wide range of possible walks. We further explore these effects on some specific graph settings.</description>

      <title>Counting domino and lozenge tilings of reduced domains with Pad\'{e}-type approximants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new method for studying gap probabilities in a class of discrete determinantal point processes with double contour integral kernels. This class of point processes includes uniform measures of domino and lozenge tilings as well as their doubly periodic generalizations. We use a Fourier series approach to simplify the form of the kernels and to characterize gap probabilities in terms of Riemann-Hilbert problems.
  As a first illustration of our approach, we obtain an explicit expression for the number of domino tilings of reduced Aztec diamonds in terms of Pad\'e approximants, by solving the associated Riemann-Hilbert problem explicitly. As a second application, we obtain an explicit expression for the number of lozenge tilings of (simply connected) reduced hexagons in terms of Hermite-Pad\'e approximants. For more complicated domains, such as hexagons with holes, the number of tilings involves a generalization of Hermite-Pad\'e approximants.</description>

      <title>Polynomial McKean-Vlasov SDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a new class of McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations (SDEs), possibly with common noise, applying the theory of time-inhomogeneous polynomial processes. The drift and volatility coefficients of these SDEs depend on the state variables themselves as well as their conditional moments in a way that mimics the standard polynomial structure. Our approach leads to new results on the existence and uniqueness of solutions to such conditional McKean-Vlasov SDEs which are, to the best of our knowledge, not obtainable using standard methods. Moreover, we show in the case without common noise that the moments of these McKean-Vlasov SDEs can be computed by non-linear ODEs. As a by-product, this also yields new results on the existence and uniqueness of global solutions to certain ODEs.</description>

      <title>General diffusions on the star graph as time-changed Walsh Brownian motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a representation of general regular diffusions on star-shaped graphs as time-changed Walsh Brownian motions. These are Markov processes with continuous sample paths whose law on each edge is described locally by generalized second-order operators, a gluing condition at the junction vertex, and boundary conditions. The representation is built upon two key results: (i) a time-change representation for the distance-to-origin process, and (ii) a probabilistic interpretation of the gluing condition. This result is leveraged to derive an occupation times formula for these processes.
  Additionally, we prove two results of independent interest. First, we provide conditions under which a diffusion on the star graph is Feller and Feller--Dynkin, extending classical results for one-dimensional diffusions. Second, we establish the existence and uniqueness of solutions to the Dirichlet problem on the unit disk of the star graph, along with an explicit expression for the corresponding Green function.</description>

Abstract: The aim of this paper is to study the fluctuations of a general class of supercritical branching Markov processes with non-local branching mechanisms. We show the existence of three regimes according to the size of the spectral gap associated with the expectation semigroup of the branching process and establish functional central limit theorems within each regime.</description>

Abstract: This note explores the implications of selecting vectors randomly from an infinite dimensional Hilbert space on linear independence under the assumption that for all $k$, the first $k$ vectors follow an absolutely continuous law regarding a probability measure. It demonstrates that no constraints on the random dimension of their span are necessary, provided that all strict affine subspaces are considered negligible with respect to the Hilbert space probability measure.</description>

      <title>Renormalized stochastic pressure equation with log-correlated Gaussian coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17195v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study periodic solutions to the following divergence-form stochastic partial differential equation with Wick-renormalized gradient on the $d$-dimensional flat torus $\mathbb{T}^d$,
  \[
  -\nabla\cdot\left(e^{\diamond (- \beta X) }\diamond\nabla U\right)=\nabla \cdot (e^{\diamond (- \beta X)} \diamond \mathbf{F}),
  \] where $X$ is the log-correlated Gaussian field, $\mathbf{F}$ is a random vector field representing the flux, the in/out-flow of fluid per unit area per unit time, and $\diamond$ denotes the Wick product. The problem is a variant of the stochastic pressure equation, in which $U$ is modeling the pressure of a creeping water-flow in crustal rock that occurs in enhanced geothermal heating. In the original model, the Wick exponential term $e^{\diamond(-\beta X)}$ is modeling the random permeability of the rock. The porosity field is given by a log-correlated Gaussian random field $\beta X$, where $\beta&lt;\sqrt{d}$. We use elliptic regularity theory in order to define a notion of a solution to this (a priori very ill-posed) problem, via modifying the $S$-transform from Gaussian white noise analysis, and then establish the existence and uniqueness of solutions. Moreover, we show that the solution to the problem can be expressed in terms of the Gaussian multiplicative chaos measure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11552v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The small mass limit of the Langevin equation perturbed by $\alpha$-stable L\'{e}vy noise is considered by rewriting it in the form of slow-fast system, and spliting the fast component into three parts, where $\alpha\in(1,2)$. By exploring the three parts respectively, the approximation equation is derived. The convergence is either in the sense of uniform metric or in the sense of Skorokhod metric, depending on how regular the noise is. In the former case, we obtain the convergence rate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17380v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish ergodic and mixing properties of stochastic 2D Navier-Stokes equations driven by a highly degenerate multiplicative Gaussian noise. The noise could appear in as few as four directions and the intensity of the noise depends on the solution. The case of additive Gaussian noise was treated in Hairer and Mattingly [\emph{Ann. of Math.}, 164(3):993--1032, 2006]. To obtain ergodic and mixing properties, we use Malliavin calculus to establish the asymptotically strong Feller property. The main difficulty lies in the proof of the "invertibility" of Malliavin matrix which is totally different from the additive case.</description>

      <title>Pairwise independent correlation gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.08563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.08563v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the notion of a ``pairwise independent correlation gap'' for set functions with random elements. The pairwise independent correlation gap is defined as the ratio of the maximum expected value of a set function with arbitrary dependence among the elements with fixed marginal probabilities to the maximum expected value with pairwise independent elements with the same marginal probabilities. We show that for any nonnegative monotone submodular set function defined on $n$ elements, this ratio is upper bounded by $4/3$ in the following two cases: (a) $n = 3$ for all marginal probabilities and (b) all $n$ for small marginal probabilities (and similarly large marginal probabilities). This differs from the bound on the ``correlation gap'' which holds with mutual independence and showcases the fundamental difference between pairwise independence and mutual independence. We discuss the implication of the results with two examples and end the paper with a conjecture.</description>

      <title>Endogenous distress contagion in a dynamic interbank model: how possible future losses may spell doom today</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.15431v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a dynamic and stochastic interbank model with an endogenous notion of distress contagion, arising from rational worries about future defaults and ensuing losses. This entails a mark-to-market valuation adjustment for interbank claims, leading to a forward-backward approach to the equilibrium dynamics whereby future default probabilities are needed to determine today's balance sheets. Distinct from earlier models, the resulting distress contagion acts, endogenously, as a stochastic volatility term that exhibits clustering and down-market spikes. Furthermore, by incorporating multiple maturities, we provide a novel framework for constructing systemic interbank term structures, reflecting the intertemporal risk of contagion. We present the analysis in two parts: first, the simpler single maturity setting that extends the classical interbank network literature and, then, the multiple maturity setting for which we can examine how systemic risk materialises in the shape of the resulting term structures.</description>

      <title>Hedging Valuation Adjustment for Callable Claims</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.02479v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we extend to callable assets the model risk approach of B{\'e}n{\'e}zet and Cr{\'e}pey (2024), itself leveraging on the notion of hedging valuation adjustment initially introduced for dealing with transaction costs in Burnett (2021) \&amp;amp; Burnett and Williams (2021). The classical way to deal with model risk is to reserve the differences between the valuations in reference models and in the local models used by traders. However, while traders' prices are thus corrected, their hedging strategies and their exercise decisions are still wrong, which necessitates a risk-adjusted reserve. We illustrate our approach on a stylized callable range accrual representative of huge amounts of structured products on the market. We showthat a model risk reserve adjusted for the risk of wrong exercise decisions may largely exceed a basic reserve only accounting for valuation differences.</description>

      <title>Mathematical Introduction to Deep Learning: Methods, Implementations, and Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.20360v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This book aims to provide an introduction to the topic of deep learning algorithms. We review essential components of deep learning algorithms in full mathematical detail including different artificial neural network (ANN) architectures (such as fully-connected feedforward ANNs, convolutional ANNs, recurrent ANNs, residual ANNs, and ANNs with batch normalization) and different optimization algorithms (such as the basic stochastic gradient descent (SGD) method, accelerated methods, and adaptive methods). We also cover several theoretical aspects of deep learning algorithms such as approximation capacities of ANNs (including a calculus for ANNs), optimization theory (including Kurdyka-{\L}ojasiewicz inequalities), and generalization errors. In the last part of the book some deep learning approximation methods for PDEs are reviewed including physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and deep Galerkin methods. We hope that this book will be useful for students and scientists who do not yet have any background in deep learning at all and would like to gain a solid foundation as well as for practitioners who would like to obtain a firmer mathematical understanding of the objects and methods considered in deep learning.</description>

      <title>Parametric Sensitivity Analysis for Models of Reaction Networks within Interacting Compartments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09208v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Models of reaction networks within interacting compartments (RNIC) are a generalization of stochastic reaction networks. It is most natural to think of the interacting compartments as "cells" that can appear, degrade, split, and even merge, with each cell containing an evolving copy of the underlying stochastic reaction network. Such models have a number of parameters, including those associated with the internal chemical model and those associated with the compartment interactions, and it is natural to want efficient computational methods for the numerical estimation of sensitivities of model statistics with respect to these parameters. Motivated by the extensive work on computational methods for parametric sensitivity analysis in the context of stochastic reaction networks over the past few decades, we provide a number of methods in the basic RNIC setting. Provided methods include the (unbiased) Girsanov transformation method (also called the Likelihood Ratio method) and a number of coupling methods for the implementation of finite differences, each motivated by methods from previous work related to stochastic reaction networks. We provide several numerical examples comparing the various methods in the new setting. We find that the relative performance of each method is in line with its analog in the "standard" stochastic reaction network setting. We have made all of the Matlab code used to implement the various methods freely available for download.</description>

      <title>On absolute continuity of inhomogeneous and contracting on average self-similar measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18936v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a condition for absolute continuity of self-similar measures in arbitrary dimensions. This allows us to construct the first explicit absolutely continuous examples of inhomogeneous self-similar measures in dimension one and two. In fact, for $d\geq 1$ and any given rotations in $O(d)$ acting irreducibly on $\mathbb{R}^d$ as well as any distinct translations, all having algebraic coefficients, we construct absolutely continuous self-similar measures with the given rotations and translations. We furthermore strengthen Varj\'u's result for Bernoulli convolutions, treat complex Bernoulli convolutions and in dimension $\geq 3$ improve the condition on absolute continuity by Lindenstrauss-Varj\'u. Moreover, self-similar measures of contracting on average measures are studied, which may include expanding similarities in their support.</description>

      <title>Malliavin Calculus for the stochastic heat equation and results on the density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10115v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the one-dimensional stochastic heat equation with unbounded, nonlinear,Lipschitz coefficients with Dirichlet boundary conditions. Using Malliavin calculus, we construct a piecewise approximation of the solution u and establish regularity results. This approximation enables us to provide a new proof of the existence of a density for the random variable u(t, x) at any fixed t, x. Unlike existing proofs, which rely on comparison principles ([10], [12]), our approach is based purely on a localization argument, which allows us to handle the unbounded coefficients.</description>

      <title>Proportion of Nilpotent Subgroups in Finite Groups and Their Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11724v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work introduces and investigates the function $J(G) = \frac{\text{Nil}(G)}{L(G)}$, where $\text{Nil}(G)$ denotes the number of nilpotent subgroups and $L(G)$ the total number of subgroups of a finite group $G$. The function $J(G)$, defined over the interval $(0,1]$, serves as a tool to analyze structural patterns in finite groups, particularly within non-nilpotent families such as supersolvable and dihedral groups. Analytical results demonstrate the product density of $J(G)$ values in $(0,1]$, highlighting its distribution across products of dihedral groups. Additionally, a probabilistic analysis was conducted, and based on extensive computational simulations, it was conjectured that the sample mean of $J(G)$ values converges in distribution to the standard normal distribution, in accordance with the Central Limit Theorem, as the sample size increases. These findings expand the understanding of multiplicative functions in group theory, offering novel insights into the structural and probabilistic behavior of finite groups.</description>

      <title>The No-Underrun Sampler: A Locally-Adaptive, Gradient-Free MCMC Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18548v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce the No-Underrun Sampler (NURS), a locally-adaptive, gradient-free Markov chain Monte Carlo method that blends ideas from Hit-and-Run and the No-U-Turn Sampler. NURS dynamically adapts to the local scale of the target distribution without requiring gradient evaluations, making it especially suitable for applications where gradients are unavailable or costly. We establish key theoretical properties, including reversibility, formal connections to Hit-and-Run and Random Walk Metropolis, Wasserstein contraction comparable to Hit-and-Run in Gaussian targets, and bounds on the total variation distance between the transition kernels of Hit-and-Run and NURS. Empirical experiments, supported by theoretical insights, illustrate the ability of NURS to sample from Neal's funnel, a challenging multi-scale distribution from Bayesian hierarchical inference.</description>
