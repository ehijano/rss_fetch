      <title>Enhanced Deep Potential Model for Fast and Accurate Molecular Dynamics; Application to the Hydrated Electron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In molecular simulations, neural network force fields aim at achieving \emph{ab initio} accuracy with reduced computational cost. This work introduces enhancements to the Deep Potential network architecture, integrating a message-passing framework and a new lightweight implementation with various improvements. Our model achieves accuracy on par with leading machine learning force fields and offers significant speed advantages, making it well-suited for large-scale, accuracy-sensitive systems. We also introduce a new iterative model for Wannier center prediction, allowing us to keep track of electron positions in simulations of general insulating systems. We apply our model to study the solvated electron in bulk water, an ostensibly simple system that is actually quite challenging to represent with neural networks. Our trained model is not only accurate, but can also transfer to larger systems. Our simulation confirms the cavity model, where the electron's localized state is observed to be stable. Through an extensive run, we accurately determine various structural and dynamical properties of the solvated electron.</description>

      <title>Quantum-informed simulations for mechanics of materials: DFTB+MBD framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The macroscopic behaviors of materials are determined by interactions that occur at multiple lengths and time scales. Depending on the application, describing, predicting, and understanding these behaviors require models that rely on insights from electronic and atomic scales. In such cases, classical simplified approximations at those scales are insufficient, and quantum-based modeling is required. In this paper, we study how quantum effects can modify the mechanical properties of systems relevant to materials engineering. We base our study on a high-fidelity modeling framework that combines two computationally efficient models rooted in quantum first principles: Density Functional Tight Binding (DFTB) and many-body dispersion (MBD). The MBD model is applied to accurately describe non-covalent van der Waals interactions. Through various benchmark applications, we demonstrate the capabilities of this framework and the limitations of simplified modeling. We provide an open-source repository containing all codes, datasets, and examples presented in this work. This repository serves as a practical toolkit that we hope will support the development of future research in effective large-scale and multiscale modeling with quantum-mechanical fidelity.</description>

      <title>Consistent Second-Order Treatment of Spin-Orbit Coupling and Dynamic Correlation in Quasidegenerate N-Electron Valence Perturbation Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a formulation and implementation of second-order quasidegenerate N-electron valence perturbation theory (QDNEVPT2) that provides a balanced and accurate description of spin-orbit coupling and dynamic correlation effects in multiconfigurational electronic states. In our approach, the energies and wavefunctions of electronic states are computed by treating electron repulsion and spin-orbit coupling operators as equal perturbations to the non-relativistic complete active-space wavefunctions and their contributions are incorporated fully up to the second order. The spin-orbit effects are described using the Breit-Pauli (BP) or exact two-component Douglas-Kroll-Hess (DKH) Hamiltonians within spin-orbit mean-field approximation. The resulting second-order methods (BP2- and DKH2-QDNEVPT2) are capable of treating spin-orbit coupling effects in nearly degenerate electronic states by diagonalizing an effective Hamiltonian expanded in a compact non-relativistic basis. For a variety of atoms and small molecules across the entire periodic table, we demonstrate that DKH2-QDNEVPT2 is competitive in accuracy with variational two-component relativistic theories. BP2-QDNEVPT2 shows high accuracy for the second- and third-period elements, but its performance deteriorates for heavier atoms and molecules. We also consider the first-order spin-orbit QDNEVPT2 approximations (BP1- and DKH1-QDNEVPT2), among which DKH1-QDNEVPT2 is reliable but less accurate than DKH2-QDNEVPT2. Both DKH1- and DKH2-QDNEVPT2 hold promise as efficient and accurate electronic structure methods for treating electron correlation and spin-orbit coupling in a variety of applications.</description>

      <title>Photon Many-body Dispersion: an Exchange-correlation Functional for Strongly Coupled Light-matter Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce an electron-photon exchange-correlation functional for quantum electrodynamical density-functional theory (QEDFT). The approach, photon MBD (pMBD), is inspired by the many-body dispersion (MBD) method for weak intermolecular interactions, which is generalized to include both electronic and photonic (electromagnetic) degrees of freedom on the same footing. We demonstrate that pMBD accurately captures effects that arise in the context of strong light-matter interactions, such as anisotropic electron-photon interactions, beyond single-photon effects, and cavity modulated van der Waals interactions. Moreover, we show that pMBD is computationally efficient and allows simulations of large complex systems coupled to optical cavities.</description>

      <title>Nonadiabatic Field on Quantum Phase Space: A Century after Ehrenfest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonadiabatic transition dynamics lies at the core of many electron/hole transfer, photoactivated, and vacuum field-coupled processes. About a century after Ehrenfest proposed "Phasenraum" and the Ehrenfest theorem, we report a conceptually novel trajectory-based nonadiabatic dynamics approach, nonadiabatic field (NaF), based on a generalized exact coordinate-momentum phase space formulation of quantum mechanics. It does not employ the conventional Born-Oppenheimer or Ehrenfest trajectory in the nonadiabatic coupling region. Instead, in NaF the equations of motion of the independent trajectory involve a nonadiabatic nuclear force term in addition to an adiabatic nuclear force term of a single electronic state. A few benchmark tests for gas phase and condensed phase systems indicate that NaF offers a practical tool to capture the correct correlation of electronic and nuclear dynamics for processes where the states remain coupled all the time as well as for the asymptotic region where the coupling of electronic states vanishes.</description>

      <title>A Novel Class of Phase Space Representations for the Exact Population Dynamics of Two-State Quantum Systems and the Relation to Triangle Window Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Isomorphism of the two-state system is heuristic in understanding the dynamical or statistical behavior of the simplest yet most quantum system that has no classical counterpart. We use constraint phase space [developed in J. Chem. Phys. 2016, 145, 204105; 2019, 151, 024105 and J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 2021, 12, 2496-2501], non-covariant phase space functions, time-dependent weight functions, and time-dependent normalization factors to construct a novel class of phase space representations of the exact population dynamics of the two-state quantum system. The equations of motion of the trajectory on constraint phase space are isomorphic to the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation. The contribution of each trajectory to the integral expression for the population dynamics is always positive semi-definite. We also prove that the triangle window function approach, albeit empirically proposed in J. Chem. Phys. 2016, 145, 144108, is related to a special case of the novel class and leads to an isomorphic representation of the exact population dynamics of the two-state quantum system.</description>

      <title>QArray: a GPU-accelerated constant capacitance model simulator for large quantum dot arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semiconductor quantum dot arrays are a leading architecture for the development of quantum technologies. Over the years, the constant capacitance model has served as a fundamental framework for simulating, understanding, and navigating the charge stability diagrams of small quantum dot arrays. However, while the size of the arrays keeps growing, solving the constant capacitance model becomes computationally prohibitive. This paper presents an open-source software package able to compute a $100 \times 100$ pixels charge stability diagram of a 16-dot array in less than a second. Smaller arrays can be simulated in milliseconds - faster than they could be measured experimentally, enabling the creation of diverse datasets for training machine learning models and the creation of digital twins that can interface with quantum dot devices in real-time. Our software package implements its core functionalities in the systems programming language Rust and the high-performance numerical computing library JAX. The Rust implementation benefits from advanced optimisations and parallelisation, enabling the users to take full advantage of multi-core processors. The JAX implementation allows for GPU acceleration.</description>

      <title>Nonadiabatic Field with Triangle Window Functions on Quantum Phase Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The constraint coordinate-momentum phase space (CPS) formulation of finite-state quantum systems has recently revealed that the triangle window function approach is an isomorphic representation of the exact population-population correlation function of the two-state system. We use the triangle window (TW) function and the CPS mapping kernel element to formulate a novel useful representation of discrete electronic degrees of freedom (DOFs). When it is employed with nonadiabatic field (NaF) dynamics, a new variant of the NaF approach (i.e., NaF-TW) is proposed. Extensive benchmark tests of model systems in both the condensed phase and gas phase demonstrate that the NaF-TW approach is competent in faithfully capturing the dynamical interplay between electronic and nuclear DOFs. In comparison to the symmetrical quasi-classical (SQC) method where triangle window functions were originally proposed, the performance of NaF-TW is significantly better when the bifurcation characteristic of nuclear motion in the asymptotic region is important.</description>

      <title>Provably Convergent and Robust Newton-Raphson Method: A New Dawn in Primitive Variable Recovery for Relativistic MHD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A long-standing and formidable challenge faced by all conservative schemes for relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD) is the recovery of primitive variables from conservative ones. This process involves solving highly nonlinear equations subject to physical constraints. An ideal solver should be "robust, accurate, and fast -- it is at the heart of all conservative RMHD schemes," as emphasized in [S.C. Noble et al., ApJ, 641:626-637, 2006]. Despite over three decades of research, seeking efficient solvers that can provably guarantee stability and convergence remains an open problem.
  This paper presents the first theoretical analysis for designing a robust, physical-constraint-preserving (PCP), and provably (quadratically) convergent Newton-Raphson (NR) method for primitive variable recovery in RMHD. Our key innovation is a unified approach for the initial guess, devised based on sophisticated analysis. It ensures that the NR iteration consistently converges and adheres to physical constraints. Given the extreme nonlinearity and complexity of the iterative function, the theoretical analysis is highly nontrivial and technical. We discover a pivotal inequality for delineating the convexity and concavity of the iterative function and establish theories to guarantee the PCP property and convergence. We also develop theories to determine a computable initial guess within a theoretical "safe" interval. Intriguingly, we find that the unique positive root of a cubic polynomial always falls within this interval. Our PCP NR method is versatile and can be seamlessly integrated into any RMHD scheme that requires the recovery of primitive variables, potentially leading to a broad impact in this field. As an application, we incorporate it into a discontinuous Galerkin method, resulting in fully PCP schemes. Several numerical experiments demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of the PCP NR method.</description>

      <title>Overcoming the numerical sign problem in the Wigner dynamics via adaptive particle annihilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.05161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2008.05161v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The infamous numerical sign problem poses a fundamental obstacle to particle-based stochastic Wigner simulations in high dimensional phase space. Although the existing particle annihilation via uniform mesh significantly alleviates the sign problem when dimensionality D $\le$ 4, the mesh size grows dramatically when D $\ge$ 6 due to the curse of dimensionality and consequently makes the annihilation very inefficient. In this paper, we propose an adaptive particle annihilation algorithm, termed Sequential-clustering Particle Annihilation via Discrepancy Estimation (SPADE), to overcome the sign problem. SPADE follows a divide-and-conquer strategy: Adaptive clustering of particles via controlling their number-theoretic discrepancies and independent random matching in each group, and it may learn the minimal amount of particles that can accurately capture the non-classicality of the Wigner function. Combining SPADE with the variance reduction technique based on the stationary phase approximation, we attempt to simulate the proton-electron couplings in 6-D and 12-D phase space. A thorough performance benchmark of SPADE is provided with the reference solutions in 6-D phase space produced by a characteristic-spectral-mixed scheme under a $73^3 \times 80^3$ uniform grid, which fully explores the limit of grid-based deterministic Wigner solvers.</description>

      <title>Effective Data-Driven Collective Variables for Free Energy Calculations from Metadynamics of Paths</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.05571v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A variety of enhanced sampling methods predict multidimensional free energy landscapes associated with biological and other molecular processes as a function of a few selected collective variables (CVs). The accuracy of these methods is crucially dependent on the ability of the chosen CVs to capture the relevant slow degrees of freedom of the system. For complex processes, finding such CVs is the real challenge. Machine learning (ML) CVs offer, in principle, a solution to handle this problem. However, these methods rely on the availability of high-quality datasets -- ideally incorporating information about physical pathways and transition states -- which are difficult to access, therefore greatly limiting their domain of application. Here, we demonstrate how these datasets can be generated by means of enhanced sampling simulations in trajectory space via the metadynamics of paths [arXiv:2002.09281] algorithm. The approach is expected to provide a general and efficient way to generate efficient ML-based CVs for the fast prediction of free energy landscapes in enhanced sampling simulations. We demonstrate our approach with two numerical examples, a two-dimensional model potential and the isomerization of alanine dipeptide, using deep targeted discriminant analysis as our ML-based CV of choice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.06103v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to compute the first quasi-normal modes of the Kerr geometry via the Teukolsky equation. This technique allows us to extract the complex frequencies and separation constants of the equation without the need for sophisticated numerical techniques, and with an almost immediate implementation under the \texttt{PyTorch} framework. We are able to compute the oscillation frequencies and damping times for arbitrary black hole spins and masses, with accuracy typically below the percentual level as compared to the accepted values in the literature. We find that PINN-computed quasi-normal modes are indistinguishable from those obtained through existing methods at signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) larger than 100, making the former reliable for gravitational-wave data analysis in the mid term, before the arrival of third-generation detectors like LISA or the Einstein Telescope, where SNRs of ${\cal O}(1000)$ might be achieved.</description>

      <title>Geometry-enhanced Pre-training on Interatomic Potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.15718v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) enables molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with ab initio accuracy and has been applied to various fields of physical science. However, the performance and transferability of MLIPs are limited by insufficient labeled training data, which require expensive ab initio calculations to obtain the labels, especially for complex molecular systems. To address this challenge, we design a novel geometric structure learning paradigm that consists of two stages. We first generate a large quantity of 3D configurations of target molecular system with classical molecular dynamics simulations. Then, we propose geometry-enhanced self-supervised learning consisting of masking, denoising, and contrastive learning to better capture the topology and 3D geometric information from the unlabeled 3D configurations. We evaluate our method on various benchmarks ranging from small molecule datasets to complex periodic molecular systems with more types of elements. The experimental results show that the proposed pre-training method can greatly enhance the accuracy of MLIPs with few extra computational costs and works well with different invariant or equivariant graph neural network architectures. Our method improves the generalization capability of MLIPs and helps to realize accurate MD simulations for complex molecular systems.</description>

      <title>Optimal finite-differences discretization for the diffusion equation from the perspective of large-deviation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18374</link>

Abstract: When applying the finite-differences method to numerically solve the one-dimensional diffusion equation, one must choose discretization steps $\Delta x$, $\Delta t$ in space and time, respectively. By applying large-deviation theory on the discretized dynamics, we analyze the numerical errors due to the discretization, and find that the (relative) errors are especially large in regions of space where the concentration of particles is very small. We find that the choice $\Delta t = {\Delta x}^2 / (6D)$, where $D$ is the diffusion coefficient, gives optimal accuracy compared to any other choice (including, in particular, the limit $\Delta t \to 0$), thus reproducing the known result that may be obtained using truncation error analysis. In addition, we give quantitative estimates for the dynamical lengthscale that describes the size of the spatial region in which the numerical solution is accurate, and study its dependence on the discretization parameters. We then turn to study the advection-diffusion equation, and obtain explicit expressions for the optimal $\Delta t$ and other parameters of the finite-differences scheme, in terms of $\Delta x$, $D$ and the advection velocity. We apply these results to study large deviations of the area swept by a diffusing particle in one dimension, trapped by an external potential $\sim |x|$. We extend our analysis to higher dimensions by combining our results from the one dimensional case with the locally one-dimension method.</description>

      <title>Multiple timestep reversible $N$-body integrators for close encounters in planetary systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07113v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present new almost time-reversible integrators for solution of planetary systems consisting of "planets" and a dominant mass ("star"). The algorithms can be considered adaptive generalizations of the Wisdom--Holman method, in which all pairs of planets can be assigned timesteps. These timesteps, along with the global timestep, can be adapted time-reversibly, often at no appreciable additional compute cost, without sacrificing any of the long-term error benefits of the Wisdom--Holman method. The method can also be considered a simpler and more flexible version of the \texttt{SYMBA} symplectic code. We perform tests on several challenging problems with close encounters and find the reversible algorithms are up to $2.6$ times faster than a code based on \texttt{SYMBA}. The codes presented here are available on Github. We also find adapting a global timestep reversibly and discretely must be done in block-synchronized manner or similar.</description>

      <title>Electron-Tunnelling-Noise Programmable Random Variate Accelerator for Monte Carlo Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16421v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article presents an electron tunneling noise programmable random variate accelerator for accelerating the sampling stage of Monte Carlo simulations. We used the LiteX framework to generate a FemtoRV imfc RISC-V instruction set soft processor and deploy it on a Digilent Arty-100T FPGA development board. The RISC-V soft processor augmented with our programmable random variate accelerator achieves an average speedup of 8.70 times and a median speedup of 8.68 times for a suite of twelve different benchmark applications when compared to GNU Scientific Library software random number generation. These speedups are achievable because the benchmarks spend an average of 90.0 % of their execution time generating random samples. The results of the Monte Carlo benchmark programs run over the programmable random variate accelerator have an average Wasserstein distance of 1.48 times and a median Wasserstein distance of 1.41 times that of the results produced by the GNU Scientific Library random number generators. The soft processor samples the electron tunneling noise source using the hardened XADC block in the FPGA. The flexibility of the LiteX framework allows for the deployment of any LiteX-supported soft processor with an electron tunneling noise programmable random variate accelerator on any LiteX-supported development board that contains an FPGA with an XADC.</description>
