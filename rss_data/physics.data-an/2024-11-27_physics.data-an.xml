      <title>In search of rogue waves: a novel proposal distribution for parallelized rejection sampling of the truncated KdV Gibbs measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Gibbs ensemble of the truncated KdV (TKdV) equation has been shown to accurately describe the anomalous wave statistics observed in laboratory experiments, in particular the emergence of extreme events. Here, we introduce a novel proposal distribution that facilitates efficient rejection sampling of the TKdV Gibbs measure. Within parameter regimes accessible to laboratory experiments and capable of producing extreme events, the proposal distribution generates 1--6 orders of magnitude more accepted samples than does a naive, uniform distribution. When equipped with the new proposal distribution, a simple rejection algorithm enjoys key advantages over a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm, include better parallelization properties and generation of uncorrelated samples.</description>

      <title>Multiscale analysis of the textural atomization process of a rocket engine assisted coaxial jet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A method for analyzing liquid ligaments of a textural atomization process is presented in this article for the case of a rocket engine type assisted atomization process under combustion. The operating point positions the atomization process in the fiber type regime carrying an intense textural atomization process. Multiscale in nature, the method based on image analysis associates a scale distribution with a family of ligaments, this distribution being sensitive to the number, size and shape of these ligaments. The quality of scale distributions measured by image analysis depends on the spatial resolution and the precision of area measurements of surfaces with curved boundaries but described by square pixels. Part of the work consisted of improving the method for measuring scale distributions by using a subpixel image analysis technique and refining the surface area measurement method. Another part directed the multiscale analysis towards the estimation of the diameter distributions of the blobs that characterize the large-scale deformation of the ligaments. The analysis describes the atomization process at a level of detail never reached. For instance, assuming that the blobs are drops in formation, the estimated diameter distribution (bimodal in the case examined here) as well as the number of these drops are evaluated as a function of the distance from the injector. This information indicates where the process is most intense and where it stops. Furthermore, these diameter distributions receive a mathematical expression whose parameters report clear evolutions with the distance from the injector. This shows the possibility of elaborating mathematical models appropriate for textural atomization mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Propagation within Chained Models for Machine Learning Reconstruction of Neutrino-LAr Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09864v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sequential or chained models are increasingly prevalent in machine learning for scientific applications, due to their flexibility and ease of development. Chained models are particularly useful when a task is separable into distinct steps with a hierarchy of meaningful intermediate representations. In reliability-critical tasks, it is important to quantify the confidence of model inferences. However, chained models pose an additional challenge for uncertainty quantification, especially when input uncertainties need to be propagated. In such cases, a fully uncertainty-aware chain of models is required, where each step accepts a probability distribution over the input space, and produces a probability distribution over the output space. In this work, we present a case study for adapting a single model within an existing chain, designed for reconstruction within neutrino-Argon interactions, developed for neutrino oscillation experiments such as MicroBooNE, ICARUS, and the future DUNE experiment. We test the performance of an input uncertainty-enabled model against an uncertainty-blinded model using a method for generating synthetic noise. By comparing these two, we assess the increase in inference quality achieved by exposing models to upstream uncertainty estimates.</description>

      <title>Graph Frequency Features of Cancer Gene Co-Expression Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06747v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complex gene interactions play a significant role in cancer progression, driving cellular behaviors that contribute to tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis. Gene co-expression networks model the functional connectivity between genes under various biological conditions. Understanding the system-level evolution of these networks in cancer is critical for elucidating disease mechanisms and informing the development of targeted therapies. While previous studies have primarily focused on structural differences between cancer and normal cell co-expression networks, this study applies graph frequency analysis to cancer transcriptomic signals defined on gene co-expression networks, highlighting the graph spectral characteristics of cancer systems. Using a range of graph frequency filters, we showed that cancer cells display distinctive patterns in the graph frequency content of their gene transcriptomic signals, effectively distinguishing between cancer types and stages. The transformation of the original gene feature space into the graph spectral space captured more intricate cancer properties, as validated by significantly higher F-statistic scores for graph frequency-filtered gene features compared to those in the original space.</description>

      <title>Towards Monte Carlo based Full Spectrum Modeling of Airborne Gamma-Ray Spectrometry Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02606v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This monograph presents advancements in Airborne Gamma-Ray Spectrometry (AGRS), a critical tool for emergency response to radiological incidents such as severe nuclear accidents or nuclear weapon detonations. Current AGRS calibration and data evaluation methods struggle to accurately quantify many radioactive materials expected in radiological emergencies, limiting the risk assessment and, hence, the effectiveness of emergency response actions. To address these limitations, this work introduces a full spectrum numerical modeling approach that features three key innovations: high-fidelity Monte Carlo simulations that combine an advanced scintillation physics model with detailed geometric representations of the aircraft and detector system; a surrogate model that replicates the Monte Carlo simulations with significantly reduced computation time; and a data evaluation methodology that leverages the surrogate model within a Bayesian inversion framework, enabling the quantification of arbitrarily complex gamma-ray fields. The methodology presented here, rigorously validated through laboratory and field measurements, achieves not only a significant improvement in accuracy and sensitivity over traditional methods but also substantially expands the operational capabilities of AGRS systems for both emergency response scenarios and geophysical surveys. These innovations lay the groundwork for establishing a new global standard for AGRS, ultimately supporting better-informed protective actions and reducing health risks during radiological emergencies.</description>
