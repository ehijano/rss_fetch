      <title>Circumstellar Interaction in the Ultraviolet Spectra of SN 2023ixf 14-66 Days After Explosion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SN 2023ixf was discovered in M101 within a day of explosion and rapidly classified as a Type II supernova with flash features. Here we present ultraviolet (UV) spectra obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope 14, 19, 24, and 66 days after explosion. Interaction between the supernova ejecta and circumstellar material (CSM) is seen in the UV throughout our observations in the flux of the first three epochs and asymmetric MgII emission at day 66. We compare our observations to CMFGEN supernova models which include CSM interaction ($\dot{M}&lt;10^{-3}$ $M_{\odot}$/yr) and find that the power from CSM interaction is decreasing with time, from $L_{\rm sh}\approx5\times10^{42}$ erg/s at day 14 to $L_{sh}\approx1\times10^{40}$ erg/s at day 66. We examine the contribution of individual atomic species to the spectra at day 14 and 19, showing that the majority of the features are dominated by iron, nickel, magnesium, and chromium absorption in the ejecta. The UV spectral energy distribution of SN 2023ixf sits between that of supernovae which show no definitive signs of CSM interaction and those with persistent signatures assuming the same progenitor radius and metallicity. Finally, we show that the evolution and asymmetric shape of the MgII emission are not unique to SN 2023ixf. These observations add to the early measurements of dense, confined CSM interaction, tracing the mass-loss history of SN 2023ixf to $\sim33$ yr prior to explosion and the density profile to a radius of $\sim5.7\times10^{15}$ cm. They show the relatively short evolution from quiescent red supergiant wind to high mass loss.</description>

      <title>$\gamma$-Cascade V4: A Semi-Analytical Code for Modeling Cosmological Gamma-Ray Propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the universe is not transparent to gamma rays with energies above around one hundred GeV, it is necessary to account for the interaction of high-energy photons with intergalactic radiation fields in order to model gamma-ray propagation. Here, we present a public numerical software for the modeling of gamma-ray observables. This code computes the effects on gamma-ray spectra from the development of electromagnetic cascades and cosmological redshifting. The code introduced here is based on the original $\gamma$-Cascade, and builds on it by improving its performance at high redshifts, introducing new propagation modules, and adding many more extragalactic radiation field models, which enables the ability to estimate the uncertainties inherent to EBL modeling. We compare the results of this new code to existing electromagnetic transport models.</description>

      <title>Are long gamma-ray bursts progenitors to merging binary black holes?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The distribution of delay times between the formation of binary black hole (BBH) progenitors and their gravitational-wave (GW) merger provides important clues about their unknown formation histories. When inferring the delay time distribution, it is typically assumed that BBH progenitor formation traces the star formation rate (SFR). In this work, we consider the rate of long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) instead of the SFR. LGRBs are thought to correspond to the formation of (possibly spinning) black holes, and may therefore be related to the population of BBH progenitors. By comparing the redshift evolution of the LGRB rate as inferred by Ghirlanda &amp; Salvaterra (2022) and the BBH merger rate inferred by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) observations, we find that the delay time distribution between LGRBs and BBH mergers is well-described by a power law with minimum delay time $10$ Myr and slope $\alpha ={-0.96}^{+0.64}_{-0.85}$ (90\% credibility). This matches theoretical predictions for the BBH delay time distribution, which in turns lends support to the hypothesis that LGRBs trace BBH progenitor formation. However, comparing the absolute rates of these two populations, we find that at most $f = {0.04}^{+0.18}_{-0.03}$ of LGRBs may evolve into merging BBH. We also consider the possibility that LGRBs only produce BBH systems with large aligned spins (with effective inspiral spin $\chi_\mathrm{eff} &gt; 0.2$). In this case, we find $f = {0.003}^{+0.011}_{-0.002}$ and the delay time distribution favors the steepest power law slopes we consider ($\alpha = -2$).</description>

      <title>The 230 GHz Variability of Numerical Models of Sagittarius A* II. The Physical Origins of the Variability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explored in Chan et al. 2024 how the ion-electron temperature ratio affects certain numerical models of Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*). Specifically, we studied these effects in magnetic-dominated regions in magnetic-arrested disk (MAD), focusing on the $3$-hour variability at $230$ GHz -- $M_{\Delta T}$. In this study, we investigate how variations in electron temperature prescription parameter, $R_{\rm Low}$, influence $M_{\Delta T}$ by analyzing a series of general-relativistic raytracing (GRRT) snapshots. In certain black hole models with a spin $a &gt; 0$, we discover that increasing $R_{\rm Low}$ renders the photon ring more optically thick, obscuring the varying accretion flows that contribute to the variability. However, as $R_{\rm Low}$ increases further, MAD flux eruptions become more pronounced, compensating for the decrease in $M_{\Delta T}$. For models with a spin $a &lt; 0$, although a higher $R_{\rm Low}$ also increases the optical thickness of the fluid, voids within the optically thick gas fail to cover the entire photon ring. Similarly, flux eruptions are more prominent as $R_{\rm Low}$ increases further, contributing to the observed rise in $M_{\Delta T}$ against $R_{\rm Low}$. For black holes with $a \approx 0$, although the effect of increasing optical depth is still present, their $230$ GHz light curves and hence $M_{\Delta T}$ are insensitive to the changes in $R_{\rm Low}$. Furthermore, we find that the variability of the $230$ GHz light curves at $R_{\rm Low} = 1$ correlates with fluctuations in the internal energy of the gas near the black hole, indicating that unusual gas heating may be the source of significant $M_{\Delta T}$ seen in simulations. Our findings highlight potential approaches for refining $M_{\Delta T}$ to better align with observations when modelling Sgr A* or other low-luminosity active galactic nuclei.</description>

      <title>The propagation-induced circular polarization of fast radio bursts in relativistic plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although the physical origin of fast radio bursts (FRBs) remains unknown, magnetars are the most likely candidates. The polarization properties of FRBs offer crucial insights into their origins and radiation mechanisms. Significant circular polarization (CP) has been observed in some FRBs. CP may result from intrinsic radiation or propagation effects, both within and outside the magnetosphere. Recent observations indicate that polarization properties of FRB 20201124A can change over short timescales (about tens of milliseconds), challenging models that attribute CP to out-of-magnetosphere emission and propagation. Additionally, some magnetospheric radiation models predict that bursts with high CP produced by off-axis emission will be systematically fainter, which contradicts the observations. We propose that CP arises from magnetospheric propagation effects caused by relativistic plasma. We identify the conditions under which high CP occurs, finding it to be rare. Moreover, our model accounts for the more commonly observed low CP and the varying handedness of CP.</description>

      <title>Effects from Dark Matter Halos on X-ray Pulsar Pulse Profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutron stars (NSs) can capture dark matter (DM) particles because of their deep gravitational potential and high density. The accumulated DM can affect the properties of NSs. In this work we use a general relativistic two-fluid formalism to solve the structure of DM-admixed NSs (DANSs) and the surrounding spacetime. Specifically, we pay attention to the situation where those DANSs possess DM halos. Due to the gravitational effect of the DM halo, the pulse profile of an X-ray pulsar is changed. Our study finds a universal relation between the peak flux deviation of the pulse profile and $M_{\rm halo}/R_{\rm BM}$, which is the ratio of the DM halo mass, $M_{\rm halo}$, to the baryonic matter (BM) core radius, $R_{\rm BM}$. Our results show that, when $M_{\rm halo}/R_{\rm BM}=0.292$ and the DM particle mass $m_f = 0.3\,$GeV, the maximum deviation of the profile can be larger than 100$\%$, which has implication in X-ray pulsar observation.</description>

      <title>X-ray Polarimetry of X-ray Pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiation from X-ray pulsars (XRPs) was expected to be strongly linearly polarized owing to a large difference in their ordinary and extraordinary mode opacities. The launch of IXPE allowed us to check this prediction. IXPE observed a dozen X-ray pulsars, discovering pulse-phase dependent variation of the polarization degree (PD) and polarization angle (PA). Although the PD showed rather erratic profiles resembling flux pulse dependence, the PA in most cases showed smooth variations consistent with the rotating vector model (RVM), which can be interpreted as a combined effect of vacuum birefringence and dipole magnetic field structure at a polarization-limiting (adiabatic) radius. Application of the RVM allowed us to determine XRP geometry and to confirm the free precession of the NS in Her X-1. Deviations from RVM in two bright transients led to the discovery of an unpulsed polarized emission likely produced by scattering off the accretion disk wind.</description>

      <title>Black hole mass and optical radiation mechanism of the tidal disruption event AT 2023clx</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the optical light curves of the tidal disruption event (TDE) AT 2023clx in the declining phase, observed with Mephisto. Combining our light curve with the ASAS-SN and ATLAS data in the rising phase, and fitting the composite multi-band light curves with MOSFiT, we estimate black hole mass of AT 2023clx is between $10^{5.67}$--$10^{5.82}~M_{\odot}$. This event may be caused by either a full disruption of a $0.1~M_{\odot}$ star, or a partial disruption of a $0.99~M_{\odot}$ star, depending on the data adopted for the rising phase. Based on those fit results and the non-detection of soft X-ray photons in the first 90 days, we propose that the observed optical radiation is powered by stream-stream collision. We speculate that the soft X-ray photons may gradually emerge in 100--600 days after the optical peak, when the debris is fully circularized into a compact accretion disk.</description>

      <title>Investigating the effect of hadronic models on IACT images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The predictions of hadronic interaction models for cosmic-ray induced air showers contain inherent uncertainties due to limitations of available accelerator data. This leads to differences in shower simulations using each of those models. Many studies have been carried out to track those differences by investigating the shower development or the particle content. In this work, we propose a new approach to search for discrepancies and similarities between the models, via the IACT images resulting from the observations of hadronic air showers. We use simulations of H.E.S.S. as a show-case scenario and, by investigating variables of the camera images, we find potential indicators to highlight differences between models. Number of pixels, Hillas image size, and density showed the largest difference between the models. We then further explore the (in)compatibility of the models by combining all the variables and using Boosted Decision Trees. For protons, a significant difference in the classifier output is found for EPOS-LHC when compared to both QGSJET-II04 and Sybill 2.3d. For helium and nitrogen, QGSJET-II04 is shown to be the outlier case. No significant differences are found for silicon and iron. The distribution of (in)compatibility between the models in the phase space of shower parameters shows that a targeted search can be fruitful, with showers with energies of a few TeV and core closer to the large telescope presenting the largest power of separation.</description>

      <title>An empirical background modeling tool (TweedleDEE) applied to new Milky Way satellite Leo VI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a computational tool, TweedleDEE, for empirically modeling diffuse gamma-ray background emission in a 1 degree region of the sky, using publicly available gamma-ray data slightly off-axis from this region. This background model allows a user to perform a purely data-driven search for anomalous localized sources of gamma-ray emission, including new physics. As an application, we use TweedleDEE and the MADHATv2 package to perform the first search for dark matter annihilation in the newly discovered Leo VI dwarf spheroidal galaxy, and present model constraints for a variety of choices of the annihilation channel and velocity dependence of the cross section.</description>

      <title>Cold fronts in galaxy clusters I: A case for the large-scale global eigen modes in unmagnetized and weakly magnetized cluster core</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Galaxy clusters show large-scale azimuthal X-ray surface brightness fluctuations known as cold fronts. These are overdense (average density jumps $\sim 30\%$ or post-jump density $\sim 130\%$) and have milder discontinuity in pressure. Cold fronts are argued to originate due to sloshing driven by sub-halo passage at close proximity to the cluster center. While this is a viable source of large-scale perturbations, the physical mechanisms that can sustain such density structures (of specific geometry) are not clear. In this work, we explore whether long wavelength thermal instability is an explanation for cold front formation in a cluster core which is perturbed by sub-halos or AGN activity. Using global linear perturbation analysis, we show that internal gravity waves (thermally unstable) can form large-scale three-dimensional spiral structures, akin to observed cold fronts. We explore if the presence of magnetic field (along spherical $\hat{\phi}$) may support such structures (by suppressing small scale Kelvin-Helmholtz modes) or disrupt them (by promoting additional thermal instability). We find that latter happens at shorter wavelengths and only at frequencies above the characteristic buoyancy or Brunt V\"ais\"al\"a frequency ($&gt;N_{\rm BV}$). Our work implies, firstly, that large-scale spirals may be formed and sustained over a long timescale ($&gt;N^{-1}_{\rm BV}$) even in presence of aligned magnetic fields that is otherwise supportive against mixing at the interface. Secondly, short-wavelength (but relatively longer along the field) unstable compressive modes may form within or in the vicinity of such spirals. The instability is an overstable slow wave, and grows in 2D at timescales $\gtrsim 2-3$ times longer than the spiral growth timescale (via thermal instability). Thus we claim that this instability cannot destroy the large scale coherence.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Three-Body Problem at High Eccentricities = Simple Pendulum II: Octupole including Brown's Hamiltonian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The very long-term evolution of the hierarchical restricted three-body problem with a massive perturber is analyzed analytically in the high eccentricity regime. Perturbations on the time scale of the outer orbit can accumulate over long timescales and be comparable to the effect of the octupole term. These perturbations are described by Brown's Hamiltonian - having different forms in the literature. We show that at the high eccentricity regime - the effect of Brown's Hamiltonian is an azimuthal precesssion of the eccentricity vector and can be solved analytically. In fact, the dynamics are equivalent to a simple pendulum model allowing an explicit flip criterion.</description>

      <title>Variable, circularly polarized radio emission from the Young Stellar Object [BHB2007]-1: another ingredient of a unique system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The young stellar object [BHB2007]-1 has been extensively studied in the past at radio, millimeter, and infrared wavelengths. It shows a gap in the disk and previous observations claimed the possible emission from a forming sub-stellar object, in correspondence to the disk gap. Here, we analyze a set of 8 Karl Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) observations at 15 GHz and spread over a month. We infer a slowly variable emission from the star, with a $\sim 15 \text{-} 20\%$ circular polarization detected in two of the eight observations. The latter can be related to the magnetic fields in the system, while the unpolarized and moderately varying component can be indicative of free-free emission associated with jet induced shocks or interaction of the stellar wind with dense surrounding material. We discard any relevant short flaring activities when sampling the radio light curves down to 10 seconds and find no clear evidence of emission from the sub-stellar object inferred from past observations, although deeper observations could shed further light on this.</description>

      <title>Transverse instability of electron-acoustic solitons in a relativistic degenerate astrophysical magnetoplasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the nonlinear theory of small-amplitude electron-acoustic solitons (EASs) in a relativistic astrophysical magnetoplasma consisting of two-temperature electrons: a sparse population of relativistic nondegenerate classical electrons and a group of fully degenerate dense relativistic electrons (main constituent) immersed in a static magnetic field with a neutralizing stationary ion background. By using the multiple-scale reductive perturbation technique with the Lorentz transformation, the Zakharov-Kuznetsov (ZK) and the modified Zakharov-Kuznetsov (mZK) equations are derived to describe the evolution of EASs in two different regimes of relativistic degeneracy: $r_{d0}&lt;50$ and $r_{d0}\gtrsim50$. The characteristics of the plane soliton solutions of ZK and mZK equations and the soliton energy are studied. We show that the solitons moving at an angle $\alpha$ to the external magnetic field can be unstable under transverse long-wavelength perturbations. The growth rates of instabilities are obtained and analyzed with the effects of the relativity parameter $\beta_{\rm{cl}}=k_BT_{\rm{cl}}/m_ec^2$ and the degeneracy parameter $r_{d0}$, where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant and $T_{\rm{cl}}$ is the temperature of classical electrons. Interestingly, the ZK solitons, even if it is stable for the first-order perturbations, can be unstable in the second-order correction. Furthermore, while the first-order growth rates of perturbations for ZK solitons tend to vanish as $\alpha\rightarrow 38^\circ$, that for the mZK soliton goes to zero as $\alpha\rightarrow 90^\circ$. However, depending on the angle $\alpha$, the growth rates are found to be reduced either by increasing the values of $\beta_{\rm{cl}}$ or by decreasing the values of $r_{d0}$. The applications of our results to astrophysical plasmas, such as those in the environments of white dwarfs are discussed.</description>

      <title>Eccentric features in the gravitational wave phase of dynamically formed black hole binaries</title>

Abstract: We study the gravitational wave (GW) phase shift arising from R{\o}mer delay in binary black hole (BBH) mergers formed dynamically in three-body systems, where both the inner orbit of the merging binary and the outer orbit are eccentric. We provide a semi-analytical model and several analytical approximations that allow for fast evaluation of both the temporal evolution and the maximum value of the phase shift. The highest phase shifts occur when the binary merges close to the pericentre of the outer orbit, and can in this case be orders-of-magnitude larger compared to the circular limit. At high outer orbit eccentricities, the orbital curvature leaves distinct imprints onto the phase shift if the binary passes the outer pericentre during its inspiral. By comparing with phase-shifts measured in numerical chaotic 3-body scatterings, we show that our model accurately describes the observed phase of dynamically assembled binary systems in realistic astrophysical scenarios, providing a way to directly determine their formation channel via single GW observations.</description>

      <title>Cygnus X-3 revealed as a Galactic ultraluminous X-ray source by IXPE</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.01174v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The accretion of matter by compact objects can be inhibited by radiation pressure if the luminosity exceeds the critical value, known as the Eddington limit. Discovery of ultraluminous X-ray sources has shown that accretion can proceed even when the apparent luminosity significantly exceeds this limit. High apparent luminosity might be produced thanks to geometric beaming of the radiation by an outflow. The outflow half-opening angle, which determines the amplification due to beaming, has never been robustly constrained. Using the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer, we made the measurement of X-ray polarization in the Galactic X-ray binary Cyg X-3. We find high, over 20%, nearly energy-independent linear polarization, orthogonal to the direction of the radio ejections. These properties unambiguously indicate the presence of a collimating outflow in the X-ray binary Cyg~X-3 and constrain its half-opening angle, &lt;15 degrees. Thus, the source can be used as a laboratory for studying the super-critical accretion regime. This finding underscores the importance of X-ray polarimetry in advancing our understanding of accreting sources.</description>

      <title>Probing pre-supernova mass loss in double-peaked Type Ibc supernovae from the Zwicky Transient Facility</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.04698v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Eruptive mass loss of massive stars prior to supernova (SN) explosion is key to understanding their evolution and end fate. An observational signature of pre-SN mass loss is the detection of an early, short-lived peak prior to the radioactive-powered peak in the lightcurve of the SN. This is usually attributed to the SN shock passing through an extended envelope or circumstellar medium (CSM). Such an early peak is common for double-peaked Type IIb SNe with an extended Hydrogen envelope but is uncommon for normal Type Ibc SNe with very compact progenitors. In this paper, we systematically study a sample of 14 double-peaked Type Ibc SNe out of 475 Type Ibc SNe detected by the Zwicky Transient Facility. The rate of these events is ~ 3-9 % of Type Ibc SNe. A strong correlation is seen between the peak brightness of the first and the second peak. We perform a holistic analysis of this sample's photometric and spectroscopic properties. We find that six SNe have ejecta mass less than 1.5 Msun. Based on the nebular spectra and lightcurve properties, we estimate that the progenitor masses for these are less than ~ 12 Msun. The rest have an ejecta mass &gt; 2.4 Msun and a higher progenitor mass. This sample suggests that the SNe with low progenitor masses undergo late-time binary mass transfer. Meanwhile, the SNe with higher progenitor masses are consistent with wave-driven mass loss or pulsation-pair instability-driven mass loss simulations.</description>

      <title>Imprints of massive black-hole binaries on neighbouring decihertz gravitational-wave sources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.06335v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The most massive black holes in our Universe form binaries at the centre of merging galaxies. The recent evidence for a gravitational-wave (GW) background from pulsar timing may constitute the first observation that these supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) merge. Yet, the most massive SMBHBs are out of reach of interferometric {GW} detectors and are exceedingly difficult to resolve individually with pulsar timing. These limitations call for unexplored strategies to detect individual SMBHBs in the uncharted frequency band $\lesssim10^{-5}\,\rm Hz$ in order to establish their abundance and decipher the coevolution with their host galaxies. Here we show that SMBHBs imprint detectable long-term modulations on GWs from stellar-mass binaries residing in the same galaxy. We determine that proposed deci-Hz GW interferometers sensitive to numerous stellar-mass binaries could uncover modulations from $\sim\mathscr{O}(10^{-1}$ - $10^4)$ SMBHBs with masses $\sim\mathscr{O}(10^7$ - $10^8)\,\rm M_\odot$ out to redshift $z\sim3.5$. This offers a unique opportunity to map the population of SMBHBs through cosmic time, which might remain inaccessible otherwise.</description>

Abstract: Binary systems containing a compact object may exhibit periodic brightening episodes due to gravitational lensing as the compact object transits the companion star. Such ``self-lensing'' signatures have been detected before for white dwarf binaries. We attempt to use these signatures to identify detached stellar-mass neutron star and black hole binaries using data from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). We present a systematic search for self-lensing signals in Galactic binaries from a subset of high-cadence ZTF data taken in 2018. We identify 12 plausible candidates from the search, although because each candidate is observed to only brighten once, other origins such as stellar flares are more likely. We discuss prospects for more comprehensive future searches of the ZTF data.</description>

      <title>Inferring host-galaxy properties of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA's black holes</title>

Abstract: Observations of gravitational waves from binary black hole (BBH) mergers have measured the redshift evolution of the BBH merger rate. The number density of galaxies in the Universe evolves differently with redshift based on their physical properties, such as their stellar masses and star formation rates. In this work we show that the measured population-level redshift distribution of BBHs sheds light on the properties of their probable host-galaxies. We first assume that the hosts of BBHs can be described by a mixture model of galaxies weighted by stellar mass or star formation rate, and find that we can place upper limits on the fraction of mergers coming from a stellar mass weighted sample of galaxies. We then constrain parameters of a physically motivated power-law delay-time distribution using GWTC-3 data, and self-consistently track galaxies in the \textsc{UniverseMachine} simulations with this delay-time model to infer the probable host-galaxies of BBHs over a range of redshifts. We find that the inferred host-galaxy distribution at redshift $z=0.21$ has a median star formation rate $\sim 0.9\,M_\odot\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ and a median stellar mass of $\sim 1.9 \times 10^{10}\,M_\odot$. We also provide distributions for the mean stellar age, halo mass, halo radius, peculiar velocity, and large scale bias associated with the host-galaxies, as well as their absolute magnitudes in the B- and ${ \rm K_s}$-bands. Our results can be used to design optimal electromagnetic follow-up strategies for BBHs, and also to aid the measurement of cosmological parameters using the statistical dark siren method.</description>

      <title>Bayesian inference of multimessenger astrophysical data: Joint and coherent inference of gravitational waves and kilonovae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03750v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a Bayesian framework for joint and coherent analyses of multimessenger binary neutron star signals. The method, implemented in our bajes infrastructure, incorporates a joint likelihood for multiple datasets, support for various semi-analytical kilonova models and numerical-relativity (NR) informed relations for the mass ejecta, as well as a technique to include and marginalize over modeling uncertainties. As a first application, we analyze the gravitational-wave GW170817 and the kilonova AT2017gfo data. These results are then combined with the most recent X-ray pulsars analyses of PSR J0030+0451 and PSR J0740+6620 to obtain EOS constraints.Various constraints on the mass-radius diagram and neutron star properties are then obtained by resampling over a set of ten million parametrized EOS built under minimal assumptions. We find that a joint and coherent approach improves the inference of the extrinsic parameters (distance) and, among the instrinc parameters, the mass ratio. The inclusion of NR informed relations strongly improves over the case of using an agnostic prior on the intrinsic parameters. Comparing Bayes factors, we find that the two observations are better explained by the common source hypothesis only by assuming NR-informed relations. These relations break some of the degeneracies in the employed kN models. The EOS inference folding-in PSR J0952-0607 minimum-maximum mass, PSR J0030+0451 and PSR J0740+6620 data constrains, among other quantities, the neutron star radius to $R_{1.4}={12.30}^{+0.81}_{-0.56}$ km ($R_{1.4}={13.20}^{+0.91}_{-0.90}$ km) and the maximum mass to $M_{max}={2.28}^{+0.25}_{-0.17}~{\rm M_\odot}$ ($M_{max}={2.32}^{+0.30}_{-0.19}~{\rm M_\odot}$) where the ST+PDT (PDT-U) analysis of Vinciguerra et a (2023) for PSR J0030+0451 is employed. Hence, the systematics on PSR J0030+0451 data reduction currently dominate the mass-radius diagram constraints.</description>

      <title>SN 2023zaw: an ultra-stripped, nickel-poor supernova from a low-mass progenitor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08165v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present SN 2023zaw $-$ a sub-luminous ($\mathrm{M_r} = -16.7$ mag) and rapidly-evolving supernova ($\mathrm{t_{1/2,r}} = 4.9$ days), with the lowest nickel mass ($\approx0.002$ $\mathrm{M_\odot}$) measured among all stripped-envelope supernovae discovered to date. The photospheric spectra are dominated by broad He I and Ca NIR emission lines with velocities of $\sim10\ 000 - 12\ 000$ $\mathrm{km\ s^{-1}}$. The late-time spectra show prominent narrow He I emission lines at $\sim$1000$\ \mathrm{km\ s^{-1}}$, indicative of interaction with He-rich circumstellar material. SN 2023zaw is located in the spiral arm of a star-forming galaxy. We perform radiation-hydrodynamical and analytical modeling of the lightcurve by fitting with a combination of shock-cooling emission and nickel decay. The progenitor has a best-fit envelope mass of $\approx0.2$ $\mathrm{M_\odot}$ and an envelope radius of $\approx50$ $\mathrm{R_\odot}$. The extremely low nickel mass and low ejecta mass ($\approx0.5$ $\mathrm{M_\odot}$) suggest an ultra-stripped SN, which originates from a mass-losing low mass He-star (ZAMS mass $&lt;$ 10 $\mathrm{M_\odot}$) in a close binary system. This is a channel to form double neutron star systems, whose merger is detectable with LIGO. SN 2023zaw underscores the existence of a previously undiscovered population of extremely low nickel mass ($&lt; 0.005$ $\mathrm{M_\odot}$) stripped-envelope supernovae, which can be explored with deep and high-cadence transient surveys.</description>

Abstract: A new generation of neutrino observatories will search for PeV-EeV neutrinos interacting in the ice by detecting radio pulses. Extended air showers propagating into the ice will form an important background and could be a valuable calibration signal. We present results from a Monte-Carlo simulation framework developed to fully simulate radio emission from cosmic-ray particle cascades as observed by in-ice radio detectors in the polar regions. The framework involves a modified version of CoREAS (a module of CORSIKA 7) to simulate in-air radio emission and a GEANT4-based framework for simulating in-ice radio emission from cosmic-ray showers as observed by in-ice antennas. The particles that reach the surface of the polar ice sheet at the end of the CORSIKA 7 simulation are injected into the GEANT4-based shower simulation code that takes the particles and propagates them further into the ice sheet, using an exponential density profile for the ice. The framework takes into account curved ray paths caused by the exponential refractive index profiles of air and ice. We present the framework and discuss some key features of the radio signal and radio shower footprint for in-ice observers.</description>

      <title>X-ray Afterglow limits on the viewing angles of short gamma-ray bursts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05297v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The observed behavior of a short gamma-ray burst (sGRB) afterglow lightcurve can reveal the angular structure of the relativistic jet and constrain the observer's viewing angle $\theta_\textrm{obs}$. Regardless of viewing angle, the afterglow emission is produced by the interaction between the relativistic jet and its surrounding environment. However, the observed deceleration time of the jet, and, therefore, the time of the afterglow peak, depends on the observer's viewing angle. A larger viewing angle leads to a later peak of the afterglow and a lower flux at peak. We use the the earliest X-ray afterglow detections of 58 cosmological sGRBs detected with the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory X-ray Telescope to set an upper limit on the ratio of the viewing angle $\theta_\textrm{obs}$ to the jet's half-opening angle $\theta_\textrm{c}$. We adopt a power-law angular jet structure in both energy $E(\theta)\propto\theta^{-a}$ and Lorentz factor $\Gamma(\theta)\propto\theta^{-b}$ beyond the core. For this structured jet scenario we find that either sGRBs are viewed within $\theta_\textrm{obs}/\theta_\textrm{c}&lt;1$ or the initial Lorentz factor of material in their jet's core is extremely high ($\Gamma_0&gt;500$). If we consider a tophat jet structure, we constrain 90% of our sample to be viewed within $\theta_\textrm{obs}/\theta_\textrm{c}&lt;1.06$ and 1.15 for our canonical and conservative afterglow scenarios. For a subset of events with measurements of the jet break, under the assumption that they on-axis we can constrain $\Gamma_0\theta_\textrm{c}\gtrsim 30$. This confirmation that cosmological sGRBs are viewed either on-axis or very close to their jet's core has significant implications for the nature of the prompt gamma-ray production mechanism and for the rate of future sGRB detections coincident with gravitational waves (GWs), implying that they are extremely rare.</description>

      <title>Pair-instability evolution and explosions in massive stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16113v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Very massive stars are radiation pressure dominated. Before running out of viable nuclear fuel, they can reach a thermodynamic state where electron-positron pair-production robs them of radiation support, triggering their collapse. Thermonuclear explosion(s) in the core ensue. These have long been predicted to result in either repeated episodic mass loss (pulsational pair instability), which reduces the mass available to eventually form a black hole, or, if sufficient energy is generated, the complete unbinding of all stellar material in one single explosive episode (pair instability supernova), which leaves behind no black hole. Despite theoretical agreement among modelers, the wide variety of predicted signatures and the rarity of very high-mass stellar progenitors have so far resulted in a lack of observational confirmation. Nevertheless, because of the impact of pair instability evolution on black hole masses relevant to gravitational-wave astronomy, as well as the present and upcoming expanded capabilities of time-domain astronomy and high redshift spectroscopy, interest in these explosion remains high. We review the current understanding of pair instability evolution, with particular emphasis on the known uncertainties. We also summarize the existing claimed electromagnetic counterparts and discuss prospects for future direct and indirect searches.</description>

      <title>Detecting the heterodyning of gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.02672v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves modulate the apparent frequencies of other periodic signals. Low-frequency gravitational waves could therefore be detected by observing frequency modulations in signals from higher-frequency sources, e.g., those from binary white dwarfs detected with the LISA gravitational-wave detector. We propose a concrete method to extract these modulations by coherently adding the cross-spectra of a large number of well-resolved quasi-monochromatic signals. We apply this method to the case of LISA, and find this method would enable the detection of background gravitational wave strain amplitudes of, e.g., $A\simeq10^{-10}$ at a frequency $F\simeq10^{-8}\,\rm Hz$, given current projections for the number and properties of Galactic binary white dwarfs and the sensitivity of the instrument. We also estimate (to within an order of magnitude) that this method could potentially compete with that of current Pulsar Timing Arrays when using signals from binary neutron stars such as those expected to be observed with proposed detectors like DECIGO. Our results show that gravitational-wave detectors could be sensitive at frequencies outside of their designed bandwidth using the same infrastructure, which has the potential to open up unexplored and otherwise inaccessible parts of the gravitational wave spectrum.</description>

      <title>Long-Lived Particles and the Quiet Sun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.01856v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The nuclear reaction network within the interior of the Sun is an efficient MeV physics factory, and can produce long-lived particles generic to dark sector models. In this work we consider the sensitivity of satellite instruments, primarily the RHESSI Spectrometer, that observe the Quiet Sun in the MeV regime where backgrounds are low. We find that Quiet Sun observations offer a powerful and complementary probe in regions of parameter space where the long-lived particle decay length is longer than the radius of the Sun, and shorter than the distance between the Sun and Earth. We comment on connections to recent model-building work on heavy neutral leptons coupled to neutrinos and high-quality axions from mirror symmetries.</description>

      <title>Spin oscillations in neutrino gravitational scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14475v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study neutrino spin oscillations while the particles scatter off a rotating black hole surrounded by a thick magnetized accretion disk. Neutrino spin precession is caused by the interaction of the neutrino magnetic moment with the magnetic field in the disk which has both toroidal and poloidal components. Our calculation of the observed neutrino fluxes, accounting for spin oscillations, are based on numerical simulations of the propagation of a great number of incoming test particles using High Performance Parallel Computing. The obtained results significantly improve our previous findings. We briefly discuss the applications for the observations of astrophysical neutrinos.</description>

      <title>LAMOST J1010+2358 is not a Pair-Instability Supernova Relic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17078v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The discovery of a star formed out of pair-instability supernova ejecta would have massive implications for the Population III star initial mass function and the existence of stars over 100 Msun, but none have yet been found. Recently, the star LAMOST J1010+2358 was claimed to be a star that formed out of gas enriched by a pair-instability supernova. We present a non-LTE abundance analysis of a new high-resolution Keck/HIRES spectrum of J1010+2358. We determined the carbon and aluminum abundances needed to definitively distinguish between enrichment by a pair-instability and core-collapse supernova. Our new analysis demonstrates that J1010+2358 does not have the unique abundance pattern of a a pair-instability supernova, but was instead enriched by the ejecta of a low mass core-collapse supernova. Thus, there are still no known stars displaying unambiguous signatures of pair-instability supernovae.</description>

      <title>Degeneracy Enhancement of Neutron-Antineutron Oscillation in Neutron Star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08591v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the fermion oscillation in a degenerate environment. The direct consequence is introducing a Pauli blocking factor $1 - f_i$, where $f_i$ is the phase space distribution function, for each intermediate mass eigenstate during propagation. It is then much easier for a state with larger existing fraction or density to oscillate into other states with less degeneracy while the reversed process is not enhanced. This can significantly modify the oscillation behaviors. We apply this degenerate fermion oscillation to a concrete scenario of neutron-antineutron oscillation in neutron star. It turns out antineutrons receive a standing fraction to annihilate with the environmental neutrons. The subsequent neutron star heating can put an extremely stringent bound on the baryon number violating cross mass term between neutron and antineutron.</description>

      <title>A global view on star formation: The GLOSTAR Galactic plane survey. XI. Radio source catalog IV: $2^\circ &lt; \ell &lt; 28^\circ$, $36^\circ &lt; \ell &lt; 60^\circ$ and $|b| &lt; 1^\circ$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12585v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The GLOSTAR survey studies star formation with the VLA and the Effelsberg 100m telescope in the Galactic plane (-2d&lt;l&lt;60d; |b|&lt;1d) and the Cygnus X region with unprecedented sensitivity in both flux density (~50uJy/beam) and the capability of detecting emission with angular scales in the range from 1" to the largest radio structures in the Galaxy.
  We provide a complete GLOSTAR-VLA D-configuration radio source catalog for the covered part of the Galactic disk. A catalog for the pilot region (28d&lt;l&lt;36d) has been published in a previous paper and here we present the complementary catalog for the area within 2d&lt;l&lt;28d, 36d&lt;l&lt;60d and |b|&lt;1d.
  Observations were taken with the VLA in a 4-8GHz band to image 100 degrees$^2$ of the inner Galactic disk at a reference frequency of 5.8GHz, using 260h of telescope time. We determined spectral indices inside the observed band and in the frequency range 1.4-5.8GHz by complementing our results with those from the THOR survey (1-2GHz).
  The final images have an angular resolution of 18" and an average sensitivity of 123uJy/beam. The sensitivity is better (~60uJy/beam) in areas free of extended emission. The Galactic disk catalog presented in this work, consists of 11211 radio sources. Of these, 1965 are known large-scale structure sources such as star-forming region complexes, well-known SNRs, SNR candidates or parts thereof. The remaining 9227 are discrete individual sources. Source parameters, namely flux densities, sizes, spectral indices, and classifications are reported. We identify 769 HII region candidates, 359 are newly classified as such. The mean value of spectral indices of 225 HII regions is 0.14$\pm$0.02, consistent with most of them emitting optically thin thermal radio emission. Combining our results with the previously published catalog of the pilot region, the final GLOSTAR-VLA D-configuration catalog contains 12981 radio sources.</description>
