      <title>Recurrence relations and applications for the Maclaurin coefficients of squared and cubic hypergeometric functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present and prove that the coefficients $u_n$ and $v_n$ in the series expansions $F^2(a,b;c;z) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty u_n z^n$ and $F^3(a,b;c;z) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty v_n z^n$ ($a,b,c,z \in \mathbb{C}$ and $-c \notin \mathbb{N} \cup \{0\}$) satisfy second- and third-order linear recurrence relations, respectively, where $F(a,b;c;x)$ denotes the Gaussian hypergeometric function and $\mathbb{C}$ is the complex plane. Our results provide recurrence relations for the Maclaurin coefficients of the squares and cubes of several classical special functions in the complex domain, including zero-balanced Gauss hypergeometric functions, elliptic integrals, as well as classical orthogonal polynomials such as Chebyshev, Legendre, Gegenbauer, and Jacobi polynomials. As applications, we first establish the monotonicity of a function involving Gauss hypergeometric functions and then present a new proof of the well-known Clausen's formula.</description>

      <title>On unions of geodesics and projections of invariant sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a $d$-dimensional complete Riemannian manifold and let $\pi: SM \to M$ denote the canonical projection from the unit tangent bundle. We prove that if $E \subset SM$ is a set that invariant under the geodesic flow with Hausdorff dimension $\dim_{\mathcal{H}} E \ge 2(k-1)+1 +\beta$ for some integer $1 \le k \le d-1$ and some $\beta \in [0,1]$, then the projection $\pi(E)$ satisfies $\dim_{\mathcal{H}} \pi(E) \ge k + \beta$. In other words, this yields a lower bound on the Hausdorff dimension of unions of geodesics in $M$. Our theorem extends a result of J. Zahl concerning unions of lines in $\mathbb{R}^d$. The proof relies on the transversal property of geodesics, an appropriate $(k+1)$-linear curved Kakeya estimate, and the Bourgain-Guth argument.</description>

      <title>Boundedness of bilinear radial Fourier multipliers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that a bilinear radial Fourier multiplier operator with symbol $\sigma$ is $L^2(\R^n)\times L^2(\R^n) \to L^1(\R^n)$ bounded, $n\in \mathbb N,$ if the function $\sigma$ satisfies the smoothness condition $\sigma(2^j\cdot)\Phi\in L^2_{1/2 +\epsilon}(\mathbb R^{2n})$ for some $\epsilon&gt;0$ and every $j\in \mathbb Z,$ where $\Phi$ is a smooth cutoff function adapted to the annulus $|x|\in [1/4,4]$. This condition is dimension free. We also apply similar reasoning to provide alternative proof of the initial result concerning multilinear Bochner-Riesz operator and prove an estimate for generalized bilinear Bochner-Riesz operator.</description>

      <title>On the small denominator problem for generalized Minkowski--Funk transforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rubin's generalized Minkowski--Funk transforms $M_t^\alpha$ on the sphere $\mathbb{S}^n$ give rise, for irrational radii $t=\cos(\beta\pi)$, to a small denominator problem governed by the asymptotic behavior of their spectral multipliers. We show that for Lebesgue-almost every $\beta$ the corresponding two-sine small divisor inequality has infinitely many solutions, and deduce that $(M_t^\alpha)^{-1}$ is not bounded from $\tilde{H}^{s+\rho+1}(\mathbb{S}^n)$ to $H^s(\mathbb{S}^n)$ in the non-critical case $\rho\neq 0,1$. In the critical cases $\rho\in\{0,1\}$ we prove Rubin's Conjectures 4.4 and 4.7 on the failure of endpoint Sobolev regularity for the inverse transforms.</description>

      <title>On $L^2$ estimates for quadratic images of product Frostman measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $f\in\mathbb R[x,y,z]$ be a fixed non-degenerate quadratic polynomial. Given an $\alpha$-Frostman probability measure $\mu$ supported on $[0,1]$ with $\alpha\in(0,1)$, consider the pushforward measure $\nu=f_{\#}(\mu\times\mu\times\mu)$ on $\mathbb R$. We prove the following $L^2$ energy estimate: for a fixed nonnegative Schwartz function $\varphi$ with $\int\varphi=1$ and $\varphi_\delta(t)=\delta^{-1}\varphi(t/\delta)$, there exist $\epsilon&gt;0$ and $\delta_{0}&gt;0$ (depending only on $\alpha$ and the coefficients of $f$) such that \[ \int_{\mathbb R}(\varphi_\delta*\nu(t))^{2}\,dt \ \lesssim\ \delta^{\alpha+\epsilon-1} \qquad \text{for all } \delta\in(0,\delta_{0}]. \] The proof expands the $L^2$ energy into a weighted six-fold coincidence integral and reduces the main contribution to a planar incidence problem after a controlled change of variables. The key new input is an incidence estimate for point sets that arise as bi-Lipschitz images of a Cartesian product $M\times M$ of a $\delta$-separated and non-concentrated set $M$, yielding a power saving beyond what is available from separation and non-concentration alone. We also give examples showing that bounded support and Frostman-type hypotheses are necessary for such $L^{2}$ control.</description>

      <title>A Sharp Localized Weighted Inequality Related to Gagliardo and Sobolev Seminorms and Its Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we establish a nearly sharp localized weighted inequality related to Gagliardo and Sobolev seminorms, respectively, with the sharp $A_1$-weight constant or with the specific $A_p$-weight constant when $p\in (1,\infty)$. As applications, we further obtain a new characterization of Muckenhoupt weights and, in the framework of ball Banach function spaces, an inequality related to Gagliardo and Sobolev seminorms on cubes, a Gagliardo--Nirenberg interpolation inequality, and a Bourgain--Brezis--Mironescu formula. All these obtained results have wide generality and are proved to be (nearly) sharp.
  The original version of this article was published in [Adv. Math. 481 (2025), Paper No. 110537]. In this revised version, we correct an error appeared in Theorem 1.1 in the case where $p=1$, which was pointed out to us by Emiel Lorist.</description>

      <title>The Fourier extension conjecture for the paraboloid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24990v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a proof of Fourier extension conjecture on the paraboloid in all dimensions bigger than 2 that begins with a decomposition suggested in Sawyer [Saw8] of writing a smooth Alpert projection as a sum of pieces whose Fourier extensions are localized. This is then used in the case d=3 to establish the trilinear equivalence of the Fourier extension conjecture given in C. Rios and E. Sawyer [RiSa1] and [RiSa3]. A key aspect of the proof is that the trilinear equivalence only requires an averaging over grids, which converts a difficult exponential sum into an oscillatory integral with periodic amplitude, that is then used to prove the localization on the Fourier side. Finally, we extend this argument to all dimensions bigger than 2 using bilinear analogues of the smooth Alpert trilinear inequalities, which generalize those in Tao, Vargas and Vega [TaVaVe].</description>

      <title>Coloring and density theorems for configurations of a given volume</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.09973v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is a treatise on finite point configurations spanning a fixed volume to be found in a single color-class of an arbitrary finite (measurable) coloring of the Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^n$, or in a single large measurable subset $A\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n$. More specifically, we study vertex-sets of simplices, rectangular boxes, and parallelotopes, attempting to make progress on several open problems posed in the 1970s and the 1980s. As one of the highlights, we give a negative answer to a question of Erd\H{o}s and Graham, by coloring the Euclidean plane $\mathbb{R}^2$ in $25$ colors without creating monochromatic rectangles of unit area. More generally, we construct a finite coloring of the Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^n$ such that no color-class contains the $2^m$ vertices of any (possibly rotated) $m$-dimensional rectangular box of volume $1$. A positive result is still possible if rectangular boxes of merely sufficiently large volumes are sought in a single color-class of a finite measurable coloring of $\mathbb{R}^n$, and we establish it under an additional assumption $n\geq m+1$. Also, motivated by a question of Graham on reasonable bounds in his result on monochromatic axes-aligned right-angled $m$-dimensional simplices, we establish its measurable coloring and density variants with polylogarithmic bounds, again in dimensions $n\geq m+1$. Next, we generalize a result of Erd\H{o}s and Mauldin, by constructing an infinite measure set $A\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n$ such that every $n$-parallelotope with vertices in $A$ has volume strictly smaller than $1$. Finally, some results complementing the literature on isometric embeddings of hypercube graphs and on the hyperbolic analogue of the Hadwiger-Nelson problem also follow as byproducts of our approaches.</description>

      <title>Model agnostic signal encoding by leaky integrate and fire, performance and uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12994v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Integrate-and-fire is a resource efficient time-encoding mechanism that summarizes into a signed spike train those time intervals where a signal's charge exceeds a certain threshold. We analyze the IF encoder in terms of a very general notion of approximate bandwidth, which is shared by most commonly-used signal models. This complements results on exact encoding that may be overly adapted to a particular signal model. We take into account, possibly for the first time, the effect of uncertainty in the exact location of the spikes (as may arise by decimation), uncertainty of integration leakage (as may arise in realistic manufacturing), and boundary effects inherent to finite periods of exposure to the measurement device. The analysis is done by means of a concrete bandwidth-based Ansatz that can also be useful to initialize more sophisticated model specific reconstruction algorithms, and uses the earth mover's (Wasserstein) distance to measure spike discrepancy.</description>
