      <title>New CDM Crisis Revealed by Multi-Scale Cluster Lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The properties of substructure in galaxy clusters, exquisitely probed by gravitational lensing, offer a stringent test of dark matter models. Combining strong and weak lensing data for massive clusters, we map their total mass--dominated by dark matter--over the dynamic range needed to confront small-scale predictions for collisionless cold dark matter (CDM). Using state-of-the-art lens models, we extract four key subhalo properties: the mass function, projected radial distribution, internal density profile, and tidal truncation radius. We find that the subhalo mass function and truncation radii are consistent with CDM expectations. In contrast, the inner density profiles and radial distribution of subhalos are strongly discrepant with CDM. The incidence of galaxy-galaxy strong lensing (GGSL) from subhalo cores exceeds CDM predictions by nearly an order of magnitude, requiring inner density slopes as steep as $\gamma \gtrsim 2.5$ within $r \lesssim 0.01\,R_{200}$ consistent with core-collapsed self-interacting dark matter (SIDM), while the same subhalos behave as collisionless in their outskirts. Additionally, the observed radial distribution of subhalos hosting bright cluster member galaxies, explicitly modeled in the lens reconstructions, remains incompatible with CDM. Together, these small-scale stress tests reveal an intriguing paradox and challenge the dark matter microphysics of purely collisionless CDM and motivate hybrid scenarios, such as a dual-component model with both CDM and SIDM, or entirely new classes of dark matter theories.</description>

      <title>Sahyadri: A simulation suite for the cosmology dependence of the Cosmic Web</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Sahyadri, a suite of cosmological $N$-body simulations designed to enable precision studies of the low-redshift Universe with next-generation spectroscopic surveys. Sahyadri includes systematic variations of six cosmological parameters around Planck 2018 constraints, with seed-matched initial conditions enabling cosmological parameter derivatives. Each simulation evolves $2048^3$ particles in a periodic box of side length $200$ $h^{-1}$ Mpc, yielding a particle mass of $m_{\rm{p}} = 8.1 \times 10^{7}\,h^{-1}\,M_{\odot}$ in the fiducial Planck 2018 cosmology. This resolution enables robust identification of dark matter halos down to $M_{\rm min} = 3.2 \times 10^{9}$ $h^{-1}$ $M_\odot$, which represents a factor of $\sim$25 improvement over the AbacusSummit suite, and is over two orders of magnitude better than the Quijote and Aemulus suites. We estimate that approximately 40% of DESI BGS galaxies at redshift $z &lt; 0.15$ - roughly 1.6 million objects - reside in halos accessible to Sahyadri but beyond the reach of existing parameter-varying simulation suites. We demonstrate Sahyadri's capabilities through measurements of the matter power spectrum, halo mass function and power spectrum, and beyond 2-point statistics such as the Voronoi volume function and $k^{\rm th}$ nearest neighbour statistics, showing excellent agreement with theoretical predictions and significant sensitivity to $\Omega_{\rm m}$ variations. We implement a custom compression scheme reducing storage requirements by a factor of $\sim$3 while maintaining sub-percent clustering accuracy. Key data products will be made publicly available.</description>

      <title>Baryon Acoustic Oscillations from the C IV Forest with DESI DR2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a measurement of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) in the cross-correlation of triply ionized carbon C IV absorption with the positions of quasars (QSO) and Emission Line Galaxies (ELG). We use quasars and ELGs from the second data release (DR2) of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey. Our data sample consists of 2.5 million quasars, 3.1 million ELGs, and the C IV absorption is measured along the line of sight of 1.5 million high redshift quasars with $z &gt; 1.3$. We measure the isotropic BAO signal at 4.2$\sigma$ for the CIV$\times$QSO cross-correlation. This translates into a 3.0% precision measurement of the ratio of the isotropic distance scale, $D_{\rm V}$, and the sound horizon at the drag epoch, $r_{\rm d}$, with $D_{\rm V}/r_{\rm d}(z_{\rm eff} = 1.92) = 30.3 \pm 0.9$. We make the first detection of the BAO feature in the CIV$\times$ELG cross-correlation at a significance of 2.5$\sigma$ and find $D_{\rm V}/r_{\rm d}(z_{\rm eff} = 1.47) = 24.6 \pm 1.0$.</description>

      <title>A new magnitude--redshift relation based on SNe Ia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new empirical relation between the standardized magnitude ($m$) of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) and redshift ($z$). Using Pantheon+ and DES-SN5YR, we find a negative linear correlation between $m-5\log(z(1+z))$ and $z$, implying that their magnitude--redshift relation can be parametrized with just two parameters: an intercept $\mathcal{M}$ and a slope $b$. This relation corresponds to the luminosity distance $d_L(z)=c\,H_0^{-1}z(1+z)10^{bz/5}$ and is valid up to at least $z\simeq1.1$. It outperforms the $\Lambda$CDM and flat $w$CDM models and the (2,1) Pad\'e approximant for $d_L(z)$, and performs comparably to the flat $\Lambda$CDM model and the (2,1) Pad\'e($j_0=1$) model of Hu et al. Furthermore, the relation is stable in the absence of low-$z$ SNe, making it suitable for fitting Hubble diagrams of SNe Ia without the need to add a low-$z$ sample. In deep fields in particular, assuming that the large-scale density is independent of the comoving radial coordinate, $b\propto q_0+1$. We fit the empirical relation to SN data in eight deep-field regions and find that their fitted $\mathcal{M}$ and $b$ parameters are consistent within $1.6\,\sigma$, in agreement with isotropy. The inferred $q_0$ values, ranging from $-0.6$ to $-0.4$, are consistent within $1.5\,\sigma$ and significantly lower than zero, indicating statistically consistent cosmic acceleration across all eight regions. We apply the empirical relation to the DES-Dovekie and Amalgame SN samples, finding $b$ values consistent with those from DES-SN5YR and Pantheon+. Finally, using the empirical relation in the hemispheric comparison method applied to Pantheon+ up to $z=1.1$, we find no evidence for anisotropies in $\mathcal{M}$ and $b$.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Great Attractor: The Local Group's streamline trajectory, cosmic velocity and dynamical fate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the Great Attractor using the Manticore-Local suite of digital twins of the nearby Universe. The Great Attractor concept has been proposed as an answer to three distinct questions: what sources the Local Group velocity in the cosmic microwave background frame, where present-day velocity streamlines converge, and where the Local Group is moving to. Addressing the original motivation of the Great Attractor -- explaining the Local Group cosmic velocity -- we find that mass within $155~h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$ accounts for only ${\sim}72\%$ of that velocity magnitude with ${\sim}38\,\deg$ directional offset. We show that even in the purely linear regime convergence within this volume is not guaranteed, particularly when also accounting for small-scale contributions to the observer velocity; no single structure, including the proposed Great Attractor, would be expected to dominate the velocity budget. Streamline convergence is smoothing-scale-dependent, transitioning from Virgo at small scales through the Hydra--Centaurus region at intermediate scales to Shapley at large scales; at intermediate smoothing the convergence point lies near Abell 3565 with an asymmetric basin of mass $\log( M / (h^{-1} \mathrm{M}_\odot)) = 16.4 \pm 0.1$ that excludes Norma. To address the third question, we evolve the Manticore-Local realisations to scale factor $a = 10$ in a new Beyond-Present-Time simulation suite and identify the asymptotic future location of the Local Group. We find that the dominant motion is towards Virgo, but even it contributes at most one third of the Local Group velocity. Our results demonstrate that the classical Great Attractor is not a dynamically dominant structure but an artifact of the instantaneous velocity field, and that no single attractor is likely to account for the Local Group motion in the cosmic rest frame.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing Gamma Ray Burst Energy Relations with Observational H(z) data in Neural Network Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gamma ray bursts (GRBs) offer a powerful probe of the cosmic expansion history far beyond the redshift range accessible to Type Ia supernovae. However, the calibration of GRB luminosity correlations is hindered by the circularity problem, which arises from assuming a fiducial cosmological model during calibration. In this work, we perform a model independent calibration of GRB luminosity relations using observational Hubble parameter H(z) data from the A220 and J220 compilations, thereby avoiding explicit cosmological assumptions. We employ Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to reconstruct the calibration relation directly from the data. In addition, we implement a Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) framework as an alternative approach, enabling a data driven treatment of both statistical and systematic uncertainties. The calibrated GRB sample is used to constrain the Amati relation, and we systematically compare the outcomes obtained from different calibration techniques and datasets. While the Amati Parameters obtained from GRBs caibrated from the ANN and BNN results are consistent with previous low redshifts calibrations using model-independent methods, the BNN approach provides a more robust framework.</description>

      <title>Primordial Gravitational Waves from Scalar Backreaction in Axion-SU(2) Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we perform the first numerical study of strong scalar backreaction in spectator chromo-natural inflation (SCNI) in the case where the spectator sector decays during inflation. The tachyonic instability in scalar fluctuations, activated as the system crosses the $m_Q = \sqrt{2}$ threshold, amplifies perturbations and may significantly alter the background dynamics. The strong scalar backreaction regime introduces an effective quartic term in the potential for the gauge field background that rapidly drives it to zero, accelerating the axion-gauge system decay. We describe the dynamics of such decay and derive the gravitational wave spectrum for a set of benchmark parameters. Interestingly, the signal may peak at interferometer scales and lie within LISA's projected sensitivity.</description>

      <title>One-Loop Tensor Power Spectrum from a Non-Minimally Coupled Spectator Field during Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the full one-loop corrections to the primordial tensor power spectrum in an inflationary scenario with a non-minimally coupled spectator field, using the in-in formalism. We derive semi-analytic results for the scalar-sourced one-loop tensor spectrum and the effective tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r_{\mathrm{eff}}$ . We consider two representative coupling functions: a localized Gaussian dip (Model G), which leads to moderate loop corrections, and a rapidly oscillatory coupling (Model O), which can yield much larger loop contributions. For Model G, we find a $\mathcal{O}(1)$ correction to $r_{\mathrm{eff}}$ while Model O can significantly enhance $r_{\mathrm{eff}}$ by several orders of magnitude (relative to the tree-level value). We further calculate the energy density of primordial gravitational waves. Assuming that primordial black holes with mass $10^{-12}M_{\odot}$ generated in this scenario, constitute all of the dark matter, we find that the results are several orders of magnitude lower than the sensitivities of Taiji/TianQin/LISA.</description>

      <title>Evidence of sloshing-driven mini-halo formation in the cool-core cluster RXCJ1558.3-1410</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio mini-halos are perplexing features, typically hosted by X-ray cool-core galaxy clusters. Understanding the connection between thermal X-ray and non-thermal radio emission is key to uncovering their origin. Here, we present a multiwavelength study of the cool-core cluster RXCJ1558.3-1410 using archival Chandra X-ray and wideband uGMRT radio data (Bands 3, 4 and 5). Our improved analysis confirms a previously known X-ray cavity at $\sim$36 kpc south-east of the cluster centre and we report a new cavity at $\sim$42 kpc to the north-west. These cavities suggest that the AGN provides mechanical power of $\sim$$6.0 \times 10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$, sufficient to offset radiative cooling in the ICM. We also detect a sharp surface brightness edge at $\sim$72 kpc south-east of the centre, characterised by a temperature jump and pressure continuity, consistent with a cold front, likely caused by gas sloshing from a minor merger. Our uGMRT images reveals an interesting diffuse emission surrounding the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG), with its edge spatially coinciding with the sloshing cold front and roughly with the cooling radius. Furthermore, a low star formation rate and uniform metal abundance up to the sloshing edge are consistent with the earlier findings of suppression of star formation and metallicity homogenisation by mixing core gas through sloshing. Finally, the spatial correlation between the mini-halo and the observed X-ray features indicates that ICM sloshing, rather than AGN feedback, plays a dominant role in powering the proposed radio mini-halo emission.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We confront the ghost-free non-local $F(R)$ gravity theories with the latest Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) constraints on the spectral index of the scalar perturbations and the updated constraints of Planck/BICEP on the tensor-to-scalar ratio. After reviewing how the ghost-free non-local version of $F(R)$ gravity can be obtained, we show that the de Sitter solution can be obtained in this framework. Also, we show that the resulting theory can be cast in terms of an $F(R,\phi)$ theory of gravity. We analyze two models of non-local $F(R)$ gravity, one power-law and the $R^2$ model, and we show that both models can be compatible with the ACT and updated Planck/BICEP constraints.</description>

      <title>The Scalar Mach-Sciama Theory of Gravitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate a scalar realization of Sciama's Machian programme within the general Bergmann-Wagoner class of scalar--tensor gravity. Starting from a universally conformally coupled matter sector, we rewrite the field equations in terms of the invariant set $\{{\cal I}_1,{\cal I}_2,{\cal I}_3,\hat g_{\mu\nu}\}$, so that Machian requirements can be stated independently of conformal frame. Sciama's causal postulate is implemented not by modifying the local dynamics, but as a selection rule on the solution space of the invariant scalar equation: the admissible configuration is the retarded response to the matter distribution in the causal past, with any source-free contribution removed. In a spatially flat FLRW universe, and in the light, slowly varying regime, the prescription reduces to an explicit temporal kernel that links the background scalar evolution to the matter content within the Hubble region, reproducing the expected Machian scaling in an expanding background. Universal coupling to a single physical metric implies that structureless test bodies share the same acceleration in a given external configuration, so that the E\"otvs parameter vanishes at leading order. Nonuniversal effects can arise only when gravitational binding energy contributes appreciably to the total mass, as in strongly self-gravitating objects. Thus, the theory implements a causal Machian determination of the cosmological inertial scale while remaining consistent with standard weak-field tests.</description>

      <title>Relatively Fast and Reasonably Furious: Evidence for Increased Burstiness in Smaller Halos at Cosmic Dawn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce an effective framework to model star-formation burstiness and use it to jointly fit galaxy UV luminosity functions (UVLFs), clustering, and H$\alpha$/UV ratios, providing the first robust empirical evidence that early galaxies hosted in lower-mass halos are burstier. Using $z\sim 4-6$ observations, we find that galaxies show approximately $0.6$ dex of SFR variability if hosted in halos of $M_h = 10^{11}\, M_\odot$ (typical of $M_{\rm UV}\approx -19$ galaxies at $z = 6$). This translates into a scatter of $\sigma_{M_{\rm UV}}\approx 0.75$ in the UVLF, in line with past findings. Strikingly, we find that burstiness grows for galaxies hosted in smaller halos, reaching $\gtrsim 1$ dex for $M_h \leq 10^{9}\, M_\odot$ (corresponding to $\sigma_{M_{\rm UV}} \approx 1.5$ for faint $M_{\rm UV} \gtrsim -15$ galaxies). Extrapolating to higher redshifts, when small halos were more prevalent, the inferred mass-dependent burstiness can reproduce observed UVLFs up to $z\sim 17$ within 1$\sigma$, potentially alleviating the tension between pre- and post-JWST galaxy-formation models. Current observations allow us to constrain burst timescales to approximately $20$ Myr, consistent with expectations from supernova feedback, and suggest broad distributions of ionizing efficiencies at fixed $M_{\rm UV}$. Our results demonstrate that mass-dependent burstiness, as predicted by hydrodynamical simulations, is critical for understanding the mass assembly of early galaxies.</description>

      <title>Charting the Flavour Structure of Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: What flavour structure of $t$-channel thermal dark matter remains compatible with current flavour physics and direct detection bounds? We broadly chart the space of hypotheses using the framework of flavour symmetries and their breaking patterns. We then focus on scenarios in which the fermionic dark matter and its scalar mediator are flavour singlets, falling into the class of rank-1 flavour violation. For two representative benchmarks, quarkphilic ($q_L$) and leptophilic ($e_R$), we perform a comprehensive phenomenological analysis, fitting the relic abundance and examining the interplay among flavour observables, direct detection, and collider searches. Our results quantify the allowed deviations from flavour-symmetric limits and assess the discovery prospects in future flavour and direct detection experiments.</description>

      <title>Local Group analogues in a cosmological context -- I. Relating velocity structure to the cosmic web</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our Local Group, dominated in mass by the Milky Way (MW) and M31, provides a unique laboratory for testing $\Lambda$CDM cosmology on small scales owing to its proximity. However, its connection to the surrounding large-scale environment, which is essential for interpreting its properties, is inadequately understood. In this work, we explore the connection between Local Group analogues (LGAs) and their surrounding large-scale environments using the ABACUSSUMMIT simulation suite, highlighting the key role of the coupling energy of the MW-M31 orbit, $E_{\rm coupling}$. We find that LGAs with high $E_{\rm coupling}$ preferentially reside in denser regions, whereas those with low $E_{\rm coupling}$ tend to occupy low-density environments. Furthermore, LGAs with low $E_{\rm coupling}$ exhibit strong alignment with cosmic filaments, manifested as a pronounced polar anisotropy in the distribution of tracer haloes. By contrast, LGAs with high $E_{\rm coupling}$ show a weaker polar anisotropy but an enhanced azimuthal anisotropy, with large-scale tracer haloes preferentially lying in the plane spanned by the halo pair and the orbital spin vector. Within this framework, our Local Group is characterised by typical $E_{\rm coupling}$ residing in a relatively under-dense environment, yet it remains consistent with the 95\% range of analogue systems identified in the simulation.</description>

      <title>MUSE-ALMA Haloes XIII. Molecular gas in $z \sim 0.5$ HI-selected galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present new results from the MUSE-ALMA Haloes survey, covering 79 galaxies associated with strong HI absorption at redshift about 0.5. Our ALMA Cycle 10 observations add 39 systems to the initial 21, bringing the total to 60 galaxies. CO emission is detected in 9 new galaxies, and in 12 of 60 total, doubling the number of CO-emitting HI-selected galaxies and probing 1.2 dex deeper in molecular gas mass than previous studies. These galaxies span a wide range of stellar masses and metallicities. By comparing CO(2-1) and CO(3-2) properties with star formation rates and gas-phase metallicities from VLT/MUSE and HST, we find a dual behaviour in star formation efficiency: low-mass systems follow main-sequence scaling relations, while high-mass systems show suppressed star formation. This diversity indicates that HI absorbers trace both evolved and younger galaxies, providing a key step toward completing the baryon census at redshift about 0.5.</description>

      <title>Revisiting The Cosmological Time Dilation of Distant Quasars: Influence of Source Properties and Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04171v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: After decades of searching, cosmological time dilation was recently identified in the timescale of variability seen in distant quasars. Here, we expand on the previous analysis to disentangle this cosmological signal from the influence of the properties of the source population, specifically the quasar bolometric luminosity and the rest-frame emission wavelength at which the variability was observed. Furthermore, we consider the potential influence of the evolution of the quasar population over cosmic time. We find that a significant intrinsic scatter of 0.288 +- 0.021 dex in the variability timescales, which was not considered in the previous analysis, is favoured by the data. This slightly increases the uncertainty in the results. However, the expected cosmological dependence of the variability timescales is confirmed to be robust to changes in the underlying assumptions. We find that the variability timescales increase smoothly with both wavelength and bolometric luminosity, and that black hole mass has no effect on the variability timescale once rest wavelength and bolometric luminosity are accounted for. Moreover, if the standard cosmological model is correct, governed by relativistic expansion, we also find very little cosmological evolution in the intrinsic variability timescales of distant quasars.</description>

      <title>Power Suppression and Lensing Anomaly -- A phenomenological investigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21386v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Primordial power spectra with low power at long wavelengths can alleviate lensing anomaly. However the extent to which data favours such a primordial spectra is not clear. In this work, we investigate power suppression and related mitigation of lensing anomaly with the help of phenomenological models which are valid over scales of interest. We consider simple extensions to nearly scale invariant power spectra such as those which includes running and running of running of spectral index. We perform Bayesian analysis of these models, which are agnostic about power suppression, with Planck legacy data and show that data tend to choose parameters which leads to power suppression at low multipoles. We then investigate the connection between power suppression and alleviation of lensing anomaly and show that lensing anomaly is mitigated the most in models with maximum suppression of power at low multipoles. We also analyse the significance of these findings using information criteria. These results are further analyzed in the light of Planck Release 4 data using CamSpec, HiLLiPoP and LoLLiPoP likelihoods in which departure of lensing parameter from one is significantly reduced. Furthermore, we investigate the ability of near-ultimate future CMB missions such as ECHO to put tighter constraints on these models and to settle the issue. We conclude that we can make stronger conclusions about the presence of power suppression in the future by studying such simple phenomenological models.</description>

      <title>Constraints from CMB lensing tomography with projected bispectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07968v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We measure the angular power spectrum and bispectrum of the projected overdensity of photometric DESI luminous red galaxies, and its cross-correlation with maps of the Cosmic Microwave Background lensing convergence from \planck. This analysis is enabled by the use of the ``filtered-squared bispectrum'' approach, introduced in previous work, which we generalise here to the case of cross-correlations between multiple fields. The projected galaxy bispectrum is detected at very high significance (above $30\sigma$ in all redshift bins), and the galaxy-galaxy-convergence bispectrum is detected above $5\sigma$ in the three highest-redshift bins. We find that the bispectrum is reasonably well described over a broad range of scales by a tree-level prediction using the linear galaxy bias measured from the power spectrum. We carry out the first cosmological analysis combining projected power spectra and bispectra under a relatively simple model, and show that the galaxy bispectrum can be used in combination with the power spectrum to place a constraint on the amplitude of matter fluctuations, $\sigma_8$, an on the non-relativistic matter fraction $\Omega_m$. We find that data combinations involving the galaxy bispectrum recover constraints on these parameters that are in good agreement with those found from the traditional ``2$\times$2-point'' combination of galaxy-galaxy and galaxy-convergence power spectra, across all redshift bins.</description>

      <title>1.8 per cent measurement of $H_0$ from Cepheids alone</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09665v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the most pressing problems in current cosmology is the cause of the Hubble tension. We revisit a two-rung distance ladder, composed only of Cepheid periods and magnitudes, anchor distances in the Milky Way, Large Magellanic Cloud, NGC 4258, and host galaxy redshifts. We adopt the SH0ES data for the most up-to-date and carefully vetted measurements, where the Cepheid hosts were selected to harbour also Type Ia supernovae. We introduce two important improvements: a rigorous selection modelling and a state-of-the-art density and peculiar velocity model using Manticore-Local, based on the Bayesian Origin Reconstruction from Galaxies (BORG) algorithm. We infer $H_0 = 71.7 \pm 1.3\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, assuming the Cepheid host sample was selected by supernova magnitudes. However, the actual selection criteria are not clear, and other assumptions can increase $H_0$ by up to one statistical standard deviation. The posterior has a lower central value and a 45 per cent smaller uncertainty than a previous study using the same distance-ladder data. The result is also slightly lower than the supernova-based SH0ES inferred value of $H_0 = 73.2 \pm 0.9\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, and is in $3.3\sigma$ tension with the latest cosmic microwave background results in the standard cosmological model. These results demonstrate that a measurement of $H_0$ of sufficient precision to weigh in on the Hubble tension is achievable using second-rung data alone, underscoring the importance of robust and accurate statistical and velocity-field modelling.</description>

      <title>Bias in the tensor-to-scalar ratio from self-interacting dark radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10607v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the cosmological imprint of self-interacting dark radiation (DR) on the primordial $B$-mode angular power spectrum and its impact on the estimation of the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. We consider a minimal model in which DR is described as an effectively massless axion-like particle with quartic self-interactions. These interactions are incorporated into the Einstein-Boltzmann equations using the relaxation time approximation and implemented in the $\texttt{CLASS}$ code. We show that increasing the strength of DR self-interactions suppresses anisotropic stress, thereby reducing the damping of gravitational waves and leading to an enhancement of the primordial $B$-mode signal relative to the free-streaming case. Using mock CMB data and Markov Chain Monte Carlo analyses, we show that neglecting DR self-interactions may bias the inferred value of $r$ by an amount comparable to the uncertainty expected in forthcoming CMB polarization experiments, such as the ground-based $\textit{Simons Observatory}$ and the satellite missions $\textit{LiteBIRD}$ and PICO. Our results emphasize the importance of properly modeling DR interactions in future precision searches for primordial $B$-modes in order to obtain unbiased constraints on inflationary gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Searching for Dark Structures: A Comparison of Weak-lensing Convergence Maps and Lensing-weighted Galaxy Density Maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25836v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the result of a comparison between the dark matter distribution inferred from weak gravitational lensing and the observed galaxy distribution to identify dark structures with a high dark matter-to-galaxy density ratio. To do this, we use weak-lensing convergence maps from the Dark Energy Survey Year 3 data, and construct corresponding galaxy convergence maps at $z\lesssim1.0$ , representing projected galaxy number density fluctuations weighted by lensing efficiency. The two maps show overall agreement. However, we could identify 22 regions where the dark matter density exhibits an excess compared to the galaxy density. After carefully examining the survey depths and proximity to survey boundaries, we select the seven most probable candidates for dark structures. This sample provides valuable test beds for further investigations into dark matter mapping. Moreover, our method will be very useful for future studies of dark structures as large-scale weak-lensing surveys become available, such as the Euclid mission, the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time, and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope.</description>

      <title>Luminosity-Dependent Assembly Bias of Central Galaxies from Weak Lensing and Clustering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.21377v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Assembly bias, which is the variation in halo clustering at fixed mass driven by formation history, has long been predicted by numerical simulations but remains difficult to confirm observationally. Previous studies have reported evidence for halo assembly bias by dividing samples according to galaxy stellar mass using various methods. In this work, we present observational measurements of halo assembly bias based on the luminosity of spectroscopically confirmed brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs). Using cluster catalogs and shear measurements from the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys, we employ a mass-dependent halo-bias model to disentangle halo bias from its underlying mass dependence in galaxy-galaxy lensing and clustering measurements. We confirm that brighter BCGs are less strongly clustered on large scales, with a relative bias ratio deviating from unity at the $\sim3\sigma$ level, suggesting the presence of assembly bias. Similar qualitative trends are also found in the FLAMINGO and MillenniumTNG hydrodynamical simulations, strengthening the connection between galaxy luminosity and halo formation history.</description>

      <title>The AIDA-TNG project: dark matter profiles and concentrations in alternative dark matter models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15869v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the standard Cold Dark Matter (CDM) scenario, the density profiles of dark matter haloes are well described by analytical models linking their concentration to halo mass. Alternative scenarios, such as warm dark matter (WDM) and self-interacting dark matter (SIDM), modify the inner structure of haloes and predict different profile shapes and central slopes. We employ the AIDA-TNG simulations to investigate how alternative dark matter physics and baryonic processes jointly shape the internal structure of haloes. Using dark-matter-only and full-physics runs, we measure the dark matter density profiles of haloes spanning six orders of magnitude in mass, from 10^9.5 Msun to 10^14.5 Msub, and characterise them with multiple analytical models. We provide the distribution of the best-fitting parameters, as well as the concentration-mass relation in WDM and SIDM. The Einasto profile well reproduces the inner flattening produced in WDM models, both in the collisionless and in the full-physics runs. In SIDM dark-matter-only runs, haloes are better described by explicitly cored profiles, with core sizes that depend on mass and on the self-interaction model. When baryons are included, the differences between CDM and SIDM decrease, and such large dark-matter cores no longer form because adiabatic contraction in the baryon-dominated region counteracts self-interactions. Nevertheless, the coupling between baryons and self-interactions induces a broader range of inner slopes, including cases that are steeper than CDM at Milky Way masses. Alternative dark matter physics thus leaves clear signatures in the inner halo structure, even if baryons significantly reshape these differences. Our results are useful for future studies that need to predict the properties of haloes in multiple dark matter models.</description>

      <title>A New Consistency Test for the $\Lambda$CDM Model using Radial and Transverse BAO Measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07075v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a calibration-free consistency test of spatially flat $\Lambda$CDM based on baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) distance measurements. The method forms ratios of BAO distances including the Hubble distance, the comoving angular diameter distance, and the volume-averaged distance, so that the sound horizon scale cancels, and then maps each observed ratio to an effective flat-$\Lambda$CDM matter density parameter, ${\Omega}_{\rm M}^{\Lambda}$, defined as the value of $\Omega_{\rm M}$ that reproduces the measured ratio within $\Lambda$CDM. Flat $\Lambda$CDM predicts that ${\Omega}_{\rm M}^{\Lambda}$ should be independent of redshift and of the particular ratio used. For ratios involving the integrated distances, we associate them with well-defined effective line-of-sight redshift intervals based on the integral mean value theorem. We apply the test to BAO measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release~1 and Data Release~2, propagating the full published BAO covariance matrices into all derived ratios and ${\Omega}_{\rm M}^{\Lambda}$ constraints. Within current uncertainties, the inferred ${\Omega}_{\rm M}^{\Lambda}$ values are broadly consistent with a redshift-independent constant, providing an internal consistency check of flat $\Lambda$CDM that can be strengthened straightforwardly as BAO measurements improve.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03984v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The pulsar timings are sensitive to both the nanohertz gravitational-wave background and the oscillation of ultralight dark matter. The Hellings-Downs angular correlation curve provides a criterion to search for stochastic gravitational-wave backgrounds at nanohertz via pulsar timing arrays. We study the angular correlation of the timing residuals induced by the spin-2 ultralight dark matter, which is different from the usual Hellings-Downs correlation. At a typical frequency, we show that the spin-2 ultralight dark matter can give rise to the deformation of the Hellings-Downs correlation curve induced by the stochastic gravitational wave background.</description>

Abstract: In this work we constrain the value of $\sigma_8$ for the normal and self-accelerating branch of a DGP brane embedded in a five-dimensional Minkowski space-time. For that purpose we first constrain the model parameters $H_0$, $\Omega_{m0}$, $\Omega_{r0}$ and $M$ by means of the Pantheon+ catalog and a mock catalog of gravitational waves. Then, we solve numerically the equation for dark matter scalar perturbations using the dynamical scaling solution for the master equation and assuming that $p=4$ for the matter dominated era. Finally, we found that the evolution of matter density perturbations in both branches is different from the $\Lambda$CDM model and that the value of $\sigma_8=0.774\pm0.027$ for the normal branch and $\sigma_8=0.913\pm0.032$ for the self-accelerating branch.</description>

      <title>Extreme mass ratio inspirals in dark matter halos: dynamics and distinguishability of halo models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16649</link>

Abstract: The gravitational wave (GW) signals from extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs), a key target for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), will be affected in the presence of dark matter (DM) halos. In this paper we explore whether the effects of DM are detectable by LISA within a fully relativistic framework. We model the massive EMRI component as a nonrotating black hole (BH) surrounded by a DM halo. We compute axial and polar GW fluxes for circular orbits at linear order in the mass ratio for DM density profiles with varying mass and compactness. By comparing the phase evolution with vacuum systems, we find that DM halos can induce dephasings of tens to hundreds of radians over a one-year observation period. We demonstrate that even highly diluted DM distributions can significantly affect the emitted waveforms, and that the resulting GW signals can usually be distinguished from each other. While it is important to generalize these findings to more generic orbits and to spinning BHs, our results suggest that LISA could not only reveal the presence of DM halos, but also discriminate between different halo models.</description>

      <title>Abundant Population of Broad H$\alpha$ Emitters in the GOODS-N Field Revealed by CONGRESS, FRESCO, and JADES</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02895v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a spectroscopic search for broad H$\alpha$ emitters at z$\approx$3.7-6.5 in the GOODS-N field, utilizing JWST/NIRCam slitless spectroscopy from FRESCO and CONGRESS, complemented by JADES imaging. We identify 19 broad H$\alpha$ emitters with FWHM$&gt;$1000 km/s at z$\approx$4-5.5, including 9 new sources. The broad H$\alpha$ luminosity function (LF) derived from our sample is consistent with those of other JWST-selected broad-line AGN reported in the literature. The black hole masses and AGN bolometric luminosities, inferred from the broad H$\alpha$ components, indicate that most sources are accreting at ~10% of the Eddington limit. We derive their host stellar masses via SED fitting and find higher $M_{BH}/M_{*}$ ratios relative to the local $M_{BH}-M_{*}$ relations, consistent with previous studies. We find that 42% of the sample do not satisfy the widely-used color selection criteria for Little Red Dots (LRDs), with the majority of these sources lacking the characteristic steep rest-optical red slope, indicating that the LRD selection is highly incomplete when selecting AGN galaxies. A comparison of the average SEDs between our sample and LRDs selected in the same field reveals that the steep red slopes observed in some LRDs are likely due to line-boosting effects as previously suggested. Furthermore, we find that 68% of color-selected LRDs with H$\alpha$ detections in the NIRCam/Grism spectra do not exhibit broad-line features. While the limited sensitivity of the grism spectra may hinder the detection of broad-line components in faint sources, our findings still highlight the enigmatic nature of the LRD population.</description>

      <title>Signatures of dark subhalos in dwarf spheroidal galaxies: I. Fluctuations in surface density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26056v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dark matter (DM) subhalos offer critical tests of cosmological models through their abundance and properties, yet most remain undetectable due to their lack of stars. We investigate whether their presence leaves measurable imprints on the projected stellar density fields of dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs). Building on literature $N$-body experiments, we show that subhalo interactions induce subtle out-of-equilibrium fluctuations appearing as density corrugations. In a CDM framework, these fluctuations are dominated by the most massive subhalos in the host halo. We develop a Fourier-based framework to quantify these features, identifying characteristic peaks in the spatial frequency spectrum that are well described by Voigt profiles. The peak parameters are sensitive to both the subhalo mass function and the number of stellar tracers. For the configurations tested, $N_{\star} \sim 10^5$ stars suffice to detect subhalo populations with $M_{\rm subhalo} \lesssim 10^6~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$, while larger masses produce stronger and more complex signatures. We assess the feasibility of this technique by analyzing Gaia and HST data: in this context, the Fornax dwarf shows residual low-frequency structures resembling those in our controlled subhalo experiments, making it an interesting case for follow-up. Prospectively, wide-field surveys such as Euclid, the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, and the Vera C. Rubin Observatory are expected to deliver stellar samples of $N_{\star} \sim 10^5$ per dwarf, offering compelling prospects for probing subhalo imprints. Our results introduce a novel pathway to constrain the subhalo mass function in dSphs, and motivate follow-up work that incorporates alternative DM models and additional dynamical perturbations.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic models of reheating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08685v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a causal hydrodynamic model that provides an effective macroscopic description of the field-theoretic dynamics during the early stages of reheating. The inflaton condensate is treated as a homogeneous background coupled to a relativistic fluid that represents its inhomogeneous fluctuations. Within the divergence-type theory framework derived from kinetic considerations, the model captures essential dissipative and non-equilibrium effects while remaining stable and causal. We find that the coupling between the oscillating condensate and the fluid induces a parametric resonance in the tensor sector, leading to the amplification of the viscous stress tensor and the generation of gravitational waves with a characteristic spectral peak. The predicted spectrum agrees with lattice simulations performed with CosmoLattice. This hydrodynamic approach offers an effective bridge between microscopic field dynamics and macroscopic cosmological observables.</description>

      <title>Conserved Quantities in Expanding G\"odel Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00238v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: At linear order we study perturbations to a G\"odel background spacetime which includes expansion in addition to rotation. We investigate the transformation behaviour of these perturbations under gauge transformations and construct gauge invariant quantities. Using the perturbed energy conservation equation we find that there are conserved quantities in Expanding G\"odel (EG) Cosmology, in particular a spatial metric trace perturbation, {\zeta} SMTP , which is conserved on large scales for pressureless dust. We finally extend our discussion to a perfect fluid matter content to also obtain conserved quantities in this context.</description>
