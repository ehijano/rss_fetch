      <title>Plasma-Enhanced Germination in North Indian Wheat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The application of nonthermal plasma in agriculture has emerged as a sustainable and eco-friendly method to enhance seed vigor, germination, and crop productivity. This study investigates the effects of atmospheric pressure plasma treatment on five popular bread wheat varieties of North India, WH 1142, HI 1544, GW 366, GW 322, and GW 273. Direct dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma exposure and plasma activated water irrigation were tested. Results indicated significant improvements in seed wettability, germination index, root and shoot growth, spike length, and grain yield compared to controls. Among treatments, 3 min DBD exposure and 15 min PAW irrigation consistently produced the best results, with variety specific differences in vigor and yield. These findings demonstrate the potential of plasma seed treatment as a chemical free technology to enhance productivity in wheat, contributing to sustainable agriculture in India.</description>

      <title>GPU Acceleration and Portability of the TRIMEG Code for Gyrokinetic Plasma Simulations using OpenMP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The field of plasma physics heavily relies on simulations to model various phenomena, such as instabilities, turbulence, and nonlinear behaviors that would otherwise be difficult to study from a purely theoretical approach. Simulations are fundamental in accurately setting up experiments, which can be extremely costly and complex. As high-fidelity tools, gyrokinetic simulations play a crucial role in discovering new physics, interpreting experimental results, and improving the design of next-generation devices. However, their high computational costs necessitate the use of acceleration platforms to reduce execution time. This work revolves around the TRIangular MEsh based Gyrokinetic (TRIMEG) code, which performs high-accuracy particle-in-cell plasma simulations in tokamak geometries, leveraging a novel finite element approach. The rise of graphical processing units (GPUs) constitutes an occasion to satisfy such computational needs, by offloading the most expensive portion of the code to the accelerators. The chosen approach features GPU offloading with the OpenMP API, which grants portability of the code to different architectures, namely AMD and NVIDIA. The particle pushing as well as the grid-to-particle operations have been ported to GPU platforms. Compiler limitations had to be overcome, and portions of the code were restructured to be suitable for GPU acceleration. Kernel performance was evaluated by carrying out GPU grid size exploration, as well as scalability studies. In addition, the efficiency of hybrid MPI-OpenMP offloading parallelization was assessed. The speedup of the GPU implementation was calculated by comparing it with the pure CPU version using different rationales. The Ion Temperature Gradient (ITG) mode was simulated using the GPU-accelerated version, and its correctness was verified in terms of the energy growth rate and the two-dimensional mode structures.</description>

      <title>Understanding Carbon Sourcing and Transport Originating from the Helicon Antenna Surfaces During High-Power Helicon Discharge in DIII-D Tokamak</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high-power helicon wave system in the DIII-D tokamak introduces new plasma--material interaction (PMI) challenges due to rectified RF sheath potentials forming near antenna structures and surrounding tiles. Using the STRIPE modeling framework-which integrates SOLPS-ITER, COMSOL, RustBCA, and GITR/GITRm-we simulate carbon erosion, re-deposition, and global impurity transport in two H-mode discharges with varying antenna--plasma gaps and RF powers. COMSOL predicts rectified sheath potentials of 1-5 kV, localized near the bottom of the antenna where magnetic field lines intersect at grazing angles. Erosion is dominated by carbon self-sputtering, with RF-accelerated D+ ions contributing up to 1 % of the total erosion flux. GITRm simulations show that in the small-gap case, only ~ 13 % of eroded carbon is re-deposited locally, with 58 % transported into the core. In contrast, the large-gap case exhibits lower total erosion, along with reduced core penetration (~ 35 %) and weaker re-deposition (~ 4 %), consistent with lower collisionality and limited plasma contact. The simulation trends are consistent with experimental observations, which have not shown elevated core impurity levels during helicon operation in the present graphite-wall configuration. However, under certain plasma conditions and magnetic configurations, the helicon antenna may still act as a finite source of net erosion and core-directed impurity transport, potentially influencing the overall core impurity balance. These findings emphasize the need for sheath-aware antenna designs and predictive impurity transport modeling to support future high-power RF systems with high-Z first wall materials in fusion devices.</description>

      <title>Triggers for plasma detachment bifurcation in the edge divertor region of tokamaks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of the trigger for detachment bifurcation phenomenon in tokamak divertors, revealed through steady-state and time-dependent UEDGE simulations: The observed electron temperature cliff at the outer target in DIII-D H-mode plasmas with ion $B\times \nabla B$ drift driven into the active divertor results from a bifurcation-induced $T_e$ drop above the X-point accompanied by reversal of the $E\times B$ flow pattern in the private flux region. Time-dependent simulations reveal a two-phase transition mechanism: the high-field-side radiation front first extends across the last closed flux surface and stabilizes above the X-point, causing local $T_e$ to drop from $\sim 70\,\mathrm{eV}$ to $\sim 10\,\mathrm{eV}$ and inducing $E\times B$ flow reversal in a thin layer below the X-point, which lasts $&lt; 0.5\,\mathrm{ms}$; Flow reversal below the X-point subsequently triggers the sharp drop in outer target temperature on a timescale of $1-2\,\mathrm{ms}$, establishing deep detachment a few ms thereafter. A bifurcation transition occurs when the high-field-side radiation front crosses the separatrix while the outer divertor remains attached, with the $T_e$ cliff manifesting distinctly when the outer target $T_e \gtrsim 10\,\mathrm{eV}$ prior to the bifurcation. These results demonstrate that the bifurcation is linked to in-out divertor asymmetry and asymmetric radiation front evolution.</description>

      <title>Electric field induced by radial redistribution of the energetic ion pressure in a fusion plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is found by using the gyrokinetic theory that significant radial electric fields, or zonal flows, can be generated by the radial redistribution of energetic ion pressure in a tokamak fusion device. Trapped energetic ions are more effective to generate the radial electric field than the isotropic energetic ions. This suggests that the energetic $\alpha$ particles produced by DT fusion may induce significant radial electric field and thus help to improve the core plasma confinement in a fusion reactor.</description>

      <title>Piecewise omnigenous magnetohydrodynamic equilibria as fusion reactor candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In piecewise omnigenous magnetic fields, charged particles remain perfectly confined in the abscence of collisions and turbulence. This concept extends the traditional notion of omnigenity, the theoretical principle upon which most of existing magnetic fusion reactor designs, including tokamaks, are based. While piecewise omnigenity broadens the range of potentially viable stellarator reactor candidates, it is achieved by relaxing the requirement of continuity in the magnetic field strength, which could appear to pose significant challenges for the design of magnetohydrodynamic equilibria. In this work, a stellarator magnetic configuration is presented that satisfies the ideal magnetohydrodynamic equilibrium equation and that achieves unprecedented levels of piecewise omnigenity. As a result, it exhibits favorable transport characteristics, including reduced bulk radial (neoclassical and turbulent transport), bootstrap current and fast ion losses. In addition, the configuration displays robust MHD stability across a range of \b{eta} values and possesses a rotational transform profile compatible with an island divertor. Collectively, these features satisfy the standard set of physics criteria required for a viable reactor candidate which, until now, were believed to be attainable only by certain types of omnigenous stellarators.</description>

      <title>Single-laser scheme for reaching strong field QED regime via direct laser acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a single-laser scheme for reaching the strong-field QED regime based on direct laser acceleration (DLA) of electrons followed by their head-on collision with the same laser pulse reflected from an overdense foil. In this configuration, electrons are first accelerated inside an underdense plasma by a relativistic laser pulse and subsequently interact with the reflected laser field, emitting high-energy photons via nonlinear Compton scattering which decay into electron-positron pairs through the nonlinear Breit-Wheeler process. Using analytical scalings supported by quasi-3D particle-in-cell simulations including QED effects, we demonstrate that a laser pulse with power as low as 2 PW is sufficient to reach the quantum regime characterized by $\chi_e&gt; 1$ . For higher powers, we observe a rapid nonlinear increase in the number of generated positrons, reaching more than 2 nC for a 10 PW laser pulse with energy of approximately 1.1 kJ. A semi-analytical model is employed to estimate the positron yield, showing good agreement with simulation results. We further study the influence of laser depletion and the positioning of the reflecting foil on the efficiency of pair production. The presented scheme provides an experimentally feasible platform for probing strong-field QED effects using currently available multi-petawatt laser systems.</description>

      <title>Super Time Stepping Methods for Diffusion using Discontinuous-Galerkin Spatial Discretizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Super-time-stepping (STS) methods provide an attractive approach for enabling explicit time integration of parabolic operators, particularly in large-scale, higher-dimensional kinetic simulations where fully implicit schemes are impractical. In this work, we present an explicit STS framework tailored for diffusion operators in gyrokinetic models, motivated by the fact that constructing and storing a Jacobian is often infeasible due to strong nonlocal couplings, high dimensionality, and memory constraints. We investigate the performance of several STS methods, including Runge-Kutta-Chebyshev (RKC) and Runge-Kutta-Legendre (RKL) schemes, applied to a diffusion equation discretized using both discontinuous Galerkin (DG) and finite-difference methods. To support time adaptivity, we introduce a novel error norm designed to more accurately track temporal error arising from DG spatial discretizations, in which degrees of freedom contribute unevenly to the solution error. Finally, we assess the performance of an automatic eigenvalue estimation algorithm for determining the required number of STS stages and compare it against an analytical estimation formula.</description>

      <title>In-Situ Inverse Design of a Plasma Metamaterial Beam Steering Device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inverse design is a commonly used methodology for creating devices that manipulate electromagnetic (EM) waves by algorithmically modifying device parameters to achieve a desired functionality. Utilizing plasma, a dynamically tunable medium, allows the optimization of the design process to be conducted directly on the experimental hardware (in-situ). A key advantage of this method is the creation of devices that are inherently switchable and dynamically reconfigurable. Bayesian optimization is used to tune the plasma density of 91 independent discharges that make up a plasma metamaterial (PMM) device to steer incoming EM waves to desired exit waveguides. Measurements were conducted in an automated loop where a vector network analyzer records the PMM transmission characteristics for each device setting. By relying only on measured scattering parameters, this gradient-free approach is robust to experimental drift and noise and does not require complex full-wave models. Significant performance improvements over traditional simulation-based (in-silico) inverse design are demonstrated, with in-situ Bayesian optimization achieving up to 10,000x higher isolation between ports than the best in-silico design at the same target frequency. This work also presents guidelines for applying Bayesian optimization to noisy, high-dimensional physical systems.</description>

      <title>Dielectric formalism of the 2D uniform electron gas at finite temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of the two-dimensional uniform electron gas (2D-UEG or more commonly 2DEG) at finite temperature, spanning a broad range of densities / coupling strengths ($0.01\le{r}_s\le20$) and temperatures / degeneracy parameters ($0.01\le\Theta= k_B T/E_F \le 10$). Within the self-consistent dielectric formalism, we construct two-dimensional versions of the Singwi-Tosi-Land-Sj\"olander (STLS) and hypernetted-chain (HNC) approximation based schemes. We benchmark the accuracy of the STLS and the HNC schemes against new state-of-the-art path-integral Monte Carlo data. We also report structural and thermodynamic properties across the full $(r_s,\Theta)$ phase diagram domain studied, identify regimes in which these schemes remain quantitatively reliable, and provide an accurate parametrization of the exchange--correlation free energy of the finite-temperature 2DEG.</description>

Abstract: We compute quasi-exact \emph{ab initio} path-integral Monte Carlo results for the Matsubara Green's function of the uniform electron gas (UEG) at finite temperature over a broad range of coupling strengths ($r_s=1,\dots,10)$. This allows us to present approximation-free results for the static self-energy $\Sigma_\infty(p)$ and spectral function $A(p,\omega)$, and to benchmark previous approximate results for the UEG. In addition, our work opens up intriguing avenues to study the single-particle spectrum and density of states of real warm dense matter systems based on truly first principles.</description>

      <title>Ionization Dynamics in Intense Laser-Produced Plasmas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13938v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ionization dynamic of argon plasma irradiated by an intense laser is investigated to understand transient physics in dynamic systems. This study demonstrates that significant delayed ionization responses and stepwise ionization processes are crucial factors in determining the ionization state of such systems. When an intense laser begins to ionize an initially cold argon plasma, the conditions change rapidly, leading to a delayed response in ionization. Consequently, the dynamics do not reach a steady state, even if the electron temperature and density appear unchanged, particularly when the atomic transition process is not sufficiently rapid compared to the relevant time scales. Furthermore, in this case, numerous highly excited states are created primarily through collisional excitation. Thus, even low-energy photons can predominantly ionize plasmas, challenging the conventional belief that such photon energies insufficient to overcome the binding energy of bound electrons typically contribute less to the ionization. These findings underscore the necessity of incorporating these processes in ionization modeling within radiation hydrodynamic simulations for various laser-plasma experiments.</description>

Abstract: We propose and detail a multi-step analytical procedure, based on an improved fully relativistic plane model for Laser Wake Field Acceleration, to tailor the initial density of a cold diluted plasma to the laser pulse profile, so as to control and optimize the partial wave-breaking of the plasma wave and maximize the acceleration of small bunches of electrons self-injected by the first wave-breaking at the density down-ramp, at least in the first stages of their acceleration phase. We find an excellent agreement with the results of Particle In Cell simulations obtained with the same input data.</description>

By varying the field asymmetry, the pulse shape from Gaussian to super-Gaussian, and the carrier envelope phase, we show the momentum distribution and the number density of created pairs to exhibit extreme sensitivity to these field characteristics. The effects are also qualitatively explained by analyzing the turning-point structures within the WKB formalism. We observed that multiphoton pair production dominates in the case of long falling-pulse asymmetry. For a short falling pulse with a flat-top super-Gaussian laser profile, pair production is further facilitated. For certain field parameters, we demonstrate that the number density can be enhanced by two to three orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Inhomogeneous mixing: From microscopic dynamics to mesoscopic staircases</title>

Abstract: Inhomogeneous mixing and the consequent mesoscopic layered structure have been observed in many physical systems, including magnetically confined fusion plasmas. Especially, in plasmas, mixing can be enhanced through turbulence spreading by intermittent coherent structures (blobs/voids), or suppressed due to the formation of transport barriers (sheared zonal flows). Interestingly, blobs/voids and zonal flows are not independent, and they can co-exist in a state of inhomogeneous mixing, often called the E x B staircase. In this paper, we first introduce recent experimental progress on the physics of blobs/voids: how turbulence spreading by blobs/voids occurs, the consequences of enhanced turbulence spreading for the scrape-off layer (SOL) power decay length, and the interaction between blobs/voids and zonal flows. Then, we provide a brief review of experimental results on staircases, or more generally layered mesoscopic transport barriers. Staircases are often elusive in experiments, requiring integrating multi-diagnostic data, utilizing high-dimensional diagnostics, or extracting hidden information from signals for their identification. Our understanding is still incomplete. This paper serves as an initial step toward applying insights gained from inhomogeneous mixing due to blobs/voids to the understanding of a staircase.</description>

      <title>A magnetic avalanche as the central engine powering a solar flare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12235</link>

Abstract: Solar flares are the most powerful, magnetically driven, explosions in the heliosphere. The nature of magnetic energy release in the solar corona that heats the plasma and accelerates particles in a flare, however, remains poorly understood. Here, we report high-resolution coronal observations of a flare by the Solar Orbiter mission that reveal initially weaker but rapid reconnection events, on timescales of a few seconds at most, leading to a more prominent activity of a similar nature that explosively causes a flare. Signatures of this process are further imprinted on the widespread raining plasma blobs with short lifetimes, giving rise to the characteristic ribbon-like emission pattern associated with the flare. Our observations unveil the central engine of a flare and emphasize the crucial role of an avalanche-like magnetic energy release mechanism at work.</description>

      <title>Evolution of an Alfv\'en Wave-Driven Proton Beam in the Expanding Solar Wind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02940v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the self-consistent formation and long-term evolution of proton beams in the expanding solar wind using an ensemble of one-dimensional hybrid expanding box simulations. Initial conditions are chosen to represent a range of plasma states observed by the Helios spacecraft at 0.3 AU, including an amplitude-modulated Alfv\'en wave that nonlinearly drives a proton beam aligned with the magnetic field. We compare simulation results with solar wind data out to 1.5 AU and show that our model reproduces key observed features of proton beams on average, such as the radial evolution of the drift and the relative core-to-beam density ratio. These findings support the theory that the observed evolution of the proton beam drift in the solar wind is determined by kinetic instabilities. More broadly, our results indicate that the interplay between nonlinear Alfv\'en wave dynamics, expansion effects and kinetic instabilities plays a fundamental role in solar wind dynamics, with implications for interpreting solar wind heating rate estimates.</description>

      <title>Deterministic and probabilistic neural surrogates of global hybrid-Vlasov simulations</title>

Abstract: Hybrid-Vlasov simulations resolve ion-kinetic effects for modeling the solar wind-magnetosphere interaction, but even 5D (2D + 3V) simulations are computationally expensive. We show that graph-based machine learning emulators can learn the spatiotemporal evolution of electromagnetic fields and lower order moments of ion velocity distribution in the near-Earth space environment from four 5D Vlasiator runs performed with identical steady solar wind conditions. The initial ion number density is systematically varied, while the grid spacing is held constant, to scan the ratio of the characteristic ion skin depth to the numerical grid size. Using a graph neural network architecture operating on the 2D spatial simulation grid comprising 670k cells, we demonstrate that both a deterministic forecasting model (Graph-FM) and a probabilistic ensemble forecasting model (Graph-EFM) based on a latent variable formulation are capable of producing accurate predictions of future plasma states. A divergence penalty is incorporated during training to encourage divergence-freeness in the magnetic fields and improve physical consistency. For the probabilistic model, a continuous ranked probability score objective is added to improve the calibration of the ensemble forecasts. When trained, the emulators achieve more than two orders of magnitude speedup in generating the next time step relative to the original simulation on a single GPU compared to 100 CPUs for the Vlasiator runs, while closely matching physical magnetospheric response of the different runs. These results demonstrate that machine learning offers a way to make hybrid-Vlasov simulation tractable for real-time use while providing forecast uncertainty.</description>
