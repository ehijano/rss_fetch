      <title>Automatic Parallel Tempering Markov Chain Monte Carlo with Nii-C</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to the high dimensionality or multimodality that is common in modern astronomy, sampling Bayesian posteriors can be challenging. Several publicly available codes based on different sampling algorithms can solve these complex models, but the execution of the code is not always efficient or fast enough. The article introduces a C language general-purpose code, Nii-C (https://github.com/shengjin/nii-c.git), that implements a framework of Automatic Parallel Tempering Markov Chain Monte Carlo. Automatic in this context means that the parameters that ensure an efficient parallel tempering process can be set by a control system during the initial stages of a sampling process. The auto-tuned parameters consist of two parts, the temperature ladders of all parallel tempering Markov chains and the proposal distributions for all model parameters across all parallel tempering chains. In order to reduce dependencies in the compilation process and increase the code's execution speed, Nii-C code is constructed entirely in the C language and parallelised using the Message-Passing Interface protocol to optimise the efficiency of parallel sampling. These implementations facilitate rapid convergence in the sampling of high-dimensional and multi-modal distributions, as well as expeditious code execution time. The Nii-C code can be used in various research areas to trace complex distributions due to its high sampling efficiency and quick execution speed. This article presents a few applications of the Nii-C code.</description>

      <title>The inverse Kalman filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we introduce a new approach, the inverse Kalman filter (IKF), which enables accurate matrix-vector multiplication between a covariance matrix from a dynamic linear model and any real-valued vector with linear computational cost. We incorporate the IKF with the conjugate gradient algorithm, which substantially accelerates the computation of matrix inversion for a general form of covariance matrices, whereas other approximation approaches may not be directly applicable. We demonstrate the scalability and efficiency of the IKF approach through distinct applications, including nonparametric estimation of particle interaction functions and predicting incomplete lattices of correlated data, using both simulation and real-world observations, including cell trajectory and satellite radar interferogram.</description>

      <title>Bayesian inversion with Student's t priors based on Gaussian scale mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13665v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many inverse problems focus on recovering a quantity of interest that is a priori known to exhibit either discontinuous or smooth behavior. Within the Bayesian approach to inverse problems, such structural information can be encoded using Markov random field priors. We propose a class of priors that combine Markov random field structure with Student's t distribution. This approach offers flexibility in modeling diverse structural behaviors depending on available data. Flexibility is achieved by including the degrees of freedom parameter of Student's t distribution in the formulation of the Bayesian inverse problem. To facilitate posterior computations, we employ Gaussian scale mixture representation for the Student's t Markov random field prior, which allows expressing the prior as a conditionally Gaussian distribution depending on auxiliary hyperparameters. Adopting this representation, we can derive most of the posterior conditional distributions in a closed form and utilize the Gibbs sampler to explore the posterior. We illustrate the method with two numerical examples: signal deconvolution and image deblurring.</description>

      <title>GIST: Gibbs self-tuning for locally adaptive Hamiltonian Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15253v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel and flexible framework for localized tuning of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) samplers by Gibbs sampling the algorithm's tuning parameters conditionally based on the position and momentum at each step. For adaptively sampling path lengths, the framework encompasses randomized HMC, multinomial HMC, the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), and the Apogee-to-Apogee Path Sampler as special cases. The Gibbs self-tuning (GIST) framework is illustrated with an alternative to NUTS for locally adapting path lengths, evaluated with an exact Hamiltonian for an ill-conditioned normal and with the leapfrog algorithm for a test suite of diverse models.</description>

      <title>Stable generative modeling using Schr\"odinger bridges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04372v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of sampling from an unknown distribution for which only a sufficiently large number of training samples are available. Such settings have recently drawn considerable interest in the context of generative modelling and Bayesian inference. In this paper, we propose a generative model combining Schr\"odinger bridges and Langevin dynamics. Schr\"odinger bridges over an appropriate reversible reference process are used to approximate the conditional transition probability from the available training samples, which is then implemented in a discrete-time reversible Langevin sampler to generate new samples. By setting the kernel bandwidth in the reference process to match the time step size used in the unadjusted Langevin algorithm, our method effectively circumvents any stability issues typically associated with the time-stepping of stiff stochastic differential equations. Moreover, we introduce a novel split-step scheme, ensuring that the generated samples remain within the convex hull of the training samples. Our framework can be naturally extended to generate conditional samples and to Bayesian inference problems. We demonstrate the performance of our proposed scheme through experiments on synthetic datasets with increasing dimensions and on a stochastic subgrid-scale parametrization conditional sampling problem.</description>

      <title>Process-based Inference for Spatial Energetics Using Bayesian Predictive Stacking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09906v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rapid developments in streaming data technologies have enabled real-time monitoring of human activity that can deliver high-resolution data on health variables over trajectories or paths carved out by subjects as they conduct their daily physical activities. Wearable devices, such as wrist-worn sensors that monitor gross motor activity, have become prevalent and have kindled the emerging field of ``spatial energetics'' in environmental health sciences. We devise a Bayesian inferential framework for analyzing such data while accounting for information available on specific spatial coordinates comprising a trajectory or path using a Global Positioning System (GPS) device embedded within the wearable device. We offer full probabilistic inference with uncertainty quantification using spatial-temporal process models adapted for data generated from ``actigraph'' units as the subject traverses a path or trajectory in their daily routine. Anticipating the need for fast inference for mobile health data, we pursue exact inference using conjugate Bayesian models and employ predictive stacking to assimilate inference across these individual models. This circumvents issues with iterative estimation algorithms such as Markov chain Monte Carlo. We devise Bayesian predictive stacking in this context for models that treat time as discrete epochs and that treat time as continuous. We illustrate our methods with simulation experiments and analysis of data from the Physical Activity through Sustainable Transport Approaches (PASTA-LA) study conducted by the Fielding School of Public Health at the University of California, Los Angeles.</description>
