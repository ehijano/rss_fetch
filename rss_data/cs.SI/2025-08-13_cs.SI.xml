      <title>How Conversational Structure and Style Shape Online Community Experiences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sense of Community (SOC) is vital to individual and collective well-being. Although social interactions have moved increasingly online, still little is known about the specific relationships between the nature of these interactions and Sense of Virtual Community (SOVC). This study addresses this gap by exploring how conversational structure and linguistic style predict SOVC in online communities, using a large-scale survey of 2,826 Reddit users across 281 varied subreddits. We develop a hierarchical model to predict self-reported SOVC based on automatically quantifiable and highly generalizable features that are agnostic to community topic and that describe both individual users and entire communities. We identify specific interaction patterns (e.g., reciprocal reply chains, use of prosocial language) associated with stronger communities and identify three primary dimensions of SOVC within Reddit -- Membership &amp; Belonging, Cooperation &amp; Shared Values, and Connection &amp; Influence. This study provides the first quantitative evidence linking patterns of social interaction to SOVC and highlights actionable strategies for fostering stronger community attachment, using an approach that can generalize readily across community topics, languages, and platforms. These insights offer theoretical implications for the study of online communities and practical suggestions for the design of features to help more individuals experience the positive benefits of online community participation.</description>

      <title>Effective and Efficient Attributed Hypergraph Embedding on Nodes and Hyperedges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An attributed hypergraph comprises nodes with attributes and hyperedges that connect varying numbers of nodes. Attributed hypergraph node and hyperedge embedding (AHNEE) maps nodes and hyperedges to compact vectors for use in important tasks such as node classification, hyperedge link prediction, and hyperedge classification. Generating high-quality embeddings is challenging due to the complexity of attributed hypergraphs and the need to embed both nodes and hyperedges, especially in large-scale data. Existing solutions often fall short by focusing only on nodes or lacking native support for attributed hypergraphs, leading to inferior quality, and struggle with scalability on large attributed hypergraphs.
  We propose SAHE, an efficient and effective approach that unifies node and hyperedge embeddings for AHNEE computation, advancing the state of the art via comprehensive embedding formulations and algorithmic designs. First, we introduce two higher-order similarity measures, HMS-N and HMS-E, to capture similarities between node pairs and hyperedge pairs, respectively. These measures consider multi-hop connections and global topology within an extended hypergraph that incorporates attribute-based hyperedges. SAHE formulates the AHNEE objective to jointly preserve all-pair HMS-N and HMS-N similarities. Direct optimization is computationally expensive, so we analyze and unify core approximations of all-pair HMS-N and HMS-N to solve them simultaneously. To enhance efficiency, we design several non-trivial optimizations that avoid iteratively materializing large dense matrices while maintaining high-quality results. Extensive experiments on diverse attributed hypergraphs and 3 downstream tasks, compared against 11 baselines, show that SAHE consistently outperforms existing methods in embedding quality and is up to orders of magnitude faster.</description>

      <title>The Roots of International Perceptions: Simulating US Attitude Changes Towards China with LLM Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise of LLMs poses new possibilities in modeling opinion evolution, a long-standing task in simulation, by leveraging advanced reasoning abilities to recreate complex, large-scale human cognitive trends. While most prior works focus on opinion evolution surrounding specific isolated events or the views within a country, ours is the first to model the large-scale attitude evolution of a population representing an entire country towards another -- US citizens' perspectives towards China. To tackle the challenges of this broad scenario, we propose a framework that integrates media data collection, user profile creation, and cognitive architecture for opinion updates to successfully reproduce the real trend of US attitudes towards China over a 20-year period from 2005 to today. We also leverage LLMs' capabilities to introduce debiased media exposure, extracting neutral events from typically subjective news contents, to uncover the roots of polarized opinion formation, as well as a devils advocate agent to help explain the rare reversal from negative to positive attitudes towards China, corresponding with changes in the way Americans obtain information about the country. The simulation results, beyond validating our framework architecture, also reveal the impact of biased framing and selection bias in shaping attitudes. Overall, our work contributes to a new paradigm for LLM-based modeling of cognitive behaviors in a large-scale, long-term, cross-border social context, providing insights into the formation of international biases and offering valuable implications for media consumers to better understand the factors shaping their perspectives, and ultimately contributing to the larger social need for bias reduction and cross-cultural tolerance.</description>

      <title>Where are GIScience Faculty Hired from? Analyzing Faculty Mobility and Research Themes Through Hiring Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Academia is profoundly influenced by faculty hiring networks, which serve as critical conduits for knowledge dissemination and the formation of collaborative research initiatives. While extensive research in various disciplines has revealed the institutional hierarchies inherent in these networks, their impacts within GIScience remain underexplored. To fill this gap, this study analyzes the placement patterns of 946 GIScience faculty worldwide by mapping the connections between PhD-granting institutions and current faculty affiliations. Our dataset, which is compiled from volunteer-contributed information, is the most comprehensive collection available in this field. While there may be some limitations in its representativeness, its scope and depth provide a unique and valuable perspective on the global placement patterns of GIScience faculty. Our analysis reveals several influential programs in placing GIScience faculty, with hiring concentrated in the western countries. We examined the diversity index to assess the representation of regions and institutions within the global GIScience faculty network. We observe significant internal retention at both the continental and country levels, and a high level of non-self-hired ratio at the institutional level. Over time, research themes have also evolved, with growing research clusters emphasis on spatial data analytics, cartography and geovisualization, geocomputation, and environmental sciences, etc. These results illuminate the influence of hiring practices on global knowledge dissemination and contribute to promoting academic equity within GIScience and Geography.</description>

      <title>Meta-learning optimizes predictions of missing links in real-world networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relational data are ubiquitous in real-world data applications, e.g., in social network analysis or biological modeling, but networks are nearly always incompletely observed. The state-of-the-art for predicting missing links in the hard case of a network without node attributes uses model stacking or neural network techniques. It remains unknown which approach is best, and whether or how the best choice of algorithm depends on the input network's characteristics. We answer these questions systematically using a large, structurally diverse benchmark of 550 real-world networks under two standard accuracy measures (AUC and Top-k), comparing four stacking algorithms with 42 topological link predictors, two of which we introduce here, and two graph neural network algorithms. We show that no algorithm is best across all input networks, all algorithms perform well on most social networks, and few perform well on economic and biological networks. Overall, model stacking with a random forest is both highly scalable and surpasses on AUC or is competitive with graph neural networks on Top-k accuracy. But, algorithm performance depends strongly on network characteristics like the degree distribution, triangle density, and degree assortativity. We introduce a meta-learning algorithm that exploits this variability to optimize link predictions for individual networks by selecting the best algorithm to apply, which we show outperforms all state-of-the-art algorithms and scales to large networks.</description>

      <title>Efficient Learning on Large Graphs using a Densifying Regularity Lemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18273v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learning on large graphs presents significant challenges, with traditional Message Passing Neural Networks suffering from computational and memory costs scaling linearly with the number of edges. We introduce the Intersecting Block Graph (IBG), a low-rank factorization of large directed graphs based on combinations of intersecting bipartite components, each consisting of a pair of communities, for source and target nodes. By giving less weight to non-edges, we show how to efficiently approximate any graph, sparse or dense, by a dense IBG. Specifically, we prove a constructive version of the weak regularity lemma, showing that for any chosen accuracy, every graph, regardless of its size or sparsity, can be approximated by a dense IBG whose rank depends only on the accuracy. This dependence of the rank solely on the accuracy, and not on the sparsity level, is in contrast to previous forms of the weak regularity lemma. We present a graph neural network architecture operating on the IBG representation of the graph and demonstrating competitive performance on node classification, spatio-temporal graph analysis, and knowledge graph completion, while having memory and computational complexity linear in the number of nodes rather than edges.</description>

      <title>From Platform Migration to Cultural Integration: the Ingress and Diffusion of #wlw from TikTok to RedNote in Queer Women Communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07579v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hashtags serve as identity markers and connection tools in online queer communities. Recently, the Western-origin #wlw (women-loving-women) hashtag has risen in the Chinese lesbian community on RedNote, coinciding with user migration triggered by the temporary US TikTok ban. This event provides a unique lens to study cross-cultural hashtag ingress and diffusion through the populations' responsive behaviors in cyber-migration. In this paper, we conducted a two-phase content analysis of 418 #wlw posts from January and April, examining different usage patterns during the hashtag's ingress and diffusion. Results indicate that the successful introduction of #wlw was facilitated by TikTok immigrants' bold importation, both populations' mutual interpretation, and RedNote natives' discussions. In current manifestation of diffusion, #wlw becomes a RedNote-recognized queer hashtag for sharing queer life, and semantically expands to support feminism discourse. Our findings provide empirical insights for enhancing the marginalized communities' cross-cultural communication.</description>

      <title>Equivariance Everywhere All At Once: A Recipe for Graph Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14291v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph machine learning architectures are typically tailored to specific tasks on specific datasets, which hinders their broader applicability. This has led to a new quest in graph machine learning: how to build graph foundation models capable of generalizing across arbitrary graphs and features? In this work, we present a recipe for designing graph foundation models for node-level tasks from first principles. The key ingredient underpinning our study is a systematic investigation of the symmetries that a graph foundation model must respect. In a nutshell, we argue that label permutation-equivariance alongside feature permutation-invariance are necessary in addition to the common node permutation-equivariance on each local neighborhood of the graph. To this end, we first characterize the space of linear transformations that are equivariant to permutations of nodes and labels, and invariant to permutations of features. We then prove that the resulting network is a universal approximator on multisets that respect the aforementioned symmetries. Our recipe uses such layers on the multiset of features induced by the local neighborhood of the graph to obtain a class of graph foundation models for node property prediction. We validate our approach through extensive experiments on 29 real-world node classification datasets, demonstrating both strong zero-shot empirical performance and consistent improvement as the number of training graphs increases.</description>
