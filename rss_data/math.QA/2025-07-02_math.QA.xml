      <title>Critical elements in algebras of numerical events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The probability p(s) of the occurrence of an event pertaining to a physical system which is observed in different states s determines a function p from the set S of states of the system to [0,1]. The function p is called a numerical event or more precisely an S-probability. When appropriately structured, sets P of numerical events form so-called algebras of S-probabilities, which are orthomodular posets that can serve as quantum logics. If one deals with a classical physical system, then P will be a Boolean algebra. Starting with a supposed quantum logic or logics obtained by individual measurements, newly added numerical events may turn out to be crucial for the assumption of classicality or non-classicality of the physical system. We will call those numerical events critical and will study their impacts among various classes of algebras of numerical events. Moreover, we will consider the situation of enlarging S by new states and will describe how elements of an algebra of S-probabilities contribute to the character of a logic when there exists a certain relation between them and the element that is newly added.</description>

      <title>Shuffle algebras, lattice paths and quantum toroidal $\mathfrak{gl}_{n|m}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe and compute various families of commuting elements of the matrix shuffle algebra of type $\mathfrak{gl}_{n|m}$, which is expected to be isomorphic to quantum toroidal $\mathfrak{gl}_{n|m}$. Our formulas are given in terms of partial traces of products of $R$-matrices of the quantum affine algebra $U_t(\dot{\mathfrak{gl}}_{n|m})$, and have a lattice path interpretation. Our calculations are based on the machinery of the quantum toroidal algebras and a new anti-homomorphism between matrix shuffle algebras.</description>

      <title>The Algebraic Structure of Morphosyntax</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within the context of the mathematical formulation of Merge and the Strong Minimalist Thesis, we present a mathematical model of the morphology-syntax interface. In this setting, morphology has compositional properties responsible for word formation, organized into a magma of morphological trees. However, unlike syntax, we do not have movement within morphology. A coproduct decomposition exists, but it requires extending the set of morphological trees beyond those which are generated solely by the magma, to a larger set of possible morphological inputs to syntactic trees. These participate in the formation of morphosyntactic trees as an algebra over an operad, and a correspondence between algebras over an operad. The process of structure formation for morphosyntactic trees can then be described in terms of this operadic correspondence that pairs syntactic and morphological data and the morphology coproduct. We reinterpret in this setting certain operations of Distributed Morphology as transformation that allow for flexibility in moving the boundary between syntax and morphology within the morphosyntactic objects.</description>

      <title>$(d,\sigma)$-twisted Affine-Virasoro superalgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For any finite dimensional Lie superalgebra $\dot{\mathfrak{g}}$ (maybe a Lie algebra) with an even derivation $d$ and a finite order automorphism $\sigma$ that commutes with $d$, we introduce the $(d,\sigma)$-twisted Affine-Virasoro superalgebra $\mathfrak{L}=\mathfrak{L}(\dot{\mathfrak{g}},d,\sigma)$ and determine its universal central extension $\hat{\mathfrak{L}}=\hat{\mathfrak{L}}(\dot{\mathfrak{g}},d,\sigma)$. This is a huge class of infinite-dimensional Lie superalgebras. Such Lie superalgebras consist of many new and well-known Lie algebras and superalgebras, including the Affine-Virasoro superalgebras, the twisted Heisenberg-Virasoro algebra, the mirror Heisenberg-Virasoro algebra, the W-algebra $W(2,2)$, the gap-$p$ Virasoro algebras, the Fermion-Virasoro algebra, the $N=1$ BMS superalgebra, the planar Galilean conformal algebra. Then we give the classification of cuspidal $A\mathfrak{L}$-modules by using the weighting functor from $U(\mathfrak{h})$-free modules to weight modules. Consequently, we give the classification of simple cuspidal $\mathfrak{L}$-modules by using the $A$-cover method. Finally, all simple quasi-finite modules over $\mathfrak{L}$ and $\hat{\mathfrak{L}}$ are classified. Our results recover many known Lie superalgebra results from mathematics and mathematical physics, and give many new Lie superalgebras.</description>

      <title>On the conjecture of Kashuba and Mathieu about free Jordan algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kashuba and Mathieu proposed a conjecture on vanishing of Lie algebra homology, implying a description of the $GL_d$-module structure of the free $d$-generated Jordan algebra. Their conjecture relies on a functorial version of the Tits--Kantor--Koecher construction that builds Lie algebras out of Jordan algebras. In this note, we summarize new intricate computational data concerning free Jordan algebras and explain why, despite a lot of overwhelmingly positive evidence, the conjecture of Kashuba and Mathieu is not true.</description>

      <title>Tables of practical invariants for distinguishing multiplicity-free fusion categories up to rank 7</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper discusses to what extent the census of multiplicity-free fusion categories up to rank 7, proposed by the software package Anyonica and the anyonwiki website, can be regarded as a proper classification. The questions of correctness and completeness are briefly discussed, and the question of inequivalence of the provided categories is resolved under the assumption that all proposed data is correct. This is done by providing tables of small sets of invariants for these categories, for which (a) their invariance under automorphisms can be checked manually, and (b) the (in)equivalence of two skeletal fusion categories can be checked manually. These invariants can also be used to identify the category on the anyonwiki that corresponds to one for which the skeletal data is known.</description>

      <title>Fundamental $n$-quandles of links are residually finite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17703v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the residual finiteness and subquandle separability of quandles, properties that respectively imply the solvability of the word problem and the generalized word problem for quandles. From Winker's work, we know that fundamental $n$-quandles of oriented links, which are canonical quotients of their fundamental quandles, are closely associated with $n$-fold cyclic branched covers of the 3-sphere branched over these links. We prove that the fundamental $n$-quandle of any oriented link in the 3-sphere is residually finite for each $n\ge 2$. This supplements the recent result by Bardakov, Singh and the third author on residual finiteness of fundamental quandles of oriented links, and the classification by Hoste and Shanahan of links whose fundamental $n$-quandles are finite for some $n$. We also establish several general results on these finiteness properties and identify many families of quandles admitting them.</description>

      <title>Macdonald deformation of Vogel's universality and link hyperpolynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16569v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vogel's universality implies a unified description of the adjoint sector of representation theory for simple Lie algebras in terms of three parameters $\alpha,\beta,\gamma$, which are homogeneous coordinates of Vogel's plane. Actually this is true (if at all) only for a piece of representation theory captured by knot/Chern-Simons theory, where some irreducible representations are often undistinguishable and combined into new ``universally-irreducible" entities (uirreps). We consider from this point of view the recently discovered Macdonald deformation of quantum dimensions, for which a kind of universality holds for the ADE series. The claim is that universal are not Macdonald dimensions themselves, but their products with Littlewood-Richardson coefficients, which themselves are functions of $q$ and $t$ in Macdonald theory. These products are precisely what arises in knot/refined Chern-Simons theory. Actually, we consider the simplest decomposition of adjoint square into six uirreps and obtain the universal formulas for hyperpolynomials of the Hopf link and, more generally, of the torus links $T[2,2n]$.</description>
