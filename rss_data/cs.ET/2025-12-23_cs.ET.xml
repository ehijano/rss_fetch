      <title>Shuttling Compiler for Trapped-Ion Quantum Computers Based on Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trapped-ion quantum computers based on segmented traps rely on shuttling operations to establish connectivity between multiple sub-registers within a quantum processing unit. Several architectures of increasing complexity have already been realized, including linear arrays, racetrack loops, and junction-based layouts. As hardware capabilities advance, the need arises for flexible software layers within the control stack to manage qubit routing$\unicode{x2014}$the process of dynamically reconfiguring qubit positions so that all qubits involved in a gate operation are co-located within the same segment. Existing approaches typically employ architecture-specific heuristics, which become impractical as system complexity grows. To address this challenge, we propose a layout-independent compilation strategy based on large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we fine-tune pretrained LLMs to generate the required shuttling operations. We evaluate this approach on both linear and branched one-dimensional architectures, demonstrating that it provides a foundation for developing LLM-based shuttling compilers for trapped-ion quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Multifractality Analysis of Single Qubit Quantum Circuit Outcomes for a Superconducting Quantum Computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a multifractal analysis of time series data obtained by repeatedly running a single-qubit quantum circuit on IBM superconducting quantum computers, in which the measurement outcomes are recorded as the number of zeros. By applying advanced signal processing techniques, including the wavelet leader method and multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis, we uncover strong multifractal behavior in the output data. This finding indicates that the temporal fluctuations inherent to quantum circuit outputs are not purely random but exhibit complex scaling properties across multiple time scales. The multifractal nature of the signal suggests the possibility of tailoring filtering strategies that specifically target these scaling features to effectively mitigate noise in quantum computations. Our results not only contribute to a deeper understanding of the dynamical properties of quantum systems under repeated measurement but also provide a promising avenue for improving noise reduction techniques in near-term quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Sonified Quantum Seizures. Sonification of time series in epileptic seizures and simulation of seizures via quantum modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply sonification strategies and quantum computing to the analysis of an episode of seizure. We first sonify the signal from a selection of channels (from real ECoG data), obtaining a polyphonic sequence. Then, we propose two quantum approaches to simulate a similar episode of seizure, and we sonify the results. The comparison of sonifications can give hints on similarities and discrepancies between real data and simulations, helping refine the \textit{in silico} model. This is a pioneering approach, showing how the combination of quantum computing and sonification can broaden the perspective of real-data investigation, and helping define a new test bench for analysis and prediction of seizures.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity-Aware Mixed-Precision Quantization for ReRAM-based Computing-in-Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compute-In-Memory (CIM) systems, particularly those utilizing ReRAM and memristive technologies, offer a promising path toward energy-efficient neural network computation. However, conventional quantization and compression techniques often fail to fully optimize performance and efficiency in these architectures. In this work, we present a structured quantization method that combines sensitivity analysis with mixed-precision strategies to enhance weight storage and computational performance on ReRAM-based CIM systems. Our approach improves ReRAM Crossbar utilization, significantly reducing power consumption, latency, and computational load, while maintaining high accuracy. Experimental results show 86.33% accuracy at 70% compression, alongside a 40% reduction in power consumption, demonstrating the method's effectiveness for power-constrained applications.</description>

      <title>Transformer-Based Neural Quantum Digital Twins for Many-Body Quantum Simulation and Optimal Annealing Schedule Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15662v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Transformer-based Neural Quantum Digital Twins (Tx-NQDTs) to simulate full adiabatic dynamics of many-body quantum systems, including ground and low-lying excited states, at low computational cost. Tx-NQDTs employ a graph-informed Transformer neural network trained to predict spectral properties (energy levels and gap locations) needed for annealing schedule design. We integrate these predictions with an adaptive annealing schedule design based on first-order adiabatic perturbation theory (FOAPT), which slows the evolution near predicted small gaps to maintain adiabaticity. Experiments on a D-Wave quantum annealer (N = 10, 15, 20 qubits, 12 control segments) show that Tx-NQDT-informed schedules significantly improve success probabilities despite hardware noise and calibration drift. The optimized schedules achieve success probabilities 2.2-11.7 percentage points higher than the default linear schedule, outperforming the D-Wave baseline in 44 of 60 cases. These results demonstrate a practical, data-driven route to improved quantum annealing performance on real hardware.</description>

      <title>Information-Theoretic Constraints on Variational Quantum Optimization: Efficiency Transitions and the Dynamical Lie Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14701v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms are leading candidates for near-term advantage, yet their scalability is fundamentally limited by the ``Barren Plateau'' phenomenon. While traditionally attributed to geometric concentration of measure, I propose an information-theoretic origin: a bandwidth bottleneck in the optimization feedback loop. By modeling the optimizer as a coherent Maxwell's Demon, I derive a thermodynamic constitutive relation, $\Delta E \leq \eta I(S:A)$, where work extraction is strictly bounded by the mutual information established via entanglement. I demonstrate that systems with polynomial Dynamical Lie Algebra (DLA) dimension exhibit ``Information Superconductivity'' (sustained $\eta &gt; 0$), whereas systems with exponential DLA dimension undergo an efficiency collapse when the rate of information scrambling exceeds the ancilla's channel capacity. These results reframe quantum trainability as a thermodynamic phase transition governed by the stability of information flow.</description>

      <title>Practical Challenges in Executing Shor's Algorithm on Existing Quantum Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15330v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computers pose a fundamental threat to widely deployed public-key cryptosystems, such as RSA and ECC, by enabling efficient integer factorization using Shor's algorithm. Theoretical resource estimates suggest that 2048-bit RSA keys could be broken using Shor's algorithm with fewer than a million noisy qubits. Although such machines do not yet exist, the availability of smaller, cloud-accessible quantum processors and open-source implementations of Shor's algorithm raises the question of what key sizes can realistically be factored with today's platforms. In this work, we experimentally investigate Shor's algorithm on several cloud-based quantum computers using publicly available implementations. Our results reveal a substantial gap between the capabilities of current quantum hardware and the requirements for factoring cryptographically relevant integers. In particular, we observe that circuit constructions still need to be highly specific for each modulus, and that machine fidelities are unstable, with high and fluctuating error rates.</description>
