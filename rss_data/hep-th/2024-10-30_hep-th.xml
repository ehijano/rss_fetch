Abstract: Flux compactifications that give three- or four-dimensional Anti de Sitter vacua with a parametrically small negative cosmological constant are claimed to be ubiquitous in String Theory. However, the 1+1 and 2+1 dimensional CFT duals to such vacua should have very large central charges and rather unusual properties. We construct brane configurations that source these would-be AdS flux compactifications, and identify certain UV AdS geometries that these branes source. The central charge of the CFT duals to these UV AdS geometries place lower bounds on the absolute values of the cosmological constants of the AdS vacua. These bounds are incompatible with the scale separation needed to construct realistic cosmological models.</description>

      <title>The Three-Point Form Factor of $\textrm{Tr}\,\phi^3$ to Six Loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the three-point form factor of the length-three half-BPS operator ($\textrm{Tr}\,\phi^3$) in planar $\mathcal{N}=4$ Super-Yang-Mills theory, using analyticity and integrability methods. We find that the functions describing the form factor in perturbation theory live in the same restrictive space of multiple polylogarithms as the one describing the form factor of the stress-tensor operator ($\textrm{Tr}\,\phi^2$). Furthermore, we find that the leading-order data in the collinear limit provided by the form factor operator product expansion (FFOPE) is enough to fix the form factor uniquely, at least through six loops. We perform various tests of our results using the subleading FFOPE corrections. We also analyze the form factor in the Regge limit where two Mandelstam invariants are large; we obtain a compact representation for the form factor in this limit which is valid to all orders in the coupling.</description>

      <title>Quantum Turbulence in a Three-Dimensional Holographic Superfluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report real-time simulations of far-from-equilibrium dynamics of a holographic superfluid in three dimensions. The holographic duality maps a strongly coupled superfluid to a weakly coupled theory with gravity in a higher-dimensional curved space which we study numerically. Starting from configurations of dense tangles of quantized vortex lines, the superfluid exhibits turbulent behavior during its evolution towards thermal equilibrium. Specifically, we observe two subsequent universal regimes of quasi-stationary scaling in the occupation number spectrum, the first of which is Kolmogorov-like. Indications for the strongly dissipative nature of vortex dynamics in the three-dimensional holographic superfluid are found in the rapid shrinking and annihilation of small vortex rings that emerge from frequent reconnections of vortex lines during the evolution.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Entropy is Elastic Cross Section</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present universal relations between entanglement entropy, which quantifies the quantum correlation between subsystems, and the elastic cross section, which is the primary observable for high energy particle scattering, by employing a careful formulation of wave packets for the incoming particles. For 2-to-2 elastic scattering with no initial entanglement and subdividing the system along particle labels, we show that both the R\'enyi and Tsallis entropies in the final states are directly proportional to the elastic cross section in unit of the transverse size for the initial wave packets, which is then interpreted as the elastic scattering probability. The relations do not depend on the underlying dynamics of the quantum field theory and are valid to all orders in coupling strengths. Furthermore, computing quantum correlations between momentum and non-kinematic data leads to entanglement entropies expressed as various semi-inclusive elastic cross sections. Our result gives rise to a novel ``area law'' for entanglement entropy in a two-body system.</description>

      <title>Systematic exploration of the non-geometric flux landscape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given the huge size of the generic four-dimensional scalar potentials arising from the type II supergravities based on toroidal orientifolds, it is even hard to analytically solve the extremization conditions, and therefore the previous studies have been mainly focused on taking some numerical approaches. In this work, using the so-called {\it axionic flux polynomials} we demonstrate that the scalar potential and the extremization conditions can be simplified to a great extent, leading to the possibility of performing an analytic exploration of the flux landscape. In this regard, we consider the isotropic case of a type IIB model based on the standard ${\mathbb T}^6/({\mathbb Z}_2 \times {\mathbb Z}_2)$ orientifold having the three-form fluxes $F_3/H_3$ and the non-geometric $Q$-flux. This model results in around 300 terms in the scalar potential which depend on 6 moduli/axionic fields and 14 flux parameters. Considering that the axionic flux polynomials can take either zero or non-zero values results in the need of analyzing $2^{14}=16384$ candidate configurations, and we find that more than 16200 of those result in No-Go scenarios for Minkowskian/de-Sitter vacua. Based on our systematic exploration of non-tachyonic flux vacua, we present a detailed classification of such No-Go scenarios as well as the leftover ``undecided" configurations for which we could not conclude about the presence/absence of the stable Minkowskian/de-Sitter vacua.</description>

      <title>Analytic evaluation of the three-loop three-point form factor of $\operatorname{tr}\phi^3$ in $\mathcal{N}=4$ sYM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute analytically the three-loop correlation function of the local operator $\text{tr} \, \phi^3$ inserted into three on-shell states, in maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. The result is expressed in terms of Chen iterated integrals. We also present our result using generalised polylogarithms, and evaluate them numerically, finding agreement with a previous numerical result in the literature. We observe that the result depends on fewer kinematic singularities compared to individual Feynman integrals. Furthermore, upon choosing a suitable definition of the finite part, we find that the latter satisfies powerful symbol adjacency relations similar to those previously observed for the $\text{tr} \, \phi^2$ case.</description>

      <title>Imaginary part of timelike entanglement entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the imaginary part of the timelike entanglement entropy. In the context of field theory, it is more appropriate to obtain the timelike entanglement entropy through the Wick rotation of the twist operators. It is found that, in certain special cases, the imaginary part of the timelike entanglement entropy is related to the commutator of the twist operator and its first-order temporal derivative. To evaluate these commutators, we employ the operator product expansion of the twist operators, revealing that the commutator is generally universal across most scenarios. However, in more general cases, the imaginary part of the timelike entanglement entropy proves to be more complex. We compute the commutator of the twist operators along with its higher-order temporal derivatives. Utilizing these results, we derive a modified formula for the imaginary part of the timelike entanglement entropy. Furthermore, we extend this formula to the case of strip subregion in higher dimensions. Our analysis shows that for the strip geometry, the imaginary part of the timelike entanglement entropy is solely related to the commutators of the twist operator and its first-order temporal derivative. The findings presented in this paper provide valuable insights into the imaginary part of timelike entanglement entropy and its physical significance.</description>

      <title>Manifestations of $(2+1)d$ chiral anomaly in a graphene plate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by Son's model for graphene, we consider a $(2+1)$-dimensional fermionic system in which fermions are described by four-component spinors. These fermions are proposed to interact with an electromagnetic field originating from a four-dimensional setting, as the graphene plate is embedded in 4d Minkowski spacetime. In this framework, a chiral anomaly arises at the boundary of the plate, stemming from a non-local anomaly action that depends on both the electromagnetic and chiral gauge fields when the chiral transformation is localized. This results in boundary chiral and electric currents, and we explore potentially observable effects when external magnetic or electric fields are applied to the fermionic system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the linearized stability and causality properties of relativistic viscous superfluid hydrodynamics. The Landau-Lifshitz-Clark-Putterman formulation for the theory of relativistic viscous superfluids suffers from the same instability and acausality issues as the relativistic Navier-Stokes equation for normal fluids when written in the formulations of Eckart or Landau and Lifshitz. We show that conditions to ensure stability and causality can be satisfied with judicious redefinitions of the hydrodynamic variables. The conditions we obtain hold at non-zero superfluid velocity as well.</description>

      <title>Classical eikonal from Magnus expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a classical scattering problem, the classical eikonal is defined as the generator of the canonical transformation that maps in-states to out-states. It can be regarded as the classical limit of the log of the quantum S-matrix. In a classical analog of the Born approximation in quantum mechanics, the classical eikonal admits an expansion in oriented tree graphs, where oriented edges denote retarded/advanced worldline propagators. The Magnus expansion, which takes the log of a time-ordered exponential integral, offers an efficient method to compute the coefficients of the tree graphs to all orders. We exploit a Hopf algebra structure behind the Magnus expansion to develop a fast algorithm which can compute the tree coefficients up to the 12th order (over half a million trees) in less than an hour. In a relativistic setting, our methods can be applied to the post-Minkowskian (PM) expansion for gravitational binaries. We demonstrate the methods by computing the 3PM eikonal and find agreement with previous results based on amplitude methods.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of the Kerr-AdS black hole from an ensemble-averaged theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exploring the universal structure of the gravitational path integral beyond semi-classical saddles and uncovering a compelling statistical interpretation of black hole thermodynamics have long been significant challenges. We investigate the statistical interpretation of the Kerr-AdS black hole thermodynamics through an ensemble-averaged theory. By extending the phase space to include all possible states with conical singularities in their Euclidean counterparts, we derive the probability distribution of different states inherited from the Euclidean gravitational path integral. Moreover, we can define a density matrix of all the states in the phase space. By ensemble-averaging over all states, we show that the black hole phase transition naturally arises in the semi-classical limit, just as in the Schwarzschild-AdS and Reissner-Nordstr\"om-AdS cases. Away from the semi-classical regime, the ensemble-averaged theory exhibits a notable deviation from the conventional phase transition. Expanding around the classical saddles yields the subleading-order correction to the Gibbs free energy, which is half of the Hawking temperature. We demonstrate that the half Hawking temperature correction is a universal feature inherent to black holes in asymptotically AdS spacetime. With the subleading-order correction to Gibbs free energy, we also suggest that the whole black hole thermodynamic should be corrected accordingly.</description>

      <title>A Tale of Bulk and Branes: Symmetry TFT of 6D SCFTs from IIB/F-theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the 7D Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) associated to a 6D SCFT from the IIB/F-theory geometric engineering approach. The 6D (2,0) or (1,0) SCFT is constructed from IIB on a non-compact complex surface possibly with 7-branes. We derive the general form of 7D SymTFT actions from the compactification of IIB action on the boundary link of the base manifold of an elliptic Calabi-Yau threefold, for both the cases with or without flavor 7-branes intersecting the boundary link. Along the way we found new terms in the SymTFT action from the worldvolume action of flavor 7-branes involving the flavor center symmetries. We crosscheck the results against those obtained from either holographic constructions or the dual M-theory picture. Our construction potentially leads to a classification of the 7D SymTFTs which parallels the known geometric classification of the 6D SCFTs.</description>

      <title>On exact overlaps of integrable matrix product states: inhomogeneities, twists and dressing formulas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Invoking a quantum dressing procedure as well as the representation theory of twisted Yangians we derive a number of summation formulas for the overlap between integrable matrix product states and Bethe eigenstates which involve only eigenvalues of fused transfer matrices and which are valid in the presence of inhomogeneities as well as twists. Although the method is general we specialize to the $SO(6)$ spin chain for which integrable matrix product states corresponding to evaluation representations of the twisted Yangian $Y^+(4)$ encode the information about one-point functions of the D3-D5 domain wall version of ${\cal N}=4$ SYM. Considering the untwisted and homogeneous limit of our summation formulas we finally fill the last gap in the analytical understanding of the overlap formula for the $SO(6$) sector of the D3-D5 domain wall system.</description>

      <title>Consistent $\mathcal{N}=4$, $D=4$ truncation of type IIB supergravity on $\textrm{S}^{1} \times \textrm{S}^{5}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fetching techniques from Generalised Geometry and Exceptional Field Theory, we develop a new method to identify consistent subsectors of four-dimensional gauged maximal supergravities that possess a (locally) geometric embedding in type IIB or 11D supergravity. We show that a subsector that is invariant under a structure group $\textrm{G}_\textrm{S} \subset \textrm{E}_{7(7)}$ can define a consistent truncation, even when $\textrm{G}_\textrm{S}$ is not part of the symmetry of the gauged maximal supergravity. As an illustration of the method, type IIB supergravity on $\textrm{S}^{1} \times \textrm{S}^{5}$ is shown to admit a consistent truncation to pure $\mathcal{N}=4$, $D=4$ gauged supergravity. Explicit uplift formulae are presented which provide a type IIB alternative to the M-theory embedding constructed by Cvetic, Lu and Pope $25$ years ago.</description>

      <title>Binary Kerr black-hole scattering at 2PM from quantum higher-spin Compton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum higher-spin theory applied to Compton amplitudes has proven to be surprisingly useful for elucidating Kerr black hole dynamics. Here we apply the framework to compute scattering amplitudes and observables for a binary system of two rotating black holes, at second post-Minkowskian order, and to all orders in the spin-multipole expansion for certain quantities. Starting from the established three-point and conjectured Compton quantum amplitudes, the infinite-spin limit gives classical amplitudes that serves as building block that we feed into the unitarity method to construct the 2-to-2 one-loop amplitude. We give scalar box, vector box, and scalar triangle coefficients to all orders in spin, where the latter are expressed in terms of Bessel-like functions. Using the Kosower-Maybee-O'Connell formalism, the classical 2PM impulse is computed, and in parallel we work out the scattering angle and eikonal phase. We give novel all-orders-in-spin formulae for certain contributions, and the remaining ones are given up to ${\cal O}(S^{11})$. Since Kerr 2PM dynamics beyond ${\cal O}(S^{\ge 5})$ is as of yet not completely settled, this work serves as a useful reference for future studies.</description>

      <title>Exact overlaps for "all" integrable matrix product states of rational spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The overlaps between integrable matrix product states (MPS) and Bethe states are important in both the non-equilibrium statistical physics and the AdS/CFT duality. We present the general MPS overlap formula. The result is a product of a ratio of Gaudin determinants and a prefactor. The Gaudin determinants depend on the spin chain but not on the MPS. The MPS dependent prefactor is given for all integrable MPS of the $\mathfrak{gl}_{N}$, $\mathfrak{o}_{N}$ and $\mathfrak{sp}_{N}$ symmetric spin chains with arbitrary representations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove conjectures of Garoufalidis-Gu-Mari\~no that perturbative series associated with the hyperbolic knots $4_1$ and $5_2$ are resurgent and Borel summable. In the process, we give an algorithm that can be used to explicitly compute the Borel-Laplace resummation as a combination of state integrals of Andersen-Kashaev. This gives a complete description of the resurgent structure in these examples and allows for explicit computations of Stokes constants.</description>

      <title>Quantum dust collapse with cosmological constant and methods for constructing conformal diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The loop quantum gravitational collapse of the dust ball in presence of positive cosmological constant is investigated within the Oppenheimer-Snyder collapse scenario. The dust ball interior is described within the framework of loop quantum cosmology, while its exterior geometry is determined by the differentiability of the spacetime metric at the dust ball surface and the assumption of the (vacuum) exterior to be stationary. In order to determine the global causal structure of the investigated spacetime a robust (numerical) method of constructing Penrose-Carter diagrams is built. Unfortunately the presence of cosmological constant does not cure the problems already present in the case of it vanishing -- the exterior geometry resembles that of Reissner-Nordstr\"om-de Sitter black hole, in particular featuring timelike singularties.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present simple derivation of the Luttinger liquid relation for the 1D Hubbard model both for finite $U$ and in the $U=\infty$ limit. We describe the simple solution of the Hubbard model in the infinite repulsion limit and use it to calculate the correlators of the model in this limit in a simple and a physical way using the Bosonization technique. We then calculate the asymptotics of the correlators of the model at arbitrary $U$ through the single parameter, which can be calculated from the Bethe Ansatz solution. Our derivation of the critical exponents is simple and allows one to express different physical operators of the Hubbard model through the charge and spin Bose fields in a direct and a physically transparent way.</description>

      <title>Thermal effects on warm chromoinflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore a model of a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson inflaton field coupled to a non-Abelian $SU(2)$ gauge field. This model naturally leads to a warm inflation scenario, where the inflationary dynamics is dominated by thermal dissipation. In this work, we consider a scenario where the inflaton, an axion-like field, is coupled to the $SU(2)$ gauge field, similar to chromoinflation models. Both the inflaton and the gauge field with a non-vanishing vacuum expectation value are coupled to a thermal radiation bath. We demonstrate that the presence of the thermal bath during warm chromoinflation induces a thermal plasma mass for the background gauge field. This thermal mass can significantly disrupt the dynamics of the background gauge field, thereby driving it to its trivial null solution.</description>

      <title>A Linear Response Analysis of the Semiclassical Approximation to Spin 1/2 Quantum Electrodynamics in 1+1 Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An investigation of the validity of the semiclassical approximation to quantum electrodynamics in 1+1 dimensions is given. The criterion for validity used here involves the impact of quantum fluctuations introduced through a two-point function which emerges naturally when considering the stability of the backreaction equation to linear order perturbations, resulting in the linear response equation. Consideration is given to the case of a spatially homogeneous electric field generated by a classical source, coupled to a quantized massive spin 1/2 field. Solutions to the linear response equation as well as the impact of quantum fluctuations introduced through the current density two-point correlation function are presented for two relevant electric field-to-mass parameter values $qE/m^2$, indicative of the strength of the backreaction process. Previous efforts utilized approximate solutions to the linear response equation that were expected to be valid for early times. A comparative analysis is given between the exact and approximate solutions in order to validate this conjecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The memory burden effect is an explicit resolution to the information paradox by which an evaporating black hole acquires quantum hair, which then suppresses its rate of mass loss with respect to the semi-classical Hawking rate. We show that this has significant implications for particle dark matter that captures in neutron stars and forms black holes that go on to consume the host star. In particular, we show that constraints on the nucleon scattering cross section and mass of spin-0 and spin-1/2 dark matter would be extended by several orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Possibility of quantum Hall effect in neutron star environment: A chiral model approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A high baryon density and strong magnetic fields are expected in peripheral collisions in heavy-ion collision experiments, such as the upcoming CBM experiment at FAIR in Germany and NICA in Russia. Such densities are also likely in the core of massive neutron stars, possibly with mixed quark-hadron phases. We employed the chiral effective model to obtain the constituent quark mass in this non-perturbative QCD regime. A quantized version of conductivity and resistivity is found reliable in the quantum domain of low density and high magnetic fields. Landau quantization gives rise to phenomena similar to SdH oscillations and quantum Hall effect in this regime. We have used a density-dependent magnetic field to observe SdH-type oscillations and the possibility of the quantum Hall effect in the interior of neutron stars where the magnetic field varies as a function of the baryon density. Our results indicate the possibility of observing the quantum Hall effect in a neutron star environment as well as in heavy-ion collision of CBM and NICA experiments.</description>

      <title>Spin Polarized Quasi-particle in Off-equilibrium Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is usually believed that physics in off-equilibrium state characterized by hydrodynamic gradient can be equivalently studied using equilibrium state with suitable metric perturbation. We scrutinize this assumption using chiral kinetic theory in curved space, focusing on spin response to hydrodynamic gradient. Two effects of metric perturbation have been identified: one is to change particle motion by scattering it off the metric fields, which does capture spin response to hydrodynamic gradient, but is limited by kinematic condition in the scattering picture. The other is the genuine effect of off-equilibrium state, which is realizable by mapping the equilibrium state in curved space to flat space through a suitable frame choice. It lifts the kinematic condition in the spin response to hydrodynamic gradient. We classify off-equilibrium effect on spin polarization into modifications of (i) spectral function; (ii) distribution function; (iii) KMS relation. While the last two have been studied using chiral kinetic theory, the first one is usually ignored in kinetic description. We perform a detailed analysis on the first one, finding the radiative correction to spectral function leads to a polarized quasi-particle. The degeneracy of spin responses to different hydrodynamic sources at tree-level is also lifted by radiative correction.</description>

      <title>The Excess of JWST Bright Galaxies: a Possible Origin in the Ground State of Dynamical Dark Energy in the light of DESI 2024 Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent observations by JWST yield a large abundance of luminous galaxies at $z\gtrsim 10$ compared to that expected in the CDM scenario based on extrapolations of the star formation efficiency measured at lower redshifts. While several astrophysical processes can be responsible for such observations, here we explore to what extent such an effect can be rooted in the assumed Dark Energy (DE) sector of the current cosmological model. This is motivated by recent results from different cosmological probes combined with the last data release of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), which indicate a tension in the DE sector of the concordance ${\Lambda}$ CDM model. We have considered the effect of assuming a DE characterized by a negative {\Lambda} as the ground state of a quintessence field on the galaxy luminosity function (LF) at high redshifts. We find that such models naturally affect the galaxy UV luminosities in the redshift range $10 \lesssim z\lesssim 15$ needed to match the JWST observations, and with the value of ${\Omega}_{\Lambda}$=[-0.6,-0.3] remarkably consistent with that required by independent cosmological probes. A sharp prediction of such models is the steep decline of the abundance of bright galaxies in the redshift range $15 \lesssim z\lesssim 16$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the causal structure for spherically symmetric dust collapse within effective loop quantum gravity. We develop a general strategy (working beyond the dynamical model of our consideration) for constructing double null coordinates, allowing the extraction of conformal diagrams within single coordinate charts. With the methods introduced, we confirm that the homogeneous Oppenheimer-Snyder collapse scenario resembles the Reissner-Nordstr\"om-like picture. For the nonhomogenous collapse scenario, we construct the conformal diagrams, subsequently, we study its relevant properties, in particular, dust particles' trajectories, apparent horizons and shell-crossing singularities. We conclude that a considerable region of spacetime cannot be probed by the model's dynamics because of the formation of the shell-crossings. We also address the problem of the possible (non)-existence of timelike singularity known from the homogeneous collapse scenario.</description>

      <title>Numerical evaluation of the real-time photon-instanton cross-section in a superconducting circuit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Instantons, semi-classical trajectories of quantum tunneling in imaginary time, have long been used to study thermodynamic and transport properties in a myriad of condensed matter and high energy systems. A recent experiment in superconducting circuits [Phys. Rev. Lett. 126, 197701, (2021)] provided first evidence for direct dynamical signatures of instantons (phase slips), manifested by order-unity inelastic decay probabilities for photons with which they interact, motivating the development of a scattering theory of instantons [Phys. Rev. Lett. 126, 137701, (2021)]. While this framework successfully predicted the measured inelastic decay rates of the photons for several experimental devices, it is valid only if the tunneling time of the instantons is much shorter than the relaxation time of the environment in which they are embedded, and requires a closed analytical expression for the instanton trajectory. Here, we amend these issues by incorporating numerical methods that lift some of the previously applied approximations. Our results agree with the experimental measurements, also for devices with shorter relaxation times, without fitting parameters. This framework should be useful in many other quantum field theoretical contexts.</description>

      <title>Further support for $S_8$ increasing with effective redshift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Adil et al. 2023, we reported an increasing trend in $S_8$ with effective redshift $z_{\textrm{eff}}$ based on $f \sigma_8(z)$ constraints over the redshift range $0 \lesssim z \lesssim 2$, and predicted that this trend would be observable in independent datasets. Recently, the studies by Artis et al. and the ACT+DESI collaboration appeared, presenting data that aligns with the expected trends. In this letter, we quantify the statistical significance of the increasing $S_8$ trends in recent studies by fitting a linear model to estimate the slope $\Delta\,S_8/\Delta\, z_{\textrm{eff}}$, and comparing the results to mock simulations. We find probabilities of $p = 0.0163$ and $p = 0.01893$, corresponding to approximately $2.1\sigma$ for each dataset. Using Fisher's method to combine the independent probabilities, we obtained $p=0.0027$ ($2.8 \sigma$). When we incorporate our earlier findings, the combined statistical significance reaches between $3\sigma$ and $3.7\sigma$. This letter continues a series of studies initiated in 2020 that explore redshift-dependent $\Lambda$CDM parameters as an indication of a breakdown in the standard cosmological model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the gravitational properties of a nonlinear electromagnetic extension of an AdS Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole. Our study begins with an analysis of the metric function and horizon structure, followed by calculations of the Ricci and Kretschmann scalars and an evaluation of the non-vanishing Christoffel symbols. These calculations allow us to examine geodesics and their influence on the photon sphere, shadow formation, and bending angle. In the thermodynamic framework, we evaluate essential quantities, including the Hawking temperature, entropy, heat capacity, Gibbs free energy, and Hawking radiation emission. We further investigate black hole evaporation by estimating the evaporation timescale as the black hole approaches its final state. Additionally, quasinormal modes for scalar and vector perturbations are computed using the WKB approximation to characterize oscillatory behavior of the system. Finally, a time-domain analysis is provided in order to examine the evolution of these perturbations.</description>

      <title>Double BFV quantisation of 3d Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the cohomological setting developed by Batalin, Fradkin and Vilkovisky to the case of a nested coisotropic embedding $C\hookrightarrow C_\circ \hookrightarrow F$ inside a symplectic manifold $F$.
  To this, we naturally assign the coisotropic reductions $\pi\colon C\to \underline{C}$, as well as $\pi_\circ\colon C_\circ\to\underline{C_\circ}$ and the residual reduction $\pi_{\mathrm{res}}\colon C_{\mathrm{res}}\to \underline{C_{\mathrm{res}}}$, where $C_{\mathrm{res}}=\pi_\circ(C)\hookrightarrow \underline{C_\circ}$ is the residual coisotropic embedding such that $\underline{C_{\mathrm{res}}}\simeq \underline{C}$.
  We show that there is a relation between the BFV resolutions of $\underline{C_\circ}$ and $\underline{C}$, in terms of a graded coisotropic embedding, which can further be resolved via BFV.
  We call this construction \emph{double BFV resolution}, and we use it to prove that "resolution commutes with reduction". We then deduce a quantisation of $\underline{C}\simeq\underline{C_{\mathrm{res}}}$, from a quantisation of the double BFV Hamiltonian dg manifold following the quantum BFV prescription (when it exists). As an application, we provide a well defined candidate space of (physical) quantum states of three-dimensional Einstein--Hilbert theory, which is thought of as a partial reduction of the Palatini--Cartan model for gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present some addition theorems for spin-weighted spherical harmonics, generalizing previous results for scalar (spin-zero) spherical harmonics. These addition theorems involve sums over the azimuthal quantum number of products of two spin-weighted spherical harmonics at different points on the two-sphere, either (or both) of which are differentiated with respect to one of their arguments.</description>

      <title>Global anomalies &amp; bordism of non-supersymmetric strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06895v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The three tachyon-free non-supersymmetric string theories in ten dimensions provide a handle on quantum gravity away from the supersymmetric lamppost. However, they have not been shown to be fully consistent; although local anomalies cancel due to versions of the Green-Schwarz mechanism, there could be global anomalies, not cancelled by the Green-Schwarz mechanism, that could become fatal pathologies. We compute the twisted string bordism groups that control these anomalies via the Adams spectral sequence, showing that they vanish completely in two out of three cases (Sugimoto and $SO(16)^2$) and showing a partial vanishing also in the third (Sagnotti 0'B model). We also compute lower-dimensional bordism groups of the non-supersymmetric string theories, which are of interest to the classification of branes in these theories via the Cobordism Conjecture. We propose a worldvolume content based on anomaly inflow for the $SO(16)^2$ NS5-brane, and discuss subtleties related to the torsion part of the Bianchi identity. As a byproduct of our techniques and analysis, we also reprove that the outer $\mathbb{Z}_2$ automorphism swapping the two $E_8$ factors in the supersymmetric heterotic string is also non-anomalous.</description>

      <title>Integrable Deformations from Twistor Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17551v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrable field theories in two dimensions are known to originate as defect theories of 4d Chern-Simons and as symmetry reductions of the 4d anti-self-dual Yang-Mills equations. Based on ideas of Costello, it has been proposed in work of Bittleston and Skinner that these two approaches can be unified starting from holomorphic Chern-Simons in 6 dimensions. We provide the first complete description of this diamond of integrable theories for a family of deformed sigma models, going beyond the Dirichlet boundary conditions that have been considered thus far. Starting from 6d holomorphic Chern-Simons theory on twistor space with a particular meromorphic 3-form $\Omega$, we construct the defect theory to find a novel 4d integrable field theory, whose equations of motion can be recast as the 4d anti-self-dual Yang-Mills equations. Symmetry reducing, we find a multi-parameter 2d integrable model, which specialises to the $\lambda$-deformation at a certain point in parameter space. The same model is recovered by first symmetry reducing, to give 4d Chern-Simons with generalised boundary conditions, and then constructing the defect theory.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of Weil-Petersson volumes and two-dimensional quantum gravities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07276v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a refined expression for the large genus asymptotics of the Weil-Petersson volumes of the moduli space of super-Riemann surfaces with an arbitrary number of boundaries. Our formula leverages the connection between JT supergravity and its matrix model definition, utilizing some basic tools of resurgence theory. The final result holds for arbitrary boundary lengths and preserves the polynomial structure of the super-volumes. As a byproduct we also obtain a prediction for the large genus asymptotics of generalized $\Theta$-class intersection numbers. We extend our proposal to the case of the quantum volumes relevant for the Virasoro minimal string/Liouville gravity. Performing the classical limit on the quantum volumes, we recover a formula for the ordinary Weil-Petersson building blocks of JT gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21784v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Factorization algebras play a central role in the formulation of quantum field theories given by Kevin Costello and his collaborators. In this paper, we propose a concrete construction of a topological operator in their formulation. We focus on a shift symmetry of a one-dimensional massless scalar theory. And we give some discussions of $\mathbb{Z}$-gauging of it, i.e., compact scalar theory and its $\theta$-vacuum.</description>

      <title>Bouncing Cosmology in 1+1 Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09671v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, I construct a bouncing cosmology by considering the backreaction of the winding condensate on a 1+1 dimensional cosmological model with a periodic spatial coordinate. I based my work on previous results that considered the backreaction of the winding condensate on a 1+1 dimensional Euclidean black hole. This cosmological model is obtained as an analytic continuation of a Euclidean black hole. I solved the equations and obtained non-singular solutions at near-Hagedorn temperatures, both numerically and analytically. To remain within the weak coupling regime, it is necessary to connect two solutions; otherwise, the dilaton, which determines the string coupling, would grow quadratically. This connection is achieved through a smooth coordinate transformation, ensuring the model's validity. As a result, the model becomes geodesically complete and non-singular. The connection is made at a time in which the curvature is small, thereby avoiding higher-order $\alpha'$ corrections.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we develop a systematic analysis of the properties of entanglement entropy in curved backgrounds using the replica approach. We explore the analytic $(q-1)$ expansion of R\'enyi entropy $S_q$ and its variations; our setup applies to generic variations, from symmetry transformations to variations of the background metric or entangling region. Our methodology elegantly reproduces and generalises results from the literature on entanglement entropy in different dimensions, backgrounds, and states. We use our analytic expansions to explore the behaviour of entanglement entropy in static black hole backgrounds under specific scaling transformations, and we explain why this behaviour is key to determining whether there are islands of entanglement.</description>

Abstract: We investigate time delays of gravitational wave and scalar wave scatterings around black hole backgrounds in scalar-Gauss-Bonnet effective field theories of gravity. By requiring infrared causality, we impose a lower bound on the cutoff scale of the theories. With this bound, we further discuss the detectability of scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity in gravitational waves from binary black hole mergers. Comparing with the gravitational effective field theories that only contain the two tensor modes, adding a scalar degree of freedom opens up a detectable window in the planned observations.</description>

      <title>The Feyn-Structure of Yangian Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11936v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Yangian-type differential operators are shown to constrain Feynman integrals beyond the restriction to integrable graphs. In particular, we prove that all position-space Feynman diagrams at tree level feature a Yangian level-one momentum symmetry as long as their external coordinates are distinct. This symmetry is traced back to a set of more elementary bilocal operators, which annihilate the integrals. In dual momentum space, the considered Feynman graphs represent multi-loop integrals without `loops of loops', generalizing for instance the family of so-called train track or train track network diagrams. The extension of these results to integrals with massive propagators on the boundary of the Feynman graph is established. When specializing to the dual conformal case, where propagator powers sum up to the spacetime dimension at each position-space vertex, the symmetry extends to the full dual conformal Yangian. Hence, our findings represent a generalization of the statements on the Yangian symmetry of Feynman integrals beyond integrability and reveal its origin lying in a set of more elementary bilocal annihilators. Previous applications of the Yangian suggest to employ the resulting differential equations for bootstrapping multi-loop integrals beyond the dual conformal case. The considered bilocal constraints on Feynman integrals resemble the definition of conformal partial waves via Casimir operators, but are based on a different algebraic structure.</description>

Abstract: Integrating out supersymmetric M2 branes wrapped on two-cycles in Calabi-Yau manifolds is an important calculation: it allows the determination of, and in some ways defines, the free energy of topological strings. In these notes, based on a short course aimed at graduate students, we go through various aspects of this calculation in detail. The end result is a recently proposed new formula for the topological string free energy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19418v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We calculate the false-vacuum decay rate in one-dimensional quantum mechanics on the basis of the saddle-point approximation in the Euclidean path integral at finite temperature. The saddle points are the finite-T and shifted bounce solutions, which are finite-period analogs of the (zero-temperature) bounce solution, and the shot solutions. We re-examined the zero-temperature result by Callan and Coleman and compare with the zero-temperature limit of our results. We also perform some numerical calculations to illustrate the temperature dependence of the decay rate and compare it with the result by Affleck.</description>

      <title>Quantum gravity with purely virtual particles from asymptotically local quantum field theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21599v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the local limits of various classes of unitary, nonlocal quantum field theories. While it is easy to build nonlocal models with well-behaved asymptotics in Euclidean space, the Minkowskian correlation functions typically exhibit singular behaviors. We introduce "asymptotically local" quantum field theory (AL-QFT) as the class that encompasses unitary, nonlocal theories with well-defined local limits in Minkowski spacetime. The target models cannot propagate ghosts, but are allowed to contain purely virtual particles (PVPs). In the bubble diagram, the nonlocal deformation generates PVPs straightforwardly. In the triangle diagram, it does so possibly up to multi-threshold corrections, which may be adjusted by tuning the deformation itself. We build examples of AL-QFTs, including a deformation of quantum gravity with purely virtual particles. AL-QFT can serve various purposes, such as suggesting innovative approaches to off-shell physics, providing an alternative formulation for theories with PVPs, or smoothing out nonanalytic behaviors. We discuss its inherent arbitrariness and the implications for renormalizability.</description>

Abstract: Finite real spectral triples are defined to characterise the non-commutative geometry of a fuzzy torus. The geometries are the non-commutative analogues of flat tori with moduli determined by integer parameters. Each of these geometries has four different Dirac operators, corresponding to the four unique spin structures on a torus. The spectrum of the Dirac operator is calculated. It is given by replacing integers with their quantum integer analogues in the spectrum of the corresponding commutative torus.</description>

Abstract: In a recent paper, with Drago and Pinamonti we have introduced a Wetterich-type flow equation for scalar fields on Lorentzian manifolds, using the algebraic approach to perturbative QFT. The equation governs the flow of the effective average action, under changes of a mass parameter k. Here we introduce an analogous flow equation for gauge theories, with the aid of the Batalin-Vilkovisky (BV) formalism. We also show that the corresponding effective average action satisfies a Slavnov-Taylor identity in Zinn-Justin form. We interpret the equation as a cohomological constraint on the functional form of the effective average action, and we show that it is consistent with the flow.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01087v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strongly coupled gauge theories provide an ultra-violet realization of new physics models for physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics arising from composite dynamics. Depending on the gauge group and matter content, they are expected to exhibit interesting features and rich phenomenology, similar or dissimilar to QCD, of which model builders and phenomenologists can take advantage. Due to the non-perturbative nature of these theories, first principles lattice calculations are essential to test the validity of composite models and provide theoretical inputs, that are otherwise unattainable, to the experimental searches for new physics. In this contribution, we will review recent efforts in the non-perturbative lattice studies of strongly coupled gauge theories other than QCD in the context of physics beyond the Standard Model by focusing on technical developments and new results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09234v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The infrared problems of quantum electrodynamics, in contrast to ultraviolet difficulties which are of technical nature, are related to fundamental, conceptual physical questions, such as: what is a charged particle, is the particle interpretation of the electromagnetic field complete, does a vacuum state exist, or what is the quantum status of long range degrees of freedom. On the calculational level, the standard local formulations of quantum field theory have achieved procedures to deal with infinities related to long range correlations. However, the answers to the conceptual questions formulated above, based on the locality paradigm, do not seem to be fully convincing, which is confirmed by the fact that no canonical picture did emerge. This contribution briefly characterizes perspectives which open with an admission of nonlocal variables residing in infinity, or at the boundary of spacetime after compactification. Recently, this line of investigation gains popularity.</description>

Abstract: We construct a (quantum mechanically) modified model for the Oppenheimer-Snyder collapse scenario where the exterior of the collapsing dust ball is a Hayward black hole spacetime and the interior is a dust Friedmann-Robertson-Walker cosmology. This interior cosmology is entirely determined by the junction conditions with the exterior black hole. It turns out to be non-singular, displaying a power-law contraction which precedes a de Sitter phase or, reversely, a power-law expansion followed by a de Sitter era. We also analyse the global causal structure and the viability of the model.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the properties of accretion flows around the Konoplya-Zhidenko (KZ) black hole, which is proposed by deforming the Kerr metric with a single deformation parameter to test the no-hair theorem using gravitational wave observations. The dynamical equations describing the general relativistic viscous accreting flow are solved self-consistently to find the transonic accretion solutions in terms of global constants, such as energy ($E$), angular momentum ($\mathcal{L}$), viscosity parameter ($\alpha$), spin ($a_{k}$), and deformation parameter ($\eta_0$). We obtain five distinct types of accretion solutions (O, A, $\text{A}^{\prime}$, W, and I-types), and observe that those solutions are not unique but rather continue to exist for wide range of parameter spaces in the $\mathcal{L}-E$ plane. Furthermore, we find that the viscous accretion flows can harbor shock waves when the relativistic shock conditions are satisfied. Consequently, the shock-induced global accretion solutions are obtained, and the effect of $\eta_0$ on shock properties, such as shock radius ($r_{\rm sh}$) and change in electron temperature ($T_{\rm e}$) across the shock front are investigated. Moreover, we calculate the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of accretion flow using the relativistic thermal bremsstrahlung emission coefficient and study the modification of SEDs due to the increase of $\eta_0$ for both shock-induced and shock-free solutions. In addition, it has been noticed that the observable quantities, like quasi-periodic oscillation frequency ($\nu_{\rm QPO}$) and bolometric disc luminosity ($L$), are strongly dependent on $\eta_0$. Finally, we phenomenologically show that the KZ black hole is consistent with the high-frequency QPOs, commonly observed in black hole binaries and black hole candidates.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Bootstrap</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00810v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a semidefinite relaxation method called Hamiltonian bootstrap which finds lower bounds to the ground state energy of a quantum Hamiltonian subject to Hermitian linear constraints, along with approximations of the corresponding ground state correlation functions. We show that symmetry can be used to significantly reduce both the memory and time requirements, and we include unitary, antiunitary, discrete, and continuous symmetries in our analysis. We demonstrate Hamiltonian bootstrap using the 1D Hubbard model and find quantitative agreement with both exact diagonalization and the Bethe ansatz.</description>

      <title>Invisible Higgs decay from dark matter freeze-in at stronger coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21874v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Higgs boson decay into dark matter (DM) in the framework of freeze-in at stronger coupling. Even though the Higgs-DM coupling is significant, up to order one, DM does not thermalize due to the Boltzmann suppression of its production at low temperatures. We find that this mechanism leads to observable Higgs decay into invisible final states with the branching fraction of 10% and below, while producing the correct DM relic abundance. This applies to the DM masses down to the MeV scale, which requires a careful treatment of the hadronic production modes. For DM masses below the muon threshold, the Boltzmann suppression is not operative and the freeze-in nature of the production mechanism is instead guaranteed by the smallness of the electron Yukawa coupling. As a result, MeV DM with a significant coupling to the Higgs boson remains non-thermal as long as the reheating temperature does not exceed $\mathcal{O}(100)\;$MeV. Our findings indicate that there are good prospects for observing light non-thermal DM via invisible Higgs decay at the LHC and FCC.</description>
