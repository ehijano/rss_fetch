      <title>On novel Hamiltonian descriptions of some three-dimensional non-conservative systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present novel Hamiltonian descriptions of some three-dimensional systems including two well-known systems describing the three-wave-interaction problem and some well-known chaotic systems, namely, the Chen, L\"u, and Qi systems. We show that all of these systems can be described in a Hamiltonian framework in which the Poisson matrix $\mathcal{J}$ is supplemented by a resistance matrix $\mathcal{R}$. While such resistive-Hamiltonian systems are manifestly non-conservative, we construct higher-degree Poisson matrices via the Jordan product as $\mathcal{N} = \mathcal{J} \mathcal{R} + \mathcal{R} \mathcal{J}$, thereby leading to new bi-Hamiltonian systems. Finally, we discuss conformal Hamiltonian dynamics on Poisson manifolds and demonstrate that by appropriately choosing the underlying parameters, the reduced three-wave-interaction model as well as the Chen and L\"u systems can be described in this manner where the concomitant non-conservative part of the dynamics is described with the aid of the Euler vector field.</description>

      <title>Random matrix ensembles and integrable differential identities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrable differential identities, together with ensemble-specific initial conditions, provide an effective approach for the characterisation of relevant observables and state functions in random matrix theory. We develop the approach for the unitary and orthogonal ensembles. In particular, we focus on a reduction where the probability measure is induced by a Hamiltonian expressed as a formal series of even interactions. We show that the order parameters for the unitary ensemble, that is associated with the Volterra lattice, solve the modified KP equation. The analogous reduction for the orthogonal ensemble, associated with the Pfaff lattice, leads to a new integrable chain. A key step for the calculation of order parameters solution for the orthogonal ensemble is the evaluation of the initial condition by using a map from orthogonal to skew-orthogonal polynomials. The thermodynamic limit leads to an integrable system (a chain for the orthogonal ensemble) of hydrodynamic type. Intriguingly, we find that the solution to the initial value problem for both the discrete system and its continuum limit are given by the very same semi-discrete dynamical chain.</description>

      <title>Symmetric Sextic Freud Weight</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08522v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the properties of the sequence of coefficients $(\b_n)_{n\geq0}$ in the recurrence relation satisfied by the sequence of monic symmetric polynomials, orthogonal with respect to the symmetric sextic Freud weight $$\omega(x; \tau, t) = \exp(-x^6 + \tau x^4 + t x^2), \qquad x \in \mathbb{R}, $$ with real parameters $\tau$ and $t$. We derive a fourth-order nonlinear discrete equation satisfied by $\beta_n$, which is shown to be a special case of {the second} member of the discrete Painlev\'{e} I hierarchy. Further, we analyse differential and differential-difference equations satisfied by the recurrence coefficients. The emphasis is to offer a comprehensive study of the intricate evolution in the behaviour of these recurrence coefficients as the pair of parameters $(\tau,t)$ change. A comprehensive numerical and computational analysis is carried out for critical parameter ranges, and graphical plots are presented to illustrate the behaviour of the recurrence coefficients as well as the complexity of the associated Volterra lattice hierarchy. The corresponding symmetric sextic Freud polynomials are shown to satisfy a second-order differential equation with rational coefficients. The moments of the weight are examined in detail, including their integral representations, differential equations, and recursive structure. Closed-form expressions for moments are obtained in several special cases, and asymptotic expansions for the recurrence coefficients are provided. The results highlight rich algebraic and analytic structures underlying the symmetric sextic Freud weight and its connections to integrable systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum integrable model for the quantum cohomology/K-theory of flag varieties and the double $\beta$-Grothendieck polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03768v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A GL$(n)$ quantum integrable system generalizing the asymmetric five vertex spin chain is shown to encode the ring relations of the equivariant quantum cohomology and equivariant quantum K-theory ring of flag varieties. We also show that the Bethe ansatz states of this system generate the double $\beta$-Grothendieck polynomials.</description>
