      <title>Operators on Hilbert Space having $\Gamma_{E(3; 3; 1, 1, 1)}$ and $\Gamma_{E(3; 2; 1, 2)}$ as Spectral Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A $7$-tuple of commuting bounded operators $\textbf{T} = (T_1, \dots, T_7)$ on a Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$ is called a \textit{$\Gamma_{E(3; 3; 1, 1, 1)} $-contraction} if $\Gamma_{E(3; 3; 1, 1, 1)}$ is a spectral set for $\textbf{T}. $ Let $(S_1, S_2, S_3)$ and $(\tilde{S}_1, \tilde{S}_2)$ be tuples of commuting bounded operators defined on a Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$ with $S_i\tilde{S}_j = \tilde{S}_jS_i$ for $1 \leqslant i \leqslant 3$ and $1 \leqslant j \leqslant 2$. We say that $\textbf{S} = (S_1, S_2, S_3, \tilde{S}_1, \tilde{S}_2)$ is a $\Gamma_{E(3; 2; 1, 2)} $-contraction if $ \Gamma_{E(3; 2; 1, 2)}$ is a spectral set for $\textbf{S}$. We derive various properties of $\Gamma_{E(3; 3; 1, 1, 1)}$-contractions and $\Gamma_{E(3; 2; 1, 2)}$-contractions and establish a relationship between them. We discuss the fundamental equations for $\Gamma_{E(3; 3; 1, 1,1 )}$-contractions and $\Gamma_{E(3; 2; 1, 2)}$-contractions. We explore the structure of $\Gamma_{E(3; 3; 1, 1, 1)}$-unitaries and $\Gamma_{E(3; 2; 1, 2)}$-unitaries and elaborate on the relationship between them. We also study various properties of $\Gamma_{E(3; 3; 1, 1, 1)}$-isometries and $\Gamma_{E(3; 2; 1, 2)}$-isometries. We discuss the Wold Decomposition for a $\Gamma_{E(3; 3; 1, 1, 1)}$-isometry and a $\Gamma_{E(3; 2; 1, 2)}$-isometry. We further outline the structure theorem for a pure $\Gamma_{E(3; 3; 1, 1, 1)}$-isometry and a pure $\Gamma_{E(3; 2; 1, 2)}$-isometry.</description>

      <title>Shortcut Laakso spaces, pure PI unrectifiability and differentiability of Lipschitz functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a family of purely PI unrectifiable Lipschitz differentiability spaces and investigate the possible of Banach spaces targets for which Lipschitz differentiability holds. We provide a general investigation into the geometry of \emph{shortcut} metric spaces and characterise when such spaces are PI rectifiable, and when they are $Y$-LDS, for a given $Y$. The family of spaces arises as an example of our characterisations. Indeed, we show that Laakso spaces satisfy the required hypotheses.</description>

      <title>Exactness and LLP Results via Operator System Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we employ operator system techniques to investigate structural properties of C*-algebras. In particular, we provide more direct proofs of results concerning exactness and the local lifting property (LLP) of group C$^*$-algebras that avoid relying on the traditional heavy machinery of C$^*$-algebra theory. Briefly, these methods allow us to deduce that any C*-algebra containing $n$ unitaries whose $\textit{ joint numerical radius}$, in the sense defined by \cite{FKP}, is strictly less than $n$, must fail certain of these properties.</description>

      <title>On the Rate of Convergence of Iterative Methods for Nonexpansive Mappings in CAT(0) Spaces and Hyperbolic Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Krasnosel'ski\u{\i} Mann and Halpern iterations are classical schemes for approximating fixed points of nonexpansive mappings in Banach spaces, and have been widely studied in more general frameworks such as $CAT(\kappa)$ and, more generally, geodesic spaces. Convergence results and convergence rate estimates in these nonlinear settings are already well established. The contribution of this paper is to extend to complete $CAT(0)$ spaces the proof techniques originally developed in the linear setting of Banach and Hilbert spaces, thereby recovering the same asymptotic regularity bounds and to introduce a novel optimizer for Hyperbolic Deep learning based on Halpern Iteration similarly to HalpernSGD \cite{foglia2024halpernsgd,colao2025optimizer} in Euclidean setting.</description>

      <title>A Low-Rank Symplectic Gradient Adjustment Method for Computing Nash Equilibria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a theoretical and numerical investigation of the symplectic gradient adjustment (SGA) method and of a low-rank SGA (LRSGA) method for efficiently solving two-objective optimization problems in the framework of Nash games. The SGA method outperforms the gradient method by including second-order mixed derivatives computed at each iterate, which requires considerably larger computational effort. For this reason, a LRSGA method is proposed where the approximation to second-order mixed derivatives are obtained by rank-one updates. The theoretical analysis presented in this work focuses on novel convergence estimates for the SGA and LRSGA methods, including parameter bounds. The superior computational complexity of the LRSGA method is demonstrated in the training of a CLIP neural architecture, where the LRSGA method outperforms the SGA method by orders of magnitude smaller CPU time.</description>

      <title>An almost-almost-Schur lemma on the 3-sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a recent preprint, Frank and the second author proved that if a metric on the sphere of dimension $d&gt;4$ almost minimizes the total $\sigma_2$-curvature in the conformal class of the standard metric, then it is almost the standard metric (up to M\"obius transformations). This is achieved quantitatively in terms of a two-term distance to the set of minimizing conformal factors. We extend this result to the case $d=3$. While the standard metric still minimizes the total scalar curvature for $d=3$, it maximizes the total $\sigma_2$-curvature, which turns the related functional inequality into a reverse Sobolev-type inequality. As a corollary of our result, we obtain quantitative versions for a family of interpolation inequalities including the Andrews--De Lellis--Topping inequality on the $3$-sphere. The latter is itself a stability result for the well-known Schur lemma and is therefore called almost-Schur lemma. This makes our stability result an almost-almost-Schur lemma.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01279v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a nonempty finite subset of the Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^k$ $(k\ge 2)$. We prove that if a function $f\colon \mathbb{R}^k\to \mathbb{C}$ is such that the sum of $f$ on every congruent copy of $K$ is zero, then $f$ vanishes everywhere. In fact, a stronger, weighted version is proved. As a corollary we find that every finite subset $K$ of $\mathbb{R}^k$ having at least two elements is a Jackson set; that is, no subset of $\mathbb{R}^k$ intersects every congruent copy of $K$ in exactly one point.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15985v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a variety of applications, the problem comes up of describing the principal part of the inverse of a holomorphic operator at an eigenvalue in terms of left and right root functions associated to the eigenvalue. Such a description was given by Keldysh in 1951. His theorem, the proof of which was published only in 1971, is a fundamental result in the local spectral theory of operator-valued functions. Here we present a streamlined derivation in the matrix case, and we extend Keldysh's theorem by means of a new principal part formula. Special attention is given to the semisimple case (first-order poles).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11018v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a simple alternative proof of Royen's Gaussian Correlation inequality by using (a slightly generalized version of) Nakamura-Tsuji's symmetric inverse Brascamp-Lieb inequality for even log-concave functions. We explain that this inverse inequality is in a certain sense a dual counterpart to the forward inequality of Bennett-Carbery-Christ-Tao and Valdimarsson, and that the log-concavity assumption therein cannot be omitted in general.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06529v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the concept of disjoint topological transitivity for supercyclicity, in this paper, we introduce the concept of disjoint Furstenberg-semi-transitivity. Then we provide sufficient conditions for cosine operator functions generated by adjoints of weighted composition operators to be Furstenberg-semi-transitive on the space of Radon measures on a locally compact, non-compact Hausdorff space. Also, we characterize disjoint Furstenberg-semi-transitive generalized bilateral weighted shifts on the standard Hilbert module over the C*-algebra of compact operators on a separable Hilbert space. As a special case, we consider the case when the corresponding Furstenberg family under consideration is the family of all infinite subsets of the set of natural numbers. Finally, we illustrate our results with concrete examples.</description>

      <title>Stability results of the Bishop-Phelps-Bollob\'as property and the generalized AHSP</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17762v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the Bishop-Phelps-Bollob\'as property for operators (BPBp for short). To this end, we investigate the generalized approximate hyperplane series property (generalized AHSP for short) for a pair $(X,Y)$ of Banach spaces, which characterizes when $(\ell_1(X),Y)$ has the BPBp. We prove the following results. For a locally compact Hausdorff space $L$, if $(X, \mathcal{C}_0(L,Y))$ has the BPBp, then so does $(X,Y)$. Furthermore, if the pair $(X, Y)$ has the generalized AHSP and $\mathcal{L}(X,Z) = \mathcal{K}(X,Z)$, then the pair $(X, Z)$ also has the generalized AHSP, where $Z$ is one of the spaces $\mathcal{C}(K, Y)$, $\mathcal{C}_0(L, Y)$, or $\mathcal{C}_b(\Omega, Y)$, with $K$ a compact Hausdorff space and $\Omega$ a completely regular space.</description>

      <title>A new complete proof of the random Brouwer fixed point theorem and its implied consequences of unification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08521v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We first establish a general random Sperner lemma by presenting a completely new approach for the theory of $L^{0}$-simplicial subdivisions of $L^{0}$-simplexes. Based on this, we are able to achieve a new complete proof of the random Brouwer fixed theorem in random Euclidean spaces, which can provide a solid foundation for various contemporary applications of interest. Afterward, we unify the works currently available and closely related to the random Brouwer fixed theorem: we first prove that the stochastic Brouwer fixed point theorem occurring elsewhere in stochastic analysis is equivalent to a special case of our random Brouwer fixed theorem, and then prove a general random Borsuk theorem and its equivalence with the random Brouwer fixed theorem. Finally, we conclude this paper with commentaries on recent state of study of the famous Schauder conjecture.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Reverse Isoperimetric Inequalities for Log-concave Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05712v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Rogers-Shephard and Zhang's projection inequalities are two reverse, affine isoperimetric-type inequalities for convex bodies. Following a classical work by Schneider, both inequalities have been extended to the so-called $m$th-order setting. In this work, we establish the $m$th-order analogues for these inequalities in the setting of log-concave functions. Our proof of the functional Zhang's projection inequality employs properties of the asymmetric LYZ body, significantly streamlining the argument and producing a novel approach for the case $m=1$. Furthermore, we introduce and analyze the radial mean bodies of a log-concave function, thereby providing a functional generalization of Gardner and Zhang's radial mean bodies. These are new even in the case $m=1$. Our development leverages an extension of Ball bodies, which may be of independent interest.</description>
