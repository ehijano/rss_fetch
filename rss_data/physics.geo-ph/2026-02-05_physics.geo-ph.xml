      <title>Backend-agnostic Julia framework for 3D modeling and inversion of gravity data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a high-performance framework for three-dimensional gravity modeling and inversion implemented in Julia, addressing key challenges in geophysical modeling such as computational complexity, ill-posedness, and the non-uniqueness inherent to gravity inversion. The framework adopts a data-space inversion formulation to reduce the dimensionality of the problem, leading to significantly lower memory requirements and improved computational efficiency while maintaining inversion accuracy. Forward modeling and inversion operators are implemented within a backend-agnostic kernel abstraction, enabling execution on both multicore CPUs and GPU accelerators from a single code base. Performance analyses conducted on NVIDIA CUDA GPUs demonstrate substantial reductions in runtime relative to CPU execution, particularly for large-scale datasets involving up to approximately 3.3 million rectangular prisms, highlighting the scalability of the proposed approach. The inversion incorporates implicit model constraints through the data-space formulation and depth-weighted sensitivity, which mitigate depth-related amplitude decay and yield geologically coherent, high-resolution subsurface density models. Validation using synthetic models confirms the ability of the framework to accurately reconstruct complex subsurface structures such as vertical and dipping dykes. Application to field gravity data further demonstrates the robustness and practical utility of the GPU-accelerated framework, with the recovered models showing strong consistency with independent geological constraints and prior interpretations. Overall, this work underscores the potential of GPU-enabled computing in Julia to transform large-scale gravity inversion workflows, providing an efficient, extensible, and accurate computational solution for high-resolution geophysical studies.</description>

      <title>Correcting exponentiality test for binned earthquake magnitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13599v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Above the magnitude of completeness - the minimum threshold for which a 100\% detection rate is assumed - earthquake magnitudes are typically modeled as a continuous exponential distribution. In practice, however, earthquake catalogs report magnitudes with finite resolution, resulting in a discrete (geometric) distribution. To determine the magnitude of completeness, the Lilliefors test is commonly applied. Because this test assumes continuous data, it is standard practice to add uniform noise to binned magnitudes prior to testing exponentiality.
  Here we show analytically that uniform dithering does not recover the underlying continuous exponential distribution from its discretized (geometric) form. It instead returns a piecewise-constant residual lifetime distribution, whose deviation from the exponential model becomes detectable as catalog size or bin width increases. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate that this deviation yields a systematic overestimation of the magnitude of completeness, with biases exceeding one magnitude unit in large, high-resolution catalogs.
  We derive the exact noise distribution - a truncated exponential within each magnitude bin - that correctly restores the continuous exponential distribution over the whole magnitude range. Numerical tests show that this correction yields Lilliefors rejection probabilities that are consistent with the significance level across a wide range of bin widths and catalog sizes. Although illustrated for the Lilliefors test, the identified bias and the proposed correction are independent of the specific statistical test and apply generally to exponentiality testing of discretized magnitude data.</description>

      <title>CoolPath Tool: A Thermal Comfort Path Planning Tool for Urban Mobility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02540v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extreme heat poses a growing challenge for active transportation in cities where conventional weather reporting (e.g. limited air temperature measurement for the whole city) fails to capture the large microclimate variations that pedestrians and cyclists experience. We present a novel walking and biking route planning tool (''CoolPath Tool'') that selects paths based on thermal comfort using the Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) rather than just distance or travel time. This system combines high-resolution thermal modeling with real-time route mapping. We generate city-scale UTCI maps using GPU version of Solar and LongWave Environmental Irradiance Geometry (SOLWEIG) model, to account for urban features (buildings, trees,) and weather conditions. The urban features are pre-mapped using satellite data products and the routes are the roadways. For any given origin and destination, our tool calculates the average UTCI along each possible route and recommends the ''coolest'' route, i.e. the path with the lowest heat stress (often the most shaded or otherwise thermally comfortable), while still being reasonably direct. We demonstrate this in a case study for Austin, Texas. The approach identifies routes that significantly reduce pedestrians' heat exposure (often recommending routes with a much larger proportion of shade). Such thermally-informed route planning has important public well-being, and economic implications: by helping people avoid dangerous heat hotspots and sun-exposed areas, it can reduce the risk of heat-related illness and make walking or biking a safer choice even on hot days. This tool is part of the Austin Digital Twin efforts developed as part the UT-City CoLab needs. The work while demonstrated for Austin, TX is scalable, and transferrable to other cities globally.</description>
