      <title>An Approach to Use Depletion Charges for Modifying Band Profiles for Field-Effect Transistors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the study of using depletion charges for tailoring lateral band profiles and applying it to the promising gate-all-around field-effect transistors (GAAFET). Specifically, we introduce heavily p-type doped Si next to the channel, but outside the channel, of a transistor. They are connected to the heavily n-type doped source and drain for generating the depletion charges. The finite difference method was used for simulations and the results show significant modifications of the conduction band along the channel. The depletion charges act as built-in electrodes capable of significantly modifying the band profiles of field-effect transistors. Quantum confinement within the channel has been attempted with different approaches, such as additional electrodes and point contacts. The results presented show two aspects of this approach, namely, realizing quantum confinement in an all-Si structure and tailoring band profiles within channels to modify their transport properties.</description>

      <title>Selective enhancement of Coulomb interactions in planar Weyl fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on our study of the electron interaction effects in topological two-dimensional (2D) materials placed in a quantizing magnetic field. Taking our cue from a recent experimental report, we consider a particular case of bismuthene monolayer with a strong spin-orbit interaction which can be a Weyl semimetal when placed on a specially tuned substrate. Interestingly, we observe that in some Landau levels of this material, the interaction effects are strongly enhanced compared to those for a conventional 2D system. Such an enhancement of electron-electron interactions in these materials is largely due to an anisotropy present in the materials. Additionally, the interaction effects can be tuned by changing the coupling to the substrate and the strongest inter-electron interactions are observed when the system is a Weyl semimental. The observed enhancement of the interaction effects can therefore be an important signature of the 2D Weyl fermions.</description>

      <title>Topolectrical space-time circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topolectrical circuits have emerged as a pivotal platform for realizing static topological states that are challenging to construct in other systems, facilitating the design of robust circuit devices. In addition to spatial dimensionality, synergistic engineering of both temporal and spatial degrees in circuit networks holds tremendous potential across diverse technologies, such as wireless communications, non-reciprocal electronics and dynamic signal controls with exotic space-time topology. However, the realization of space-time modulated circuit networks is still lacking due to the necessity for flexible modulation of node connections in both spatial and temporal domains. Here, we propose a new class of topolectrical circuits, referred to as topolectrical space-time circuits, to bridge this gap. By designing and applying a novel time-varying circuit element controlled by external voltages, we can construct circuit networks exhibiting discrete space-time translational symmetries in any dimensionality, where the circuit dynamical equation is in the same form with time-dependent Schrodinger equation. Through the implementation of topolectrical space-time circuits, three distinct types of topological space-time crystals are experimentally demonstrated, including the (1+1)-dimensional topological space-time crystal with midgap edge modes, (2+1)-dimensional topological space-time crystal with chiral edge states, and (3+1)-dimensional Weyl space-time semimetals. Our work establishes a solid foundation for the exploration of intricate space-time topological phenomena and holds potential applications in the field of dynamically manipulating electronic signals with unique space-time topology</description>

      <title>Enhancing Unconventional Spin-Orbit Torque Efficiency: First Numerical Study on the Influence of Crystallographic Texture and Polycrystalline Effects on Low-Symmetry Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-orbit torque (SOT) has been extensively studied as a key mechanism in spintronics applications. However, conventional SOT materials limit the spin polarization direction to the in-plane orientation, which is suboptimal for efficient magnetization switching. Recently, spins currents with spin polarization along multiple directions have been observed in low-symmetry materials, offering a promising energy-efficient strategy for the field-free switching of magnetic materials with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. However, the efficiency of this mechanism is highly dependent on the crystallographic texture of the SOT materials, a critical factor that, to date, has not been quantitatively investigated. In this study, we present the first comprehensive numerical investigation into the impact of both in-plane and out-of-plane crystallographic textures of SOT materials on the unconventional SOT generated by Dresselhaus-like and out-of-plane spin polarizations. By employing a theoretical orientation distribution function, we calculate the effective unconventional SOT values for SOT materials with tunable crystallographic texture. This analysis provides a framework for the synthesis and optimization of future low-symmetry SOT materials for the first time, which can enhance operational efficiency for spintronics applications in magnetoresistive random-access memory and spin logic devices.</description>

      <title>Probing $k$-Space Alternating Spin Polarization via the Anomalous Hall Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets represent a recently discovered class of collinear magnets, characterized by antiparallel neighboring magnetic moments and alternating-sign spin polarization in momentum-space($k$-space). However, experimental methods for probing the $k$-space spin polarization in altermagnets remain limited. In this work, we propose an approach to address this challenge by interfacing an altermagnet with the surface of a topological insulator. The massless Dirac fermions on the topological insulator surface acquire a mass due to the time-reversal symmetry breaking. The local $k$-space magnetic moment at the Dirac point directly determines both the sign and magnitude of this Dirac mass, resulting in an anomalous Hall effect. By measuring the Hall conductance, we can extract the local $k$-space magnetic moment. Moreover, we can map the global magnetic moment distribution by tuning the Dirac point position using an in-plane magnetic field, thereby revealing the $k$-space spin density of the altermagnet. This work establishes the Dirac fermion on the topological insulator surface as a sensitive probe for unveiling spin characters of altermagnets and those of other unconventional antiferromagnets.</description>

      <title>Natural and Intrinsic Vacancies in two-dimensional g-C$_3$N$_4$ for Trapping Isolated B and C Atoms as Color Centers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Color centers are vital for quantum information processing, but traditional ones often suffer from instability, difficulty in realization, and precise control of locations. In contrast, natural intrinsic vacancy-based color centers in two-dimensional systems offer enhanced stability and tunability. In this work, we demonstrate that g-C$_3$N$_4$ with natural intrinsic vacancies is highly suitable for trapping B/C atoms to form stable color centers as qubits. With easily identifiable vacancies, B/C atoms are expectable to be placed at the vacancy sites in g-C$_3$N$_4$ through STM manipulation. The vacancy sites are confirmed as the most stable adsorption positions, and once atoms are adsorbed, they are protected by diffusion barriers from thermal diffusions. The most stable charge states are C$_V^{+2}$/B$_V^{+2}$, C$_V^{+1}$/B$_V^{+1}$, and C$_V^0$/B$_V^0$ in turn, with charge transition levels of 0.39 eV and 2.49 eV, respectively. Specifically, the defect levels and net spin of C$_V$/B$_V$ can be adjusted by charge states. C$_V$, C$_V^{+1}$, C$_V^{+2}$, B$_V^{+1}$, and B$_V^{+2}$ exhibit optically allowable defect transition levels. The zero-phonon lines suggest fluorescence wavelengths fall within the mid-infrared band, ideal for qubit operations of stable initialization and readout. Furthermore, the Zero-field splitting (ZFS) parameter and the characteristic hyperfine tensor are provided as potential fingerprints for electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) experiments.</description>

      <title>Crowding Effects during DNA Translocation in Nanopipettes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quartz nanopipettes are an important emerging class of electric single-molecule sensors for DNA, proteins, their complexes as well as other biomolecular targets. However, in comparison to other resistive pulse sensors, nanopipettes constitute a highly asymmetric environment and the transport of ions and biopolymers can become strongly direction-dependent. For double-stranded DNA, this can include the characteristic translocation time and its tertiary structure, but as we show here, nanoconfinement can not only lead to unexplored features in the transport characteristics of the sensor, but also unlock new capabilities for biophysical and bioanalytical studies at the single-molecule level. To this end, we show how the accummulation of DNA inside the nanochannel leads to crowding effects, and in some cases reversible blocking of DNA entry, and provide a detailed analysis based on a range of different DNA samples and experimental conditions. Moreover, using biotin-functionalised DNA and streptavidin-modified gold nanoparticles as target, we demonstrate in a proof-of-concept study how the crowding effect, and the resulting increased residence time in nanochannel, can be exploited in a new analytical paradigm, involving DNA injection into the nanochannel, incubation with the nanoparticle target and analysis of the complex by reverse translocation. We thereby integrate elements of sample processing and detection into the nanopipette, as an important conceptual advance, and make a case for the wider applicability of this device concept.</description>

      <title>Bipartite Current Fluctuations in Quantum Wires through Charge Fractionalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum information measures of many-body systems often imply a measure with multi- or two regions such as bipartite charge fluctuations within the ground state revealing the logarithmic profile of the entanglement entropy in a quantum wire. Here, we introduce a new method from the bipartite current fluctuations and the divergence theorem. They reveal the fractional charges related to ground-state energetics and the proximity to Mott physics in the same ballistic quantum wires. This also encodes the behavior of the electron Green's function in space. With metallic gates on both sides of an interface to implement the protocol introducing the two macroscopic domains, bipartite current fluctuations can reveal an additional localized bound state associated to the topological Jackiw-Rebbi model, coexisting with the fractional charges. Through the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) algorithm we introduce a quantum spin chain analogue.</description>

      <title>Electrically-tunable graphene nanomechanical resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The excellent mechanical properties make graphene promising for realizing nanomechanical resonators with high resonant frequencies, large quality factors, strong nonlinearities, and the capability to effectively interface with various physical systems. Equipped with gate electrodes, it has been demonstrated that these exceptional device properties can be electrically manipulated, leading to a variety of nanomechanical/acoustic applications. Here, we review the recent progress of graphene nanomechanical resonators with a focus on their electrical tunability. First, we provide an overview of different graphene nanomechanical resonators, including their device structures, fabrication methods, and measurement setups. Then, the key mechanical properties of these devices, for example, resonant frequencies, nonlinearities, dissipations, and mode coupling mechanisms, are discussed, with their behaviors upon electrical gating being highlighted. After that, various potential classical/quantum applications based on these graphene nanomechanical resonators are reviewed. Finally, we briefly discuss challenges and opportunities in this field to offer future prospects of the ongoing studies on graphene nanomechanical resonators.</description>

      <title>Chern Vector Protected Three-dimensional Quantized Hall Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Chern vector with arbitrary formula $\textbf{C}\!=\!(\mathcal{C}_{yz},\mathcal{C}_{xz},\mathcal{C}_{xy})$ in three-dimensional systems has been experimentally realized [\B{Nature 609, 925 (2022)}]. Motivated by these progresses, we propose the Chern vector $\textbf{C}\!=\!(0,m,n)$-protected quantized Hall effect in three-dimensional systems. By examining samples with Chern vector $\textbf{C}\!=\!(0,m,n)$ and dimensions $L_y$ and $L_z$ along the $y$- and $z$-directions, we demonstrate a topologically protected two-terminal response. This response can be reformulated as the sum of the transmission coefficients along the $x$- and $y$-directions, given by $(mL_y\!+\!nL_z)$. When applied to Hall bar setups, this topological mechanism gives rise to quantized Hall conductances, such as \(G_{xy}\) and \(G_{xz}\), which are expressed by $\pm(mL_y\!+\!nL_z)$. These Hall conductances exhibit a clear dependency on sample dimensions, illuminating the intrinsic three-dimensional nature. Finally, we propse potential candidates for experimental realization. Our findings not only deepen the understanding of the topological nature of Chern vectors but also enlighten the exploration of their transport properties.</description>

      <title>Scanning gate microscopy detection of Majorana bound states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically study scanning gate microscopy of a superconductor-proximitized semiconducting wire focusing on the possibility of detection of Majorana bound states. We exploit the possibility to create local potential perturbation by the scanning gate tip which allows controllable modification of the spatial distribution of the Majorana modes, which is translated into changes in their energy structure. When the tip scans across the system, it effectively divides the wire into two parts with controllable lengths, in which two pairs of Majorana states are created when the system is in the topological regime. For strong values of the tip potential the pairs are decoupled, and the presence of Majorana states can be detected via local tunneling spectroscopy that resolves the energy splittings resulting from the Majorana states wave functions overlap. Importantly, as the system is probed spatially via the tip, this technique can distinguish Majorana bound states from quasi-Majorana states localized on smooth potential barriers. We demonstrate that for weaker tip potentials the two neighboring Majorana states hybridize opening pronounced anticrossings in the energy spectra which are reflected in local conductance maps and which result in non-zero non-local conductance features. Finally, we demonstrate the effect of the disorder on the scanning gate microscopy spectroscopy maps.</description>

      <title>Phase-controlled minimal Kitaev chain in multiterminal Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a nanodevice based on multi-terminal Josephson junctions for the creation and detection of poor man's Majorana (PMM) modes. The device consists of a double three-terminal Josephson junction (3TJJ) embedded in a planar semiconductor that engineers a two-site Kitaev chain. We identify the conditions necessary for the emergence of PMM modes by precisely tuning the superconducting phases of the terminals and the inter-junction coupling between the 3TJJs. To validate our findings, we perform numerical simulations that account for disorder in a more general geometry, and test experimentally feasible protocols based on conductance measurements to reliably detect these modes. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on magnetic fields, our design eliminates the need for such fields, potentially increasing the energy-level resolution and significantly expanding the range of compatible semiconductor materials, such as Ge-based heterostructures.</description>

      <title>A dressed singlet-triplet qubit in germanium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In semiconductor hole spin qubits, low magnetic field ($B$) operation extends the coherence time ($T_\mathrm{2}^*$) but proportionally reduces the gate speed. In contrast, singlet-triplet (ST) qubits are primarily controlled by the exchange interaction ($J$) and can thus maintain high gate speeds even at low $B$. However, a large $J$ introduces a significant charge component to the qubit, rendering ST qubits more vulnerable to charge noise when driven. Here, we demonstrate a highly coherent ST hole spin qubit in germanium, operating at both low $B$ and low $J$. By modulating $J$, we achieve resonant driving of the ST qubit, obtaining an average gate fidelity of $99.68\%$ and a coherence time of $T_\mathrm{2}^*=1.9\,\mu$s. Moreover, by applying the resonant drive continuously, we realize a dressed ST qubit with a tenfold increase in coherence time ($T_\mathrm{2\rho}^*=20.3\,\mu$s). Frequency modulation of the driving signal enables universal control, with an average gate fidelity of $99.64\%$. Our results demonstrate the potential for extending coherence times while preserving high-fidelity control of germanium-based ST qubits, paving the way for more efficient operations in semiconductor-based quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Impact of phonon lifetimes on the single-photon indistinguishability in quantum emitters based on 2D materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Localized excitons in two-dimensional (2D) materials are considered as promising sources of single photons on demand. The photon indistinguishability as key figure of merit for quantum information processing is strongly influenced by the coupling of charge excitations to lattice vibrations of the surrounding semiconductor material. Here, we quantify the impact of exciton-acoustic-phonon-interaction and cavity QED effects on photon indistinguishability in a Hong-Ou-Mandel setup by solving fully quantum mechanical equations for the coupled QD-cavity-phonon system including non-Markovian effects. We find a strong reduction of indistinguishability compared to 3D systems due to increased exciton-phonon coupling efficiency. Moreover, we show that the coherence properties of photons are significantly influenced by the finite phonon lifetime in the surrounding material giving rise to pure dephasing. Only if these limitations can be overcome, localized excitons in 2D semiconductors can become a new avenue for quantum light sources.</description>

      <title>Non-Topological Edge-Localized Yu-Shiba-Rusinov States in CrBr$_3$/NbSe$_2$ Heterostructures</title>

Abstract: Topological superconductivity is predicted to emerge in certain magnet-superconductor hybrid systems. Here, we revisit the heterostructure of insulating monolayer CrBr$_3$ and NbSe$_2$, for which different conclusions on the presence of topological superconductivity have been reported. Using low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and (shot noise) spectroscopy, we find that the superconducting gap well inside the CrBr3 islands is not affected by magnetism. At the island edges, we observe Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) states at a variety of in-gap positions, including zero energy. The absence of topological superconductivity is verified by extensive dI/dV measurements at the CrBr$_3$ island edges. Our results ask for a more detailed understanding of the interaction between magnetic insulators and superconductors.</description>

      <title>Topological Influence of Sextets on Graphene Oxide Nanostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graphene Oxide (GO) remains a perennial chemical enigma despite its utility in preparing graphene and its functionalization. Epoxides and tertiary alcohols are construed as primary functional groups, but the structural motifs, spectra, and physicochemical properties remain largely inexplicable. Our graph theoretic perturbational analysis of introducing defects (sp3 carbons) on graphene shows the induction of sextets that topologically force 1, 4-quinoidal channels. Edge defects minimize these, whose propagation is halted by vertex anti-defects. Molecular models show that epoxidation creates a diradical centered on two cove-end carbons due to close-lying frontier orbitals. This drives the cascade addition of hydroxides, yielding the 1:2 ratio of epoxides and hydroxides. This nanostructure accounts for the cation exchange, acidity, anionic nature of GO, and topological conditions that break its sigma framework. The simulated spectra of a 2D sheet with this nanostructure correlate pleasantly with experiments, emphasizing the dominant role of sextet topology on the surface chemistry of graphene.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian global synchronization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synchronization of coupled nonlinear oscillators is a prevalent phenomenon in natural systems and can play important roles in various fields of modern science, such as laser arrays and electric networks. However, achieving robust global synchronization has always been a significant challenge due to its extreme susceptibility to initial conditions and structural perturbations. Here, we present a novel approach to achieve robust global synchronization by manipulating the interplay between non-Hermitian physics and nonlinear dynamics. Remarkably, the initial-state-independent non-Hermitian skin and topological global synchronization are proposed, exhibiting diverse anomalous effects such as the enlarged-size triggered non-Hermitian global synchronization and nonlinear skin states-dominated global synchronization. To validate our findings, we design and fabricate nonlinear topoelectrical circuits for experimental observation of non-Hermitian global synchronization. Our work opens up a promising avenue for establishing resilient global synchronization with potential applications in constructing high-radiance laser arrays and topologically synchronized networks.</description>

      <title>Multi-scale physics of cryogenic liquid helium-4: Inverse coarse-graining properties of smoothed particle hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent numerical studies on cryogenic liquid helium-4 have provided a multiscale physics perspective based on Landau's two-fluid model. This study presents the possibility that two-fluid models based on classical and quantum hydrodynamics have a relationship between scale transformation by filtering in large eddy simulations (LES) and inverse scale transformation using smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). We consider that the spin angle momentum conservation term, which we previously introduced into the two-fluid model as a quantum mechanical correction, formally corresponds to the subgrid-scale (SGS) model, which can be derived from the scale transformation of the two-fluid model from quantum to classical hydrodynamics. We demonstrate that solving the two-fluid model based on classical hydrodynamics using SPH can reproduce the fluctuations at the microscopic scale because the truncation errors owing to the smoothing kernel approximation can substitute the fluctuations at the microscopic scale. In particular, the fluctuations can be reproduced at more macroscopic scales and amplified according to the size of kernel radius. Our results and discussion provide new insights into the microscopic composition of cryogenic liquid helium4 within a multiscale framework. First, a normal fluid can be a mixture of inviscid and viscous particles. Second, a flow identified as a normal fluid on the microscopic scale because of the presence of molecular viscosity is still classified as an inviscid fluid on the hydrodynamic scale because its viscosity is insufficient to produce eddy viscosity. In conclusion, we provide a new multiscale physical framework for cryogenic liquid helium-4.</description>

      <title>Designing edge currents using mesoscopic patterning in chiral d-wave superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chiral superconductors are topological as characterized by a finite Chern number and chiral edge modes. Direct fingerprints of chiral superconductivity is thus often taken to be spontaneous edge currents with associated magnetic signatures. However, a number of recent theoretical studies have shown that the total edge current along semi-infinite edges is greatly reduced or even vanishes in many scenarios for all pairing symmetries except chiral $p$-wave, thus impeding experimental detection. We demonstrate how mesoscopic finite-sized samples can be designed to give rise to a shape- and size-dependent strong enhancement of the chiral edge currents and their generated orbital magnetic moment and magnetic fields. In particular, we find that low rotational symmetry systems, such as pentagons and hexagons, give rise to the largest currents, while circular disks also generate large currents but in the opposite direction. The current and magnetic signatures diverge with shrinking system sizes, eventually cut-off by finite-size suppression of chiral superconductivity. We thus also extract the full phase diagram as a function of temperature and system size for different geometries, including competing superconducting orders. Our results are relevant for system sizes on the order of tens to hundreds of coherence lengths, and highlight mesoscopic patterning as a viable route to experimentally identify chiral $d$-wave superconductivity.</description>

Abstract: Thermoelectric effects in metals are typically small due to the nearly-perfect particle-hole (PH) symmetry around their Fermi surface [1, 2]. Despite being initially considered paradoxical [3], thermophase effects [4-8] and linear thermoelectricity [9] in superconducting systems were identified only when PH symmetry is explicitly broken [10-14]. Here, we experimentally demonstrate that a superconducting tunnel junction can develop a very large bipolar thermoelectric effect in the presence of a nonlinear thermal gradient thanks to spontaneous PH symmetry breaking [15]. Our junctions show a maximum thermovoltage of $\pm150\; \mu$ V at $\pm650$ mK, directly proportional to the superconducting gap. Notably, the corresponding Seebeck coefficient of $\pm300\; \mu$V/K is roughly $10^5$ times larger than the one expected for a normal metal at the same temperature [16, 17]. Moreover, by integrating our junctions into a Josephson interferometer, we realize a bipolar thermoelectric Josephson engine (BTJE) [18] with phase-coherent thermopower control [19]. When connected to a generic load, the BTJE generates a phase-tunable electric power up to about 140 mW/m$^2$ at subKelvin temperatures. In addition, our device implements the prototype for a persistent thermoelectric memory cell, written or erased by current injection [20]. We expect that our findings will trigger thermoelectricity in PH symmetric systems, and will lead to a number of groundbreaking applications in superconducting electronics [21], cutting-edge quantum technologies [22-24] and sensing [25].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13829v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent experiments have shown that the edge states of a quantum Hall sample can be coupled to a superconductor, so that incoming electrons in the edge states can be Andreev converted by the superconductor as coherent superpositions of an electron and a hole. In parallel, single-electron emitters that operate in the gigahertz regime have been realized on quantum Hall edge states. Motivated by this remarkable experimental progress, we here analyze the Andreev reflections of incoming charge pulses on the interface with a superconductor. To this end, we employ a Wigner function representation that allows us to visualize the response function of the interface both in the time and in the frequency domain. We analyze the response of an interface between a normal-metal and a singlet or triplet superconductor with and without an insulating barrier in between them. As a special case, we analyze the Andreev reflections of clean single-particle excitations that are generated by the application of lorentzian-shaped voltage pulses to the contacts of the inputs. Our predictions may be tested in future experiments with edge states coupled to superconductors.</description>

      <title>Electric-field switchable chirality in rhombohedral graphene Chern insulators stabilized by tungsten diselenide</title>

Abstract: Chern insulators host topologically protected chiral edge currents with quantized conductance characterized by their Chern number. Switching the chirality of a Chern insulator, namely, the direction of the edge current, is highly challenging due to topologically forbidden backscattering but is of considerable importance for the design of topological devices. Nevertheless, this can be achieved by reversing the sign of the Chern number through a topological phase transition. Here, we report electrically switchable chirality in rhombohedral multilayer graphene-based Chern insulators. By introducing moire superlattices in rhombohedral heptalayer graphene, we observed a cascade of topological phase transitions at quarter electron filling of a moire band with the Chern number tunable from -1, 1 to 2. Furthermore, integrating monolayer tungsten diselenide at the moireless interface of rhombohedral decalayer graphene/h-BN superlattices stabilizes the Chern insulators, enabling quantized anomalous Hall resistance of h/2e^2. Remarkably, the Chern number can be switched from -1 to 2 using displacement fields. Our work establishes rhombohedral multilayer graphene moire superlattices as a versatile platform for topological engineering, with switchable chirality offering significant promise for integrating chiral edge currents into topological electronic circuits.</description>

Abstract: Phonon hydrodynamics describes the motions of heat carriers (phonons) at sub-continuum scales: diffusive, ballistic, viscous, and vortical. In a previous paper, these behaviours were investigated within the framework of non-equilibrium thermodynamics with internal variables at the macroscopic scale, deriving generalizations of the Guyer-Krumhansl equation. In particular, a generalized heat conduction equation, containing not only the Fourier, Maxwell-Vernotte-Cattaneo, and Guyer-Krumhansl contributions, but also a term describing phonon vortices, was obtained. In this paper, we provide new insight and clarifications into the same model for rigid heat-conducting media. Then, we a posteriori identify two non-local macroscopic internal variables, $Q^s$ and $Q^a$ (the symmetric part and the antisymmetric part of a second order tensor $Q$) with the symmetric (changed in sign) and antisymmetric gradients of the heat flux, $-(\nabla J(q))^s$ and $(\nabla J(q))^{a}$. Also an identification of these two tensorial internal variables is obtained by an asymptotic approach. This generalizes the heat equation with additional terms containing the time derivative of the heat flux describing the viscous and vortical motions of phonons. These terms may describe the transfer from ordered rotational motion of phonon vortices to rotational microscopic motions of diatomic particles constituting complex polar crystals, in analogy to the hydrodynamics of classical micropolar fluids. Therefore, this paper fits into the currently explored area of phonon vorticity and its interactions with the heat flux itself.</description>

Abstract: Using an S-matrix formulation we evaluate the thermodynamic potential and conductance of a Bloch or N\'eel magnetic wall interacting with a one dimensional free electron gas via a double exchange interaction. The minimization of the elastic magnetic energy plus electronic thermodynamic potential indicates that for chemical potential larger than the magnetic interaction the domain wall is generally deformed to a thin wall, while for magnetic interaction larger than the chemical potential tends towards wide walls. In contrast, for a double wall configuration the deformation is always towards wide walls. For the single as well as the double magnetic wall configurations the conductance monotonically decreases with decreasing wall width. The thermodynamic potential and conductance of Bloch and N\'eel magnetic domain walls are identical within this prototype model.</description>

Abstract: We develop a microscopic theory for excitons and cavity exciton polaritons in transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers under a perpendicular static magnetic field. We obtain numerically exact solutions for the ground and excited states, accounting for the interplay between arbitrarily large magnetic fields and light-matter coupling strengths. This includes the very strong coupling regime, where light-induced modifications of the exciton wavefunction become essential and the approximate coupled oscillator description breaks down. Our results show excellent agreement with recent experimental measurements of the diamagnetic shift of the ground and excited exciton states in WS$_2$, MoS$_2$, MoSe$_2$, and MoTe$_2$ monolayers. For polaritons, we consider experimentally relevant system parameters and demonstrate that the diamagnetic shifts of both the ground and excited states at high magnetic fields exhibit clear signatures of the very strong coupling regime, highlighting the necessity of our microscopic and numerically exact treatment over perturbative approaches. Furthermore, our microscopic approach allows us to evaluate the exciton-exciton and polariton-polariton interaction strengths. Comparing results specific to TMD monolayers with those applicable to quantum wells, we find that variational approaches overestimate the TMD excitons' interaction strength. We also observe that magnetic fields weaken the interaction strength for both excitons and polaritons, with a less pronounced effect in TMDs than in quantum wells, and that light-induced modifications to the matter component in TMD polaritons can enhance interaction strengths beyond those of purely excitonic interactions.</description>

Abstract: Stochastic neurons are extremely efficient hardware for solving a large class of problems and usually come in two varieties -- "binary" where the neuronal statevaries randomly between two values of -1, +1 and "analog" where the neuronal state can randomly assume any value between -1 and +1. Both have their uses in neuromorphic computing and both can be implemented with low- or zero-energy-barrier nanomagnets whose random magnetization orientations in the presence of thermal noise encode the binary or analog state variables. In between these two classes is n-ary stochastic neurons, mainly ternary stochastic neurons (TSN) whose state randomly assumes one of three values (-1, 0, +1), which have proved to be efficient in pattern classification tasks such as recognizing handwritten digits from the MNIST data set or patterns from the CIFAR-10 data set. Here, we show how to implement a TSN with a zero-energy-barrier (shape isotropic) magnetostrictive nanomagnet subjected to uniaxial strain.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Hall Effect in Two-dimensional Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09298v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Symmetry is a cornerstone of condensed matter physics, fundamentally shaping the behavior of electronic systems and inducing the emergence of novel phenomena. The Hall effect, a key concept in this field, demonstrates how symmetry breaking, particularly of time-reversal symmetry, influences electronic transport properties. Recently, the nonlinear Hall effect has extended this understanding by generating a transverse voltage that modulates at twice the frequency of the driving alternating current without breaking time-reversal symmetry. This effect is closely tied to the symmetry and quantum geometric properties of materials, offering a new approach to probing the Berry curvature and quantum metric. Here, we provide a review of the theoretical insights and experimental advancements in the nonlinear Hall effect, particularly focusing on its realization in two-dimensional materials. We discuss the challenges still ahead, look at potential applications for devices, and explore how these ideas might apply to other nonlinear transport phenomena. By elucidating these aspects, this review aims to advance the understanding of nonlinear transport effects and their broader implications for future technologies.</description>

      <title>Spin-flip Scattering at a Chiral Interface of Helical Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08611v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate spin-flip scattering processes of electrons when they pass a chiral interface, which is the boundary between right- and left-handed one-dimensional chain. We construct a minimal $p$-orbital model consisting of the right- and left-handed one-dimensional threefold helical chains connected at $z=0$ with the nearest neighbor hopping and the spin-orbit coupling. The dynamics of spin-polarized wave packet passing through the interface, the Green's functions, and electronic states near the interface are analyzed numerically. We find that the microscopic structure of the interface is important and this strongly affects the local electronic orbital state. This in addition to the spin-orbit coupling determines whether the spin flip occurs or not at the chiral interface and suggests a possible spin transport control by the orbital configuration at the chiral interface.</description>

      <title>Magnetic measurements under high pressure with a quantum sensor in Hexagonal Boron Nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13757v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic measurements under high-pressure conditions are pivotal for the study of superconductivity and magnetic materials but remain challenging due to the micrometer-sized sample in diamond anvil cells (DAC). In this study, we propose a quantum sensing approach utilizing negatively charged boron-vacancy (V$_B^-$) spin defects in two-dimensional hexagonal boron nitride for high resolution magnetic measurements under pressure. The optical and spin properties of VB$^-$ defects were systematically studied under high-pressure conditions, revealing a significant pressure-induced shift in zero-field splitting (ZFS), approximately three times larger than that of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center. Furthermore, we demonstrate the pressure-dependent magnetic transition and variations in the Curie temperature of van der Waals ferromagnet Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ flake using V$_B^-$ defects under pressures. Notably, the maximum operational pressure for V$_B^-$ defects was determined to be approximately 11 GPa, attributed to a structural phase transition in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). This work establishes the way for two-dimensional quantum sensing technologies under high-pressure environments.</description>

      <title>Open reaction-diffusion systems: bridging probabilistic theory and simulations across scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07119v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reaction-diffusion processes are the foundational model for a diverse range of complex systems, ranging from biochemical reactions to social agent-based phenomena. The underlying dynamics of these systems occur at the individual particle/agent level, and in realistic applications, they often display interaction with their environment through energy or material exchange with a reservoir. This requires intricate mathematical considerations, especially in the case of material exchange since the varying number of particles/agents results in ``on-the-fly'' modification of the system dimension. In this work, we first overview the probabilistic description of reaction-diffusion processes at the particle level, which readily handles varying number of particles. We then extend this model to consistently incorporate interactions with macroscopic material reservoirs. Based on the resulting expressions, we bridge the probabilistic description with macroscopic concentration-based descriptions for linear and nonlinear reaction-diffusion systems, as well as for an archetypal open reaction-diffusion system. Using these mathematical bridges across scales, we finally develop numerical schemes for open reaction-diffusion systems, which we implement in two illustrative examples. This work establishes a methodological workflow to bridge particle-based probabilistic descriptions with macroscopic concentration-based descriptions of reaction-diffusion in open settings, laying the foundations for a multiscale theoretical framework upon which to construct theory and simulation schemes that are consistent across scales.</description>

      <title>Unifying Floquet theory of longitudinal and dispersive readout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03417v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We devise a Floquet theory of longitudinal and dispersive readout in circuit QED. By studying qubits coupled to cavity photons and driven at the resonance frequency of the cavity $\omega_{\rm r}$, we establish a universal connection between the qubit AC Stark shift and the longitudinal and dispersive coupling to photons. We find that the longitudinal coupling $g_\parallel$ is controlled by the slope of the AC Stark shift as function of the driving strength $A_{\rm q}$, while the dispersive shift $\chi$ depends on its curvature. The two quantities become proportional to each other in the weak drive limit ($A_{\rm q}\rightarrow 0$). Our approach unifies the adiabatic limit ($\omega_{\rm r}\rightarrow 0$) -- where $g_\parallel$ is generated by the static spectrum curvature (or quantum capacitance) -- with the diabatic one, where the static spectrum plays no role. We derive analytical results supported by exact numerical simulations. We apply them to superconducting and spin-hybrid cQED systems, showcasing the flexibility of faster-than-dispersive longitudinal readout.</description>

      <title>Axion Dark Matter and Plateau-Plateau Transition in Quantum Hall Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06038v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Axion dark matter inevitably generates electromagnetic radiation in quantum Hall effect experiments that use strong magnetic fields. Although these emissions are very weak, we have shown using a QCD axion model that they influence the plateau-plateau transition at low temperatures (below $100$ mK) in a system with a large surface area (greater than $10^{-3}\rm cm^2$) of two-dimensional electrons. By analyzing previous experiments that show saturation of the transition width $\Delta B$ as temperature and microwave frequency change, we provide evidence for the presence of axions. Notably, in most experiments without axion effects, the saturation frequency $f_s(T)$ is less than $1$ GHz at temperatures of $100$ mK or lower and for system sizes of $10^{-3}\rm cm^2$ or smaller. Additionally, the frequency $f_s(T)$ decreases with decreasing temperature or increasing system size. However, there are experiments that show a saturation frequency $f_s(T)\simeq 2.4$GHz at a low temperature of 35 mK and with a large surface area of $6.6\times 10^{-3}\rm cm^2$ for the Hall bar. This identical frequency of approximately $2.4$ GHz has also been observed in different plateau transitions and in Hall bars of varying sizes, indicating the presence of axion microwaves. The saturation frequency $f_s=m_a/2\pi$ of $\simeq 2.4$ GHz implies an axion mass of $\simeq 10^{-5}$eV. We also propose additional experiments that support the existence of axions. The appearance of the axion effect in the quantum Hall effect is attributed to significant absorption of axion energy, which is proportional to the square of the number of electrons involved.</description>
