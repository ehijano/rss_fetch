      <title>Empirical Bernstein and betting confidence intervals for randomized quasi-Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Randomized quasi-Monte Carlo (RQMC) methods estimate the mean of a random variable by sampling an integrand at $n$ equidistributed points. For scrambled digital nets, the resulting variance is typically $\tilde O(n^{-\theta})$ where $\theta\in[1,3]$ depends on the smoothness of the integrand and $\tilde O$ neglects logarithmic factors. While RQMC can be far more accurate than plain Monte Carlo (MC) it remains difficult to get confidence intervals on RQMC estimates. We investigate some empirical Bernstein confidence intervals (EBCI) and hedged betting confidence intervals (HBCI), both from Waudby-Smith and Ramdas (2024), when the random variable of interest is subject to known bounds. When there are $N$ integrand evaluations partitioned into $R$ independent replicates of $n=N/R$ RQMC points, and the RQMC variance is $\Theta(n^{-\theta})$, then an oracle minimizing the width of a Bennett confidence interval would choose $n =\Theta(N^{1/(\theta+1)})$. The resulting intervals have a width that is $\Theta(N^{-\theta/(\theta+1)})$. Our empirical investigations had optimal values of $n$ grow slowly with $N$, HBCI intervals that were usually narrower than the EBCI ones, and optimal values of $n$ for HBCI that were equal to or smaller than the ones for the oracle.</description>

      <title>Fast Singular-Kernel Convolution on General Non-Smooth Domains via Truncated Fourier Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid and accurate evaluation of convolutions with singular kernels plays crucial roles in a wide range of scientific and engineering applications. Building on the recently introduced Truncated Fourier Filtering method for smooth kernels, this work presents a fast, high-order numerical methodology that extends the approach to singular kernels and non-smooth domains. The method relies on truncated Fourier expansions of a prescribed order $F$ for the characteristic function of the integration domain, as well as expansions for the products of characteristic functions and singular functions. This version of the article is a preliminary draft, shared to facilitate early dissemination. The complete version will be available shortly.</description>

      <title>A convergent algorithm for mean curvature flow of surfaces with Dirichlet boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish convergence results for a spatial semidiscretization of Mean Curvature Flow (MCF) for surfaces with fixed boundaries.
  Our analysis is based on Huisken's evolution equations for the mean curvature and the normal vector, enabling precise control of discretization errors and yielding optimal error estimates for discrete spaces with piecewise polynomials of degree $p \geq 2$.
  Building on techniques recently developed by Kov\'acs, Li, Lubich, and collaborators for closed surfaces, we extend these ideas to surfaces with boundaries by formulating appropriate boundary conditions for both the mean curvature and the normal vector. These boundary treatments are essential for proving convergence.
  The core of our analysis involves a classical error splitting strategy using auxiliary discrete functions that approximate the surface geometry, the mean curvature, and the normal vector. We estimate two types of errors for each variable to rigorously assess both stability and consistency.
  To effectively handle boundary conditions for the normal vector, we introduce a nonlinear Ritz projection into the analysis. As a result, we derive optimal $H^1$ error estimates for the surface position, velocity, mean curvature, and normal vector. Our theoretical findings are corroborated by numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Nonlinear Elimination Preconditioning for Transport in Fractured Porous Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sequential implicit (SI) formulations are gaining increasing interest due to their ability to decouple reservoir simulation problems into distinct flow and transport subproblems, allowing for the use of specialized solvers tailored to each. This separation often improves solver efficiency and flexibility, especially in weakly coupled systems. However, for fractured reservoirs, even the decoupled subproblems may generate nonlinearly stiff systems. This is specifically evident in the transport subproblem, where fracture-induced non-linearity imbalances often lead to poor Newton convergence, including failed iterations and frequent timestep cuts. To address this challenge, we propose and investigate an adaptive Nonlinear Elimination (NE) preconditioned exact Newton algorithm specifically tailored to transport subproblems that arise from the sequential splitting of two-phase flow in fractured porous media. The proposed method is evaluated through a series of waterflooding test cases involving discrete fracture networks. The adaptive NE-preconditioned algorithm consistently demonstrates improved convergence behavior and computational efficiency compared to standard Newton.</description>

      <title>Numerical analysis of an H(div)-conforming divergence-free discontinuous Galerkin method with a second-order explicit Runge-Kutta scheme for the incompressible Euler equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an error analysis for an \( H(\text{div}) \)-conforming divergence-free discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method, combined with a second-order explicit Runge-Kutta (RK) scheme, for the incompressible Euler equations. This work extends the error analysis of the second-order explicit Runge-Kutta discontinuous Galerkin (RKDG) type methods to incompressible flows, in which the exactly divergence-free constraint introduces additional challenges to the analysis. For smooth solutions, we rigorously derive an a priori error estimate of $O(h^{k+1 / 2}+\tau^2)$ under a restrictive CFL condition $\tau \lesssim h^{4 / 3}$ for polynomials of degree $k \geq 1$, where $h$ and $\tau$ are the mesh size and time step size, respectively. For the case of linear polynomials, we further investigate whether existing analytical techniques can relax the restrictive CFL condition to a standard CFL condition $\tau \lesssim h$. It is demonstrated that the exactly divergence-free constraint prevents the application of these techniques. We conjecture that the error estimates for linear polynomials cannot be derived under a standard CFL condition. Numerical experiments are conducted, supporting our analytical results and the conjecture for linear polynomials.</description>

      <title>On Symmetric Lanczos Quadrature for Trace Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Golub-Welsch algorithm computes Gauss quadrature rules with the nodes and weights generated from the symmetric tridiagonal matrix in the Lanczos process. While symmetric Lanczos quadrature (in exact arithmetic) theoretically reduces computational costs, its practical feasibility for trace estimation remains uncertain. This paper resolves this ambiguity by establishing sufficient and necessary conditions for the symmetry of Lanczos quadratrure. For matrices of Jordan-Wielandt type, we provide guidance on selecting initial vectors for the Lanczos algorithm that guarantees symmetric quadrature nodes and weights. More importantly, regarding Estrada index computations in bipartite graphs or directed ones, our method would not only save computational costs, but also ensure the unbiasedness of trace estimators.</description>

      <title>Analysis and Elimination of Numerical Pressure Dependency in Coupled Stokes-Darcy Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a pressure-robust mixed finite element method (FEM) for the coupled Stokes-Darcy system. We revisits the rigorous theoretical framework of Layton et al. [2002], where velocity and pressure errors are coupled, masking pressure's influence on velocity accuracy. To investigate the pressure dependency, we introduce a auxiliary velocity projection that preserves discrete divergence and interface continuity constraints. By analyzing the difference between the discrete and projected velocities, we rigorously prove that classical FEM incurs pressure-dependent consistency errors due to inexact divergence enforcement and approximate interface conditions. To eliminate these errors, we design a pressure-robust method using divergence-free reconstruction operator, which enforce exact divergence constraint and interface continuity. Numerical examples confirm the theory: under high-pressure or low-viscosity, the proposed method reduces velocity errors by orders of magnitude compared to classical method.</description>

      <title>Provable algorithms for multi-reference alignment over $\SO(2)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The multi-reference alignment (MRA) problem involves reconstructing a signal from multiple noisy observations, each transformed by a random group element. In this paper, we focus on the group \(\mathrm{SO}(2)\) of in-plane rotations and propose two computationally efficient algorithms with theoretical guarantees for accurate signal recovery under a non-uniform distribution over the group. The first algorithm exploits the spectral properties of the second moment of the data, while the second utilizes the frequency matching principle. Both algorithms achieve the optimal estimation rate in high-noise regimes, marking a significant advancement in the development of computationally efficient and statistically optimal methods for estimation problems over groups.</description>

      <title>Parameter estimation for multivariate exponential sums via iterative rational approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present two new methods for multivariate exponential analysis. In [7], we developed a new algorithm for reconstruction of univariate exponential sums by exploiting the rational structure of their Fourier coefficients and reconstructing this rational structure with the AAA (adaptive Antoulas-Anderson) method for rational approximation [15]. In this paper, we extend these ideas to the multivariate setting. Similarly as in univariate case, the Fourier coefficients of multivariate exponential sums have a rational structure and the multivariate exponential recovery problem can be reformulated as multivariate rational interpolation problem. We develop two approaches to solve this special multivariate rational interpolation problem by reducing it to the several univariate ones, which are then solved again via the univariate AAA method. Our first approach is based on using indices of the Fourier coefficients chosen from some sparse grid, which ensures efficient reconstruction using a respectively small amount of input data. The second approach is based on using the full grid of indices of the Fourier coefficients and relies on the idea of recursive dimension reduction. We demonstrate performance of our methods with several numerical examples.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the strong and weak convergence orders of numerical methods for SDEs driven by time-changed L\'{e}vy noise under the globally Lipschitz conditions. Based on the duality theorem, we prove that the numerical approximation generated by the stochastic $\theta$ method with $\theta \in [0,1]$ and the simulation of inverse subordinator converges strongly with order $1/2$. Moreover, the numerical approximation combined with the Euler--Maruyama method and the estimate of inverse subordinator is shown to have the weak convergence order $1$ by means of the Kolmogorov backward partial integro differential equations. These theoretical results are finally confirmed by some numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Hybridizable Discontinuous Galerkin Methods for Coupled Poro-Viscoelastic and Thermo-Viscoelastic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents a unified mathematical framework for modeling coupled poro-viscoelastic and thermo-viscoelastic phenomena, formulated as a system of first-order in time partial differential equations. The model describes the evolution of solid velocity, elastic and viscous stress tensors, and additional fields related to either fluid pressure or temperature, depending on the physical context. We develop a hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin method for the numerical approximation of this coupled system, providing a high-order, stable discretization that efficiently handles the multiphysics nature of the problem. We establish stability analysis and derive optimal $hp$-error estimates for the semi-discrete formulation. The theoretical convergence rates are validated through comprehensive numerical experiments, demonstrating the method's accuracy and robustness across various test cases, including wave propagation in heterogeneous media with mixed viscoelastic properties.</description>

      <title>Trigonometric Interpolation Based Optimization for Second Order Non-Linear ODE with Mixed Boundary Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a trigonometric-interpolation approach for solutions of second order nonlinear ODEs with mixed boundary conditions. The method interpolates secondary derivative $y''$ of a target solution $y$ by a trigonometric polynomial. The solution is identified through an optimization process to capture the dynamics of $y,y',y''$ characterized by the underlying differential equation. The gradient function of the optimization can be carried out by Fast Fourier Transformation and high-degree accuracy can be achieved effectively by increasing interpolation grid points. In case that solution of ODE system is not unique, the algorithm has flexibility to approach to a desired solution that meets certain requirements such as being positive. Numerical tests have been conducted under various boundary conditions with expected performance.
  The algorithm can be extended for nonlinear ODE of a general order $k$ although implementation complexity will increase as $k$ gets larger.</description>

      <title>Efficient approximations of matrix multiplication using truncated decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We exploit the truncated singular value decomposition and the recently proposed circulant decomposition for an efficient first-order approximation of the multiplication of large dense matrices. A decomposition of each matrix into a sum of a sparse matrix with relatively few dominant entries and a dense residue can also use the above approach, and we present methods for multiplication using a Fourier decomposition and a cycle decomposition-based sparsifications. The proposed methods scale as $\mathcal{O}(n^2 \log n)$ in arithmetic operations for $n \times n$ matrices for usable tolerances in relative error $\sim$ 1\%. Note that different decompositions for the two matrices $A$ and $B$ in the product $AB$ are also possible in this approach, using a priori evaluations for suitability, to improve further on the error tolerances demonstrated here.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a nonlinear Klein--Gordon equation in the nonrelativistic limit regime with highly oscillatory initial data in the form of a modulated plane wave. In this regime, the solution exhibits rapid oscillations in both time and space, posing challenges for numerical approximation. We propose a filtered finite difference method that achieves second-order accuracy with time steps and mesh sizes that are not restricted in magnitude by the small parameter. Moreover, the method is uniformly convergent in the range from arbitrarily small to moderately bounded scaling parameters. Numerical experiments illustrate the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Second-Order Compatible-Strain Mixed Finite Elements for 2D Compressible Nonlinear Elasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, a new class of mixed finite elements -- compatible-strain mixed finite elements (CSMFEs) -- has emerged that uses the differential complex of nonlinear elasticity. Their excellent performance in benchmark problems, such as numerical stability for modeling large deformations in near-incompressible solids, makes them a promising choice for solving engineering problems. Explicit forms exist for various shape functions of first-order CSMFEs. In contrast, existing second-order CSMFEs evaluate shape functions using numerical integration. In this paper, we formulate second-order CSMFEs with explicit shape functions for the displacement gradient and stress tensor. Concepts of vector calculus that stem from exterior calculus are presented and used to provide efficient forms for shape functions in the natural coordinate system. Covariant and contravariant Piola transformations are then applied to transform the shape functions to the physical space. Mid-nodes and pseudo-nodes are used to enforce the continuity constraints for the displacement gradient and stress tensor over the boundaries of elements. The formulation of the proposed second-order CSMFEs and technical aspects regarding their implementation are discussed in detail. Several benchmark problems are solved to compare the performance of CSMFEs with first-order CSMFEs and other second-order elements that rely on numerical integration. It is shown that the proposed CSMFEs are numerically stable for modeling near-incompressible solids in the finite strain regime.</description>

      <title>Fast convolution solver based on far-field smooth approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The convolution potential arises in a wide variety of application areas, and its efficient and accurate evaluation encounters three challenges: singularity, nonlocality and anisotropy. We introduce a fast algorithm based on a far-field smooth approximation of the kernel, where the bounded domain Fourier transform, one of the most essential difficulties, is well approximated by the whole space Fourier transform which usually admits explicit formula. The convolution is split into a regular and singular integral, and they are well resolved by trapezoidal rule and Fourier spectral method respectively. The scheme is simplified to a discrete convolution and is implemented efficiently with Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Importantly, the tensor generation procedure is quite simple, highly efficient and independent of the anisotropy strength. It is easy to implement and achieves spectral accuracy with nearly optimal efficiency and minimum memory requirement. Rigorous error estimates and extensive numerical investigations, together with a comprehensive comparison, showcase its superiorities for different kernels.</description>

      <title>Quantitative estimates for a nonlinear inverse source problem in a coupled diffusion equations with uncertain measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work considers a nonlinear inverse source problem in a coupled diffusion equation from the terminal observation. Theoretically, under some conditions on problem data, we build the uniqueness theorem for this inverse problem and show two Lipschitz-type stability results in $L^2$ and $(H^1(\cdot))^*$ norms, respectively. However, in practice, we could only observe the measurements at discrete sensors, which contain the noise. Hence, this work further investigates the recovery of the unknown source from the discrete noisy measurements. We propose a stable inversion scheme and provide probabilistic convergence estimates between the reconstructions and exact solution in two cases: convergence respect to expectation and convergence with an exponential tail. We provide several numerical experiments to illustrate and complement our theoretical analysis.</description>

      <title>Preasymptotic error estimates of higher-order EEM for the time-harmonic Maxwell equations with large wave number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The time-harmonic Maxwell equations with impedance boundary condition and large wave number are discretized using the second-type N\'{e}d\'{e}lec's edge element method (EEM). Preasymptotic error bounds are derived, showing that, under the mesh condition $\kappa^{2p+1}h^{2p}$ being sufficiently small, the error of the EEM of order $p$ in the energy norm is bounded by $\mathcal{O}\big(\kappa^{p}h^p + \kappa^{2p+1}h^{2p}\big)$, while the error in the $\kappa$-scaled $\boldsymbol{L}^2$ norm is bounded by $\mathcal{O}\big((\kappa h)^{p+1} + \kappa^{2p+1} h^{2p}\big)$. Here, $\kappa$ is the wave number and $h$ is the mesh size. Numerical tests are provided to illustrate our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Topological derivative for a fast identification of short, linear perfectly conducting cracks with inaccurate background information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we consider a topological derivative-based imaging technique for the fast identification of short, linear perfectly conducting cracks completely embedded in a two-dimensional homogeneous domain with smooth boundary. Unlike conventional approaches, we assume that the background permittivity and permeability are unknown due to their dependence on frequency and temperature, and we propose a normalized imaging function to localize cracks. Despite inaccuracies in background parameters, application of the proposed imaging function enables to recognize the existence of crack but it is still impossible to identify accurate crack locations. Furthermore, the shift in crack localization of imaging results is significantly influenced by the applied background parameters. In order to theoretically explain this phenomenon, we show that the imaging function can be expressed in terms of the zero-order Bessel function of the first kind, the crack lengths, and the applied inaccurate background wavenumber corresponding to the applied inaccurate background permittivity and permeability. Various numerical simulations results with synthetic data polluted by random noise validate the theoretical results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The computation of time dynamics arising in nonlinear time-dependent partial differential equations is an ongoing challenge in numerical analysis, especially once roughness comes into play. Classical numerical schemes in general fail to resolve the oscillatory behaviour in the solution which leads to numerical instabilities and loss of convergence. Dispersive equations, e.g., nonlinear Schr\"odinger, Korteweg--de Vries and wave equations, thereby pose in particular a big problem as in contrast to the parabolic setting, no strong smoothing can be expected, i.e., if the initial data is rough, the solution stays rough which makes their approximation a delicate task. In this review we give an overview on a new numerical ansatz which aims to tackle the time dynamics of nonlinear dispersive partial differential equations even for very rough data. This is achieved by a resonance analysis and decorated tree formalism that draws its inpiration from the combinatorics used in the theory of regularity structures for solving singular SPDEs. One can hope to see this formalism applied in other contexts for dispersive PDEs and beyond.</description>

      <title>Hyper-differential sensitivity analysis with respect to model discrepancy: Prior Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyper-differential sensitivity analysis with respect to model discrepancy was recently developed to enable uncertainty quantification for optimization problems. The approach consists of two primary steps: (i) Bayesian calibration of the discrepancy between high- and low-fidelity models, and (ii) propagating the model discrepancy uncertainty through the optimization problem. When high-fidelity model evaluations are limited, as is common in practice, the prior discrepancy distribution plays a crucial role in the uncertainty analysis. However, specification of this prior is challenging due to its mathematical complexity and many hyper-parameters. This article presents a novel approach to specify the prior distribution. Our approach consists of two parts: (1) an algorithmic initialization of the prior hyper-parameters that uses existing data to initialize a hyper-parameter estimate, and (2) a visualization framework to systematically explore properties of the prior and guide tuning of the hyper-parameters to ensure that the prior captures the appropriate range of uncertainty. We provide detailed mathematical analysis and a collection of numerical examples that elucidate properties of the prior that are crucial to ensure uncertainty quantification.</description>

      <title>Analytical solutions for the Extracellular-Membrane-Intracellular model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Extracellular-Membrane-Intracellular (EMI) model is a novel mathematical framework for cardiac electrophysiology simulations. The EMI model provides a more detailed description of the heart's electrical activity compared to traditional monodomain and bidomain models, potentially making it better-suited for understanding the electrical dynamics of the heart under pathological conditions. In this paper, we derive and verify several analytical solutions for the EMI model. Specifically, we obtain a family of solutions for a single two-dimensional cell in polar coordinates and for a pair of coupled three-dimensional cells in spherical coordinates. We also introduce a manufactured solution for N three-dimensional cells in Cartesian coordinates. To verify the analytical solutions, we conduct numerical experiments using the mortar finite element method combined with operator splitting. The results demonstrate that the analytical solutions are effective for verifying the accuracy of numerical simulations of the EMI model.</description>

      <title>Sharp decay estimates and numerical analysis for weakly coupled systems of two subdiffusion equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the initial-boundary value problem for weakly coupled systems of time-fractional subdiffusion equations with spatially and temporally varying coupling coefficients. By combining the energy method with the coercivity of fractional derivatives, we convert the original partial differential equations into a coupled ordinary differential system. Through Laplace transform and maximum principle arguments, we reveal a dichotomy in decay behavior: When the highest fractional order is less than one, solutions exhibit sublinear decay, whereas systems with the highest order equal to one demonstrate a distinct superlinear decay pattern. This phenomenon fundamentally distinguishes coupled systems from single fractional diffusion equations, where such accelerated superlinear decay never occurs. Numerical experiments employing finite difference methods and implicit discretization schemes validate the theoretical findings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $N$ be a natural number. We consider weighted Cauchy matrices of the form \[ \mathcal{C}_{a,A}=\left\{\frac{\sqrt{A_j A_k}}{a_k+a_j}\right\}_{j,k=1}^N, \] where $A_1,\dots,A_N$ are positive real numbers and $a_1,\dots,a_N$ are distinct positive real numbers, listed in increasing order. Let $b_1,\dots,b_N$ be the eigenvalues of $\mathcal{C}_{a,A}$, listed in increasing order. Let $B_k$ be positive real numbers such that $\sqrt{B_k}$ is the Euclidean norm of the orthogonal projection of the vector \[ v_A=(\sqrt{A_1},\dots,\sqrt{A_N}) \] onto the $k$'th eigenspace of $\mathcal{C}_{a,A}$. We prove that the spectral map $(a,A)\mapsto (b,B)$ is an involution and discuss simple properties of this map.</description>

      <title>A Dictionary of Closed-Form Kernel Mean Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kernel mean embeddings -- integrals of a kernel with respect to a probability distribution -- are essential in Bayesian quadrature, but also widely used in other computational tools for numerical integration or for statistical inference based on the maximum mean discrepancy. These methods often require, or are enhanced by, the availability of a closed-form expression for the kernel mean embedding. However, deriving such expressions can be challenging, limiting the applicability of kernel-based techniques when practitioners do not have access to a closed-form embedding. This paper addresses this limitation by providing a comprehensive dictionary of known kernel mean embeddings, along with practical tools for deriving new embeddings from known ones. We also provide a Python library that includes minimal implementations of the embeddings.</description>

      <title>The Masked Matrix Separation Problem: A First Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a known matrix that is the sum of a low rank matrix and a masked sparse matrix, we wish to recover both the low rank component and the sparse component. The sparse matrix is masked in the sense that a linear transformation has been applied on its left. We propose a convex optimization problem to recover the low rank and sparse matrices, which generalizes the robust PCA framework. We provide incoherence conditions for the success of the proposed convex optimizaiton problem, adapting to the masked setting. The ``mask'' matrix can be quite general as long as a so-called restricted infinity norm condition is satisfied. Further analysis on the incoherence condition is provided and we conclude with promising numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Entrywise Approximate Matrix Inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the bit complexity of inverting diagonally dominant matrices, which are associated with random walk quantities such as hitting times and escape probabilities. Such quantities can be exponentially small, even on undirected unit-weighted graphs. However, their nonnegativity suggests that they can be approximated entrywise, leading to a stronger notion of approximation than vector norm-based error.
  Under this notion of error, existing Laplacian solvers and fast matrix multiplication approaches have bit complexities of $mn^2$ and $n^{\omega+1}$, respectively, where $m$ is the number of nonzero entries in the matrix, $n$ is its size, and $\omega$ is the matrix multiplication exponent.
  We present algorithms that compute entrywise $\exp(\epsilon)$-approximate inverses of row diagonally dominant $L$-matrices (RDDL) in two settings: (1) when the matrix entries are given in floating-point representation; (2) when they are given in fixed-point representation.
  For floating-point inputs, we present a cubic-time algorithm and show that it has an optimal running time under the all-pairs shortest paths (APSP) conjecture.
  For fixed-point inputs, we present several algorithms for solving linear systems and inverting RDDL and SDDM matrices, all with high probability.
  Omitting logarithmic factors:
  (1) For SDDM matrices, we provide an algorithm for solving a linear system with entrywise approximation guarantees using $\tilde{O}(m\sqrt{n})$ bit operations, and another for computing an entrywise approximate inverse using $\tilde{O}(mn)$ bit operations.
  (2) For RDDL matrices, we present an algorithm for solving a linear system using $\tilde{O}(mn^{1+o(1)})$ bit operations, and two algorithms for computing an entrywise approximate inverse: one using $\tilde{O}(n^{\omega+0.5})$ bit operations, and the other using $\tilde{O}(mn^{1.5+o(1)})$ bit operations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in quasi-Monte Carlo integration have demonstrated that the median trick significantly enhances the convergence rate of linearly scrambled digital net estimators. In this work, we leverage the quantiles of such estimators to construct confidence intervals with asymptotically valid coverage for high-dimensional integrals. By analyzing the distribution of the integration error for a class of infinitely differentiable integrands, we prove that as the sample size grows, the error decomposes into an asymptotically symmetric component and a vanishing perturbation, which guarantees that a quantile-based interval for the median estimator asymptotically captures the target integral with the nominal coverage probability.</description>

      <title>Composable and adaptive design of machine learning interatomic potentials guided by Fisher-information analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An adaptive physics-informed model design strategy for machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) is proposed. This strategy follows an iterative reconfiguration of composite models from single-term models, followed by a unified training procedure. A model evaluation method based on the Fisher information matrix (FIM) and multiple-property error metrics is proposed to guide model reconfiguration and hyperparameter optimization. Combining the model reconfiguration and the model evaluation subroutines, we provide an adaptive MLIP design strategy that balances flexibility and extensibility. In a case study of designing models against a structurally diverse niobium dataset, we managed to obtain an optimal configuration with 75 parameters generated by our framework that achieved a force RMSE of 0.172 eV/{\AA} and an energy RMSE of 0.013 eV/atom.</description>

Abstract: We present here some results for the PDE related to the logHeston model. We present different regularity results and prove a verification theorem that shows that the solution produced via the Feynman-Kac theorem is the unique viscosity solution for a wide choice of initial data (even discontinuous) and source data. In addition, our techniques do not use Feller's condition at any time. In the end, we prove a convergence theorem to approximate this solution by means of a hybrid (finite differences/tree scheme) approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.05662v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While leverage score sampling provides powerful tools for approximating solutions to large least squares problems, the cost of computing exact scores and sampling often prohibits practical application. This paper addresses this challenge by developing a new and efficient algorithm for exact leverage score sampling applicable to matrices that are lower column subsets of Kronecker product matrices. We synthesize relevant approximation guarantees and detail the algorithm that specifically leverages this structural property for computational efficiency. Through numerical examples, we demonstrate that utilizing efficiently computed exact leverage scores via our methods significantly reduces approximation errors, as compared to established approximate leverage score sampling strategies when applied to this important class of structured matrices.</description>

      <title>WKB-based third order method for the highly oscillatory 1D stationary Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces an efficient high-order numerical method for solving the 1D stationary Schr\"odinger equation in the highly oscillatory regime. Building upon the ideas from [Arnold, Ben Abdallah, Negulescu, SIAM J. Numer. Anal., 2011], we first analytically transform the given equation into a smoother (i.e. less oscillatory) equation. By developing sufficiently accurate quadratures for several (iterated) oscillatory integrals occurring in the Picard approximation of the solution, we obtain a one-step method that is third order w.r.t. the step size. The accuracy and efficiency of the method are illustrated through several numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Antithetic Multilevel Methods for Elliptic and Hypo-Elliptic Diffusions with Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13489v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new antithetic multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) method for the estimation of expectations with respect to laws of diffusion processes that can be elliptic or hypo-elliptic. In particular, we consider the case where one has to resort to time discretization of the diffusion and numerical simulation of such schemes. Inspired by recent works, we introduce a new MLMC estimator of expectations, which does not require any L\'evy area simulation and has a strong error of order 2 and a weak error of order 2. We then show how this approach can be used in the context of the filtering problem associated to partially observed diffusions with discrete time observations. We illustrate that in numerical simulations our new approaches provide efficiency gains for several problems, particularly when the diffusion process is hypo-elliptic, relative to some existing methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16914v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the unique continuation problem for the Schr\"odinger equations. We prove a H\"older type conditional stability estimate and build up a parameterized stabilized finite element scheme adaptive to the \textit{a priori} knowledge of the solution, achieving error estimates in interior domains with convergence up to continuous stability. The approximability of the scheme to solutions with only $H^1$-regularity is studied and the convergence rate for solutions with regularity higher than $H^1$ is also shown. Comparisons in terms of different parameterization for different regularities will be illustrated with respect to the convergence and condition numbers of the linear systems. Finally, numerical experiments will be given to illustrate the theory.</description>

      <title>Cons-training Tensor Networks: Embedding and Optimization Over Discrete Linear Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09005v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we introduce a novel family of tensor networks, termed constrained matrix product states (MPS), designed to incorporate exactly arbitrary discrete linear constraints, including inequalities, into sparse block structures. These tensor networks are particularly tailored for modeling distributions with support strictly over the feasible space, offering benefits such as reducing the search space in optimization problems, alleviating overfitting, improving training efficiency, and decreasing model size. Central to our approach is the concept of a quantum region, an extension of quantum numbers traditionally used in U(1) symmetric tensor networks, adapted to capture any linear constraint, including the unconstrained scenario. We further develop a novel canonical form for these new MPS, which allow for the merging and factorization of tensor blocks according to quantum region fusion rules and permit optimal truncation schemes. Utilizing this canonical form, we apply an unsupervised training strategy to optimize arbitrary objective functions subject to discrete linear constraints. Our method's efficacy is demonstrated by solving the quadratic knapsack problem, achieving superior performance compared to a leading nonlinear integer programming solver. Additionally, we analyze the complexity and scalability of our approach, demonstrating its potential in addressing complex constrained combinatorial optimization problems.</description>

      <title>A boundary integral equation formulation for transient electromagnetic transmission problems on Lipschitz domains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05823v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a boundary integral formulation for the dynamic problem of electromagnetic scattering and transmission by homogeneous dielectric obstacles. In the spirit of Costabel and Stephan, we use the transmission conditions to reduce the number of unknown densities and to formulate a system of coupled boundary integral equations describing the scattered and transmitted waves. The system is transformed into the Laplace domain where it is proven to be stable and uniquely solvable. The Laplace domain stability estimates are then used to establish the stability and unique solvability of the original time domain problem. Finally, we show how the bounds obtained in both Laplace and time domains can be used to derive error estimates for semi discrete Galerkin discretizations in space and for fully discrete numerical schemes that use Convolution Quadrature for time discretization and a conforming Galerkin method for discretization of the space variables.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Finite Element Method for Phase Field Fracture Models Based on Recovery Error Estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01177v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The phase field model is a widely used mathematical approach for describing crack propagation in continuum damage fractures. In the context of phase field fracture simulations, adaptive finite element methods (AFEM) are often employed to address the mesh size dependency of the model. However, existing AFEM approaches for this application frequently rely on heuristic adjustments and empirical parameters for mesh refinement. In this paper, we introduce an adaptive finite element method based on a recovery type posteriori error estimates approach grounded in theoretical analysis. This method transforms the gradient of the numerical solution into a smoother function space, using the difference between the recovered gradient and the original numerical gradient as an error indicator for adaptive mesh refinement. This enables the automatic capture of crack propagation directions without the need for empirical parameters. We have implemented this adaptive method for the Hybrid formulation of the phase field model using the open-source software package FEALPy. The accuracy and efficiency of the proposed approach are demonstrated through simulations of classical 2D and 3D brittle fracture examples, validating the robustness and effectiveness of our implementation.</description>

      <title>$\Gamma$-convergence of an Enhanced Finite Element Method for Mani\`a's Problem Exhibiting the Lavrentiev Gap Phenomenon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06434v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well-known that numerically approximating calculus of variations problems possessing a Lavrentiev Gap Phenomenon (LGP) is challenging, and the standard numerical methodologies such as finite element, finite difference and discontinuous Galerkin methods fail to give convergent methods because they cannot overcome the gap. This paper is a continuation of previous work by Schnake and Feng, where a promising enhanced finite element method was proposed to overcome the LGP in the classical Mani\`a's problem. The goal of this paper is to provide a complete $\Gamma$-convergence proof for this enhanced finite element method, hence, establishing a theoretical foundation for the method. The cruxes of the convergence analysis are taking advantage of the regularity of the minimizer and viewing the minimization problem as posed over the fractional Sobolev space $W^{1 + s, p}$ (for $s &gt; 0$) rather than the original admissible space.</description>

      <title>Revealing Floating-Point Accumulation Orders in Software/Hardware Implementations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00442v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accumulation-based operations, such as summation and matrix multiplication, are fundamental to numerous computational domains. However, their accumulation orders are often undocumented in existing software and hardware implementations, making it difficult for developers to ensure consistent results across systems. To address this issue, we introduce FPRev, a diagnostic tool designed to reveal the accumulation order in the software and hardware implementations through numerical testing. With FPRev, developers can identify and compare accumulation orders, enabling developers to create reproducible software and verify implementation equivalence.
  FPRev is a testing-based tool that non-intrusively reveals the accumulation order by analyzing the outputs of the tested implementation for distinct specially designed inputs. Employing FPRev, we showcase the accumulation orders of popular libraries (such as NumPy and PyTorch) on CPUs and GPUs (including GPUs with specialized matrix accelerators such as Tensor Cores). We also validate the efficiency of FPRev through extensive experiments. FPRev exhibits a lower time complexity compared to the basic solution. FPRev will be open-sourced on GitHub.</description>

      <title>On the optimal choice of the illumination function in photoacoustic tomography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06609v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work studies the inverse problem of photoacoustic tomography (more precisely, the acoustic subproblem) as the identification of a space-dependent source parameter. The model consists of a wave equation involving a time-fractional damping term to account for power law frequency dependence of the attenuation, as relevant in ultrasonics. We solve the inverse problem in a Bayesian framework using a Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimate, and for this purpose derive an explicit expression for the adjoint operator. On top of this, we consider optimization of the choice of the laser excitation function, which is the time-dependent part of the source in this model, to enhance the reconstruction result. The method employs the $A$-optimality criterion for Bayesian optimal experimental design with Gaussian prior and Gaussian noise. To efficiently approximate the cost functional, we introduce an approximation scheme based on projection onto finite-dimensional subspaces. Finally, we present numerical results that illustrate the theory.</description>

Abstract: Pole-swapping algorithms, generalizations of bulge-chasing algorithms, have been shown to be a viable alternative to the bulge-chasing QZ algorithm for solving the generalized eigenvalue problem for a matrix pencil A - {\lambda}B. It is natural to try to devise a pole-swapping algorithm that solves the standard eigenvalue problem for a single matrix A. This paper introduces such an algorithm and shows that it is competitive with Francis's bulge-chasing QR algorithm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07040v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we propose high-order basis-update &amp; Galerkin (BUG) integrators based on explicit Runge-Kutta methods for large-scale matrix differential equations. These dynamical low-rank integrators are high-order extensions of the BUG integrator and are constructed by performing a BUG step at each stage of the Runge-Kutta method. In this way, the resulting Runge-Kutta BUG integrator is robust to the presence of small singular values and does not involve backward time-integration steps. We provide an error bound, which shows that the Runge-Kutta BUG integrator retains the order of convergence of the associated Runge-Kutta method until the error reaches a plateau corresponding to the low-rank truncation error and which vanishes as the rank becomes full. This error bound is finally validated experimentally on three numerical test cases. The results demonstrate the high-order convergence of the Runge-Kutta BUG integrator and its superior accuracy compared to other dynamical low-rank integrators proposed in the literature.</description>

Abstract: We integrate random sketching techniques into block orthogonalization schemes needed for s-step GMRES. The resulting block orthogonalization schemes generate the basis vectors whose overall orthogonality error is bounded by machine precision as long as each of the corresponding block vectors are numerically full rank. We implement these randomized block orthogonalization schemes using standard distributed-memory linear algebra kernels for s-step GMRES available in the Trilinos software packages. Our performance results on the Perlmutter supercomputer (with four NVIDIA A100 GPUs per node) demonstrate that these randomized techniques can enhance the numerical stability of the orthogonalization and overall solver, without a significant increase in the execution time.</description>

      <title>Higher-order meshless schemes for hyperbolic equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05942v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the order, efficiency, stability and positivity of several meshless schemes for linear scalar hyperbolic equations. Meshless schemes are Generalised Finite Difference Methods (GFDMs) for arbitrary irregular grids in which there is no connectivity between the grid points. We propose a new MUSCL-like meshless scheme that uses a central stencil, with which we can achieve arbitrarily high orders, and compare it to existing meshless upwind schemes and meshless WENO schemes. The stability of the newly proposed scheme is guaranteed by an upwind reconstruction to the midpoints of the stencil. The new meshless MUSCL scheme is also efficient due to the reuse of the GFDM solution in the reconstruction. We combine the new MUSCL scheme with a Multi-dimensional Optimal Order Detection (MOOD) procedure to avoid spurious oscillations at discontinuities. In one spatial dimension, our fourth order MUSCL scheme outperforms existing WENO and upwind schemes in terms of stability and accuracy. In two spatial dimensions, our MUSCL scheme achieves similar accuracy to an existing WENO scheme but is significantly more stable.</description>

      <title>Sampling and estimation on manifolds using the Langevin diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14882v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Error bounds are derived for sampling and estimation using a discretization of an intrinsically defined Langevin diffusion with invariant measure $\text{d}\mu_\phi \propto e^{-\phi} \mathrm{dvol}_g $ on a compact Riemannian manifold. Two estimators of linear functionals of $\mu_\phi $ based on the discretized Markov process are considered: a time-averaging estimator based on a single trajectory and an ensemble-averaging estimator based on multiple independent trajectories. Imposing no restrictions beyond a nominal level of smoothness on $\phi$, first-order error bounds, in discretization step size, on the bias and variance/mean-square error of both estimators are derived. The order of error matches the optimal rate in Euclidean and flat spaces, and leads to a first-order bound on distance between the invariant measure $\mu_\phi$ and a stationary measure of the discretized Markov process. This order is preserved even upon using retractions when exponential maps are unavailable in closed form, thus enhancing practicality of the proposed algorithms. Generality of the proof techniques, which exploit links between two partial differential equations and the semigroup of operators corresponding to the Langevin diffusion, renders them amenable for the study of a more general class of sampling algorithms related to the Langevin diffusion. Conditions for extending analysis to the case of non-compact manifolds are discussed. Numerical illustrations with distributions, log-concave and otherwise, on the manifolds of positive and negative curvature elucidate on the derived bounds and demonstrate practical utility of the sampling algorithm.</description>

Abstract: Objective: Magnetic particle imaging (MPI) is an emerging medical imaging modality which has gained increasing interest in recent years. Among the benefits of MPI are its high temporal resolution, and that the technique does not expose the specimen to any kind of ionizing radiation. It is based on the non-linear response of magnetic nanoparticles to an applied magnetic field. From the electric signal measured in receive coils, the particle concentration has to be reconstructed. Due to the ill-posedness of the reconstruction problem, various regularization methods have been proposed for reconstruction ranging from early stopping methods, via classical Tikhonov regularization and iterative methods to modern machine learning approaches. In this work, we contribute to the latter class: we propose a plug-and-play approach based on a generic zero-shot denoiser with an $\ell^1$-prior.
  Approach: We validate the reconstruction parameters of the method on a hybrid dataset and compare it with the baseline Tikhonov, DIP and the previous PP-MPI, which is a plug-and-play method with denoiser trained on MPI-friendly data.
  Main results: We offer a quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the zero-shot plug-and-play approach on the 3D Open MPI dataset. Moreover, we show the quality of the approach with different levels of preprocessing of the data.
  Significance: The proposed method employs a zero-shot denoiser which has not been trained for the MPI task and therefore saves the cost for training. Moreover, it offers a method that can be potentially applied in future MPI contexts.</description>

      <title>Deterministic complexity analysis of Hermitian eigenproblems</title>

Abstract: In this work we revisit the arithmetic and bit complexity of Hermitian eigenproblems. Recently, [BGVKS, FOCS 2020] proved that a (non-Hermitian) matrix can be diagonalized with a randomized algorithm in $O(n^{\omega}\log^2(n/\epsilon))$ arithmetic operations, where $\omega\lesssim 2.371$ is the square matrix multiplication exponent, and [Shah, SODA 2025] significantly improved the bit complexity for the Hermitian case. Our main goal is to obtain similar deterministic complexity bounds for various Hermitian eigenproblems. In the Real RAM model, we show that a Hermitian matrix can be diagonalized deterministically in $O(n^{\omega}\log(n)+n^2\mathrm{polylog}(n/\epsilon))$ arithmetic operations, improving the classic deterministic $\widetilde O(n^3)$ algorithms, and derandomizing the aforementioned state-of-the-art. The main technical step is a complete, detailed analysis of a well-known divide-and-conquer tridiagonal eigensolver of Gu and Eisenstat [GE95], when accelerated with the Fast Multipole Method, asserting that it can accurately diagonalize a symmetric tridiagonal matrix in nearly-$O(n^2)$ operations. In finite precision, we show that an algorithm by Sch\"onhage [Sch72] to reduce a Hermitian matrix to tridiagonal form is stable in the floating point model, using $O(\log(n/\epsilon))$ bits of precision. This leads to a deterministic algorithm to compute all the eigenvalues of a Hermitian matrix in $O\left(n^{\omega}\mathcal{F}\left(\log(n/\epsilon)\right)+n^2\mathrm{polylog}(n/\epsilon)\right)$ bit operations, where $\mathcal{F}(b)\in\widetilde O(b)$ is the bit complexity of a single floating point operation on $b$ bits. This improves the best known $\widetilde{O}(n^3)$ deterministic and $O\left(n^{\omega}\log^2(n/\epsilon)\mathcal{F}\left(\log(n/\epsilon)\right)\right)$ randomized complexities. We conclude with some other useful subroutines and with open problems.</description>

      <title>Detecting Long QT Syndrome and First-Degree Atrioventricular Block using Single-Lead AI-ECG: A Multi-Center Real-World Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17499v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Home-based single-lead AI-ECG devices have enabled continuous, real-world cardiac monitoring. However, the accuracy of parameter calculations from single-lead AI-ECG algorithm remains to be fully validated, which is critical for conditions such as Long QT Syndrome (LQTS) and First-Degree Atrioventricular Block (AVBI). In this multicenter study, we assessed FeatureDB, an ECG measurements computation algorithm, in the context of single-lead monitoring using three annotated datasets: PTB-XL+ (n=21,354), CSE (n=105), and HeartVoice-ECG-lite (n=369). FeatureDB showed strong correlation with standard ECG machines (12SL and Uni-G) in key measurements (PR, QRS, QT, QTc), and high agreement confirmed by Bland-Altman analysis. In detecting LQTS (AUC=0.786) and AVBI (AUC=0.684), FeatureDB demonstrated diagnostic performance comparable to commercial ECG systems (12SL: 0.859/0.716; Uni-G: 0.817/0.605), significantly outperforming ECGDeli (0.501/0.569). Notably, FeatureDB can operate locally on resource-limited devices, facilitating use in low-connectivity settings. These findings confirm the clinical reliability of FeatureDB for single-lead ECG diagnostics and highlight its potential to bridge traditional ECG diagnostics with wearable technology for scalable cardiovascular monitoring and early intervention.</description>

      <title>Traveling wave profiles for a semi-discrete Burgers equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12171v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We look for traveling waves of the semi-discrete conservation law $4\dot u_j +u_{j+1}^2-u_{j-1}^2 = 0$, using variational principles related to concepts of ``hidden convexity'' appearing in recent studies of various PDE (partial differential equations). We analyze and numerically compute with two variational formulations related to dual convex optimization problems constrained by either the differential-difference equation (DDE) or nonlinear integral equation (NIE) that wave profiles should satisfy. We prove existence theorems conditional on the existence of extrema that satisfy a strict convexity criterion, and numerically exhibit a variety of localized, periodic and non-periodic wave phenomena.</description>
