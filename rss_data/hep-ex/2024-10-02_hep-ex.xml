      <title>High Energy Particle Detection with Large Area Superconducting Microwire Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first detailed study of an 8-channel $2\times2$ mm$^{2}$ WSi superconducting microwire single photon detector (SMSPD) array exposed to 120 GeV proton beam and 8 GeV electron and pion beam at the Fermilab Test Beam Facility. The SMSPD detection efficiency was measured for the first time for protons, electrons, and pions, enabled by the use of a silicon tracking telescope that provided precise spatial resolution of 30 $\mu$m for 120 GeV protons and 130 $\mu$m for 8 GeV electrons and pions. The result demonstrated consistent detection efficiency across pixels and at different bias currents. Time resolution of 1.15 ns was measured for the first time for SMSPD with proton, electron, and pions, enabled by the use of an MCP-PMT which provided a ps-level reference time stamp. The results presented is the first step towards developing SMSPD array systems optimized for high energy particle detection and identification for future accelerator-based experiments.</description>

      <title>Learning to Reconstruct Quirky Tracks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analysis of data from particle physics experiments traditionally sacrifices some sensitivity to new particles for the sake of practical computability, effectively ignoring some potentially striking signatures. However, recent advances in ML-based tracking allow for new inroads into previously inaccessible territory, such as reconstruction of tracks which do not follow helical trajectories. This paper presents a demonstration of the capacity of ML-based tracking to reconstruct the oscillating trajectories of quirks. The technique used is not specific to quirks, and opens the door to a program of searching for many kinds of non-standard tracks.</description>

      <title>Latest oscillation results from Daya Bay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Daya Bay reactor neutrino experiment, which pioneered the measurement of a non-zero value for the neutrino mixing angle $\theta_{13}$ in 2012, operated for nearly nine years, from Nov.~24, 2011, to Dec.~12, 2020. Antineutrinos produced by six reactors, each with a thermal power of 2.9 GW, were detected by eight identically designed detectors located in two near and one far underground experimental halls. The experimental setup, featuring kilometer-scale baselines between the detectors and reactors, enabled precise investigations within the three-neutrino mixing framework. This proceeding presents the latest measurements of the neutrino mixing angle $\theta_{13}$ and the mass-squared difference $\Delta m_{32}^2$, based on samples tagged via gadolinium capture ($n$Gd) and hydrogen capture ($n$H). The combined results from Daya Bay's most recent $n$Gd and $n$H data sets provide a $2.6\%$ precision for $\sin^22\theta_{13}$. Additionally, a search for light sterile neutrinos with full data set is summarized.</description>

      <title>From angular coefficients to quantum observables: a phenomenological appraisal in di-boson systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the growing interest in accessing the spin structure of multi-boson processes and in measuring quantum entanglement at high energies, we study polarisation and spin-correlation coefficients in di-boson systems. We show that higher-order corrections of QCD and electroweak type, off-shell modelling, and realistic effects such as fiducial selections and neutrino reconstruction are unavoidable to properly determine such coefficients, and consequently to provide a sound interpretation of observables sensitive to quantum entanglement and Bell-inequality violation. Our findings are based on a detailed phenomenological analysis of boson pairs at the LHC, either in inclusive electroweak production or coming from Higgs-boson decays.</description>

      <title>A Comparison of Micromegas with x/y Strip Charge Readouts for Directional Recoil Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting the topology and direction of low-energy nuclear and electronic recoils is broadly desirable in nuclear and particle physics, with applications in coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CE$\nu$NS), astrophysical neutrino measurements, probing dark matter (DM) beneath the neutrino fog, and confirming the galactic origin of DM. Gaseous Time Projection Chambers (TPCs) offer the required gain and readout granularity, but must be large to achieve the required volume. Therefore, scalable, cost-effective TPC readout technologies are essential. High-resolution $x/y$ strip readouts, previously identified as the optimal balance between cost-efficiency and performance, are examined here. To guide the readout design of a 40-L detector under construction, we present a comparative analysis of nine $x/y$ strip configurations with Micromegas amplification. Each setup employs VMM3a ASIC within the RD51 Scalable Readout System (SRS) for strip readout and a pulse height analyzer for reading out the Micromegas mesh. These complementary techniques assess gain, gain resolution, $x/y$ charge sharing, and point resolution of each setup. Configurations with a diamond-like carbon (DLC) layer exhibit improved spark resistance, allowing larger maximal gain and improved fractional gain resolution without notable impact on the point resolution. Although the DLC reduces charge fraction on lower strips, this can be mitigated by narrowing the upper strips. Our results allow us to select the optimal readout for future detectors. We also observe clear 3D tracks from alpha particles, with performance in good agreement with a simple simulation. Overall, Micromegas with $x/y$ strip readout are promising for low-energy recoil observatories. However, dedicated amplification devices and/or improved electronics are needed to reach the fundamental performance limit of 3D electron counting.</description>

      <title>Looping Around Neutrino Charge Radius at Ultra-Near Reactor Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We scrutinize the potential of upcoming ultra-near reactor neutrino experiments to detect radiative corrections in the elastic neutrino-electron scattering channel, focusing on the JUNO-TAO and CLOUD detectors, which employ advanced scintillator detection technologies. Previous reactor experiments have already constrained the electron neutrino charge radius, which is a neutrino property associated with a certain subset of the total radiative corrections, and have achieved limits that are only about an order of magnitude away from the Standard Model prediction. Our study demonstrates that JUNO-TAO and CLOUD could discover the neutrino charge radius in the near future, considering the established treatment of the charge radius. However, we show that it is necessary to go beyond this standard treatment. By including the complete set of one-loop level radiative corrections, we find a partial cancellation with the charge radius effect, reducing the experimental sensitivity to this quantity. Nevertheless, JUNO-TAO and CLOUD still have the potential to achieve a $5\sigma$ discovery but over longer timescales within a reasonable operational timeframe.</description>

      <title>Effective field theory analysis of rare $|\Delta c|=|\Delta u|=1$ charm decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a global analysis of $|\Delta c| = |\Delta u| = 1$ transitions using recent data on $D^0 \to \mu^+\mu^-$, $D^+ \to \pi ^+\,\mu^+\mu^-$, $\Lambda_c \to p\,\mu^+\mu^-$, and $D^0 \to \pi^+\pi^-\,\mu^+\mu^-$ decays, and work out constraints on new physics Wilson coefficients $\mathcal{C}_{7,9,10}^{(\prime)}$. While results are consistent with the standard model, we find sizeable room for new physics that can be cleanly signaled with null test observables, not probed with searches in other sectors such as kaon and $b$-decays. The decay $D^0 \to \pi^+\pi^-\,\mu^+\mu^-$ requires better understanding of hadronic contributions to be competitive in the current fit. Progress can be achieved by precision study of the double differential decay rate in the dipion and dimuon masses, together with improved theory modelling and $D \to \pi \pi$ transition form factors. On the other hand, the 4-body decay is an important contributor to the future global analysis due to its angular distributions that probe complementary combinations of Wilson coefficients, and as a QCD laboratory. The decay $\Lambda_c \to p\,\ell^+\ell^-$ is the rising star due to the simplicity of a 3-body decay with available form factors from lattice QCD, sensitivity to both 4-fermion and electromagnetic dipole couplings and its null test forward-backward asymmetry.</description>

      <title>The CuboDAQ Data Acquisition System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: CuboDAQ is a custom data acquisition system to read out SiPM-based detectors. It features electronic boards to digitize the SiPMs signal, an FPGA-based system-on-module board, the connectivity to transmit the data to a central server, and all the software necessary to operate them. The front-end is based on the TOFPET2 ASIC, produced by PETsys, connected to a custom board, featuring an Enclustra Mercury SA1 module with a Cyclone~V FPGA. Multiple boards can be operated synchronously by distributing the clock and synchronous reset signals from a central source. The system features a complete software framework to calibrate and monitor the detectors, to acquire and process data and to perform track reconstruction. The CuboDAQ system performance has been evaluated in different scenarios and can cope with sustained rates of above $4\cdot 10^6$ hits/s, with peaks of more than $7\cdot 10^6$ hits/s. This system has been employed for the readout of the SND@LHC detector at CERN, a testbeam telescope and lab setups.</description>

      <title>Hadronic rescattering to solve helicity puzzle in $B^+\to p\bar p \pi^+(K^+)$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the contribution of hadronic final state interactions (FSI) to propose a production mechanism and interpret the puzzle on helicity angle distributions in $B^+\to p\bar p \pi^+$ and $B^+\to p\bar p K^+$ decays. Experimental results indicate opposite helicity angle $\theta_p$ distributions in those two channels with the difference presenting a remarkable linear dependence on $\cos \theta_p$. We assume the production mechanism is driven by $B^+\to xy\, m^+ \to p\bar p m^+$, where $m =\pi$ or $K$, and $xy$ represents favorable mesonic decay channels producing $p\bar p$. We develop a model that includes three-body final state interaction between the $p\,,~\bar p$ and $\pi^+$ or $K^+$ considering the dominance of elastic channels $\pi^+p$ and $K^+\bar p$ interactions below 2\,GeV/c$^2$. Our three-body framework with FSI explains qualitatively the observed opposite behavior of the helicity distributions and the observed linearity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this contribution, we present new results of next-to-leading order (NLO) electroweak corrections to the doubly polarized $W^+W^-$ production cross sections at the LHC, via the full leptonic final state. This calculation has been recently achieved independently by two groups: one in Germany and our group in Vietnam. A comparison of the two results will be presented. We include also the NLO QCD corrections in the numerical analysis since they are dominant and therefore important for comparison with experimental results.</description>

      <title>Long-lived sterile neutrinos from an axionlike particle at Belle II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Axionlike particles (ALPs) can be produced in meson decays via tree-level quark-flavor-violating couplings, and decay to a pair of sterile neutrinos if also coupled to them. Such light sterile neutrinos are necessarily long-lived and may give rise to striking signatures of displaced vertices (DVs) at terrestrial experiments. In this work, we study the prospect of the ongoing Belle II experiment for detecting the sterile neutrinos from the ALP, leveraging the $\mathcal{O}(10^{10})$ $B$-mesons produced at the experiment. We propose search strategies for one or two DVs, and perform Monte-Carlo simulations in order to estimate the sensitivity reach of Belle II to active-sterile-neutrino mixing $|V_{eN}|^2$ as functions of the sterile-neutrino mass, under the legitimate assumption of zero background. Our results show that the proposed search strategies can probe values of $|V_{eN}|^2$ orders of magnitude beyond the existing bounds. Compared to the one-DV search, the two-DV one, despite its weaker sensitivities as a result of double exponential suppression of the sterile-neutrino decay positions, possesses the advantage of possible full reconstruction of the signal event allowing for pinning down the masses of the sterile neutrino and the ALP, if a discovery is made.</description>

      <title>Hidden charm-bottom structures $bc\overline{b}\overline{c}$: Axial-vector case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mass and width of a hidden charm-bottom axial-vector structure $T$ containing $bc \overline{b}\overline{c}$ quarks are calculated in QCD sum rule framework. It is treated as a diquark-antidiquark state built of scalar diquark and axial-vector antidiquark components. The mass of $T$ is computed using the two-point sum rule method. The width of this particle is evaluated by considering eight decay modes: The decays to $\eta _{b}J/\psi $, $\eta _{c}\Upsilon (1S)$, $B_{c}^{-}B_{c}^{\ast +}$, and $B_{c}^{+}B_{c}^{\ast -}$ are dissociation processes, in which all initial quarks are distributed between the final-state particles. Four decays to $DD$ mesons with appropriate charges and spin-parities are channels generated due to the annihilation of $b$ and $\overline{b}$ quarks from $T$. Partial widths for all of these processes are obtained by employing the three-point sum rule approach necessary to find the strong couplings at relevant tetraquark-meson-meson vertices. Our results for the mass $m=(12715\pm 90)~\mathrm{MeV}$ and width $\Gamma[T] =(104.2 \pm 11.2)~ \mathrm{MeV}$ of the tetraquark $T$, as well as its numerous decay channels explored in this article are useful for ongoing and future experimental investigations of fully heavy resonances.</description>

      <title>Recent $J/\psi$ measurements at the PHENIX experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quarkonium is an ideal probe to explore the properties of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Unlike Large Hadron Collider (LHC) measurements, quarkonium production at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) has different production mechanisms, can access different kinematic phase space and may experience different medium densities/temperatures. The PHENIX experiment has collected a large $J/\psi \to \mu^{+}\mu^{-}$ data set within its unique pseudorapidity region of $1.2&lt;|\eta|&lt;2.2$ in $p+p$, $p+A$ and $A+A$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 200 GeV from 2014 to 2016. Latest results of normalized charged particle multiplicity dependent normalized forward $J/\psi$ yields and normalized forward $\psi(2S)$ to $J/\psi$ ratio in 200 GeV $p+p$ collisions as well as forward $J/\psi$ azimuthal anisotropy in 200 GeV Au+Au collisions will be shown. Comparison with other RHIC and LHC measurements and latest theoretical calculations will be discussed. These PHENIX results provide their unique contributions in improving the understanding of the multi-parton interaction contribution to charmonium production and the recombination/coalescence contribution to charmonium formation within Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) at RHIC energies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proposed Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) will utilize high-luminosity high-energy electron+proton ($e+p$) and electron+nucleus ($e+A$) collisions to solve several fundamental questions including searching for gluon saturation and studying the proton/nuclear structure. Complementary to the ongoing EIC project detector technical prototype carried out by the ePIC collaboration, a Depleted Monolithic Active Pixel Sensor (i.e., MALTA2) based fast timing silicon tracking detector (FMT) has been proposed to provide additional hits for track reconstruction in the forward and backward region at the EIC to improve the overall track reconstruction quality. The fast timing resolution of the MALTA2 technology will help reject background events at the EIC as well. Progress of latest MALTA2 R$\&amp;$D, the development of a new MALTA2 quad-sensor prototype module and impacts of the proposed FMT in EIC physics studies will be discussed.</description>

      <title>Production and study of antideuterium with the GBAR beamline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The potential of circulating antideuterons ($\mathrm{\overline{d}}$) in the AD/ELENA facility at CERN is currently under investigation. Approximately 100 $\mathrm{\overline{d}}$ per bunch could be delivered as a $100\,\mathrm{keV}$ beam based on measured cross-sections. These $\mathrm{\overline{d}}$ could be further decelerated to $12\,\mathrm{keV}$ using the GBAR scheme, enabling the synthesis of antideuterium ($\mathrm{\overline{D}}$) via charge exchange with positronium, a technique demonstrated with $6\,\mathrm{keV}$ antiprotons for antihydrogen production. While this would demonstrate the production of low-energy $\mathrm{\overline{D}}$, higher fluxes are required to facilitate spectroscopic studies. We propose enhancing the anti-atom production by using laser-excited positronium in the $2P$ state within a cavity, which is expected to increase the $\mathrm{\overline{D}}(2S)$ production cross-section by almost an order of magnitude for $\mathrm{\overline{d}}$ with $2\,\mathrm{keV}$ energy. The ELENA team is currently studying the possibility of increasing the $\mathrm{\overline{d}}$ rate using an optimized new target geometry. We present the projected precision for measuring the antideuterium Lamb shift and extracting the antideuteron charge radius, as a function of the beam flux.</description>

      <title>Investigating the composition of the K$^*_0(700)$ state with $\pi^\pm$K$^0_{\rm S}$ correlations at the LHC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12830v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The first measurements of femtoscopic correlations with the particle pair combinations $\pi^\pm$K$^0_{\rm S}$ in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) are reported by the ALICE experiment. Using the femtoscopic approach, it is shown that it is possible to study the elusive K$^*_0(700)$ particle that has been considered a tetraquark candidate for over forty years. Source and final-state interaction parameters are extracted by fitting a model assuming a Gaussian source to the experimentally measured two-particle correlation functions. The final-state interaction in the $\pi^\pm$K$^0_{\rm S}$ system is modeled through a resonant scattering amplitude, defined in terms of a mass and a coupling parameter. The extracted mass and Breit-Wigner width, derived from the coupling parameter, of the final-state interaction are found to be consistent with previous measurements of the K$^*_0(700)$. The small value and increase of the correlation strength with increasing source size support the hypothesis that the K$^*_0(700)$ is a four-quark state, i.e. a tetraquark state of the form $({\rm q_1},\overline{\rm q_2}, {\rm q_3}, \overline{\rm q_3})$ in which ${\rm q_1}$, ${\rm q_2}$, and ${\rm q_3}$ indicate the flavor of the valence quarks of the $\pi$ and K$^0_{\rm S}$. This latter trend is also confirmed via a simple geometric model that assumes a tetraquark structure of the K$^*_0(700)$ resonance.</description>

      <title>Observation of enhanced long-range elliptic anisotropies inside high-multiplicity jets in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17103v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A search for partonic collective effects inside jets produced in proton-proton collisions is performed via correlation measurements of charged constituents using the CMS detector at the CERN LHC. The analysis uses data collected at a center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 138 fb$^{-1}$. Jets are reconstructed with the anti-$k_\mathrm{T}$ algorithm with a distance parameter of 0.8 and are required to have transverse momentum greater than 550 GeV and pseudorapidity $\lvert\eta\rvert$ $\lt$ 1.6. Two-particle correlations among the charged constituents within the jets are studied as functions of the particles' azimuthal angle and pseudorapidity separations ($\Delta\phi^*$ and $\Delta\eta^*$) in a jet coordinate basis, where constituents' $\eta^*$, $\phi^*$ are defined relative to the direction of the jet. The correlation functions are studied in classes of in-jet charged-particle multiplicity up to $N_\text{ch}^\mathrm{j}$ $\approx$ 100. Fourier harmonics are extracted from long-range azimuthal correlation functions to characterize azimuthal anisotropy for $\lvert\Delta\eta^*\rvert$ $\gt$ 2. For low-$N_\text{ch}^\mathrm{j}$, the long-range elliptic anisotropic harmonic, $v^*_2$, is observed to decrease with $N_\text{ch}^\mathrm{j}$. This trend is well described by Monte Carlo event generators. However, a rising trend for $v^*_2$ emerges at $N_\text{ch}^\mathrm{j}$ $\gtrsim$ 80, hinting at a possible onset of collective behavior, which is not reproduced by the models tested. This observation yields new insights into the dynamics of parton fragmentation processes in the vacuum.</description>

      <title>CPT and Lorentz symmetry tests with hydrogen using a novel in-beam hyperfine spectroscopy method applicable to antihydrogen experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17763v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a Rabi-type measurement of two ground-state hydrogen hyperfine transitions performed in two opposite external magnetic field directions. This puts first constraints at the level of 2.3 10^-21 GeV on a set of coefficients of the Standard Model Extension, which were not measured by previous experiments. Moreover, we introduce a novel method, applicable to antihydrogen hyperfine spectroscopy in a beam, that determines the zero-field hyperfine transition frequency from the two transitions measured at the same magnetic field. Our value, nu_0 = 1.420 405 751 63(63) GHz, is in agreement with literature at a relative precision of 0.44 ppb. This is the highest precision achieved on hydrogen in a beam, improving over previous results by a factor of 6.</description>

Abstract: The inclusive production of the charm-strange baryon $\Omega^{0}_{\rm c}$ is measured for the first time via its semileptonic decay into $\Omega^{-}\rm e^{+}\nu_{e}$ at midrapidity ($|y|&lt;0.8$) in proton$-$proton (pp) collisions at the centre-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV with the ALICE detector at the LHC. The transverse momentum ($p_{\rm T}$) differential cross section multiplied by the branching ratio is presented in the interval $2&lt;p_{\rm T}&lt;12~{\rm GeV}/c$. The branching-fraction ratio ${\rm BR}(\Omega^0_{\rm c} \rightarrow \Omega^{-}{\rm e}^{+}\nu_{\rm e})/ {\rm BR}(\Omega^0_{\rm c} \rightarrow \Omega^{-}{\pi}^{+})$ is measured to be 1.12 $\pm$ 0.22 (stat.) $\pm$ 0.27 (syst.). Comparisons with other experimental measurements, as well as with theoretical calculations, are presented.</description>

      <title>Investigating strangeness enhancement with multiplicity in pp collisions using angular correlations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14511v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A study of strange hadron production associated with hard scattering processes and with the underlying event is conducted to investigate the origin of the enhanced production of strange hadrons in small collision systems characterised by large charged-particle multiplicities. For this purpose, the production of the single-strange meson ${\rm K^0_S}$ and the double-strange baryon $\Xi^{\pm}$ is measured, in each event, in the azimuthal direction of the highest-$p_{\rm T}$ particle (``trigger" particle), related to hard scattering processes, and in the direction transverse to it in azimuth, associated with the underlying event, in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}=5.02$ TeV and $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV using the ALICE detector at the LHC. The per-trigger yields of ${\rm K^0_S}$ and $\Xi^{\pm}$ are dominated by the transverse-to-leading production (i.e., in the direction transverse to the trigger particle), whose contribution relative to the toward-leading production is observed to increase with the event charged-particle multiplicity. The transverse-to-leading and the toward-leading $\Xi^{\pm}$/${\rm K^0_S}$ yield ratios increase with the multiplicity of charged particles, suggesting that strangeness enhancement with multiplicity is associated with both hard scattering processes and the underlying event. The relative production of $\Xi^{\pm}$ with respect to ${\rm K^0_S}$ is higher in transverse-to-leading processes over the whole multiplicity interval covered by the measurement. The ${\rm K}^{0}_{\rm{S}}$ and $\Xi^{\pm}$ per-trigger yields and yield ratios are compared with predictions of three different phenomenological models, namely PYTHIA 8.2 with the Monash tune, PYTHIA 8.2 with ropes and EPOS LHC. The comparison shows that none of them can quantitatively describe either the transverse-to-leading or the toward-leading yields of ${\rm K}^{0}_{\rm{S}}$ and $\Xi^{\pm}$.</description>

      <title>The Search for the Cosmological Axion -- A New Refined Narrow Mass Window and Detection Scheme</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09553v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based upon a previous axion mass proposal and detection scheme, as well as considering the axion mass ranges suggested by persuasive simulations in recent years, we present a revised axion/ALP search strategy and our calculations, concentrating on a slightly narrower axion mass (and corresponding Compton frequency) window in this report. The sole aim of this study was to provide a pin-point mass value for a resonant cavity detection scheme, and the outcome of calculations presented here reinforces the earlier mass window and the results (slightly different values from our calculations but within the same window) obtained by the calculations and simulations by Kawasaki et al. (2015) and Buschmann et al. (2020). The window comprises the spectral region of 18.99 to 19.01GHz (that falls within the Ku microwave band), with a center frequency of 19.00GHz (+0.1GHz), with equivalence to an axion mass range of 78.6 to 79.6 micro-eV, with the center mass at the value of 78.582 (+5.0) micro-eV, our suggested most likely value for an axionic/ALP field mass, if these fields exist. Our search strategy, as summarized herewith, is based upon the assumption that the dark matter that exists in the current epoch of our physical universe is dominated by axions and thus the local observable axion density is the density of the light cold dark matter, permeating our local neighborhood (mainly in the Milky Way galactic halo). Some ideas and the design of an experiment, based upon the inverse Primakoff effect, and built around a Josephson Parametric Amplifier and Resonant Tunneling Diode combination installed in a resonant RF cavity, are also some possibly novel ideas, as introduced in this report.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.16661v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Antineutrinos from nuclear reactors have the potential to be used for reactor monitoring in the mid- to far-field under certain conditions. Antineutrinos are an unshieldable signal and carry information about the reactor core and the distance they travel. Using gadolinium-doped water Cherenkov detectors for this purpose has been previously proposed alongside rate-only analyses. As antineutrinos carry information about their distance of travel in their energy spectrum, the analyses can be extended to a spectral analysis to gain more knowledge about the detected core. Two complementary analyses are used to evaluate the distance between a proposed gadolinium-doped water-based liquid scintillator detector and a detected nuclear reactor. Example cases are shown for a detector in Boulby Mine, near the Boulby Underground Laboratory in the UK, and six reactor sites in the UK and France. The analyses both show strong potential to range reactors, but are limited by the detector design.</description>

Abstract: Deuterons are atomic nuclei composed of a neutron and a proton held together by the strong interaction. Unbound ensembles composed of a deuteron and a third nucleon have been investigated in the past using scattering experiments and they constitute a fundamental reference in nuclear physics to constrain nuclear interactions and the properties of nuclei. In this work, K$^{+}-$d and p$-$d femtoscopic correlations measured by the ALICE Collaboration in proton$-$proton (pp) collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) are presented. It is demonstrated that correlations in momentum space between deuterons and kaons or protons allow us to study three-hadron systems at distances comparable with the proton radius. The analysis of the K$^{+}-$d correlation shows that the relative distances at which deuterons and protons or kaons are produced are around 2 fm. The analysis of the p$-$d correlation shows that only a full three-body calculation that accounts for the internal structure of the deuteron can explain the data. In particular, the sensitivity of the observable to the short-range part of the interaction is demonstrated. These results indicate that correlations involving light nuclei in pp collisions at the LHC will also provide access to any three-body systems in the strange and charm sectors.</description>

      <title>Measurement of (anti)alpha production in central Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11758v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this letter, measurements of (anti)alpha production in central (0$-$10%) Pb$-$Pb collisions at a center-of-mass energy per nucleon$-$nucleon pair of $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV are presented, including the first measurement of an antialpha transverse-momentum spectrum. Owing to its large mass, the production of (anti)alpha is expected to be sensitive to different particle production models. The production yields and transverse-momentum spectra of nuclei are of particular interest because they provide a stringent test of these models. The averaged antialpha and alpha spectrum is compared to the spectra of lighter particles, by including it into a common blast-wave fit capturing the hydrodynamic-like flow of all particles. This fit is indicating that the (anti)alpha also participates in the collective expansion of the medium created in the collision. A blast-wave fit including only protons, (anti)alpha, and other light nuclei results in a similar flow velocity as the fit that includes all particles. A similar flow velocity, but a significantly larger kinetic freeze-out temperature is obtained when only protons and light nuclei are included in the fit. The coalescence parameter $B_4$ is well described by calculations from a statistical hadronization model but significantly underestimated by calculations assuming nucleus formation via coalescence of nucleons. Similarly, the (anti)alpha-to-proton ratio is well described by the statistical hadronization model. On the other hand, coalescence calculations including approaches with different implementations of the (anti)alpha substructure tend to underestimate the data.</description>

Abstract: This Letter presents the most precise measurement to date of the matter-antimatter imbalance at midrapidity in Pb-Pb collisions at a center-of-mass energy per nucleon pair $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 5.02$ TeV. Using the Statistical Hadronization framework, it is possible to obtain the value of the electric charge and baryon chemical potentials, $\mu_Q=-0.18\pm0.90$ MeV and $\mu_B=0.71\pm0.45$ MeV, with unprecedented precision. A centrality-differential study of the antiparticle-to-particle yield ratios of charged pions, protons, $\Omega$-baryons, and light (hyper)nuclei is performed. These results indicate that the system created in Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC is on average baryon-free and electrically neutral at midrapidity.</description>

      <title>A Dark Sink Enhances the Direct Detection of Freeze-in Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14152v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe a simple dark sector structure which, if present, has implications for the direct detection of dark matter (DM): the Dark Sink. A Dark Sink transports energy density from the DM into light dark-sector states that do not appreciably contribute to the DM density. As an example, we consider a light, neutral fermion $\psi$ which interacts solely with DM $\chi$ via the exchange of a heavy scalar $\Phi$. We illustrate the impact of a Dark Sink by adding one to a DM freeze-in model in which $\chi$ couples to a light dark photon $\gamma '$ which kinetically mixes with the Standard Model (SM) photon. This freeze-in model (absent the sink) is itself a benchmark for ongoing experiments. In some cases, the literature for this benchmark has contained errors; we correct the predictions and provide them as a public code. We then analyze how the Dark Sink modifies this benchmark, solving coupled Boltzmann equations for the dark-sector energy density and DM yield. We check the contribution of the Dark Sink $\psi$'s to dark radiation; consistency with existing data limits the maximum attainable cross section. For DM with a mass between $\text{MeV} -\mathcal{O}(10\text{ GeV})$, adding the Dark Sink can increase predictions for the direct detection cross section all the way up to the current limits.</description>

      <title>Studying the interaction between charm and light-flavor mesons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13541v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The two-particle momentum correlation functions between charm mesons ($\mathrm{D^{*\pm}}$ and $\mathrm{D}^\pm$) and charged light-flavor mesons ($\pi^{\pm}$ and K$^{\pm}$) in all charge-combinations are measured for the first time by the ALICE Collaboration in high-multiplicity proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s} =13$ TeV. For $\mathrm{DK}$ and $\mathrm{D^*K}$ pairs, the experimental results are in agreement with theoretical predictions of the residual strong interaction based on quantum chromodynamics calculations on the lattice and chiral effective field theory. In the case of $\mathrm{D}\pi$ and $\mathrm{D^*}\pi$ pairs, tension between the calculations including strong interactions and the measurement is observed. For all particle pairs, the data can be adequately described by Coulomb interaction only, indicating a shallow interaction between charm and light-flavor mesons. Finally, the scattering lengths governing the residual strong interaction of the $\mathrm{D}\pi$ and $\mathrm{D^*}\pi$ systems are determined by fitting the experimental correlation functions with a model that employs a Gaussian potential. The extracted values are small and compatible with zero.</description>

      <title>Probing Light Inelastic Dark Matter from Direct Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03128v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For dark matter (DM) direct detections, the kinematic effects such as those of the inelastic scattering can play important role in light DM searches. The light DM detection is generally difficult because of its small recoil energy. But the recoil energy of the exothermic inelastic DM scattering could exceed the detection threshold due to the contribution from the DM mass-splitting, making the direct detection of sub-GeV DM feasible. In this work, we systematically study signatures of the light exothermic inelastic DM from the recoil spectra including both the DM-electron scattering and Migdal effect. Such inelastic DM has mass around (sub-)GeV scale with DM mass-splitting of $O(1-10^2)$keV. We analyze the direct detection sensitivities to such light inelastic DM. For different inelastic DM masses and mass-splittings, we find that the DM-electron recoil and Migdal effect can contribute significantly and differently to the direct detection signatures. The DM-lepton and/or DM-quark interactions may vary for different DM models, and their interplay leads to a diversity in the recoil spectra. Hence, it is important to perform a combined analysis to include both the DM-electron recoil and Migdal effect. We further demonstrate that this analysis has strong impacts on the cosmological and laboratory bounds for the inelastic DM.</description>

Abstract: Light mesons have always been an important part of the whole hadron family, once inspiring the SU(3) classification of hadrons as a typical example~\cite{Gell-Mann:1964ewy}. Until now, the search for light mesons has been an ongoing task in hadron physics. In particular, with the accumulation of experimental data, more and more light flavor mesons with the masses around 2.2 GeV were found, including the $Y(2175)$ observed in $J/\psi\to \eta \phi f_0(980)$~\cite{BES:2007sqy} and the $X(2370)$ reported in the decay of $J/\psi\to \gamma \eta^\prime \pi^+\pi^-$~\cite{BESIII:2010gmv,BESIII:2019wkp}. These progresses show that there is a chance to construct the light meson family, which is also an effective approach to deepen our understanding of non-perturbative behavior of the strong interaction.</description>

      <title>Predicting hidden bottom molecular tetraquarks with a complex scaling method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07694v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In present work, we perform a coupled-channel analysis of $B^{(*)}_{(s)}\bar{B}^{(*)}_{(s)}$ systems with the one-boson-exchange potentials. We first study the $I(J^{PC})=1(1^{+-})$ $B\bar{B}^{*}/B^{*}\bar{B}^{*}$ system to describe the $Z_{b}(10610)$ and $Z_{b}(10650)$ particles as molecular states and determine the reasonable range of cutoff parameter $\Lambda$. Then, other $B^{(*)}_{(s)}\bar{B}^{(*)}_{(s)}$ combinations with different quantum numbers are systematically investigated. Some bound states and resonances appear in the isoscalar systems, while only several shallow bound states exist for isovector systems. Far away from the excited conventional $P-$wave bottomium, these predicted states can be easily identified as exotic particles both theoretically and experimentally. Moreover, the $\eta_b(nS)/\Upsilon(nS)$ plus light mesons are the excellent final states to search for the bound states, while the $B\bar B^*+h.c.$ and $B^* \bar B^*$ channels are suitable for the resonances. We highly recommend that the LHCb and Belle II Collaborations can hunt for these bottomonium-like states in future.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking the Non-flow Contributions to the Elliptic Flow Parameter ($v_{_2}$) in Proton-Proton Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13981v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This manuscript reports on the elliptic flow parameter, $v_{_2}$, in proton-proton (p-p) collisions using PYTHIA8 event generator simulations. The typical Event Plane ($EP$) method $v_{_2}$($EP$) as the one used for the real data analysis has been adopted to measure the $v_{_2}$ of particles composed of different quark flavors, and produced at mid-pseudorapidity $|\eta| \le 1$ at center-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s}$ = 200 GeV and $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV. The event plane has been constructed using the soft charged particles with transverse momentum ($p{_{_T}} &lt; $ 2 GeV/c) produced in various $\eta$ ranges. The pseudorapidity gap technique ($\Delta\eta$) between the particle of interest and the soft charged particles contributed to the event plane constructions has been utilized to benchmark the non-flow contributions. The $v_{_2}^{\pi^{^\pm,}\pi^{^0}}$, $v_{_2}^{J/\psi,\Upsilon, K, D, B}$, and the $v_{_2}^{\gamma_{dir}}$ show similar pattern dependence on the transverse momentum for the same $\Delta\eta$, at both $\sqrt{s}$ = 200 GeV and $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV. At each center-of-mass energy, the measured $v_{_2}$ shows obvious dependence on the quark flavor contents where $v_{_2}^{\gamma_{dir}}$ $\le$ $v_{_2}^{J/\psi, \Upsilon, K, D, B}$ $\le$ $v_{_2}^{\pi^{^\pm,}\pi^{^0}}$ for similar $\Delta\eta$ gap. The measured $v_{_2}$ shows slightly higher values at smaller $\sqrt{s}$ for particles of similar values of $\Delta\eta$ gaps, particularly at small $\Delta\eta$ gap. The measured $v_{_2}$ for all particles shows systematic decreases with increasing the $\Delta\eta$ gap as expected from the previous experimental results. Because PYTHIA8 simulations do not incorporate final state interactions, the $v_{_2}(EP)$ values reported here primarily reflect the non-flow contributions and its dependence on the quark contents, pseudorapidity gap as a function on $p_{T}$ at each center of mass-energy.</description>

      <title>Constraints on light dark sector particles from lifetime difference of heavy neutral mesons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14673v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Heavy meson decays with missing energy in the final state offer interesting avenues to search for light invisible new physics such as dark matter (DM). In this context, we show that such new physics (NP) interactions also affect lifetime difference in neutral meson-antimeson mixing. We consider general dimension-six effective quark interactions involving a pair of DM particles and calculate their contributions to lifetime difference in beauty and charm meson systems. We use the latest data on mixing observables to constrain the relevant effective operators. We find that lifetime differences provide novel and complementary flavor constraints compared to those obtained from heavy meson decays.</description>

      <title>Anapole moment of neutrinos and radioactive sources near liquid xenon detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11904v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that placing a radioactive source such as ${}^{51}$Cr near a liquid xenon detector may allow to detect the contribution induced by the anapole moment to neutrino-electron scattering in the Standard Model. Although the anapole moment of neutrinos induces a scattering rate with the same spectral shape as the neutral and charged current contributions, exposures of $\sim$ 10 tonne $\times$ year at XENONnT or XLZD may be enough to accumulate sufficient statistics. We also discuss a simple model where the anapole moment of neutrinos is shifted with respect to the SM expectation, further demonstrating how a potential measurement of the anapole moment of neutrinos would allow to constrain new physics.</description>

      <title>$4b + X$ via electroweak multi-Higgs production as smoking gun signals for Type-I 2HDM at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19643v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extending the Standard Model (SM) by one additional Higgs doublet leads to the Two-Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM). A specific charge assignment of the SM fermions under the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry leads to the Type-I 2HDM. A key feature of the Type-I 2HDM is that all the additional Higgs bosons can be fermiophobic, when their couplings to the SM fermions are suppressed. As a result, all the new Higgs states can be fairly light, $\sim$100 GeV or less, without being in conflict with the current data from the direct Higgs boson searches and the $B$-physics measurements. In a recent study Ref.~\cite{Mondal:2023wib}, which this proceeding is based on, we established that the new neutral as well as the charged Higgs bosons in this model can all be simultaneously observable in the multi-$b$ final state. An experimental validation of our results would be a clear indication that the true underlying Higgs sector in nature is the Type-I 2HDM.</description>
