      <title>Analytic thermal bootstrap meets holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute thermal holographic correlators by combining their analytic structure with the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) condition and a finite set of multi-stress tensor OPE coefficients determined from the dual AdS description. We focus on two-point functions of identical scalar operators with integer conformal dimensions at zero spatial separation. For correlators holographically dual to black brane backgrounds, we show that our results satisfy all relevant consistency conditions and agree with numerical solutions of the bulk wave equation. We further demonstrate that the expansion in generalized free field correlators proposed in [Barrat,6/2025] admits a natural interpretation in terms of Witten diagrams. Finally, we extend our analysis to spherically symmetric black hole backgrounds and show that higher-curvature corrections can be incorporated within the same framework.</description>

      <title>Higher spin Lagrangians from higher derivative diffeomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The covariant description of massless particles of arbitrary spin typically employs symmetric tensors of rank $s$ and rests on a local symmetry carried by symmetric tensor parameters of rank $s-1$, suitably generalizing the $U(1)$ transformations of Maxwell's theory and the diffeomorphisms underlying general relativity. Here we show that Fronsdal's action is actually uniquely identified by the weaker requirement of invariance under higher-derivative gauge transformations driven by a vector parameter. This observation may hint to a tighter, if unexpected, connection between higher-spin symmetry and diffeomorphisms.</description>

      <title>Generalized Replica Manifolds I: Surgery and Averaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a simple framework for implementing a type of path integral "surgery" via correlated averaging over codimension-one defects/extended operators. This technique is used to construct replica manifolds by effectively cutting and gluing the path integral without explicitly modifying the underlying manifold. We argue that restricted forms of this averaging can be used to calculate R\'enyi entanglement entropy corresponding to a wide range of choices of subsystem partitioning. When the entanglement entropy being calculated in this way does not simply correspond to entanglement between subregions, we call the resulting objects from this surgery "generalized replica manifolds". We show how this framework extends to gauge theories and, in particular, how in non-Abelian gauge theories it establishes a connection between replica calculations of a gauge-invariant notion of entanglement between color degrees of freedom and a quiver gauge-theory structure. Finally, we discuss how this framework appears in the context of large-$N$ theories and holography, with a bird's-eye view of potential future directions. This paper focuses on averaging over operators that form a representation of the Heisenberg group; a subsequent paper will extend the framework to more general operator averaging.</description>

      <title>Searching for emergent spacetime in spin glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work on algebraic formulations of holographic dualities in terms of large $N$ algebras has revealed a deep connection between the properties of the associated spectral functions and the emergence of a semiclassical spacetime and causal horizons therein. One of the main lessons is that, for a radial direction to emerge, the spectral function has to exhibit non-compact support. Furthermore, there exist conjectures upon a possible duality between complex gravitational configurations and glassy systems. The goal of this paper is to combine these ideas by studying many-body quantum-mechanical systems and assess in which parameter regimes they could potentially be holographic. Thus, we compute the spectral functions of three many-body systems with quenched disorder, the SYK model, the $p$-spin model and the SU$(M)$ Heisenberg chain in the large $N$ limit and present results in different parameter regimes. Our main finding is that in the quantum spin glass phase of the SU$(M)$ Heisenberg model, the spectral function develops an exponential tail, similar to the large $q$ limit of SYK. Furthermore, we demonstrate the presence of an infinite family of quasiparticle excitations deep in the spin liquid phase of the $p$-spin model, which could point towards an emergent type I von Neumann algebra. In addition, we demonstrate the presence of an exponential tail in the spectral function for all cases without compact support and conformal symmetry. Motivated by this observation, we prove that no low-energy operator can detect a nontrivial bulk causal structure, if the spectral function has exponentially decaying tails.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study non-supersymmetric $O(16)\times O(16)$ heterotic theory on an $AdS_{3}\times S^{3}\times T^{4}$ background, finding a family of vacua parameterized by a pair of flux integers. Adding the one-loop scalar potential to the effective theory contributes positively to the cosmological constant, but we find that there is no uplift to de Sitter for any values of the fluxes. We study the fluctuations around these vacua and show that all scalar and tensor modes from the six-dimensional effective theory lie above the Breitenlohner-Freedman bound. The moduli coming from the torus compactification will also be above the bound, at least for a large range of fluxes.</description>

      <title>Matching conditions at null infinity in the presence of logarithms: the role of advanced and retarded radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a new perspective on the general matching conditions between the future of past null infinity and the past of future null infinity, emphasizing the impact of dominant logarithmic terms in the asymptotic expansion of the fields near null infinity. We explicitly consider the cases of a massless scalar field and of electromagnetism. Key in our derivation is the identification of the physical origin of these logarithms, which are associated with advanced and retarded radiation saturating the finite energy flux condition at null infinity (in a space of functions which is made precise). The matching conditions arise then from the requirement of Coulombic (i.e., $1/r$) behaviour at spatial infinity.</description>

      <title>Spatially flat cosmological quantum spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We recently described a cosmological quantum spacetime of vanishing spatial curvature, which can be considered as background for the IKKT matrix model, assuming that the resulting gauge theory couples weakly. Building on this example, we construct a large class of spatially flat cosmological quantum spacetimes. We also elaborate on various details of their algebraic and semi-classical structure as well as the higher spin modes present in these models. In particular, we introduce the notion of approximate diffeomorphisms on the cosmological quantum spacetimes that stem from gauge transformations of the underlying matrix model, and investigate how different gauges are related in the semi-classical regime by approximate diffeomorphisms. Finally, we briefly outline how the described quantum spacetimes could be incorporated into the full IKKT model.</description>

      <title>Quantum Corrections to $\eta/s$ from JT Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the computation of the shear viscosity to entropy ratio $\eta/s$ at finite chemical potential in a holographic model that takes into account the quantum fluctuations in the IR region of near-extremal black branes. Such quantum corrections can be computed from JT gravity and generate non-trivial temperature dependence for $\eta/s$, which deviates from the universal $1/4\pi$ result. In the semi-classical regime, $\eta/s$ attains a minimum which is below the KSS bound, generated by the presence of the quantum effects. In the quantum regime at lower temperatures, $\eta/s$ increases and is well above the KSS bound. We also compare the shear viscosity to the quantum-corrected absorption cross-section of near-extremal black holes, and find agreement.</description>

      <title>Foundations of Carrollian Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carrollian physics provides the natural framework for describing null hypersurfaces. This review explores the geometry of Carrollian manifolds -- spaces endowed with a degenerate metric. We begin with an algebraic overview of the Carroll group, its conformal extension, and its relation to the BMS group. Then, in the core of the review, we follow the standard pseudo-Riemannian narrative: metric $\to$ connection $\to$ curvature. We first introduce the modern, general definition of a Carrollian structure, the analogue of the metric on such manifolds, reviewing the historical developments, symmetries, and link with the algebraic groups. The second part concerns connections. We show the breakdown of the Levi-Civita theorem in the Carrollian setting and construct the most general intrinsic Carrollian connection. A preferred connection is then identified intrinsically and later shown to coincide with the one induced by embedding a null hypersurface in an ambient spacetime. The third part develops the associated curvature tensors. We include novel results presented here for the first time.
  Two advanced topics highlight the broader scope of this framework. The first treats null hypersurfaces via the rigging technique, deriving the induced geometry from the ambient space. This provides a unified language for spacelike, timelike, and null hypersurfaces, and shows that the induced rigged connection exactly reproduces the intrinsic Carrollian one. From this, the Gauss and Codazzi-Mainardi equations follow, and the Einstein equations emerge as conservation laws for the null Brown-York stress tensor. The second topic extends the Carrollian setup to generic, non-null hypersurfaces, enabling a smooth null limit and completing the unified geometric description of hypersurfaces of all causal characters.</description>

      <title>Imprint of the black hole singularity on thermal two-point functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider two-point functions of light fields at finite temperature and large real frequencies in holographic theories. The thermal system is dual to a single-sided AdS black hole. We show that the high-frequency expansion obtained from the Operator Product Expansion receives nonperturbative corrections, which are controlled by null geodesics bouncing off the black hole singularity in the two-sided eternal black hole geometry. We develop a bulk WKB description of these bouncing geodesics and explain how to calculate reflection coefficients at the singularity.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetric extensions of Kac-Moody boundary conditions in AdS$_3$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the Kac-Moody (KM) boundary conditions of AdS$_3$ gravity by incorporating fermionic fields. For $\mathcal{N}=(1,1)$ AdS$_3$ supergravity, we show that there are two possible ways to implement the fermionic extension. In the first, the extended KM boundary conditions are related to the standard super-Virasoro (VS) boundary conditions through a large gauge transformation realized by the super-Miura map between fields and chemical potentials, establishing a supersymmetric generalization of the KM-VS correspondence. In the second, a more general boundary configuration leads to strong constraints on the fermionic chemical potentials, yet offers a much richer asymptotic structure. It provides us a novel realization of the extended Kac-Moody algebra, and a geometric interpretation in terms of folds in the relativistic free-fermion droplet. Finally, we quantize the latter theory by promoting the classical Poisson brackets to (anti-)commutators, construct the corresponding Hilbert space, and show that the resulting spectrum contains only bosonic soft excitations, with no additional fermionic soft modes.</description>

      <title>Kosmic Field Theories: Towards Holographic Duals for Unitary String Cosmologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work on cosmological amplitudes has established reality conditions (derived from unitarity) for general particle-creation processes in flat FLRW cosmologies, in the Bunch-Davies wavefunction. In light of these results, we propose a new class of large-$N$ holographic gauge theories with $d$ spatial dimensions, which we call Kosmic Field Theories (KFTs), of which only a subset are conformal (KCFTs). By imposing an appropriate -- $d$ dependent -- complex phase for the number of colours $N$ and the t' Hooft coupling $\lambda$, we show that the complex phases of $n$-point functions in a KFT match the reality conditions required by $d + 1$ bulk unitarity, to all orders in bulk and boundary perturbation theory, including loop diagrams. Since $N^2/\lambda$ is imaginary in all dimensions, the class of (parity-even) KFTs has no overlap with the class of Wick rotations of unitary QFTs. We also make a preliminary investigation of positivity conditions, which might constrain the overall $\pm$ sign of $N^2$ and $\lambda$.
  Although SU($N$) models with adjoint matter can be defined in generic real dimensions $d$, several features of the class of KFTs are nicer when $d$ is odd, allowing $N^2$ to be real. This includes the possibility of non-oriented and/or open string duals, reality of the effective number of degrees of freedom, and closure under RG flow beyond the leading order in a $1/N$ expansion. This could explain why we live in a cosmology with an even number of spacetime dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Philip Warren Anderson was a pioneering theoretical physicist whose work fundamentally shaped our understanding of complex systems. Anderson received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1977 for his groundbreaking research on localization and magnetism, yet he did so much more. His work on magnetism included antiferromagnetism, superexchange, the Kondo problem and local magnetic moments in metals. Anderson pointed out the importance of disorder through his work on localization, non-crystalline solids and spin glasses. In superconductivity, he is known for the dirty superconductor theorem, showing the gauge-invariance of the BCS theory, his study of flux creep, and for his collaboration with experimentalists to realize the Josephson effect. Anderson's resonating valence bond theory may yet play an important role in high temperature superconductivity. Anderson was also fascinated by broken symmetry, and he laid the theoretical groundwork for what is now known as the Anderson-Higgs mechanism, showing how gauge bosons can acquire mass - an insight that played a foundational role in the Standard Model of particle physics. In his seminal "More is Different" paper, Anderson argued that the collective emergent phenomena that arise in complex interacting systems cannot be deduced from their fundamental parts. Anderson's legacy endures not only through the lasting impact of his scientific work but also through his influence on generations of physicists who continue to explore the rich landscape of collective behavior in nature.</description>

      <title>Swampland Conjectures through ACT Observations: Observational Signatures of Radiative-Corrected Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the consistency of radiatively corrected inflationary models with both the latest observational data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) combined with Planck 2018 and Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements, and the theoretical constraints imposed by the swampland program. We systematically test two distinct models against three key swampland conjectures: the further refined de Sitter swampland conjecture (FRDSSC), the scalar weak gravity conjecture (SWGC), and the strong scalar weak gravity conjecture (SSWGC). Model I, based on radiatively corrected Higgs inflation, satisfies the FRDSSC and remains consistent with current observational constraints ($n_s = 0.9743 \pm 0.0034$, $r &lt; 0.038$), but fails to meet the SWGC and SSWGC requirements, indicating limited theoretical compatibility with quantum gravity principles. In contrast, Model II, incorporating radiative corrections with scalar sectors, demonstrates full consistency by satisfying all three swampland conjectures simultaneously while maintaining observational viability. The compatibility of Model II is highly sensitive to the non-minimal coupling $\xi$ and renormalization scales $\mu_b$, with larger values extending the range of swampland-consistent solutions. Our results highlight the critical role of radiative corrections in achieving simultaneous theoretical and observational consistency, and identify Model II as a promising candidate for a fully viable inflationary scenario within the swampland framework. This work provides a methodology for classifying inflationary models based on their swampland compatibility, demonstrating that satisfaction of the FRDSSC alone is insufficient for full theoretical consistency.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Lattice Surgery: Non-Clifford Gates via Non-Abelian Surface Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In universal fault-tolerant quantum computing, implementing logical non-Clifford gates often demands substantial spacetime resources for many error-correcting codes, including the high-threshold surface code. A critical mission for realizing large-scale quantum computing is to develop simple and resource-efficient implementations of logical non-Clifford gates. We propose a novel way of implementing non-Clifford operations in the standard surface code based on hybrid lattice surgery. First we generalize the standard lattice surgery to hybrid lattice surgery, where operations of rough merge and rough split happen across different topological codes. Then we apply such procedures between Abelian and non-Abelian codes and show that this can provide non-Clifford operations in the standard surface code, in the form of a magic state or a non-Clifford gate teleportation. Complementing this, we provide a continuum topological field theory description of this hybrid lattice surgery utilizing interfaces between (2+1)d topological orders. From these considerations, we can generalize our protocol to non-Clifford gates and magic states at all finite levels of the Clifford hierarchy, as well as gates beyond the hierarchy. We also discuss protocols extending this framework to qutrits.</description>

      <title>Compact binary system dynamics at the second post-Newtonian order: analytical formula of the coordinate time for eccentric and circular orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work is based on the letter Phys. Lett. B, 865, 139484 (2025), where we developed the analytical expression of the coordinate time in terms of the eccentric anomaly at the second post-Newtonian order in General Relativity for a compact binary system moving on eccentric orbits. The aim of this paper is to provide more details about the performed calculations and to produce other new results. More specifically, we will focus on deriving the analytical expression of the coordinate time at the second Post-Newtonian order for circular orbits and then discuss two astrophysical applications involving binary neutron star and black hole systems.</description>

      <title>Two-parameter Langlands Correspondence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In our paper arXiv:1701.03146 we established, for every simply-laced Lie algebra g, a canonical isomorphism between the spaces of deformed conformal blocks of the deformed W-algebra and the quantum affine algebra corresponding to g, which we view as a q-deformation of the quantum Langlands correspondence. This was done by realizing the deformed conformal blocks of these algebras via the quantum K-theory of the Nakajima quiver varieties. We also linked this isomorphism to a duality emerging from the 6d little string theory. Here, we give a brief survey of these results and propose an extension to the non-simply laced case, which exhibits a Langlands-type duality.</description>

      <title>Topological Signatures and Geometrothermodynamics of Critical Phenomena in Regularized Maxwell Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the thermodynamic topology and microscopic interaction properties of charged black holes in RegMax gravity, focusing on the role of the coupling parameter $\alpha$. Using the Duan topological current method together with Ruppeiner geometry, we show that $\alpha$ controls a sharp change in phase structure. Above a certain critical threshold, we find that the Duan defect curve develops an intermediate branch and vertical tangency points, producing continuous (second-order) critical behaviour. Furthermore, the Ruppeiner curvature becomes negative at very small horizon radii before turning positive and progressively vanishing at larger radii. By contrast, below the critical value of the coupling, the intermediate black hole phase disappears, and the system shows a simpler small/large first-order/coexistence behaviour driven by free-energy competition. In this regime, the Ruppeiner curvature remains predominantly positive. Overall, increasing $\alpha$ enriches the thermodynamic topology (allowing for second-order criticality) while simultaneously reducing the domain in which classical energy conditions (ECs) are satisfied, thus linking exotic thermodynamic behaviour to more severe violations of standard energy conditions.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we develop new Bailey pairs for the pentagon identity satisfied by the tetrahedron index, expressible in terms of $q$-series. Since the tetrahedron index underlies topological invariants of 3-manifolds and related knots, our construction may offer a new framework to deriving knot invariants through the Bailey chain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.21154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that space-time modulation of electromagnetic potentials enables Klein tunneling far below the static threshold. The derived kinematics reveal oblique transitions that can connect opposite-energy continua without requiring their overlap, yielding a velocity-tunable Klein gap where transmission vanishes within a finite velocity window and reemerges beyond. The associated reduction in energy thresholds -- by up to four orders of magnitude -- suggests unprecedented experimental feasibility using flying-focus fronts and relativistic electron beams.</description>

      <title>Scrambling Without Chaos in Random Free-Fermionic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the role of randomness in the scrambling of quantum information within integrable free-fermionic systems. Considering quadratic Hamiltonians with varying degrees of randomness, we analyze entanglement-based measures to characterize the scrambling structure. We show that the memory effect in the entanglement of disjoint subsystems of Gaussian states vanishes when the local couplings are random, indicating information delocalization. The tripartite mutual information exhibits negative saturation values similar to those in chaotic systems, albeit with a smaller magnitude, revealing weaker scrambling under integrable quadratic dynamics. Despite integrability, spectral analyses reveal that local random models display a spectral-form-factor ramp and a partial crossover in the single-particle level-spacing ratio from Poisson-like to Wigner--Dyson-like behavior within a certain range of random couplings. These results demonstrate that randomness can act as a minimal ingredient for inducing information scrambling in integrable quadratic fermionic models.</description>

      <title>Shadow and Polarization Images of Rotating Black Holes in Kalb-Ramond Gravity Illuminated by Several Thick Accretion Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using ray-tracing techniques, this paper investigates the optical and polarization images of rotating black holes in Kalb-Ramond (KR) gravity illuminated by thick accretion disks. We consider two accretion disk models: the phenomenological model and the HOU disk model, where the phenomenological model includes both isotropic and anisotropic radiation. In all models, the external bright rings corresponding to the high-order image and the internal dark region associated with the event horizon are observed. At high observational inclinations, the inner shadows are obscured by the radiation from the equatorial plane, which is significantly different from the thin accretion disk model. The primary distinction between isotropic and anisotropic radiation is that the latter causes distortion of the high-order image in the vertical direction, resulting in an elliptical structure. For the HOU disk model, due to certain regions are geometrically thinner under the conical approximation, the high-order images are narrower compared to the phenomenological model. Furthermore, we find that an increase in the rotational parameter $a$ leads to an asymmetry in the intensity distribution of the high-order image, while an increase in the spontaneous Lorentz violating parameters, $\varsigma$ and $\varpi$, results in a decrease in the size of the high-order image. In the polarization image, the linear polarization is found to be significantly influenced by the intensity, while it is relatively less affected by the parameters $\varsigma$ and $\varpi$. The electric vector position angle is mainly affected by the parameters $\varsigma$ and $\varpi$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.21248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been a long entertained idea that self-bound gravitons, so-called geons, could be a dark matter candidate or form (primordial) black holes. The development of viable candidates for quantum gravity allows now to investigate these ideas. Analytic methods show that the description of geons needs to be based on composite operators made out of the graviton field. We present results from a numerical investigation into this idea using causal dynamical triangulations, an ab-initio non-perturbative definition of quantum gravity based on general relativity, and accessible in lattice-gauge-theory-like simulations. Our results suggest an interesting dependence on cosmological time and other unexpected features. Finally, we extend the analytic part of the setting to a supergravity scenario. This provides hints which, if confirmed, could explain why supersymmetry may in a realistic universe in principle not be observable at low (collider) energy scales.</description>

      <title>Exact Regions of Superradiant Instability of Kerr-Newman Black Holes and Massive Scalar Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the superradiant instability of Kerr-Newman black holes in the presence of a massive, charged scalar field using the Vieira-Bezerra-Kokkotas (VBK) method. We study the solutions of the exact polynomial condition for quasibound state frequencies and determine the domain of superradiant instability in parameter space without relying on the hydrogenic approximation or numerics. We derive the minimum scalar mass needed for quasibound states to exist, and identify the precise overlap region between the quasibound and superradiant conditions where instability can occur. Through a perturbative analysis of the resonance equation, we obtain analytic expressions for the instability boundaries and growth rates, and clarify their relation to previous numerical results. Our analysis reveals how the instability region shifts from nearly neutral Kerr black holes for light fields to highly charged near-extremal Kerr-Newman black holes for heavier fields, while remaining absent in the Reissner-Nordstrom limit.</description>

      <title>The Standard Model partial unification scale as a guide to new physics model building</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the Standard Model, partial unification of the non-Abelian running gauge couplings is achieved at the scale $\mu^{\rm SM}_{32} \approx 2.8 \times 10^{16}$ GeV. Elaborating on this fact, we discuss a simple general parametrization for the new physics corrections leading to full unification at some scale $M_X$. We show that for any new physics model such that the corrections to the non-Abelian couplings are equal (or nearly so), $M_X$ is equal (or close to) the partial unification scale $\mu^{\rm SM}_{32}$; the latter scales could be disentangled only if the corrections to the non-Abelian couplings are significantly different. We explore how the parametrization works for some relevant models with new physics below $M_X$, as low energy supersymmetry, split supersymmetry, etc. As for models with a desert up to $M_X$, we explore in particular how the parametrization works for string inspired corrections; we find a phenomenologically remarkable possibility for unification at about $100$ TeV, suggesting a low string scale, in addition to the more conservative possibility for unification at $\mu^{\rm SM}_{32}$.</description>

      <title>Integrals of stable envelopes for cotangent bundles to Grassmannians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider cohomological stable envelopes for a natural torus action $\mathsf{T}$ on $X=T^*Gr(k,n)$, introduced by Maulik-Okounkov. We define the $\mathbb{C}^*_\hbar$-equivariant integral of the stable envelope using equivariant localization over the subtorus $\mathbb{C}^*_\hbar\subset\mathsf{T}$, and compute the integral as a non-equivariant limit of the localization over the full torus, $\mathsf{T}$. The integral of such a class is an integer times a power of $\hbar$, and the main result of this paper is a combinatorial formula for these integers. In 3d mirror symmetry, these non-equivariant limits are expected to reflect some curve counting phenomena on the 3d mirror dual, $X^\vee$. When $k=1$, we obtain the binomial coefficients, and we study some of the combinatorics of the integers for higher $k$, which haven't appeared in the literature before. We give some conjectures and interpretations on extending this phenomena to type A quiver and bow varieties.</description>

      <title>DESI constraints on two-field quintessence with exponential potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a quintessence model involving two scalar fields with double-exponential potentials. This configuration allows the system as a whole to emulate the dynamics of a single field with a shallower potential, enabling scalar fields that individually cannot drive cosmic acceleration to collectively achieve and sustain it. We assess the viability of this model by performing a fully Bayesian analysis and confronting its predictions with observational data, including the Planck 2018 Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) shift parameters, the newly released Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) DR2 Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements, and the Dark Energy Survey Year 5 (DESY5) Type Ia supernova (SnIa) sample. Our analysis shows that the two-field quintessence model yields a log Bayes factor relative to the flat $\Lambda$CDM model of $\Delta \ln B \sim 4$, indicating moderate evidence against the latter. We also find that the central values of the two slopes of the exponential potentials are both close to 1, whereas the slope of an effective single-field system is constrained to be less than order unity. This property is theoretically desirable from the perspective of higher-dimensional theories. Thus, the two-field quintessence model with exponential potentials provides a physically motivated and compelling mechanism that is consistent with both observational and theoretical requirements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00068v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The description of the $T\bar{T}$ deformation in terms of two-dimensional gravity is analyzed from the Hamiltonian point of view, in a manner analogous to the ADM description of general relativity. We find that the Hamiltonian constraints of the theory imply relations between target-space momentum at finite volume which are equivalent to the $T\bar{T}$ finite volume flow equations. This fully-quantum $T\bar{T}$ result emerges already at the classical level within the gravitational theory. We exemplify the analysis for the case when the undeformed sector is a collection of $D-2$ free massless scalars, where it is shown that -- somewhat non-trivially -- the target-space two-dimensional Poincar\'e symmetry is extended to $D$ dimensions. The connection between canonical quantization of this constrained Hamiltonian system and previous path integral quantizations is also discussed. We extend our analysis to the ``gravitational'' description of $J\bar{T}$-type deformations, where it is found that the flow equations obtained involve deformations that twist the spatial boundary conditions.</description>

Abstract: We exploit the flag and Orlik-Solomon algebra to reconstruct the intersection number of twisted cocycles and obtain the bi-adjoint amplitude. By studying the pairing of the special flag, we find that it results to Cachao-He-Yuan representation of the bi-adjoint amplitude. Through identifying each standard flag with Feynman trivalent diagram, in which the propagatoris bilinear form of the flag $S^{(a)(F_m,F_m)}$, we also find the geometry interpretation of Bern-Carrasco-Johansson duality discovered by Mizera as the identity of flag with a gap. According to the definition of flag simplex, we also construct the Z-amplitude in the $\alpha^{\prime} \rightarrow 0 $ limit.</description>

      <title>Localization of $q$-form field on squared curvature gravity domain wall brane coupling with gravity and background scalar</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16324v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unlike the duality in four-dimensional spacetime, where the $q-$form fields corresponds to the scalar fields or the vector fields, in higher dimensional spacetime, they denote new types of particles. In this paper, we investigate the localization of the KK modes of the $q$-form fields in a five dimensional brane world. We introduce the coupling between the $q-$form fields and both the gravity and the background scalar field. This consideration enables the localization of the $q$-form fields on the five-dimensional RS-2 thick brane, leading to the derivation of zero modes, Schr\"{o}dinger-like equations, and a four-dimensional effective action. We suggest a new function $F(R,\varphi)$ to stand for the coupling of the $q$-form field with gravity and background scalar fields. Our analysis highlights the significance of the parameters $\text C_2$ and $\displaystyle t$ in the localization processes.</description>

      <title>Dualities from dualities in 2d $\mathcal{N}=(0,2)$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12453v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose 2d $\mathcal{N}=(0,2)$ dualities between SU(N) gauge theories with fundamental and antisymmetric chiral matter and Landau-Ginzburg theories with chiral and Fermi multiplets. Many of these dualities can be derived by topologically twisting 4d s-confining gauge theories on a two-sphere, with integer non-negative $R$ charges. We provide various checks of the dualities, showing that they descend from more "basic" dualities, similarly to analogous derivations in higher dimensions. The proof are based on the fact that the antisymmetric tensors can be traded with USp(2n) gauge theories with fundamental chirals, mimicking the higher dimensional mechanism known as tensor deconfinement. The quivers obtained in this way can be shown to be dual to LG models after applying other elementary "basic" dualities.</description>

      <title>A Renormalization Group Analysis of the Ising Model Coupled to Causal Dynamical Triangulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01134v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the matrix model characterizing the Ising model coupled to Causal Dynamical Triangulations (CDT) from the point of view of the Functional Renormalization Group Equation (FRGE). This model is a dually weighted matrix model, whose Feynman diagrams are in correspondence with discrete triangulations of two-dimensional geometries with a preferred time foliation. In particular, we find the fixed points of the beta-function equations, showing that the number of relevant directions in each case is compatible with the physical interpretation of the CFT at the fixed point. In addition to recovering the fixed points for topological gravity and pure gravity with a cosmological constant, we find a new fixed point featuring three relevant directions which matches the number of primary fields in the Ising CFT.</description>

      <title>On the zoology of 2d $\mathcal{N}=(0,2)$ dualities of gauge theories with antisymmetric matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16544v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate and propose new dualities involving 2d gauge theories with $\mathcal{N}=(0,2)$ supersymmetry. In the first part of the paper we focus on $\mathrm{SU}(n)$ gauge theories with two antisymmetric chirals. The gauge theories are non-anomalous if we consider, in addition to such matter content, $n_f$ fundamental and $n_a$ antifundamental chirals, provided the constraint $n_f+n_a=4$. By exploring the five possibile scenarios arising from this constraint we provide in each case evidences of a dual LG description, by matching the 't Hooft anomalies and deriving the relation between the elliptic genera in terms of other more fundamental dualities. In the second part of the paper we provide a 4d origin for a gauge/LG duality already stated in the literature, that does not descend from any known s-confining duality. In the last part of the paper we focus on dualities for $\mathrm{SU}(n)$ and $\mathrm{USp}(2n)$ models with antisymmetric Fermi multiplets, obtained from dimensional reduction of 4d parent dualities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18619v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We initiate the study of supersymmetry-preserving topological defect lines (TDLs) in the Conway moonshine module $V^{f \natural}$. We show that the tensor category of such defects, under suitable assumptions, admits a surjective but non-injective ring homomorphism into the ring of $\mathbb{Z}$-linear maps of the Leech lattice into itself. This puts strong constraints on possible defects and their quantum dimensions. We describe a simple construction of non-invertible TDLs from orbifolds of holomorphic (super)vertex operator algebras, which yields non-trivial examples of TDLs satisfying our main theorem. We conjecture a correspondence between four--plane--preserving TDLs in $V^{f\natural}$ and supersymmetry--preserving TDLs in K3 non-linear sigma models, which extends the correspondence between symmetry groups to the level of tensor category symmetry. We establish evidence for this conjecture by constructing non-invertible TDLs in special K3 non-linear sigma models.</description>

      <title>Bispectrum Islands</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19198v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by the amplitude bootstrap program, the spirit of this work is to constrain the space of consistent inflationary correlation functions - specifically, the bispectrum of curvature perturbations - using fundamental principles such as unitarity, locality, analyticity, and symmetries. To this end, we assume a setup for inflation in which de Sitter isometries are only mildly broken by the slow roll of the inflaton field, and study the bispectrum imprinted by a generic hidden sector during inflation. Assuming that the hidden sector's contributions to primordial non-Gaussianity are dominated by the exchange of a scalar operator (which does not preclude high-spin UV completions), we derive nontrivial positivity constraints on the resulting bispectrum $B(k_1,k_2,k_3)$. In particular, we show that $B$ must be negative in a certain region around the equilateral configuration. For instance, for isosceles triangles (with $k_2=k_3$) this region is given by $0.027\lesssim k_3/k_1\leq 2$. Furthermore, we demonstrate that unitarity imposes upper and lower bounds on the bispectrum shape, thereby carving out a Bispectrum Island where consistent shapes in our setup can reside. We complement our analysis by contemplating alternative setups where the coupling to the hidden sector is allowed to strongly break de Sitter boosts. We also identify situations that would push the bispectrum off the island and the profound physical features they would reveal.</description>

      <title>Moduli Self-Fixing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05345v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In Quantum Gravity (QG), large moduli values lead to towers of exponentially light states, making the QG cut-off field-dependent. In 4D supersymmetric (SUSY) theories, this cut-off is set by the species scale $\Lambda(z_i, \bar{z}_i)$, where $z_i$ are complex moduli. We argue that in GKP-like 4D no-scale vacua, accounting for this field dependence generates one-loop, positive-definite potentials for the otherwise unfixed moduli, with local Minkowski minima at the desert points in moduli space with $z_i \sim \mathcal{O}(1)$. As these no-scale moduli grow, a dS plateau emerges and, for larger moduli, the potential runs away to zero, consistent with Swampland expectations. This may have important consequences for the moduli fixing problem. In particular non-perturbative superpotentials may not be necessary for fixing the K\"ahler moduli in a Type IIB setting. Although one loses control over non-perturbative corrections, we argue that modular invariance (more generally, dualities) of the species scale may give us information about the behaviour at small moduli in some simple cases. We illustrate this mechanism in a Type II 4D $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$ toroidal orientifold, where in some cases, modular invariance can give us control over the non-perturbative corrections. The vanishing cosmological constant reflects a delicate cancellation between IR and UV contributions at the minimum. The models may be completed by the addition of intersecting D6-branes, yielding a 3-generation MSSM (RR tadpole free) model with some (but not all) closed string moduli fixed in Minkowski, with the complex structure moduli fixed at the desert points.</description>

      <title>From Confinement to Chaos in AdS/CFT Correspondence via Non-equilibrium Local States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22999v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study excited states in Anti-de Sitter (AdS) space prepared by local operator insertions of a massive scalar field, corresponding to local operator quenches in a free bulk scalar theory. Using the AdS/CFT correspondence, we compute the time evolution of boundary observables in the dual CFT states. We then introduce a hard wall in AdS Poincare coordinates to impose an infrared cutoff (hard-wall), creating a confining deformation of the dual conformal field theory, and analyze the dynamics of excited states in this confining background. By comparing the evolution of boundary two-point correlation functions in the deformed theory to the statistics of Gaussian random matrix ensembles, we show that for sufficiently heavy operators, the spacing-ratio statistics of peaks in temporal dynamics are closest to those of the Gaussian Symplectic Ensemble (GSE). Finally, we extend the analysis to the compact BTZ black hole and to its hard-wall deformation, finding qualitatively similar trends.</description>

      <title>Driven inhomogeneous CFT as a theory in curved space-time</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18350v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For two-dimensional conformal field theories driven by evolving background space-time metrics in a closed universe, we present an operator formulation as a driven inhomogeneous CFT. The Hamiltonian of this theory is given by a background space-time dependent smearing of the stress tensor over the spatial slice. Emphasis is placed on the treatment of the curved-space Weyl anomaly, which we show is realized by the difference between Schr\"odinger and Heisenberg picture Hamiltonians once an appropriate renormalization scheme, the chirally split scheme, is chosen. As a result, the unitary evolution generated by the background metric coincides with that of a Virasoro quantum circuit. To showcase our formalism, we consider the stress tensor one-point function and the entanglement entropy of an interval in both operator and curved-space formulations. We find that these curved-space observables admit a state interpretation only in the chirally split scheme. Finally, we derive the holographic dual of the driven CFT in three-dimensional gravity, extending previous works to arbitrary driving. The holographic dictionary reproduces the stress tensor one-point function and the entanglement entropy in a diffeomorphism invariant scheme.</description>

      <title>A Tale of Two Uplifts: Parisi-Sourlas with Defects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18356v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Defects in conformal field theories (CFTs) play a key role in critical phenomena by modifying scaling behaviors and generating new universality classes. We introduce Parisi-Sourlas (PS) supersymmetry in the presence of extended operators and demonstrate that any $p$-dimensional defect in a CFT$_d$ can be uplifted to a defect in a PS-supersymmetric CFT$_{d+2}$. Surprisingly, there are actually two distinct uplifted defects--of dimensions $p$ and $p+2$--which reduce to the original one. We show how this reduction works for correlators with insertions both in the bulk and on the defect. As a byproduct, we find new relations between defect conformal blocks in dimensions $d$ and $d+2$. We further show that the reduction of the $p$-dimensional defect implies and extend a "global symmetry reduction" previously considered in the literature. Finally, we provide various examples of these uplifts, including perturbative computations in epsilon expansion of the uplift of the Ising magnetic line defect, as well as exact computations of observables in the four-dimensional uplift of minimal models with boundaries.</description>

Abstract: We present a generalized unitarity method for theories of point-particle worldlines coupled to gravity, analogous to that of scattering amplitudes in quantum field theory. This method allows the computation of perturbative observables from basic principles such as locality and unitarity, thus avoiding gauge redundancies and the use of Feynman diagrams. We illustrate the method with a variety of examples, including the gravitational waveform for the scattering of two point masses at next-to-leading order (or ${\cal O}(G^{5/2})$), reproducing known results. Our method further streamlines the calculation of the scattering dynamics of compact binary systems and opens the door to further applications and systematical exploration of structure in this class of observables.</description>

      <title>Quantum Corrections in the Low-Temperature Fluid/Gravity Correspondence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15411v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Attempts to construct a low-temperature version of the fluid/gravity correspondence have faced obstacles manifested in the form of logarithmic terms in the frequency, $\log(\omega)$, leading to non-local in time constitutive relations for the stress tensor and the charge current. These difficulties can be broadly presented as a breakdown of the hydrodynamic description due to additional infrared modes. We employ new quantum insights into the physics of near-extremal black holes, brought about in the context of Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity, as an effective description of quantum fluctuations in the throat, to revisit the fluid/gravity correspondence at very low temperatures. The quantum corrections naturally include a new length scale, $C$, and an effective action that parametrizes the breaking of near-horizon symmetries. We show that with an appropriate choice of order of limits in the derivative expansion within the low-temperature regime, the $\log(\omega)$ infrared divergence can be resolved. By quantum averaging the infrared Schwarzian modes as an effective extra contribution to the long-wavelength fluid modes, the resulting low-temperature effective fluid description is consistent. We present the dispersion relations for all the relevant hydrodynamic modes. We also revisit the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio and find that at very low temperatures the universal $\frac{1}{4\pi}$ bound is violated due to quantum correction.</description>

Abstract: We present the new version of FeynGrav, a package that provides a set of tools to work with Feynman rules for gravity models. The new version addresses two principal issues and includes changes that improve user experience. Firstly, we present a more sophisticated implementation of the BRST formalism for general relativity and quadratic gravity, which results in a finite set of interaction rules between ghosts and gravitons. We also implement a realisation of a higher derivative gauge fixing term for quadratic gravity. Secondly, we implement Feynman rules for Cheung-Remmen variables. These variables present the general relativity action in a polynomial form and produce a finite set of Feynman rules. Lastly, we introduce some minor quality-of-life changes to the package to improve the user experience.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19862v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discovery of gravitational waves and advances in black hole imaging have opened new opportunities to probe exotic physics in strong-field regimes. Building upon a recent black hole solution in Einstein gravity coupled with nonlinear electrodynamics and exotic matter sources-specifically a cloud of strings and a quintessence field--we study the perturbative dynamics, thermodynamic behavior, and quantum transmission characteristics in anti-de Sitter spacetime. The black hole, defined by its mass, nonlinear magnetic charge, string cloud, and quintessence parameters, exhibits modified spacetime geometry, horizon structure, Hawking temperature, and effective potentials governing field propagation. We derive Schr\"{o}dinger-like equations for massless scalar, electromagnetic, and fermionic perturbations, exploring how these sources jointly shape the potential barriers. The Hawking temperature shows strong dependence on the horizon radius and nonlinear charge, differing markedly from asymptotically flat cases due to the cosmological constant. Greybody factors, describing Hawking radiation transmission probabilities, are computed for all field spins via turning point analysis. A notable result arises in the fermionic sector: positive and negative helicity modes attain maximal transmission at distinct quintessence normalization values, revealing helicity-dependent coupling absent in bosonic channels. This asymmetry suggests a potential observational signature of spin-exotic matter interactions, offering new insights into detecting quintessence through black hole radiation spectra. Our results extend previous perturbative analyses by incorporating nonlinear electrodynamics, cosmic strings, and quintessence effects--linking quantum radiation studies to gravitational wave astronomy and early-universe cosmology.</description>

When an infinite tower of corrections is considered, these theories allow for cosmological models in which the Big Bang singularity is replaced by an inflationary phase in the early-universe, and they also admit a specific class of regular black hole solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21010v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we shall consider how a dynamical oscillating and phantom crossing dark energy era can be realized in the context of $F(R)$ gravity. We approach the topic from a theoretical standpoint considering all the conditions that may lead to a consistent phantom crossing behavior and separately how the $F(R)$ gravity context may realize oscillating dark energy era. Apart from our qualitative considerations, we study in a quantitative way two $F(R)$ gravity dark energy models which are viable cosmologically and also exhibit simultaneously phantom crossing behavior and also oscillating dark energy. We consider these models by solving numerically the field equations using appropriate statefinder parameters engineered for dark energy studies. As we show, $F(R)$ provides a natural extension of Einstein's general relativity which can naturally realize a transition from a phantom era to a quintessential era, a feature supported by recent observational data, without resorting to phantom scalar fields to realize the phantom evolution.</description>

      <title>On-shell Matrix Elements of the EMT Trace in Gauge Theories and Heavy Quark Masses</title>

Abstract: We present a novel diagrammatic proof of the identity between the forward matrix element of the energy-momentum-tensor (EMT) trace operator over a single particle's on-shell state and its perturbative pole mass to any loop orders in perturbative gauge theories (with gauge bosons and fermions), without appealing to any pre-laid operator renormalization conditions or Ward identities. The proof is based on the equation of mass-dimensional analysis in dimensional regularization, the topological properties of contributing Feynman diagrams and the on-shell renormalization condition. Considering for definiteness perturbative QED and QCD with at most one fermion kept massive, we have verified the aforementioned identity, up to three loops, for all elementary particles through direct computation of dimensionally-regularized matrix elements of the relevant bare operators. We observe interestingly that the trace-anomaly contribution seemingly contains all leading-renormalon effects (explicitly verified up to three loops), and we propose accordingly a new scheme- and scale-independent trace-anomaly-subtracted mass definition for heavy $t$-,$\,b$-,$\,c$-quarks and electrons. A list of amusing numbers is subsequently presented for the composition of their perturbative pole masses.</description>

      <title>Dissecting the moat regime at low energies I: Renormalization and the phase structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06712v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dense QCD matter can feature a moat regime, where the static energy of mesons is minimal at nonzero momentum. Valuable insights into this regime can be gained using low-energy models. This, however, requires a careful assessment of model artifacts. We therefore study the effects of renormalization and in-medium modifications of quark-meson interaction on the moat regime. To capture the main effects, we use a two-flavor quark-meson model at finite temperature and baryon density in the random phase approximation. We put forward a convenient renormalization scheme to account for the nontrivial momentum dependence of meson self-energies and discuss the role of renormalization conditions for renormalization group consistent results on the moat regime. In addition, we demonstrate and that its extent in the phase diagram critically depends on the interaction of quarks and mesons.</description>

      <title>Globally defined Carroll symmetry of gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16762v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The locally defined Carroll symmetry of a gravitational wave is extended to a globally defined one by switching to Brinkmann coordinates. Translations and Carroll boosts associated with two independent globally defined solutions of a Sturm-Liouville equation allow us to describe the motions. The Displacement Memory Effect arises for particular choices of the parameters which yield trajectories with zero momentum. The relation to the Schwarzian derivative is highlighted. We illustrate our general statements by the P\"oschl-Teller profile.</description>
