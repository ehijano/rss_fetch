      <title>On certain classes of modules over group algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the relation between certain subclasses of the classes of Gorenstein projective, Gorenstein flat and Gorenstein injective modules over a group algebra, which consist of the cofibrant, cofibrant-flat and fibrant modules respectively. These subclasses have all structural properties that the Gorenstein classes are known to have, regarding the existence of complete cotorsion pairs and various approximations between them. Furthermore, these subclasses have certain properties, which are conjecturally anticipated to hold for the Gorenstein classes as well. Since the Gorenstein classes are actually equal to the corresponding subclasses for large families of groups, we thus obtain (indirectly) some information about the Gorenstein classes over these groups.</description>

      <title>Coalgebraic $K$-theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish comparison maps between the classical algebraic $K$-theory of algebras over a field and its analogue $K^c$, an algebraic $K$-theory for coalgebras over a field. The comparison maps are compatible with the Hattori--Stallings (co)traces. We identify conditions on the algebras or coalgebras under which the comparison maps are equivalences. Notably, the algebraic $K$-theory of the power series ring is equivalent to the $K^c$-theory of the divided power coalgebra. We also establish comparison maps between the $G$-theory of finite dimensional representations of an algebra and its analogue $G^c$ for coalgebras. In particular, we show that the Swan theory of a group is equivalent to the $G^c$-theory of the representative functions coalgebra, reframing the classical character of a group as a trace in coHochschild homology.</description>

      <title>Spaces of unbounded Fredholm operators: I. Homotopy equivalences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.14359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.14359v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the space of unbounded Fredholm operators equipped with the graph topology, the subspace of operators with compact resolvent, and their subspaces consisting of self-adjoint operators. Our main results are the following: (1) Natural maps between these four spaces and classical spaces of bounded operators representing K-theory are homotopy equivalences. This provides an alternative proof of a particular case of results of Joachim. (2) The subspace of unbounded essentially positive Fredholm operators represents odd K-theory. (3) The subspace of invertible operators in each of these spaces of unbounded operators is contractible.</description>

      <title>Equivariant Witt Complexes and Twisted Topological Hochschild Homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05965v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The topological Hochschild homology of a ring (or ring spectrum) $R$ is an $S^1$-spectrum, and the fixed points of THH($R$) for subgroups $C_n\subset S^1$ have been widely studied due to their use in algebraic K-theory computations. Hesselholt and Madsen proved that the fixed points of topological Hochschild homology are closely related to Witt vectors. Further, they defined the notion of a Witt complex, and showed that it captures the algebraic structure of the homotopy groups of the fixed points of THH. Recent work of Angeltveit, Blumberg, Gerhardt, Hill, Lawson and Mandell defines a theory of twisted topological Hochschild homology for equivariant rings (or ring spectra) that builds upon Hill, Hopkins and Ravenel's work on equivariant norms. In this paper, we study the algebraic structure of the equivariant homotopy groups of twisted THH. In particular, we define an equivariant Witt complex and prove that the equivariant homotopy of twisted THH has this structure. Our definition of equivariant Witt complexes contributes to a growing body of research in the subject of equivariant algebra.</description>
