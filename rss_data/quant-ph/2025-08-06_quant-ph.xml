      <title>Stabilizing ergotropy in Spin-Chain Quantum Batteries via Energy-Invariant Catalysis under Strong Non-Markovian Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum batteries (QBs) have emerged as promising platforms for microscale energy storage, yet most existing studies assume weak system-environment coupling and Markovian dynamics. Here we explore how physical catalysis can regulate the maximum extractable work (ergotropy) of a spin-chain QB strongly coupled to a cavity environment. We model the system using a Nakajima-Zwanzig-type non-Markovian master equation and simulate the time evolution of ergotropy under various physical parameters. Our results show that increasing the catalyst-spin coupling, spin energy or cavity frequency can effectively suppress ergotropy oscillations and yield quasi-stationary ergotropy regime, while overly strong catalyst, especially when accompanied by increasing system-environment coupling under such conditions, can destabilize work extraction. This study demonstrates how quantum catalysis can serve as a control knob for optimizing battery performance in strongly coupled non-Markovian regimes.</description>

      <title>Heating suppression via two-rate random and quasiperiodic drive protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a random and quasiperiodically driven one-dimensional non-integrable PXP spin chain in a magnetic field for two distinct drive protocols. Each of these protocols involves square pulses with two driving frequencies which are integer multiples of each other. For the first class of protocols, the duration of the pulse is changed randomly by an amplitude $dT$ while for the second class we use a random/quasiperiodic dipolar drive, where the quasiperiodicity is implemented using the Thue-Morse (TM) or Fibonacci sequences. For both protocols, we identify parameter regimes for which the thermalization of the driven chain is drastically slowed down due to proximity to a two-rate drive induced exact dynamical freezing. We also study the properties of these driven system moving slightly away from the freezing limit. For the first type of protocols, we show the existence of special value of $dT$ for which the thermalization rate remains small and provide an analytic explanation for such slow thermalization. For the second class of protocols, in contrast to random/quasiperiodic drives involving a single frequency studied earlier, we find that the TM quasiperiodic drive leads to a distinctly slower thermalization than that for drive protocols which are either periodic or follow a random or quasiperiodic Fibonacci sequence. We provide a qualitative semi-analytic understanding of these phenomena either using an exact calculation for small system sizes or carrying out a perturbative analysis in the large drive-amplitude limit. Our analysis brings out the central role of such two-frequency protocols in the reduction of heating in driven quantum systems. We discuss experiments which can test our theory.</description>

      <title>Measurement-Induced Entanglement in Conformal Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Local measurements can radically reshape patterns of many-body entanglement, especially in long-range entangled quantum-critical states. Yet, analytical results addressing the effects of measurements on many-body states remain scarce, and measurements are often approximated as forcing specific measurement outcomes. We study measurement-induced entanglement (MIE) in Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids, a broad family of 1+1d quantum critical states described at low energies by compact free boson conformal field theories (CFT). Measuring the local charge operator, we show that the MIE is entirely universal, conformally invariant, and depends on the operator content of the CFT. Using a replica-trick to address the randomness of the measurement outcomes, we compute the MIE exactly for Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids, in very good agreement with matrix-product state calculations. We show that the MIE for physical quantum measurements is fundamentally different from the entanglement induced by forcing measurement outcomes, and has a natural interpretation in terms of Born averaging over conformally-invariant boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Strong electron-electron interactions in a dilute weakly-localized metal near a metal-to-insulator transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Because it is easily switched from insulator to metal either via chemical doping or electrical gating, silicon is at the core of modern information technology and remains a candidate platform for quantum computing. The metal-to-insulator transition in this material has therefore been one of the most studied phenomena in condensed matter physics, and has been revisited with considerable profit each time a new fabrication technology has been introduced. Here we take advantage of recent advances in creating ultra-thin layers of Bohr-atom-like dopants to realize the two-dimensional disordered Hubbard model at half-filling and its metal-to-insulator transition (MIT) as a function of mean distance between atoms. We use gas-phase dosing of dopant precursor molecules on silicon to create arsenic and phosphorus $\delta$-layers as thin as 0.4~nm and as dilute as 10$^{13}$~cm$^{-2}$. On approaching the insulating state, the conventional weak localization effects, prevalent at high dopant densities and due to orbital motion of the electrons in the plane, become dominated by electron-electron interaction contributions which obey a paramagnetic Zeeman scaling law. The latter make a negative contribution to the conductance, and thus cannot be interpreted in terms of an emergent Kondo regime near the MIT.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a method to synthetically engineer the range of dipolar interactions in tweezer atom arrays by effectively modifying the modes of the electromagnetic vacuum with far-detuned relay atoms. We derive equations of motion for the atoms of interest after adiabatic elimination of the relay atoms. We show the effectiveness of the scheme for realistic experimental parameter regimes with circular and low-angular-momentum Rydberg atom states.</description>

      <title>Quantum algorithm for linear matrix equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe an efficient quantum algorithm for solving the linear matrix equation AX+XB=C, where A, B and C are given complex matrices and X is unknown. This is known as the Sylvester equation, a fundamental equation with applications in control theory and physics. Rather than encoding the solution in a quantum state in a fashion analogous to prior quantum linear algebra solvers, our approach constructs the solution matrix X in a block-encoding, rescaled by some factor. This allows us to obtain certain properties of the entries of X exponentially faster than would be possible from preparing X as a quantum state. The query and gate complexities of the quantum circuit that implements this block-encoding are almost linear in a condition number that depends on A and B, and depend logarithmically in the dimension and inverse error. We show how our quantum circuits can solve BQP-complete problems efficiently, discuss potential applications and extensions of our approach, its connection to Riccati equation, and comment on open problems.</description>

      <title>A resource-efficient quantum-walker Quantum RAM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient and coherent data retrieval and storage are essential for harnessing quantum algorithms' speedup. Such a fundamental task is addressed by a quantum Random Access Memory (qRAM). Despite their promising scaling properties, current qRAM proposals demand excessive resources and rely on operations beyond the capabilities of current hardware requirements, rendering their practical realization inefficient. We introduce a novel architecture that significantly reduces resource requirements while preserving optimal complexity scaling for quantum queries. Moreover, unlike previous proposals, our algorithm design leverages a simple, repeated operational block based exclusively on local unitary operations and short-range interactions between a limited number of quantum walkers traveling over a single binary tree. This novel approach not only simplifies experimental requirements by reducing the complexity of necessary operations but also enhances the architecture's scalability by ensuring a resource-efficient, modular design that maintains optimal quantum query performance.</description>

      <title>Pulse Shaping for Ultra-Fast Adiabatic Quantum Gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fundamental challenge in quantum computing is to increase the number of operations within the qubit coherence time. While this can be achieved by decreasing the gate duration, the use of shorter signals increases their bandwidth and can cause leakage into energetically separated states. A common method to suppress leakage for short pulses is the Derivative Removal by Adiabatic Gate (DRAG) method, which however, relies on IQ modulation of radio-frequency (RF) signals, thus cannot be applied to the baseband signals, e.g., for semiconductor spin qubits. This paper proposes a novel technique, Delayed Leakage Reduction (DLR), that suppresses leakage at targeted frequencies even for baseband control by using time-delayed repetitions of the control signal to enable rapid, high-fidelity operations. We apply DLR on the adiabatic CZ gate between two spin qubits and achieve fidelities exceeding 99.9% within 9.4 ns for a resonance frequency difference of only 100 MHz. Towards the experimental realization of the proposed control method, we also assess the impact on the fidelity of the sampling rate of the electronic hardware generating the control pulse, thus setting the minimum hardware requirements for any experimental demonstration.</description>

      <title>Intermediate-temperature topological Uhlmann phase on IBM quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A spin-1 system can exhibit an intermediate-temperature topological regime with a quantized Uhlmann phase sandwiched by topologically trivial low- and high-temperature regimes. We present a quantum circuit consisting of system and ancilla qubits plus a probe qubit which prepares an initial state corresponding to the purified state of a spin-1 system at finite temperature, evolves the system according to the Uhlmann process, and measures the Uhlmann phase via expectation values of the probe qubit. Although classical simulations suggest the quantized Uhlmann phase is observable on IBM's noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers, an implementation of the circuit without any optimization exceeds the gate count for the error budget and results in unresolved signals. Through a series of optimization with Qiskit and BQSQit, the gate count can be substantially reduced, making the jumps of the Uhlmann phase more visible. A recent hardware upgrade of IBM quantum computers further improves the signals and leads to a clearer demonstration of interesting finite-temperature topological phenomena on NISQ hardware.</description>

      <title>Observation of Purcell Effect in Electrically Coupled Cavity-Magnet System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the observation of the Purcell effect in a cavity-metallic magnet hybrid system using electric-field-mediated coupling. In this configuration, microwave-induced axial currents in the microwire induce circular magnetic fields that drive the ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) of the magnetized microwire. Field-dependent transmission and reflection spectroscopies reveal a clear cavity perturbation consistent with the Purcell regime, in which the magnetic loss rate exceeds the light-matter coupling strength. Despite the small magnetic volume ($\sim 10^{-13}\,\text{m}^3$), measurements performed at both room temperature and 7 mK show coupling rates as high as 56 MHz, one order of magnitude stronger than expected from conventional coupling at the magnetic antinode. Time-domain ringdown measurements directly show the magnetic-field-dependent modification of the cavity photon lifetime, in agreement with theoretical predictions. These results establish a versatile approach for coupling microwave fields to metallic magnets via geometric and electric-field-mediated interactions, opening new opportunities for hybrid cavity-magnet systems.</description>

      <title>Today's Experiments Suffice to Verify the Quantum Essence of Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gravity-mediated entanglement experiments employ concepts from quantum information to argue that if gravitational interaction creates entanglement between two systems, then gravity cannot be described by a classical system. However, the proposed experiments remain beyond out current technological capability, with optimistic projections placing the experiment outside of short-term future. Here we leverage quantum information techniques to argue that current matter-wave interferometers are sufficient to indirectly prove that gravitational interaction creates entanglement between two systems. Specifically, we prove that if we experimentally verify the Schr\"{o}dinger equation for a single delocalized system interacting gravitationally with an external mass, then the time evolution of two delocalized systems will lead to gravity-mediated entanglement. Our findings indicate that the experimental verification of the quantum essence of gravity is on the horizon.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate qubit dynamics under PT and Anti-PT-symmetric non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, focusing on phase evolution, decoherence, quantum speed limits (QSL), and R\'enyi entanglement entropies. Using similarity transformations and Dyson maps, we analyze the reduced density matrix evolution in bosonic environments. Anti-PT-symmetric systems show enhanced robustness against decoherence, with slower entropy growth and longer coherence times compared to PT-symmetric counterparts. QSL behavior is non-monotonic, reflecting rapid initial evolution followed by a gradual decrease. Higher-order R\'enyi entropies reveal that Anti-PT-symmetric qubits preserve quantum information more effectively, offering advantages for memory and cryptographic applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated a strongly driven qubit strongly connected to a quantum resonator. The measured system was a superconducting flux qubit coupled to a coplanar-waveguide resonator which is weakly coupled to a probing feedline. This hybrid qubit-resonator system was driven by a magnetic flux and probed with a weak probe signal through the feedline. We observed and theoretically described the quantum interference effects, deviating from the usual single-qubit Landau-Zener-St\"{u}ckelberg-Majorana interferometry, because the strong coupling distorts the qubit energy levels.</description>

      <title>Fermionic-Adapted Shadow Tomography for dynamical correlation functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamical correlation functions are essential for characterizing the response of the quantum many-body systems to the external perturbation. As their calculation is classically intractible in general, quantum algorithms are promising in this aspect, but most rely on brute force measurement strategies that evaluate one body observable pair per circuit. In this work, we introduce Fermionic-Adapted Shadow Tomography (FAST) protocols, a new framework for the efficient calculation of multiple dynamical correlation functions. The key idea is to reformulate these functions into forms that are compatible with shadow tomography techniques. The circuits in our protocols require at most two-copy measurements with uncontrolled Hamiltonian simulation. We show that the proposed protocols enhance sample efficiency and reduce the number of measurement circuits by an order of one or two with respect to the number of qubits across a range of scenarios.</description>

      <title>Coherent heat exchange in a prethermalizing open quantum system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a simple model exhibiting a prethermal phase, i.e. a metastable state that emerges before full thermalization, through the framework of quantum stochastic thermodynamics. We explore the effects of quantum coherence in the energy eigenbasis of the initial state of the system on the process of heat exchange with a bath, and their contribution to entropy production as quantified by a heat-exchange fluctuation theorem. Such relation is derived using the End-Point Measurement (EPM) scheme, a protocol that accounts for initial quantum coherence in the statistics of energy exchanges resulting from a non-equilibrium process. We compare these results with those obtained from the widely used Two-Point Measurement (TPM) scheme which, by construction, fails to capture such quantum effects.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Signature of Logical Depth in Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the internal logical structure of a quantum circuit can leave a distinct thermodynamic signature under progressive decoherence. By comparing deep, conditionally branching circuits with shallow, uniform counterparts-while controlling for overall halting probability and physical resources-we show that branching architectures induce greater entropy flow into the environment. This effect is captured by a logical depth factor $L_d$, which quantifies entropy accumulation during environmental interactions. We validate our framework through detailed analysis of two 4-branch quantum circuits, demonstrating greater entropy production with $L_d \approx 1.615$ for conditional versus uniform architectures. An ancilla-based experimental protocol using controlled-phase gates provides a concrete pathway for detecting these thermodynamic signatures on current quantum platforms. Our results establish logical depth as a physically measurable quantity with implications for circuit design, compilation strategies, and verification protocols.</description>

      <title>A Fully-integrated Diamond Nitrogen-Vacancy Magnetometer with Nanotesla Sensitivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensemble diamond nitrogen-vacancy (DNV) centers have emerged as a promising platform for precise earth-field vector magnetic sensing, particularly in applications that require high mobility. Nevertheless, integrating all control utilities into a compact form has proven challenging, thus far limiting the sensitivity of mobile DNV magnetometers to the uT-level. This study introduces a fully integrated DNV magnetometer that encompasses all the essential components typically found in traditional platforms, while maintaining compact dimensions of approximately 13 cm * 26 cm. In contrast to previous efforts, we successfully address these challenges by integrating a high-power laser, a lock-in amplifier, and a digitally-modulated microwave source. These home-made components show comparable performance with commercial devices under our circumstance, resulting in an optimal sensitivity of 2.14 nT/sqrt{Hz}. The limitations in this system as well as possible future improvements are discussed. This work paves the way for the use of DNV magnetometry in cost-effective, mobile unmanned aerial vehicles, facilitating a wide range of practical applications.</description>

      <title>Characterizing noisy quantum computation with imperfectly addressed errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum protocols on hardware are subject to noise that prohibits performance. Protocols for addressing errors, such as error correction or error mitigation, may fail to combat errors in quantum computation if noise violates critical assumptions required for these protocols to be effective. However, tools for characterizing such failures in realistic operating conditions are limited. For example, while brute force simulations may be used to characterize the impact of such failures on a handful of input states, such simulations lack a complete description for how noise transforms state-spaces in the full quantum Hilbert space. In this work, we associate quantum computation subject to realistic noise to an ensemble of random superoperators and study the eigen- and singular spectral distributions over this ensemble. We propose a new theoretical framework to characterize singular values of random complex matrices using matrix Chernoff concentration. Using our framework, we analyze imperfectly addressed errors in error mitigation and error correction. We find that distributions of singular spectra depend on how noise violates critical assumptions of these protocols. Finally, we quantitatively discuss how our work may be applied to understanding limiting behavior of quantum computation, such as establishing spectral gaps and relaxation times for specific families of quantum Markov processes. Our work paves the way for new tools to diagnose when to trust the output of noisy quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Frequency subspace encoding for multiplexed quantum secret sharing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum secret sharing (QSS) is a multi-party quantum communication protocol that can be realized with bipartite entanglement and relative phase encoding. Previous implementations typically encoded the phase in the pump, applying it across the entire source bandwidth, thereby limiting scalability via wavelength multiplexing. In contrast, we present a variant of the standard QSS protocol that leverages frequency correlations to connect multiple users with a single source. The secret owner, who has access to the source, encodes classical information by applying frequency-dependent phase modulation to a broadband polarization-entangled photon pair. Each frequency channel therefore provides an independent QSS session among the secret owner and a pair of users. We demonstrate state fidelities of at least 90% for a channel pair of the 200 GHz ITU grid, which could be extended to more than 40 frequency bins with adequate dense-wavelength division multiplexed filters. Our results provide a resource-efficient path toward multi-user secret sharing over wavelength-multiplexed networks, eliminating the need for multiple two-photon or multi-photon sources.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A continuous variable Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) state is a resource for secure quantum communication and distributed quantum sensing. Here we present a technique for coherent control of the two-color EPR state generated by a frequency nondegenerate optical parametric oscillator. The scheme allows for robust control of the homodyne detection of each of the two EPR quantum fields separated by 200 nanometers. We apply our control scheme to stabilize and characterize a strong entangled state of two-color light displaying 9 dB of two-mode squeezing in the acoustic frequency range, making it a valuable tool for quantum networking and quantum metrology.</description>

      <title>Efficient Variational Quantum Algorithms via Circuit Knitting and Architecture Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current quantum hardware presents a significant limitation in the number of available qubits compared to the requirements of practical quantum algorithms. Circuit knitting has been proposed as a solution to this issue by partitioning larger quantum circuits into smaller parts that can be executed by current devices. However, this approach often leads to a high sampling overhead, which increases exponentially with the number of cut points. In this paper, we introduce CKVQA, a framework that applies circuit knitting to variational quantum algorithms (VQAs). By employing a quantum circuit architecture search adapted to this scenario, CKVQA aims to minimize the sampling overhead by identifying parameterized quantum circuits that achieve a favorable balance between algorithmic performance and sampling overhead. Additionally, since circuit knitting generates multiple subcircuits, we have developed a subcircuit-level optimization method to accelerate the training of VQAs and reduce overall execution time. We apply this framework to two widely-used VQAs: the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm and the Variational Quantum Eigensolver. Our numerical results demonstrate that the CKVQA framework significantly reduces the sampling overheads while maintaining comparable accuracy to conventional parameterized quantum circuit designs.</description>

      <title>Characterizing and Mitigating Flux Crosstalk in Superconducting Qubits-Couplers System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting qubits have achieved exceptional gate fidelities, exceeding the error-correction threshold in recent years. One key ingredient of such improvement is the introduction of tunable couplers to control the qubit-to-qubit coupling through frequency tuning. Moving toward fault-tolerant quantum computation, increasing the number of physical qubits is another step toward effective error correction codes. Under a multiqubit architecture, flux control (Z) lines are crucial in tuning the frequency of the qubits and couplers. However, dense flux lines result in magnetic flux crosstalk, wherein magnetic flux applied to one element inadvertently affects neighboring qubits or couplers. This crosstalk obscures the idle frequency of the qubit when flux bias is applied, which degrades gate performance and calibration accuracy. In this study, we characterize flux crosstalk and suppress it in a multiqubit-coupler chip with multi-Z lines without adding additional readout for couplers. By quantifying the mutual flux-induced frequency shifts of qubits and couplers, we construct a cancellation matrix that enables precise compensation of non-local flux, demonstrating a substantial reduction in Z-line crosstalk from 56.5$\,$permille$\,$to 0.13$\,$permille$\,$ which is close to statistical error. Flux compensation corrects the CZ SWAP measurement, leading to a symmetric map with respect to flux bias. Compared with a crosstalk-free calculated CZ SWAP map, the measured map indicates that our approach provides a near-zero crosstalk for the coupler-transmon system. These results highlight the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing flux crosstalk-free control and supporting its potential for scaling superconducting quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Quantum Neural Network applications to Protein Binding Affinity Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binding energy is a fundamental thermodynamic property that governs molecular interactions, playing a crucial role in fields such as healthcare and the natural sciences. It is particularly relevant in drug development, vaccine design, and other biomedical applications. Over the years, various methods have been developed to estimate protein binding energy, ranging from experimental techniques to computational approaches, with machine learning making significant contributions to this field. Although classical computing has demonstrated strong results in constructing predictive models, the variation of quantum computing for machine learning has emerged as a promising alternative. Quantum neural networks (QNNs) have gained traction as a research focus, raising the question of their potential advantages in predicting binding energies. To investigate this potential, this study explored the feasibility of QNNs for this task by proposing thirty variations of multilayer perceptron-based quantum neural networks. These variations span three distinct architectures, each incorporating ten different quantum circuits to configure their quantum layers. The performance of these quantum models was compared with that of a state-of-the-art classical multilayer perceptron-based artificial neural network, evaluating both accuracy and training time. A primary dataset was used for training, while two additional datasets containing entirely unseen samples were employed for testing. Results indicate that the quantum models achieved approximately 20% higher accuracy on one unseen dataset, although their accuracy was lower on the other datasets. Notably, quantum models exhibited training times several orders of magnitude shorter than their classical counterparts, highlighting their potential for efficient protein binding energy prediction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a scheme for generating stable and tunable entanglement between two localized Bloch domain walls in nanomagnetic strips kept inside a chiral optical cavity. The entanglement is mediated by the effective optomechanical interaction between the cavity photons and the two macroscopic, collective modes of the pinned domain walls. By controlling the pinning potential and optical driving frequency, the robust, steady-state entanglement between the two macroscopic domain walls can survive beyond the typical milli-Kelvin temperature range.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03506v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By performing up to the second-order Magnus expansion on the Jaynes-Cummings Model Hamiltonian governing the interaction of a two-level atom and a single cavity mode electromagnetic field, we find the term involving the squeezing of light beyond the Rotating Wave Approximation. Our results demonstrate that the Magnus expansion provides a systematic framework to capture atom-induced squeezing effects. These findings suggest new avenues for engineering nonclassical states in simple light-matter systems without requiring multi-level structures or strong nonlinear media.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Detection Beyond Local Bound with Coarse Calibrated measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bell's test, initially devised to distinguish quantum theory from local hidden variable models through violations of local bounds, is also a common tool for detecting entanglement. For this purpose, one can assume the quantum description of devices and use available information to strengthen the bound for separable states, which may go beyond the local bound, enabling more efficient entanglement detection. Here we present a systematic approach for strengthening Bell inequalities for qubit systems, using Mermin-Klyshko-Bell inequalities as examples, by considering measurement devices that are coarsely calibrated only by their ability to generate nonlocal correlations without requiring precise quantum characterization. In the case of bipartite and tripartite systems, we derive trade-offs between upper bounds for separable states and general states in terms of structure functions to optimize the entanglement detection. We then strengthen n-partite Bell inequalities for the detection of states exhibiting a diversity of entanglement structures such as genuine multipartite entanglement. For general Bell scenarios with some measurements characterized, we demonstrate that entanglement can also be detected with some local correlations by exploiting the Navascu\'es-Pironio-Ac\'in hierarchy of tests.</description>

      <title>Stabilizer R\'enyi Entropy for Translation-Invariant Matrix Product States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magic, capturing the deviation of a quantum state from the stabilizer formalism, is a key resource underpinning the quantum advantage. The recently introduced stabilizer R\'enyi entropy (SRE) offers a tractable measure of magic, avoiding the complexity of conventional methods. We study SRE in translation-invariant matrix product states (MPS), deriving exact expressions for representative states and introducing a numerically stable algorithm, named bond-DMRG, to compute the SRE density in infinite systems. Applying this method, we obtain high-precision SRE densities for the ground state of the one-dimensional Ising model. We also analyze non-local SRE density, showing it is bounded by a universal function of entanglement entropy, and further prove that two-site mutual SRE vanishes asymptotically in injective MPS. Our work not only introduces a powerful method for extracting the SRE density in quantum many-body systems, but also numerically reveals a fundamental connection between magic and entanglement, thereby paving the way for deeper theoretical investigations into their interplay.</description>

Based on this, we present a characterization for optimal quantum $(r,\delta)$-LRCs from MP codes with nested constituent codes, and also study optimal quantum $(r,\delta)$-LRCs constructed from MP codes with non-nested constituent codes. Through Hermitian dual-containing and Euclidean dual-containing MP codes, we present five infinite families of optimal quantum $(r,\delta)$-LRCs with flexible parameters.</description>

      <title>Maximally non-projective measurements are not always symmetric informationally complete</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Whereas standard quantum measurements are projective, the most general notion of a measurement is represented by positive operator-valued measures (POVMs). It is therefore natural to consider how accurately an experimenter with access only to projective measurements and classical processing can simulate POVMs. The most well-known class of non-projective measurements is called symmetric informationally complete (SIC). Such measurements are both ubiquitous in the broader scope of quantum information theory and known to be the most strongly non-projective measurements in qubit systems. Here, we show that beyond qubit systems, the SIC property is in general not associated with the most non-projective measurement. For this, we put forward a semidefinite programming criterion for detecting genuinely non-projective measurements. This method allows us to determine quantitative simulability thresholds for generic POVMs and to put forward a conjecture on which qutrit and ququart measurements that are most strongly non-projective.</description>

      <title>Numerical Errors in Quantitative System Analysis With Decision Diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decision diagrams (DDs) are a powerful data structure that is used to tackle the state-space explosion problem, not only for discrete systems, but for probabilistic and quantum systems as well. While many of the DDs used in the probabilistic and quantum domains make use of floating-point numbers, this is not without challenges. Floating-point computations are subject to small rounding errors, which can affect both the correctness of the result and the effectiveness of the DD's compression. In this paper, we investigate the numerical stability, i.e. the robustness of an algorithm to small numerical errors, of matrix-vector multiplication with multi-terminal binary decision diagrams (MTBDDs). Matrix-vector multiplication is of particular interest because it is the function that computes successor states for both probabilistic and quantum systems. We prove that the MTBDD matrix-vector multiplication algorithm can be made numerically stable under certain conditions, although in many practical implementations of MTBDDs these conditions are not met. Additionally, we provide a case study of the numerical errors in the simulation of quantum circuits, which shows that the extent of numerical errors in practice varies greatly between instances.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnons with momentum-dependent chirality are a key signature of altermagnets. We identify bicircular light as a smoking-gun optical probe for chiral altermagnetic magnons, selectively targeting their quantum geometry induced by an alteration of magnonic chirality. We show that in $d$-wave altermagnets, under a canting magnetic field, the altermagnetic magnons realize a nontrivial quantum geometry, resulting in an enhancement of the nonlinear second-order light-magnon interactions. We find that the scattering of bicircular pulses probes the present magnon quantum geometry, even if the magnonic topology is trivial. Hence, our findings establish bicircular Raman response as an optical effect of choice to identify altermagnetic magnons. As such, we propose a universal experimental protocol to distinguish altermagnets from antiferromagnets by detecting their magnon chirality patterns with light, independently of the underlying magnon topology.</description>

      <title>Signatures of quantum chaos and complexity in the Ising model on random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate signatures of quantum chaos and complexity in the quantum annealing Ising model on random Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs. By tuning the connectivity of the graph, the dynamics can be driven from a localized phase through a chaotic regime to an integrable limit. While this dynamical transition reflects in the spectral characteristics, we pursue a broader suite of quantum chaos indicators,some of which can be measured on near-term quantum devices. We study deep thermalization of a quantum state ensemble obtained from a natural unraveling of the subsystem density matrix as an indicator of chaotic dynamics. This extends the analysis of quantum chaos to the ensemble of quantum states. Furthermore, we analyze the eigenstate and eigenvalue correlations through the partial spectral form factor of subsystems and observe distinct signatures of the onset of chaos and its system size dependence, providing experimentally measurable indicators of the localization-to-chaos transition. As a locality-independent probe, we show that the Krylov complexity of operators is also maximized in the chaotic regime, providing a link between graph topology and information scrambling. Finally, we investigate a quantum analogue of the Mpemba effect, where initially "hotter" states can thermalize anomalously fast, a phenomenon most cleanly observed within the chaotic phase. However, away from the chaotic regime, the system is distinguished by multiple crossings across connectivity in its distance from the thermal ensemble with time. Collectively, this work presents a broad characterization of chaos, providing insight beyond spectral analysis and practical indicators for benchmarking near-term quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Compositional Quantum Control Flow with Efficient Compilation in Qunity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most existing quantum programming languages are based on the quantum circuit model of computation, as higher-level abstractions are particularly challenging to implement - especially ones relating to quantum control flow. The Qunity language, proposed by Voichick et al., offered such an abstraction in the form of a quantum control construct, with great care taken to ensure that the resulting language is still realizable. However, Qunity lacked a working implementation, and the originally proposed compilation procedure was very inefficient, with even simple quantum algorithms compiling to unreasonably large circuits.
  In this work, we focus on the efficient compilation of high-level quantum control flow constructs, using Qunity as our starting point. We introduce a wider range of abstractions on top of Qunity's core language that offer compelling trade-offs compared to its existing control construct. We create a complete implementation of a Qunity compiler, which converts high-level Qunity code into the quantum assembly language OpenQASM 3. We develop optimization techniques for multiple stages of the Qunity compilation procedure, including both low-level circuit optimizations as well as methods that consider the high-level structure of a Qunity program, greatly reducing the number of qubits and gates used by the compiler.</description>

      <title>Quantum Bootstrap Approach to a Non-Relativistic Potential for Quarkonium systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum bootstrap method is applied to determine the bound-state spectrum of Quarkonium systems using a non-relativistic potential approximation. The method translates the Schr\"odinger equation into a set of algebraic recursion relations for radial moments $\langle r^m \rangle$, which are constrained by the positive semidefiniteness of their corresponding Hankel matrices. The numerical implementation is first validated by calculating the $1S$ and $1P$ mass centroids for both charmonium ($c\bar{c}$) and bottomonium ($b\bar{b}$) systems, finding deviations of less than 0.5\% from experimental data from the Particle Data Group (PDG). This analysis is then extended to the hypothetical toponium ($t\bar{t}$) system, predicting a $1S$ ground state mass of $M \approx 344.3 \text{ GeV}$. This theoretical mass is in agreement with the energy of the recently observed resonance-like enhancement in the $t\bar{t}$ cross-section by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations. This result provides theoretical support for the interpretation of this experimental phenomenon as the formation of a quasi-bound toponium state and highlights the predictive power of the non-relativistic potential approach for systems of two massive quarks.</description>

Abstract: Lattice QCD calculations have been conducted using large-scale classical computers based on the Lagrangian formalism of field theory for the past 40 years. On the other hand, the advent of quantum computers has brought increasing attention to first-principles computational methods based on the Hamiltonian formalism compatible with these machines. In this talk, we discuss recent results on how to calculate hadronic properties using the Hamiltonian formalism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermoelectricity usually originates from energy-dependent transport asymmetries. In this Letter, we explore a purely quantum thermoelectric effect rooted in the emission/absorption asymmetry of a low-temperature quantum bath. We propose a gap-asymmetric S-I-S' superconducting tunnel junction in thermal equilibrium, coupled to a low-temperature electromagnetic environment, which develops a nonlinear quantum bipolar thermoelectric effect due to the dynamical Coulomb blockade. Key performance features are analyzed for realistic implementations.</description>

      <title>AION-10: Technical Design Report for a 10m Atom Interferometer in Oxford</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This Technical Design Report presents AION-10, a 10-meter atom interferometer to be located at Oxford University using ultracold strontium atoms to make precision measurements of fundamental physics. AION-10 serves as both a prototype for future larger-scale experiments and a versatile scientific instrument capable of conducting its own diverse physics programme.
  The design features a 10-meter vertical tower housing two atom interferometer sources in an ultra-high vacuum environment. Key engineering challenges include achieving nanometer-level vibrational stability and precise magnetic field control. Solutions include active vibration isolation, specialized magnetic shielding, and a modular assembly approach using professional lifting equipment.
  Detailed analysis confirms the design meets all performance requirements, with critical optical components remaining within our specifications 97% of the time under realistic operating conditions. Vacuum and vibration measurements in the host building validate that the instrument will achieve the precision needed for quantum sensing applications.
  This work establishes the technical foundation for scaling atom interferometry to longer baselines while creating a cutting-edge facility for precision measurements that could advance our understanding of fundamental physics.</description>

Abstract: A quantum mechanical Maxwell demon is proposed in a quantum dot setting. The demon avoids continuous-measurement induced decoherence by exploiting an undetailed charge detector. The control of coherent tunneling via Landau-Zener-St\"uckelberg-Majorana driving allows for efficient feedback operations with no work invested. The local violation of the second law achieves simultaneous power generation and cooling. We discuss the response current fluctuations, and the demon backaction deriving from failures, finding optimal performance in the nonadiabatic regime.</description>

      <title>Quantum algorithms: A survey of applications and end-to-end complexities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.03011v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The anticipated applications of quantum computers span across science and industry, ranging from quantum chemistry and many-body physics to optimization, finance, and machine learning. Proposed quantum solutions in these areas typically combine multiple quantum algorithmic primitives into an overall quantum algorithm, which must then incorporate the methods of quantum error correction and fault tolerance to be implemented correctly on quantum hardware. As such, it can be difficult to assess how much a particular application benefits from quantum computing, as the various approaches are often sensitive to intricate technical details about the underlying primitives and their complexities. Here we present a survey of several potential application areas of quantum algorithms and their underlying algorithmic primitives, carefully considering technical caveats and subtleties. We outline the challenges and opportunities in each area in an "end-to-end" fashion by clearly defining the problem being solved alongside the input-output model, instantiating all "oracles," and spelling out all hidden costs. We also compare quantum solutions against state-of-the-art classical methods and complexity-theoretic limitations to evaluate possible quantum speedups.
  The survey is written in a modular, wiki-like fashion to facilitate navigation of the content. Each primitive and application area is discussed in a standalone section, with its own bibliography of references and embedded hyperlinks that direct to other relevant sections. This structure mirrors that of complex quantum algorithms that involve several layers of abstraction, and it enables rapid evaluation of how end-to-end complexities are impacted when subroutines are altered.</description>

Abstract: This work presents a novel method for task optimization in industrial plants using quantum-inspired tensor network technology. This method obtains the best possible combination of tasks on a set of machines with directed constraints. With this method, an exact and explicit solution of the problem is provided. This algorithm constructs a tensor network representation of the tensor which provides the solution of the problem. This method is improved in order to reduce the computational complexity of the solution computation, using problem preprocessing, new techniques of condensation of logical constraints, optimization of the value determination technique with previously calculated results, reuse of intermediate computations, and iterative relations for constraints. Three algorithms for computation are presented: the main algorithm, the iterative algorithm which adds only the minimal amount of necessary constraints, and the genetic algorithm which combines the iterative algorithm with basic genetic algorithms. Finally, a simple version of both algorithms was implemented, and their performance was tested, all publicly available.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.16819v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a theoretical proposal for preparing and manipulating a state of a single continuous-variable degree of freedom confined to a nonharmonic potential. By utilizing optimally controlled modulation of the potential's position and depth, we demonstrate the generation of non-Gaussian states, including Fock, Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill, multi-legged-cat, and cubic-phase states, as well as the implementation of arbitrary unitaries within a selected two-level subspace. Additionally, we propose protocols for single-shot orthogonal state discrimination, algorithmic cooling, and correcting for nonlinear evolution. We analyze the robustness of this control scheme against noise. Since all the presented protocols rely solely on the precise modulation of the effective nonharmonic potential landscape, they are relevant to several experiments with continuous-variable systems, including the motion of a single particle in an optical tweezer or lattice, or current in circuit quantum electrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Probing quantum complexity via universal saturation of stabilizer entropies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04190v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonstabilizerness or `magic' is a key resource for quantum computing and a necessary condition for quantum advantage. Non-Clifford operations turn stabilizer states into resourceful states, where the amount of nonstabilizerness is quantified by resource measures such as stabilizer R\'enyi entropies (SREs). Here, we show that SREs saturate their maximum value at a critical number of non-Clifford operations. Close to the critical point SREs show universal behavior. Remarkably, the derivative of the SRE crosses at the same point independent of the number of qubits and can be rescaled onto a single curve. We find that the critical point depends non-trivially on R\'enyi index $\alpha$. For random Clifford circuits doped with T-gates, the critical T-gate density scales independently of $\alpha$. In contrast, for random Hamiltonian evolution, the critical time scales linearly with qubit number for $\alpha&gt;1$, while is a constant for $\alpha&lt;1$. This highlights that $\alpha$-SREs reveal fundamentally different aspects of nonstabilizerness depending on $\alpha$: $\alpha$-SREs with $\alpha&lt;1$ relate to Clifford simulation complexity, while $\alpha&gt;1$ probe the distance to the closest stabilizer state and approximate state certification cost via Pauli measurements. As technical contributions, we observe that the Pauli spectrum of random evolution can be approximated by two highly concentrated peaks which allows us to compute its SRE. Further, we introduce a class of random evolution that can be expressed as random Clifford circuits and rotations, where we provide its exact SRE. Our results opens up new approaches to characterize the complexity of quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Low-Overhead Transversal Fault Tolerance for Universal Quantum Computation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17653v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fast, reliable logical operations are essential for realizing useful quantum computers. By redundantly encoding logical qubits into many physical qubits and using syndrome measurements to detect and correct errors, one can achieve low logical error rates. However, for many practical quantum error correcting (QEC) codes such as the surface code, due to syndrome measurement errors, standard constructions require multiple extraction rounds -- on the order of the code distance $d$ -- for fault-tolerant computation, particularly considering fault-tolerant state preparation. Here, we show that logical operations can be performed fault-tolerantly with only a constant number of extraction rounds for a broad class of QEC codes, including the surface code with magic state inputs and feed-forward, to achieve ``transversal algorithmic fault tolerance". Through the combination of transversal operations and novel strategies for correlated decoding, despite only having access to partial syndrome information, we prove that the deviation from the ideal logical measurement distribution can be made exponentially small in the distance, even if the instantaneous quantum state cannot be made close to a logical codeword due to measurement errors. We supplement this proof with circuit-level simulations in a range of relevant settings, demonstrating the fault tolerance and competitive performance of our approach. Our work sheds new light on the theory of quantum fault tolerance and has the potential to reduce the space-time cost of practical fault-tolerant quantum computation by over an order of magnitude.</description>

Abstract: It is shown that any consistent interpretation of modern quantum mechanics is impossible, since its axiomatics is contradictory and incomplete: its provisions that the wave function in the Schr\"{o}dinger representation always describes pure states, and the wave function describing pure states imposes only statistical restrictions on the values of observables, are erroneous.</description>

      <title>Far from Perfect: Quantum Error Correction with (Hyperinvariant) Evenbly Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11926v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new class of qubit codes that we call Evenbly codes, building on a previous proposal of hyperinvariant tensor networks. Its tensor network description consists of local, non-perfect tensors describing CSS codes interspersed with Hadamard gates, placed on a hyperbolic $\{p,q\}$ geometry with even $q\geq 4$, yielding an infinitely large class of subsystem codes. We construct an example for a $\{5,4\}$ manifold and describe strategies of logical gauge fixing that lead to different rates $k/n$ and distances $d$, which we calculate analytically, finding distances which range from $d=2$ to $d \sim n^{2/3}$. Investigating threshold performance under erasure, depolarizing, and pure Pauli noise channels, we find that the code exhibits a depolarizing noise threshold of about 19.1% in the code-capacity model and 50% for pure Pauli and erasure channels under suitable gauges. We also test a constant-rate version with $k/n = 0.125$, finding excellent error resilience (about 40%) under the erasure channel. Recovery rates for these and other settings are studied both under an optimal decoder as well as a more efficient but non-optimal greedy decoder. We also consider generalizations beyond the CSS tensor construction, compute error rates and thresholds for other hyperbolic geometries, and discuss the relationship to holographic bulk/boundary dualities. Our work indicates that Evenbly codes may show promise for practical quantum computing applications.</description>

      <title>End-to-End Protocol for High-Quality QAOA Parameters with Few Shots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00557v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is a quantum heuristic for combinatorial optimization that has been demonstrated to scale better than state-of-the-art classical solvers for some problems. For a given problem instance, QAOA performance depends crucially on the choice of the parameters. While average-case optimal parameters are available in many cases, meaningful performance gains can be obtained by fine-tuning these parameters for a given instance. This task is especially challenging, however, when the number of circuit executions (shots) is limited. In this work, we develop an end-to-end protocol that combines multiple parameter settings and fine-tuning techniques. We use large-scale numerical experiments to optimize the protocol for the shot-limited setting and observe that optimizers with the simplest internal model (linear) perform best. We implement the optimized pipeline on a trapped-ion processor using up to 32 qubits and 5 QAOA layers, and we demonstrate that the pipeline is robust to small amounts of hardware noise. To the best of our knowledge, these are the largest demonstrations of QAOA parameter fine-tuning on a trapped-ion processor in terms of 2-qubit gate count.</description>

      <title>An almost-linear time decoding algorithm for quantum LDPC codes under circuit-level noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01440v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fault-tolerant quantum computers must be designed in conjunction with classical co-processors that decode quantum error correction measurement information in real-time. In this work, we introduce the belief propagation plus ordered Tanner forest (BP+OTF) algorithm as an almost-linear time decoder for quantum low-density parity-check codes. The OTF post-processing stage removes qubits from the decoding graph until it has a tree-like structure. Provided that the resultant loop-free OTF graph supports a subset of qubits that can generate the syndrome, BP decoding is then guaranteed to converge. To enhance performance under circuit-level noise, we introduce a technique for sparsifying detector error models. This method uses a transfer matrix to map soft information from the full detector graph to the sparsified graph, preserving critical error propagation information from the syndrome extraction circuit. Our BP+OTF implementation first applies standard BP to the full detector graph, followed by BP+OTF post-processing on the sparsified graph. Numerical simulations show that the BP+OTF decoder achieves similar logical error suppression compared to state-of-the-art inversion-based and matching decoders for bivariate bicycle and surface codes, respectively, while maintaining almost-linear runtime complexity across all stages.</description>

      <title>Long-distance device-independent quantum key distribution using single-photon entanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17075v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Device-independent quantum key distribution (DIQKD) provides the strongest form of quantum security, as it allows two honest users to establish secure communication channels even when using fully uncharacterized quantum devices. The security proof of DIQKD is derived from the violation of a Bell inequality, mitigating side-channel attacks by asserting the presence of nonlocality. This enhanced security comes at the cost of a challenging implementation, especially over long distances, as losses make Bell tests difficult to conduct successfully. Here, we propose a photonic realization of DIQKD, utilizing a heralded preparation of a single-photon path entangled state between the honest users. Being based on single-photon interference effects, the obtained secret key rate scales with the square root of the quantum channel transmittance. This leads to positive key rates over distances of up to hundreds of kilometers, making the proposed setup a promising candidate for securing long-distance communication in quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Universal bounds for quantum metrology in the presence of correlated noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01881v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive fundamental bounds for general quantum metrological models involving both temporal or spatial correlations (mathematically described by quantum combs), which may be effectively computed in the limit of a large number of probes or sensing channels involved. Although the bounds are not guaranteed to be tight in general, their tightness may be systematically increased by increasing numerical complexity of the procedure. Interestingly, this approach yields bounds tighter than the state of the art also for uncorrelated channels. We apply the bound to study the limits for the most general adaptive phase estimation models in the presence of temporally correlated dephasing. We consider dephasing both parallel (no Heisenberg scaling) and perpendicular (Heisenberg scaling possible) to the signal. In the former case our new bounds show that negative correlations are beneficial, for the latter we show evidence that the bounds are tight. We also apply the bounds to collisional thermometry, i.e. estimation of a parameter of the environment, showing evidence that entangled probes may provide only a limited advantage.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09465v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the distribution in space and time of a single-photon excitation shared by a network of dipole-dipole interacting atoms that are also coupled to a common photonic field mode. Time-averaged distributions reveal partial trapping of the excitation near the initially excited atom. This trapping is associated with resonances of the excitation at crossing points of the photon-dressed energy eigenvalues of the network. The predicted photon-induced many-atom trapped excitation (PIMATE) is sensitive to atomic position disorder which broadens the excitation resonances and transforms them to avoided crossings. PIMATE is shown to allow highly effective and accurate sensing of multi-atom networks and their disorder.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17817v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Schr\"odinger-Newton equation, a theoretical framework connecting quantum mechanics with classical gravity, predicts that gravity may induce measurable deviations in low-frequency mechanical systems-an intriguing hypothesis at the frontier of fundamental physics. In this study, we developed and operated an advanced optomechanical platform to investigate these effects. The system integrates an optical cavity with finesse over 350000 and a torsion pendulum with an ultra-low eigenfrequency of 0.6mHz, achieving a high mechanical Q-factor exceeding 50000. We collected data for 3 months and reached a sensitivity of 0.3urad/rtHz at the Schr\"odinger-Newton frequency of 2.5mHz where deviations from the standard quantum mechanics may occur. While no evidence supporting semiclassical gravity was found, we identify key challenges in such tests and propose new experimental approaches to advance this line of inquiry. This work demonstrates the potential of precision optomechanics to probe the interplay between quantum mechanics and gravity.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we study the effect of localizing quantum field degrees of freedom by dynamically growing cavity walls through a time-dependent potential. We use our results to show that it is possible to do this without introducing non-negligible mixedness in localized modes of the field. We discuss how this addresses the concerns, raised in previous literature, that the high degree of entanglement of regular states in QFT may hinder relativistic quantum information protocols that make use of localized relativistic probes.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal Entanglement by Dynamically Encircling a Nexus</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19715v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonreciprocal entanglement, characterized by inherently robust operation, is a cornerstone for quantum information processing and communications. However, it remains a great challenge to achieve nonreciprocal entanglement characterized by stability and robustness against environmental fluctuations. Here, we propose a universal nonlinear mechanism to engineer magnetic-free nonreciprocity in dissipative optomechanics by utilizing bistability, a phenomenon ubiquitous across nonlinear physical systems. By dynamically encircling the nexus of bistability, a cusp converged by the bistable surfaces, we obtain nonreciprocal displacement and then utilize it to achieve robust nonreciprocal entanglement. Owing to the unique landscape of bistability, our nonreciprocal displacement and entanglements exhibit stability and robustness through closed-loop operations. Our work presents a foundational framework for leveraging nonlinearity to achieve nonreciprocal quantum information processing. It paves new avenues for exploring nonreciprocal quantum information processing and designing backaction-immune quantum metrology with nonlinearity.</description>

Abstract: Complex quantum networks are powerful tools in the modeling of transport phenomena, particularly for biological systems, and enable the study of emergent phenomena in many-body quantum systems. High connectivity and long range interactions induce strong constraints on the system dynamics. Here, we study the transport properties of a quantum network described by the paradigmatic XXZ Hamiltonian, with non-trivial graph connectivity and topology, and long-range interaction. We show how long range interactions induce a memory preserving effects and strongly affect the spreading of the excitations due to cooperative shielding. We describe the memory-preserving effect in all-to-all connected regular networks with distance-independent couplings. Indeed the memory of the number of initially injected excitations is preserved over long times, being encoded in the number of frequencies present in the dynamics. Interestingly, we find that memory-preserving effects occur also in less regular graphs, such as quantum networks with either power-law node connectivity or complex, small-world type, architectures. We discuss the implications of these properties in biology-related problems, such as an application to Weber's law in neuroscience, and their implementation in specific quantum technologies via biomimicry. We also show how the presence of long range interaction strongly affect the dynamics of the excitations in small-world networks and power law all-to-all coupled networks. Indeed due to cooperative shielding as the connectivity or the range of interaction increase the initial excitation spreads more slowly among the network and becomes strongly dependent on the initial conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07468v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonstabilizerness, also known as quantum magic, quantifies the deviation of quantum states from stabilizer states, capturing the complexity necessary for quantum computational advantage. In this study, we investigate the dynamics of quantum magic in disordered many-body localized (MBL) systems using the stabilizer R\'enyi entropy (SRE). Leveraging a phenomenological description based on the $\ell$-bit model, we analytically and numerically demonstrate that interactions profoundly influence magic spreading, inducing a power-law growth of SRE that markedly contrasts with the rapid saturation observed in ergodic systems. We validate our theoretical predictions through numerical simulations of the disordered transverse-field Ising model, showing excellent agreement across various disorder strengths, system sizes, and initial states. Additionally, we uncover a universal relationship between SRE and entanglement entropy, revealing their common scaling in the MBL regime independent of disorder strength and system size. Our results offer critical insights into the interplay of disorder, interactions, and complexity in quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>QCPINN: Quantum-Classical Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Solving PDEs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16678v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have emerged as promising methods for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) by embedding physical laws within neural architectures. However, these classical approaches often require a large number of parameters to achieve reasonable accuracy, particularly for complex PDEs. In this paper, we present a quantum-classical physics-informed neural network (QCPINN) that combines quantum and classical components, allowing us to solve PDEs with significantly fewer parameters while maintaining comparable accuracy and convergence to classical PINNs. We systematically evaluated two quantum circuit architectures across various configurations on five benchmark PDEs to identify optimal QCPINN designs. Our results demonstrate that the QCPINN achieves stable convergence and comparable accuracy, while requiring approximately 10\% of the trainable parameters used in classical approaches. It also results in a 40\% reduction in the relative error $L_2$ for the convection-diffusion equation. These findings demonstrate the potential of parameter efficiency as a measurable quantum advantage in physics-informed machine learning, significantly reducing model complexity while preserving solution quality. This approach presents a promising solution to the computational challenges associated with solving PDEs.</description>

Abstract: Colliders enable the testing of quantum mechanics at its most fundamental level, and in the presence of both strong and electroweak interactions. Particle physics naturally provides examples of systems that consist not only of qubits but also qutrits. Quantum tomography at colliders makes possible the measurement of entanglement and the testing of Bell locality. We provide a comprehensive explanation of how this is achieved and why it offers a novel perspective on the loopholes exploited by local hidden variable models to evade Bell tests.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate conditional entanglement swapping, i.e. teleportation of entanglement, between time-bin qubits at the telecommunication wavelength of 1536.4 nm with high fidelity of 87\%. Our system is deployable, utilizing modular, off-the-shelf, fiber-coupled, and electrically controlled components such as electro-optic modulators. It leverages the precise timing resolution of superconducting nanowire detectors, which are controlled and read out via a custom developed graphical user interface. The swapping process is described, interpreted, and guided using characteristic function-based analytical modeling that accounts for realistic imperfections. Our system supports quantum networking protocols, including source-independent quantum key distribution, with an estimated secret key rate of approximately 0.5 bits per sifted bit.</description>

Abstract: Quantum simulation of particle phenomena is a rapidly advancing field of research. With the widespread availability of quantum simulators, a given quantum system can be simulated in numerous ways, offering flexibility in implementation and exploration. Here, we perform quantum simulation of neutrino propagation in matter, a phenomenon that plays a crucial role in neutrino oscillations. We present quantum circuits with novel gate arrangements to simulate neutrino propagation in both constant and varying matter density profiles. The oscillation probabilities are determined by encoding and measuring the qubit states in the neutrino flavor basis, showing excellent agreement with theoretical predictions.</description>

Abstract: We describe our investigations involving the sonification of data from experiments involving various mesoscopic mechanical oscillator systems cooled to close to their quantum ground states, as well as the sonification of measured data from a single qubit subject to various unitary rotations designed to test the Leggett-Garg inequality. "Listening" to data via their resulting sonifications facilitates the discovery of signals that might otherwise be hard to detect in common graphic (i.e., visual) representations, and for the qubit experiment provides a complementary way to discern when the data violates macroscopic realism with some prior listening training. The resulting soundscapes and music also provide a complementary window into the quantum realm that is accessible to non-experts with open ears.</description>

      <title>Maximally entangled states are not always useful for single shot distinguishability of unitaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14499v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There have been many instances where the maximally entangled state as a probe acts better than the product and the non-maximally entangled states in the task of distinguishing quantum channels. We provide a proof that for single-shot discrimination of two unitary channels, entangled and product states are operationally equivalent. But we identify pairs of unitaries that are perfectly distinguishable using a non-maximally entangled state, but not with a maximally entangled one. This contrast becomes more pronounced when the number of unitaries exceeds two. In every dimension $\geqslant 3$, we show that there exists a class of unitaries that are indistinguishable under maximally entangled probes, yet perfectly distinguishable using product or non-maximally entangled inputs. Another interesting set of unitaries in every dimension $\geqslant 3$ has been presented where only non-maximally entangled state acts as the successful probe, while product states and maximally entangled states cannot.</description>

Abstract: Cold Rydberg atoms trapped in an array of optical tweezers can be manipulated using laser light. We investigate the fate of out-of-equilibrium quantum dynamics in a model of Rydberg atoms arranged in a square ladder geometry within the strong blockade regime, with a detuning profile staggered along the longer direction. As the staggering strength is tuned, the model exhibits a wide class of dynamical phenomena, ranging from quantum many-body scars, integrability-induced slow dynamics and approximate Krylov fractures. Furthermore, by leveraging the chiral nature of the spectrum, we design Floquet protocols which result in dynamical signatures reminiscent of discrete-time-crystalline order and exact Floquet-flat-bands.</description>

      <title>Preparing Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state on ground levels of neutral atoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18074v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a scalable protocol in the Rydberg atomic system to generate the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states, where the qubits are encoded on the hyperfine ground levels. Our system is featured with off-resonant driving fields rather than strong Rydberg interaction sufficient for blockade. Closely it can follow the desired nonadiabatic passage during the time evolution and avoid the unwanted transition by imposing the passage-dependent and fast-varying global phase, that serves as an error correction to the universal quantum control. In our protocol, an $N$-qubit GHZ state is prepared in $N-1$ steps, which is found to be robust against both environmental noise and systematic deviation. Our protocol therefore provides an avenue toward large-scale entanglement, which is essential for quantum information processing and computation based on neutral atoms.</description>

      <title>Automatic Configuration Protocols for Optical Quantum Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19613v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Before quantum networks can scale up to practical sizes, there are many deployment and configuration tasks that must be automated. Currently, quantum networking testbeds are largely manually configured: network nodes are constructed out of a combination of free-space and fiber optics before being connected to shared single-photon detectors, time-to-digital converters, and optical switches. Information about these connections must be tracked manually; mislabeling may result in experimental failure and protracted debugging sessions. In this paper, we propose protocols and algorithms to automate two such manual processes. First, we address the problem of automatically identifying connections between quantum network nodes and time-to-digital converters. Then, we turn to the more complex challenge of identifying the nodes attached to a quantum network's optical switches. Implementation of these protocols will help enable the development of other protocols necessary for quantum networks, such as network topology discovery, link quality monitoring, resource naming, and routing. We intend for this paper to serve as a roadmap for near-term implementation.</description>

Abstract: The Schmidt numbers quantify the entanglement degree of quantum states. Quantum states with high Schmidt numbers provide a larger advantage in various quantum information processing tasks compared to quantum states with low Schmidt numbers. We derive a Schmidt number criterion based on the trace norm of the correlation matrix obtained from symmetric measurements. We show that our result is more effective than and superior to existing Schmidt number criteria by detailed examples.</description>

Abstract: A Hamiltonian with eigenenergies $E_n = \rho_n(1-\rho_n) $ has been constructed, where $\rho_n $ denotes the $n$-th non-trivial zero of the Riemann zeta function. To construct such a Hamiltonian, we generalize the Berry-Keating's paradigm and encode number-theoretic information into the Hamiltonian through modular forms. Even though our construction does not resolve the Hilbert-P\'olya conjecture -- since the eigenstates corresponding to $E_n$ are \emph{not} normalizable states -- it offers a novel physical perspective on the Riemann Hypothesis(RH). Especially, we proposed a physical statement of RH, which may serve as a potential pathway toward its proof.</description>

Abstract: After publishing my book "Quantum Computing Architecture and Hardware for Engineers: Step by Step" [1] (now I call it Volume I), in which spin qubit and superconducting qubit quantum computers were covered, I decided to continue to write the second volume to cover the trapped ion qubit quantum computer, which was also taught in my EE274 class. I follow the same structure as in Volume I by discussing the physics, mathematics, and their connection to laser pulses and electronics based on how they fulfill the five DiVincenzo's criteria. I also think it would be a good idea to share the second volume on arXiv so that more people can read it for free, and I can continue to update the contents. As of July 2025, I have finished the trapped ion quantum computer part. In the future, I plan to write more critical topics in a step-by-step manner to bridge engineers who did not receive rigorous training in Physics to the quantum computing world.</description>

      <title>High-power readout of a transmon qubit using a nonlinear coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03642v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The field of superconducting qubits is constantly evolving with new circuit designs. However, when it comes to qubit readout, the use of simple transverse linear coupling remains overwhelmingly prevalent. This standard readout scheme has significant drawbacks: in addition to the Purcell effect, it suffers from a limitation on the maximal number of photons in the readout mode, which restricts the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the Quantum Non-Demolition (QND) nature of the readout. Here, we explore the high-power regime by engineering a nonlinear coupling between a transmon qubit and its readout mode. Our approach builds upon previous work by Dassonneville et al. [Physical Review X 10, 011045 (2020)], on qubit readout with a non-perturbative cross-Kerr coupling in a transmon molecule. We demonstrate a readout fidelity of 99.21% with 89 photons utilizing a parametric amplifier. At this elevated photon number, the QND nature remains high at 96.7%. Even with up to 300 photons, the QNDness is only reduced by a few percent. This is qualitatively explained by deriving a critical number of photons associated with the nonlinear coupling, yielding a theoretical value of $\bar{n}_r^\text{crit} = 377$ photons for our sample's parameters. These results highlight the promising performance of the transmon molecule in the high-power regime, establishing it as a compelling platform for high-fidelity qubit readout.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11766v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Lindblad equation embodies a fundamental paradigm of the quantum theory of open systems, and the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) generation theorem says precisely which superoperators can appear on its right-hand side. These are the generators of completely positive trace-preserving (or nonincreasing) semigroups. A complete exposition of this theorem is given. The finite-dimensional case is handled using a form of Jamio\l{}kowski transform. The treatment requires no previous knowledge of complete positivity and obtains the Choi-Kraus presentation along the way. The (separable) infinite-dimensional case is handled by means of a sequence of finite-dimensional approximations, using the finite-dimensional case as a crucial tool. An extension to time-dependent generator is given.The condition for CP evolution is just that for semigroups applied at each instant, and the Lindblad decomposition can be chosen continuous in time.</description>

      <title>Mechanical Squeezed-Fock Qubit: Towards Quantum Weak-Force Sensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13161v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mechanical qubits offer unique advantages over other qubit platforms, primarily in terms of coherence time and possibilities for enhanced sensing applications, but their potential is constrained by the inherently weak nonlinearities and small anharmonicity of nanomechanical resonators. We propose to overcome this shortcoming by using squeezed Fock states of phonons in a parametrically driven nonlinear mechanical oscillator. We find that, under two-phonon driving, squeezed Fock states become eigenstates of a Kerr-nonlinear mechanical oscillator, featuring an energy spectrum with exponentially enhanced and tunable anharmonicity, such that the transitions to higher energy states are exponentially suppressed. This enables us to encode the mechanical qubit within the ground and first excited squeezed Fock states of the driven mechanical oscillator. This kind of mechanical qubit is termed mechanical squeezed-Fock qubit. We also show that our mechanical qubit can serve as a quantum sensor for weak forces, with its resulting sensitivity increased by at least one order of magnitude over that of traditional mechanical qubits. The proposed mechanical squeezed-Fock qubit provides a powerful quantum phonon platform for quantum sensing and information processing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14892v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs) play a vital role in non-Hermitian (NH) systems, driving unique dynamical phenomena and promising innovative applications. However, the NH dynamics at EPs remains obscure due to the incomplete biorthogonal eigenspaces of defective NH Hamiltonians and thus is often avoided. In this manuscript, we systematically establish pseudo-completeness relations at EPs by employing all available generalized eigenstates, where both single and multiple arbitrary-order EPs embracing degenerate scenarios are addressed, to unveil EP dynamics. We reveal that depending on EP order and initial conditions, the EP dynamics is characterized by a \emph{polynomial growth over time} of coalescing eigenstates or their superposition, which will dominate long-term evolution despite real spectra protected by pseudo-Hermiticity (PH), or can also become unitary. We further introduce two PH-compliant NH models to demonstrate these EP dynamics and explore their applications. This work completes the dynamical investigation of NH physics, offers valuable insights into the nonunitary evolution at EPs, and further lays the foundation for engineering and exploiting EP-related devices and technologies.</description>

      <title>Directional Codes: a new family of quantum LDPC codes on hexagonal- and square-grid connectivity hardware</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19430v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Utility-scale quantum computing requires quantum error correction (QEC) to protect quantum information against noise. Currently, superconducting hardware is a promising candidate for achieving fault tolerance due to its fast gate times and feasible scalability. However, it is often restricted to two-dimensional nearest-neighbour connectivity, which is thought to be incapable of accommodating high-rate quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes that promise to greatly reduce the number of physical qubits needed to encode logical qubits. In this paper we construct a new family of qLDPC codes, which we call ``Directional Codes'', that outperforms the rotated planar code (RPC) while naturally meeting the connectivity requirements of the widely adopted square-grid, and some even the sparser hexagonal-grid. The key idea is to utilise the iSWAP gate -- a natural native gate for superconducting qubits -- to construct circuits that measure the stabilisers of these qLDPC codes without the need for any long-range connections or an increased degree of connectivity. We numerically evaluate the performance of directional codes, encoding four, six and twelve logical qubits, using a common superconducting-inspired circuit-level Pauli noise model. We also compare them to the RPC and to the bivariate bicycle (BB) codes, currently the two most popular quantum LDPC code families. As a concrete example, directional codes outperform the RPC by achieving approximately the same logical error probability at physical error rate $p=10^{-3}$ using only $18.75-45\%$ of the physical qubits at distance up to $10$. Our discovery represents a breakthrough in QEC code design that suggests complex long-range, high-connectivity hardware may not be necessary for low-overhead fault-tolerant quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Gravity-Induced Entanglement via Squeezed Input Light under Finite Measurement Time</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01397v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the advantage of using squeezed input light for generating gravity-induced entanglement (GIE) through Fourier-domain analysis. Based on the findings of [1], which demonstrated the feasibility of detecting GIE in optomechanical systems under quantum control, we further demonstrate that squeezed input light can reduce the optical noise in the mechanical conditional state and enhance GIE. Furthermore, we estimate the systematic and statistical errors in the measurement of GIE using the Fourier transformation over a finite measurement time. Based on the error estimations using the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in GIE detection, we find that a total measurement time of 10^6 s is required to achieve SNR=1 when using squeezed input light, whereas 10^{6.8} s is needed without squeezed input light. This result highlights the effectiveness of optomechanical systems and the critical role of squeezed input light in enhancing the detectability of GIE.</description>

      <title>A class of 2x2 correlated random-matrix models with Brody spacing distribution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.01514v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A class of 2x2 random-matrix models is introduced for which the Brody distribution is the exact eigenvalue spacing distribution. The matrix elements consist of constrained finite sums of an exponential random variable raised to various powers that depend on the Brody parameter. The random matrices introduced here differ from those of the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE) in three important ways: the matrix elements are not independent and identically distributed (i.e., not IID) nor Gaussian-distributed, and the matrices are not necessarily real and/or symmetric. The first two features arise from dropping the classical independence assumption, and the third feature stems from dropping the quantum-mechanical conditions imposed in the construction of the GOE. In particular, the hermiticity condition, which in the present class of models, is a sufficient but not necessary condition for the eigenvalues to be real, is not imposed. Consequently, complex non-Hermitian 2x2 random matrices with real or complex eigenvalues can also have spacing distributions that are intermediate between those of the Poisson and Wigner classes. Numerical examples are provided for different types of random matrices, including complex-symmetric matrices with real or complex-conjugate eigenvalues. Various generalizations and extensions are discussed including a simple modification that effectuates cross-over transitions between other classes of eigenvalue spacing statistics. The case of a cross-over transition between semi-Poisson and Ginibre spacing statistics is presented as a novel example.</description>

      <title>Estimating Trotter Approximation Errors to Optimize Hamiltonian Partitioning for Lower Eigenvalue Errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13282v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Trotter approximation in conjunction with Quantum Phase Estimation can be used to extract eigen-energies of a many-body Hamiltonian on a quantum computer. There were several ways proposed to assess the quality of this approximation based on estimating the norm of the difference between the exact and approximate evolution operators. Here, we explore how different error estimators correlate with the true error in the ground state energy due to Trotter approximation. For a set of small molecules we calculate these exact error in ground-state electronic energies due to the second-order Trotter approximation. Comparison of these errors with previously used upper bounds show correlation less than 0.4 across various Hamiltonian partitionings. On the other and, building the Trotter approximation error estimation based on perturbation theory up to a second order in the time-step for eigenvalues provides estimates with very good correlations with the exact Trotter approximation errors. These findings highlight the non-faithful character of norm-based estimations for prediction of a Trotter-based eigenvalue estimation performance and the need of alternative estimators. The developed perturbative estimates can be used for practical time-step and Hamiltonian partitioning selection protocols, which are needed for an accurate assessment of quantum resources.</description>

      <title>Krylov Complexity as a Probe for Chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10194v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we explore in detail, the time evolution of Krylov complexity. We demonstrate, through analytical computations, that in finite many-body systems, while ramp and plateau are two generic features of Krylov complexity, the manner in which complexity saturates reveals the chaotic nature of the system. In particular, we show that the dynamics towards saturation precisely distinguish between chaotic and integrable systems. For chaotic models, the saturation value of complexity reaches its infinite time average at a finite saturation time. In this case, depending on the initial state, it may also exhibit a peak before saturation. In contrast, in integrable models, complexity approaches the infinite time average value from below at a much longer timescale. We confirm this distinction using numerical results for specific spin models.</description>

      <title>Subwavelength arrays of quantum emitters: nonlinearities enter the weak-drive regime, and lead to correlated subradiant states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01386v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum emitter arrays have emerged as important platforms in which strong light-matter interactions can be achieved and precisely controlled. In subwavelength regimes, they are characterised by a manifold of subradiant eigenstates, which can host novel quantum many-body states and are promising for several applications. Nevertheless, their excitation under a weak far-field driving is prevented by their subradiant nature. Consequently, the weak-drive regime has been widely regarded as a linear regime, well described by classical equations. In this work, we find that, suprisingly, the weak-drive regime is instead strongly non-linear for regular geometries, due to the important contribution of higher-order, resonant and momentum-conserving processes exciting subradiant states. Using a Dynamical Mean-Field Theory (DMFT) we show that these processes lead to a steady state of interacting subradiant excitation pairs, with quantum correlations of two-mode squeezing and long-range character, realising a novel strongly-correlated driven-dissipative state. These findings have potential impact for non-linear optics and quantum metrology.</description>

      <title>Below threshold nonsequential double ionization with linearly polarized two-color fields I: symmetry and dominance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19658v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate laser-induced nonsequential double ionization with linearly polarized bichromatic fields, focusing on the recollision-excitation with subsequent ionization (RESI) mechanism. Using the strong-field approximation, we assess how the symmetries of the field influence the dominant events. Furthermore, we show that, by manipulating the field parameters such as the field frequencies and relative phase between the two driving waves, one can influence the correlated electron-momentum distributions. Specific features of a linearly polarized bichromatic field are that the momentum distributions of the second electron are no longer centered around vanishing momenta and that there may be more than one ionization event per half cycle. This can be used to confine the RESI distributions to specific momentum regions and to determine a hierarchy of parameters that make an event dominant.</description>

      <title>The thread embodiment of holographic quantum entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10691v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper systematically develops the concept of entanglement threads that characterize the entanglement structure of holographic duality. Behind this framework lies a simple philosophy: holographic quantum entanglement can be visualized using thread-like objects. Inspired by the fact that tensor network models can be deformed into a quantum circuit form with flow-conserving features, we abstract the concept of entanglement threads. These entanglement threads can be understood as a pre-set ensemble of wires in a holographic quantum circuit, and we propose that they characterize the underlying partially ordered structure of holographic quantum entanglement. Combining the concepts of entanglement threads and kinematic space, a elegant circuit interpretation for the holographic complexity is provided. We also clarify the connection and distinction between entanglement threads and the previously proposed concept of bit threads.</description>

      <title>PennyLang: Pioneering LLM-Based Quantum Code Generation with a Novel PennyLane-Centric Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02497v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer powerful capabilities in code generation, natural language understanding, and domain-specific reasoning. Their application to quantum software development remains limited, in part because of the lack of high-quality datasets both for LLM training and as dependable knowledge sources. To bridge this gap, we introduce PennyLang, an off-the-shelf, high-quality dataset of 3,347 PennyLane-specific quantum code samples with contextual descriptions, curated from textbooks, official documentation, and open-source repositories. Our contributions are threefold: (1) the creation and open-source release of PennyLang, a purpose-built dataset for quantum programming with PennyLane; (2) a framework for automated quantum code dataset construction that systematizes curation, annotation, and formatting to maximize downstream LLM usability; and (3) a baseline evaluation of the dataset across multiple open-source models, including ablation studies, all conducted within a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline. Using PennyLang with RAG substantially improves performance: for example, Qwen 7B's success rate rises from 8.7% without retrieval to 41.7% with full-context augmentation, and LLaMa 4 improves from 78.8% to 84.8%, while also reducing hallucinations and enhancing quantum code correctness. Moving beyond Qiskit-focused studies, we bring LLM-based tools and reproducible methods to PennyLane for advancing AI-assisted quantum development.</description>

      <title>Noise-Affected Dynamical Quantum Phase Transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03005v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of uncorrelated noise on dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) in fermionic two-band models following a quantum ramp across critical points. We consider a generalized Loschmidt echo for the noise-averaged density matrix $\bar\rho$, which is a mixed state in general, as well as the pure state Loschmidt echo calculated for each noise realization with the average performed over the corresponding return rates. $\bar\rho$ can be obtained from a master equation and we show that for two-band models noise destroys its coherences which typically drives $\bar\rho$ towards the completely mixed state which is an attractive fixed point. DQPTs are thus always smoothed out for finite noise. For single noise realizations, on the other hand, we find that DQPTs under certain conditions are always present irrespective of the noise level. This leads to remarkable stable though slightly broadened DQPT-like features in the averaged return rate. We illustrate our results for the XY model by considering a noisy ramp as well as noise in the energy levels of the final Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Enantiosensitive locking of photoelectron spin and cation orientation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22433v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chirality describes the asymmetry between an object and its mirror image, underpinning diverse functionalities across all scales of matter-from molecules and aggregates to thin films and bulk chiral materials. A particularly intriguing example is chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS), where chiral structures orient electron spins enantio-sensitively. Despite extensive research, the fundamental origin of spin-chirality coupling, the unexpectedly large magnitude of the CISS effect, and the possible role of electromagnetic fields remain unclear. Here, we address these issues by examining the simplest scenario: spin-resolved photoionization of randomly oriented chiral molecules. We uncover two universal geometric mechanisms of spin-selective photodynamics, arising solely from electric-dipole interactions and previously unrecognized. These mechanisms operate effectively even in amorphous chiral media under isotropic illumination and persist at weak spin-orbit coupling, underscoring fundamental aspects of spin-chirality interplay. We further identify an unreported phenomenon central to CISS: locking of photoelectron spin orientation to molecular geometry. Our findings provide a unified geometric framework with broad implications, extending from CISS and asymmetric catalysis to spin textures in chiral crystals and chiral quantum materials such as Weyl semimetals.</description>

      <title>Quasiconservation Laws and Suppressed Transport in Weakly Interacting Localized Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The stability of localization in the presence of interactions remains an open problem, with finite-size effects posing significant challenges to numerical studies. In this work, we investigate the perturbative stability of noninteracting localization under weak interactions, which allows us to analyze much larger system sizes. Focusing on disordered Anderson and quasiperiodic Aubry-Andr\'e models in one dimension, and using the adiabatic gauge potential (AGP) at first order in perturbation theory, we compute first-order corrections to noninteracting local integrals of motion (LIOMs). We find that for at least an $O(1)$ fraction of the LIOMs, the corrections are well-controlled and converge at large system sizes, while others suffer from resonances. Additionally, we introduce and study the charge-transport capacity of this weakly interacting model. To first order, we find that the charge transport capacity remains bounded in the presence of interactions. Taken together, these results demonstrate that localization is perturbatively stable to weak interactions at first order, implying that, at the very least, localization persists for parametrically long times in the inverse interaction strength. We expect this perturbative stability to extend to all orders at sufficiently strong disorder, where the localization length is short, representing the true localized phase. Conversely, our findings suggest that the previously proposed interaction-induced avalanche instability, namely in the weakly localized regime of the Anderson and Aubry-Andr\'e models, is a more subtle phenomenon arising only at higher orders in perturbation theory or through nonperturbative effects.</description>

      <title>Natural super-orbitals representation of many-body operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10690v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of natural super-orbitals for many-body operators, defined as the eigenvectors of the one-body super-density matrix associated with a vectorized operator. We relate these objects to measures of non-Gaussianity of operators associated to the occupations of the natural super-orbitals, and define how the non-stabilizerness of operators can be affected by such a basis rotation. We first analyze the general analytical properties of these objects in various contexts, including the time-evolution operator of non-interacting Hamiltonians and Haar-random unitaries. We then perform a numerical investigation of the natural super-orbitals corresponding to both the time-evolution operator and a time-evolved local operator, focusing on two many-body systems: the fermionic $t\text{-}V$ chain and an impurity model, using tensor network simulations. Our results reveal that the $t\text{-}V$ model lacks a preferred super-orbital basis, while in the impurity model, the occupations of the natural orbitals for both operators decay exponentially at all times. This indicates that only a small number of orbitals contribute significantly to quantum correlations, enabling a compact matrix-product-operator representation and a reduced non-stabilizerness in the natural orbital basis. Finally, we examine the spatial spread of the natural orbitals for time-evolved local operators in the impurity model and show that the complexity of this operator in the natural orbital basis saturates over time. This new framework opens the door to future research that leverages the compressed structure of operators in their natural super-orbital basis, enabling for instance the computation of out-of-time-order correlators in large interacting systems over extended time scales.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Suppression Due to Black Hole Scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23729v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the evolution of entanglement entropy in a two-dimensional conformal field theory with a holographic dual. Specifically, we are interested in a class of excited states produced by a combination of pure-state (local operator) and mixed-state local quenches. We employ a method that allows us to determine the full time evolution analytically. While a single insertion of a local operator gives rise to a logarithmic time profile of entanglement entropy relative to the vacuum, we find that this growth is heavily suppressed in the presence of a mixed-state quench, reducing it to a time-independent constant bump. The degree of suppression depends on the relative position of the quenches as well as the ratio of regularization parameters associated with the quenches. This work sheds light on the interesting properties of gravitational scattering involving black holes.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Resistant RSA Modulus Decomposition via Adaptive R\'enyi Entropy Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00840v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores a theoretical approach to enhance RSA's resistance against quantum attacks by optimizing prime selection through R\'enyi entropy constraints. We develop a framework where primes are generated with controlled proximity ($|p-q| &lt; \gamma\sqrt{pq}$) to minimize the collision entropy $\mathscr{H}_2$ of the quantum period-finding operator.
  The main contributions include: (1) establishing a connection between prime distribution properties and quantum attack complexity via Maynard's prime gap theorem, (2) providing a constructive proof for prime existence under entropy constraints, and (3) demonstrating security reduction to ideal lattice problems under the quantum random oracle model.
  Theoretical analysis suggests that for $k$-bit moduli with $\gamma &lt; k^{-1/2+\epsilon}$, Shor's algorithm requires $\Omega(\gamma^{-1}k^{3/2})$ quantum operations while maintaining classical security equivalent to standard RSA. Key Enhancements: (1) Prime existence proof via Maynard's theorem (Theorem 3.1), (2) Ideal lattice embedding for SVP reduction (Theorem 5.3), (3) Quantum Fano bound for information-theoretic analysis (Theorem 6.3), (4) Multi-prime RSA extension (Section 7.3).</description>
