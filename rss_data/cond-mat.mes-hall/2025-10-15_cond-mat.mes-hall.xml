      <title>Magnetometry with Broadband Microwave Fields in Nitrogen-Vacancy Centers in Diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are optically addressable and versatile light-matter interfaces with practical application in magnetic field sensing, offering the ability to operate at room temperature and reach sensitivities below pT/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}.$ We propose an approach to simultaneously probe all of the magnetically sensitive states using a broadband microwave field and demonstrate that it can be used to measure the external DC magnetic field strength with sensitivities below 1~nT/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}.$ We develop tools for analyzing the temporal signatures in the transmitted broadband microwaves to estimate the magnetic field, comparing maximum likelihood estimation based on minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence to various neural network models, and both methods independently reach practical sensitivities. These results are achieved without optimizing parameters such as the bandwidth, power, and shape of the probing microwave field such that, with further improvements, sensitivities down to $\mathrm{pT/\sqrt{Hz}}$ can be envisioned. Our results motivate novel implementations of NV-based magnetic sensors with the potential for vectorial magnetic field detection at 1-10 kHz update rates and improved sensitivities without requiring a bias magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Influence of Platinum Thin Films on the Photophysical and Quantum Properties of Near-Surface NV Centers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are optically addressable spin defects with great potential for nanoscale quantum sensing. A key application of NV centers is the detection of external spins at the diamond surface. Among metals, platinum thin films - widely used in spintronics, catalysis and electrochemistry - provide a particularly interesting system for such studies. However, the interaction between NV centers and metals is known to affect their quantum sensing capabilities. In this work, we study five platinum-covered diamond samples containing shallow NVs created via nitrogen implantation with different energies (2.5-60 keV) and investigate the optical and quantum properties of NV ensembles beneath the metal films. We find a substantial reduction of the photoluminescence lifetime and a pronounced decrease of the NV$^{-}$ population for NV ensembles located near the platinum layer. As a result, optically detected magnetic resonance experiments could only be efficiently performed on diamonds implanted with at least 20 keV, where we observed a strong increase in the T$_{2}$ coherence time beneath the platinum thin films. Our study describes the various processes affecting NV centers near platinum films and provides guidance for the integration of thin metal films with near-surface NV centers.</description>

      <title>Topological Robustness of Anyon Tunneling at $\nu = 1/3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scaling exponent $g$ of the quasiparticle propagator for incompressible fractional quantum Hall states in the Laughlin sequence is expected to be robust against perturbations that do not close the gap. Here we probe the topological robustness of the chiral Luttinger liquid at the boundary of the $\nu=1/3$ state by measuring the tunneling conductance between counterpropagating edge modes as a function of quantum point contact transmission. We demonstrate that for transmission $t\geq 0.7$ the tunneling conductance is well-described by the first two terms of a perturbative series expansion corresponding to $g=1/3$. We further demonstrate that the measured scaling exponent is robustly pinned to $g=1/3$ across the plateau, only deviating as the bulk state becomes compressible. Finally we examine the impact of weak disorder on the scaling exponent, finding it insensitive. These measurements firmly establish the topological robustness of anyon tunneling at $\nu=1/3$ and substantiate the chiral Luttinger liquid description of the edge mode.</description>

      <title>Neuromorphic heat transport effects in a molecular junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding energy transport at the nanoscale is an open and fundamental challenge in the molecular sciences with direct implications for the design of new electronics, computing devices, and materials. While nanoscale energy transport under steady-state conditions has been studied extensively, there is much less known about energy transport under time-dependent driving forces, particularly in the far-from-equilibrium regime. In this work, we use nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations and stochastic thermodynamics to investigate energy transport in a well-studied nanoscale system, a molecular junction, subjected to a time-periodic temperature gradient. The primary observation is that molecular junctions can exhibit heat transport hysteresis, a phenomenon in which the heat flux through a system depends not only on the instantaneous value of a time-dependent temperature bias but also on the temporal history of that bias. The presented findings illustrate that molecular junctions can exhibit the specific memory effect, heat transport hysteresis, that is essential for the design of thermal neuromorphic computers. This work elucidates a potential pathway toward the realization of such devices.</description>

      <title>Trembling motion of electrons driven by Larmor spin precession</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the initialization of an ensemble of electrons in the same spin state in strained n-InGaAs subject to a perpendicular magnetic field triggers an AC electric current at GHz frequencies. The AC current emerges in the absence of any driving force and survives until the coherent precession of the electron spins is lost. The current amplitude increases linearly with both the spin-orbit coupling strength and the external magnetic field. The generation mechanism of the observed oscillatory charge motion can be fruitfully described in terms of the periodic trembling motion of spin-polarized electrons, which is a solid-state analog to the Zitterbewegung of free Dirac electrons. Our results demonstrate that the hidden consequence of relativistic quantum mechanics is realized and can be studied in a rather simple solid-state system at moderate temperatures. Furthermore, the large amplitude of the AC current at high magnetic fields enables ultra-fast spin sensitive electric read-out in solids.</description>

      <title>Wiedemann-Franz behavior at the Weyl points in compressively strained HgTe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weyl semimetals, with their unique electronic band structure, have drawn significant interest for their potential to explore quantum anomalies in condensed matter systems. In this study, we investigate the large positive magneto-thermal conductance associated with the gravitational anomaly -- one of the predicted anomalies -- for a Weyl semimetal based on a compressively strained HgTe layer. We clearly identify the Weyl regime in our device and accurately extract the thermal conductance by performing thermometry measurements at liquid helium temperatures using fully electronic methods. We observe the anticipated increase in thermal conductance, and it perfectly matches the electrical conductance according to the Wiedemann-Franz law. This finding indicates that, despite the unique electronic spectrum of Weyl semimetals, the mechanism governing heat transport in this system is the same as that for electrical transport, with no additional violations of conservation laws.</description>

      <title>Green's function expansion for multiple coupled optical resonators with finite retardation using quasinormal modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electromagnetic Green's function is a crucial ingredient for the theoretical study of modern photonic quantum devices, but is often difficult or even impossible to calculate directly. We present a numerically efficient framework for calculating the scattered electromagnetic Green's function of a multi-cavity system with spatially separated open cavities (with arbitrary shape, dispersion and loss) and finite retardation times. The framework is based on a Dyson scattering equation that enables the construction of the Green's function from the quasinormal modes of the individual resonators within a few-mode approximation and a finite number of iteration steps without requiring nested integrals. The approach shows excellent agreement with the full numerical Green's function for the example of two coupled dipoles located in the gaps of two metal dimers serving as quasinormal mode cavities, and is easily extended to arbitrarily large separations and multiple cavities.</description>

      <title>Origin of Enhanced Thermal Resistance Near Nanoscale Hotspots: Insights from Full-Dispersion-Resolved Phonon Transport in Silicon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phonon transport near nanoscale hotspots (NHs) critically determines heat dissipation in advanced electronic devices. The prevailing understanding is that the enhanced thermal resistance (TR) observed in NHs originates from long mean free path (MFP) phonons, whose MFPs are much larger than the hotspot size, thereby limiting their ability to recognize hotspots and transport heat effectively. In this study, we revisit this problem by employing the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) with a full phonon dispersion model (FPDM) to capture mode-resolved velocities, scattering processes, and nonequilibrium phonon populations in silicon. The analysis demonstrates that the increase in TR near NHs is not caused by the long MFP itself but by the low specific heat of long-MFP phonons that do not scatter directly with optical modes. These phonons heat readily when energy is supplied, steepening the local temperature gradient near the NH and thereby enhancing TR. By resolving the spectral contributions to the phonon transport resistance and temperature gradients, we identify the critical role of the modal specific heat in nonlocal phonon transport. These results provide new physical insights into nanoscale thermal management and highlight the importance of spectral mode resolution in modeling heat dissipation in electronic devices.</description>

      <title>Conductance Plateaus at Quantum Hall Integer Filling Factors in Germanium Quantum Point Contacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constricting transport through a one-dimensional quantum point contact in the quantum Hall regime enables gate-tunable selection of the edge modes propagating between voltage probe electrodes. Here we investigate the quantum Hall effect in a quantum point contact fabricated on low disorder strained germanium quantum wells. For increasing magnetic field, we observe Zeeman spin-split 1D ballistic hole transport evolving to integer quantum Hall states, with well-defined quantised conductance increasing in multiples of $e^2/h$ down to the first integer filling factor $\nu=1$. These results establish strained germanium as a viable platform for complex experiments probing many-body states and quantum phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Dissipationless transport by design in ultrathin magnetic topological insulator films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic topological insulators (MTIs) are among the prominent platforms for the next generation of high-speed and low-power spintronic devices. However, unlike their non-magnetic counterparts, where the surface spin-momentum locking prevents electrons from being scattered by non-magnetic impurities and results in a dissipationless electronic flow, magnetic impurities in MTIs cause dissipation by exerting magnetic torque on the electron spin. Decreasing this resistance is desired to reduce energy consumption and optimize performance of MTIs in envisaged applications. Here we reveal how electronic backscattering can be suppressed in a MTI thin film by external magnetic and/or electronic stimuli, to yield an entirely dissipationless spin-polarized charge transport. Our findings thus present an effective route to preserve spin coherence and enhance spin-current functionality in magnetic topological materials, suggesting design strategies for magneto-electronic and spintronic devices with strongly reduced energy consumption.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first public release of plasmonX, a novel open-source code for simulating the plasmonic response of complex nanostructures. The code supports both fully atomistic and implicit descriptions of nanomaterials. In particular, it employs the frequency-dependent fluctuating charges ($\omega$FQ) and dipoles ($\omega$FQF$\mu$) models to describe the response properties of atomistic structures, including simple and $d$-metals, graphene-based structures, and multi-metal nanostructures. For implicit representations, the Boundary Element Method is implemented in both the dielectric polarizable continuum model (DPCM) and integral equation formalism (IEF-PCM) variants. The distribution also includes a post-processing module that enables analysis of electric field-induced properties such as charge density and electric field patterns.</description>

      <title>Broad nonlocal spectrum in the Pb-InSb hybrid three terminals for potential realization of Kitaev chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hybrid superconductor-semiconductor(SC-SM) nanowires remain one of the foremost platforms for engineering topological superconductivity and Majorana zero modes(MZMs) towards fault-tolerant topological qubits, especially with the rapid development of artificial Kitaev chains. In contrast to the widely used aluminum(Al)-based hybrids, lead(Pb) offers a bulk superconducting gap of ~1.4meV and a critical temperature of ~7.2K, giving rise to a proximity-induced gap that is roughly five times larger than that obtained with Al. Here we present the first three-terminal Pb-hybrid devices and perform nonlocal differential-conductance spectroscopy on this platform. The nonlocal measurement simultaneously resolves a dual-gap feature of the parent Pb gap and the large, hard, gate-tunable induced superconducting gap, distinguished by a switch between electron- and hole-like dissipation processes. Within the induced gap we observe several types of Andreev bound states(ABSs) that undergo singlet-doublet transitions. Moreover, by tuning gate voltages we achieve gate-controlled resonating sign reversals of the nonlocal conductance, identifying three distinct regimes that correspond to different configurations of quantum-dot(QD) resonances(single-resonance, double-resonance, and series-resonance). Finally, the coupling between ABSs and QDs also present and can be modulated from the weak- to strong-coupling limit, indicating the feasibility of realizing the artificial Kitaev chains. Crucially, the robust nonlocal signatures persist up to temperatures(~1K) far above the operating temperature of Al-based devices thanks to the unusually large induced gap, thereby widening the accessible parameter space greatly and underscoring the suitability of Pb-based hybrids for implementing warm temperature artificial Kitaev chains and the topological quantum devices protected by a substantially larger topological gap.</description>

      <title>Dipole-quadrupole model and multipole analysis of resonant membrane metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Membrane-metasurfaces, formed by periodic arrangements of holes in a dielectric layer, are gaining attention for their easier manufacturing via subtractive techniques, unnecessity of substrates, and access to resonant near-fields. Despite their practical relevance, their theoretical description remains elusive. Here, we present a semi-analytical dipole-quadrupole model for the multipole analysis of numerically-obtained reflection and transmission spectra in metasurfaces excited at arbitrary angles. Dipole models are generally sufficient to study traditional metasurfaces made of solid nanostructures. However, the inclusion of electric and magnetic quadrupoles is necessary to study membrane-metasurfaces, which offer an ideal platform to showcase our method. We demonstrate the importance of choosing the optimal position of a symmetric membrane-metasurface's unit cell to ensure the sufficiency of the dipole-quadrupole approximation. We show that our formalism can explain complex phenomena arising from inter-multipole interference, including lattice anapole and generalized Kerker effects, Fano resonances, and quasi-bound states in the continuum. We also present the applicability of the method to membrane-metasurfaces with non-centrosymmetric unit cells (e.g., conical holes and surface voids). By enabling a deeper insight into the coupling mechanisms leading to the formation of local and collective resonances, our method expands the electromagnetics toolbox to study, understand, and design conventional and membrane-metasurfaces.</description>

      <title>Visualizing the Impact of Quenched Disorder on 2D Electron Wigner Solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electron Wigner solids (WSs)1-12 provide an ideal system for understanding the competing effects of electron-electron and electron-disorder interactions, a central unsolved problem in condensed matter physics. Progress in this topic has been limited by a lack of single-defect-resolved experimental measurements as well as accurate theoretical tools to enable realistic experiment-theory comparison. Here we overcome these limitations by combining atomically-resolved scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) with quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulation of disordered 2D electron WSs. STM was used to image the electron density ($n_e$) dependent evolution of electron WSs in gate-tunable bilayer MoSe$_2$ devices with varying long-range ($n_\mathrm{LR}$) and short-range ($n_\mathrm{SR}$) disorder densities. These images were compared to QMC simulations using realistic disorder maps extracted from experiment, thus allowing the roles of different disorder types to be disentangled. We identify two distinct physical regimes for disordered electron WSs that depend on the magnitude of $n_\mathrm{SR}$. For $n_\mathrm{SR} \lesssim n_e$ the WS behavior is dominated by long-range disorder and features extensive mixed solid-liquid phases, a new type of re-entrant melting-crystallization, and prominent Friedel oscillations. In contrast, when $n_\mathrm{SR} \gg n_e$ these features are suppressed and a more robust amorphous WS phase emerges that persists to higher $n_e$, highlighting the importance of short-range disorder in this regime. Our work establishes a new framework for studying disordered quantum solids via a combined experimental-theoretical approach.</description>

      <title>Chern-Selective multi-valley Flat Bands in Twisted Mono-Bilayer and Mono-Trilayer MoTe$_2$</title>

Abstract: The interplay between moir\'e flat bands originating from different valleys can give rise to a variety of exotic quantum phases. In this work, we investigate the electronic properties of twisted mono-bilayer (A-AB) and mono-trilayer (A-ABA) MoTe$_2$ using first-principles calculations and continuum models. Unlike previous studies on twisted bilayer systems, in which low-energy flat bands originate solely from the $K/K'$ valleys, in A-AB and A-ABA twisted MoTe$_2$ (\tmt) the moir\'e bands at low energies arise from both the $\Gamma$ and $K/K'$ valleys, with spin Chern numbers $C_s=0$ (for $\Gamma$) and $C_{\uparrow/\downarrow}=\pm1$ (for $K/K'$), respectively. We show that the multi-valley moir\'e flat bands are governed by interlayer-hybridization effects, and that different stacking configurations and thicknesses tune the relative energy alignment between the $\Gamma$ and $K$ valley moir\'e flat bands. By constructing valley-resolved continuum models and performing Wannierization for the low-energy moir\'e bands, we further uncover that the Berry curvature and quantum metric distributions can be effectively tuned by the layer number and stacking configuration. Unlike other moir\'e systems, where only one kind of valley influenced the low energy physics, the simultaneous appearance of two distinct types of valleys, with different symmetries, establish A-AB and A-ABA \tmt\ as ideal platforms for studying layer-controlled multi-valley physics.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic Determination of Site-Selective Ligand Binding on Single Anisotropic Nanocrystals</title>

Abstract: Organic surface ligands are integral components of nanocrystals and nanoparticles that have a strong influence on their physicochemical properties, their interaction with the environment, and their ability to self-assemble and order into higher-order structures. These hybrid nanomaterials are tunable with applications in catalysis, directed self-assembly, next-generation optoelectronics, and chemical and quantum sensing. Critically, future advances depend on our ability to rationally engineer their surface chemistry. However, fundamental knowledge of ligand-nanoparticle behavior is limited by uncertainty in where and how these ligands bind to surfaces. For nanoparticles, in particular, few characterization techniques offer both the high spatial resolution and the precise chemical mapping needed to identify specific ligand binding sites. In this study, we utilized synchrotron infrared nanospectroscopy (SINS), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) together with first-principles computer simulations to validate the site-selective adsorption of organic ligands on a shaped nanocrystal surface. Specifically, we demonstrate that the sterically encumbered isocyanide ligands (CNAr^{Mes2}) preferentially bind to the high curvature features of Ag nanocubes (NCs), where low-coordinate Ag atoms are present. In contrast, isocyanide ligands that do not exhibit these steric properties show no surface selectivity. SINS serves as an effective tool to validate these surface binding interactions at the near-single molecule level. These results indicate that steric effects can be successfully harnessed to design bespoke organic ligands for fine-tuning nanocrystal surface chemistry and the properties of the nanocrystal ligand shell.</description>

      <title>Room temperature control of axial and basal antiferromagnetic anisotropies using strain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Antiferromagnetic materials are promising platforms for the development of ultra-fast spintronics and magnonics due to their robust magnetism, high-frequency relativistic dynamics, low-loss transport, and the ability to support topological textures. However, achieving deterministic control over antiferromagnetic order in thin films is a major challenge, due to the formation of multi-domain states stabilised by competing magnetic and destressing interactions. Thus, the successful implementation of antiferromagnetic materials necessitates careful engineering of their anisotropy. Here, we demonstrate strain-based robust control over multiple antiferromagnetic anisotropies and nanoscale domains in the promising spintronic candidate a-Fe2O3, at room temperature. By applying isotropic and anisotropic in-plane strains across a broad temperature-strain phase space, we systematically tune the interplay between magneto-crystalline and magneto-elastic interactions. We discover that strain-driven control steers the system towards an aligned antiferromagnetic state, whilst preserving topological spin textures, such as merons, antimerons and bimerons. We directly map the nanoscale antiferromagnetic order using linear dichroic scanning transmission X-ray microscopy integrated with in situ strain and temperature control. A Landau model and micromagnetic simulations reveal how strain reshapes the magnetic energy landscape. These findings suggest that strain could serve as a versatile control mechanism to reconfigure equilibrium or dynamic antiferromagnetic states on demand in a-Fe2O3, paving the way for next-generation spintronic and magnonic devices.</description>

      <title>Controlling Magnetism in the 2D van der Waals Antiferromagnet CrPS$_4$ via Ion Intercalation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional van der Waals (vdW) magnetic materials are versatile platforms for tailoring electronic and magnetic properties, in which the insertion of chemical species into their interlayer gaps offers a powerful route to engineer magnetism. Here, we focus on the A-type antiferromagnetic semiconductor CrPS$_4$ (T$_N$ = 38 K) and investigate its electronic and magnetic properties upon intercalation of lithium (Li$^+$) and organic tetrabutylammonium (TBA$^+$) ions using first-principles calculations. Our results show that Li$^+$ incorporation induces a semiconductor-to-metal transition in CrPS$_4$ and selectively modifies its magnetic behaviour: switching from out-of-plane to in-plane antiferromagnetism, followed by an in-plane ferromagnetic ground state at higher intercalation levels. This is accompanied by a continuous increase of the ordering temperature, reaching a fivefold enhancement for Li$_{0.5}$CrPS$_4$. Similarly, TBA$^+$ intercalation expands the vdW gap, decoupling CrPS$_4$ layers and stabilising in-plane ferromagnetism with a T$_C$ above 100 K. Furthermore, it also modifies magnon propagation, leading to enhanced group velocities and a more isotropic magnon transport. This work highlights intercalation as a powerful and versatile approach for controlling magnetic behaviour and spin dynamics, paving the way for the design of tunable 2D layered magnetic materials for spintronic and magnonic applications.</description>

      <title>Quantum Spin Singlet and Classical N\'eel-Ordered Ground States in MoX3 (X = I, Br) Spin-3/2 Dimerized Antiferromagnetic Chain Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report that MoX3 (X = I, Br) are rare van der Waals materials that exhibit signatures of both quantum spin chains with a spin singlet ground state and classical Neel order. Bulk single crystals grown by chemical vapor transport exhibit classical antiferromagnetic ground states with a transition temperature of ~40 K as revealed by susceptibility and specific heat measurements. Above 40 K, the susceptibilities show the large, broad peaks associated with a quantum spin-singlet ground state and large singlet-triplet gaps of 21 meV and 25 meV. Monte Carlo simulations, density matrix renormalization-group calculations for finite spin-3/2 chains, and density functional theory reproduce the experimental behavior, confirming the interplay between strong one-dimensional intrachain and weak three-dimensional interchain couplings. MoX3 offers a unique platform for exploring quantum magnetism and magnetic excitations at the atomic chain limit, as these materials combine a 1D van der Waals motif, spin chain behavior, and classical interchain order.</description>

      <title>Two-Dimensional Altermagnetic Iron Oxyhalides: Real Chern topology and Valley-Spin-Lattice coupling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12748v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Altermagnets, a novel class of collinear magnetic materials, exhibit unique spin-split band structures, yet topological insulating states in intrinsic altermagnetic systems are rare. Here, we identify monolayer Fe$_2X_2$O ($X$ = Cl, Br, I) as a new family of 2D altermagnetic real Chern insulators. These materials display robust $d$-wave altermagnetic ordering, semiconducting band gaps, and nontrivial real Chern numbers per spin channel, yielding spin-polarized topological corner modes. They also feature spin-polarized valleys with strong altermagnetism-valley-spin-lattice coupling, enabling valley-selective excitation via linear dichroism and strain-induced valley polarization. In multiferroic Fe$_2$Cl$_2$O, magnetism coexists with ferroelasticity, and an applied strain can switche the N\'eel vector. These findings position 2D iron oxyhalides as a promising platform for exploring altermagnetism and magnetic topological states for spintronics and valleytronics.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium Relaxation and Odd-Even Effect in Finite-Temperature Electron Gases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03635v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pauli blocking in Fermi liquids imposes strong phase-space constraints on quasiparticle lifetimes, leading to a well-known quadratic-in-temperature decay rate of quasiparticle modes at low temperatures. In two-dimensional systems, however, even longer-lived modes are predicted (dubbed ``odd-parity'' modes) that involve a collective deformation of the Fermi distribution. Here, we present an efficient method to evaluate the full spectrum of relaxational eigenmodes of a Fermi liquid within kinetic theory. We employ this method to study the experimentally relevant case of a Fermi liquid with screened Coulomb interactions and map out the decay rates of quasiparticle modes beyond the asymptotic low-temperature limit up to the Fermi temperature, thus covering the entire temperature range of typical experiments. We confirm the existence of anomalously long-lived odd-parity modes and provide a comprehensive classification and detailed analysis of the relaxation spectrum. In particular, we find that (i) the odd-parity effect in the decay rates extends to temperatures as large as $T=0.15T_F$, (ii) there is only a small number of long-lived odd-parity modes, with an infinite number of remaining modes that show standard Fermi-liquid scaling, and (iii) the ratio between the odd- and even-parity lifetimes is tunable with the Coulomb interaction strength, in addition to temperature, which reflects a difference in the microscopic relaxation mechanism of the modes. Our findings provide a comprehensive description of the nonequilibrium relaxation behavior of two-dimensional electron gases and bridge a significant gap in our understanding of these systems.</description>

Abstract: Anderson localization is predicted to enhance the critical temperature of disordered superconductors. Despite a huge body of theoretical work based on non-linear sigma models, experiments are lacking to understand correlated electrons in disordered potentials. In this study, we investigate a tin monolayer on silicon, a material known for its likely antiferromagnetic Mott-correlated groundstate. We analyze the statistical properties of tunneling conductance maps of increasingly localized states as we approach the edge of the valence band. Using multifractal analysis, we show that the system follows an exact symmetry relation based on the algebraic structure of nonlinear sigma-models (NLsMs). We anticipate that this symmetry may be broken in specific - e.g. chiral electronic phases. Finally, we point out that multifractal analysis can equally be applied to universal conductance fluctuations in magneto-transport experiments, thus providing a powerful tool to probe the underlying symmetries of disordered electronic phases.</description>

Abstract: We study the effects of strain on exciton dynamics in transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) nanoribbons. Using the Bethe-Salpeter formalism, we derive the exciton dispersion relation in strained TMDs and demonstrate that strain-induced pseudo-gauge fields significantly influence exciton transport and interactions. Our results show that low-energy excitons occur at finite center-of-mass momentum, leading to modified diffusion properties. Furthermore, the exciton dipole moment depends on center-of-mass momentum, which enhances exciton-exciton interactions. These findings highlight the potential of strain engineering as a powerful tool for controlling exciton transport and interactions in nanoribbon-based TMD optoelectronic and quantum devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10449v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The topological properties of a material depend on its symmetries, parameters, and spatial dimension. Changes in these properties due to parameter and symmetry variations can be understood by computing the corresponding topological invariant. Since topological invariants are typically defined for a fixed spatial dimension, there is no existing framework to understand the effects of changing spatial dimensions via invariants. Here, we introduce a framework to study topological phase transitions as a system's dimensionality is altered using real-space topological markers. Specifically, we consider Shiba lattices, which are class D materials formed by magnetic atoms on the surface of a conventional superconductor, and characterize the evolution of their topology when an initial circular island is deformed into a chain. We also provide a measure of the corresponding protection against disorder. Our framework is generalizable to any symmetry class and spatial dimension, potentially guiding the design of materials by identifying, for example, the minimum thickness of a slab required to maintain three-dimensional topological properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum manipulation of molecular radical spins provides a crucial platform for exploring emergent phenomena in many-body systems. Here, we combine surface-confined synthesis with scanning tunneling microscopy(STM)tip-induced dehydrogenation to achieve atom-precise engineering of quasi-one-dimensional porphyrin-based Kondo chains (1-7 units) on Au(111). High-resolution STS measurements and low-energy effective modeling collectively demonstrate that {\pi}-radicals at each fused-porphyrin unit form Kondo singlets screened by conduction electrons. Adjacent singlets develop direct coherent coupling via quantum-state-overlap-enabled electron tunneling. Crucially, chiral symmetry in the effective model governs zero-mode distribution-present in odd-length chains yet absent in even-length chains-which dictates pronounced odd-even quantum effects in STS spectra of finite chains. Furthermore, the number of parallel porphyrin chains non-monotonically tunes the competition between the Kondo effect and spin exchange, showing opposing trends in strength and demonstrating that both wave-function overlap and the SOMO-LUMO gap collectively govern these interactions. This work simultaneously resolves the dimensional dependence of many-body correlations in confined quantum systems and pioneers approaches for quantum-critical manipulation in molecular spin architectures.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Novel Resonant Interband Contribution to Polarizability in three-dimensional systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05232v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polarizability plays an essential role in characterizing key phenomena, such as the screening effects, collective excitations, and dielectric functions present in the system. In three-dimensional materials, it typically comprises an intraband contribution, dependent on the chemical potential, and an interband contribution, largely independent of it. In this study, within the random phase approximation framework, we uncover a novel interband contribution that, unlike the conventional case, exhibits an explicit dependence on the chemical potential, which has no counterpart in two dimensions. In the long-wavelength limit, this term introduces a resonance feature with cubic wave-vector dependence when the chemical potential approaches the band edge, in contrast to the quadratic behavior characteristic of standard intraband and interband processes. Focusing on three-dimensional Dirac nodal line semimetals, we show that the polarizability is intraband-dominated at low frequencies, while interband processes prevail at intermediate and high frequencies, with the overall response being tunable via the chemical potential. Material-specific estimates for Ca$_3$P$_2$ and ZrSiS reveal a strong tunability of both contributions. These findings open new directions for probing frequency-dependent dielectric properties and hold promise for applications in tunable plasmonic and optoelectronic devices.</description>

Abstract: Seebeck coefficient, $S=L_{12}/(TL_{11})$, which is proportional to a ratio of the thermoelectric conductivity $L_{12}$ to the electric conductivity $L_{11}$ with $T$ being temperature is examined for two-dimensional Dirac electrons in a three-quarter filled organic conductor, $\alpha$-(BETS)$_2$I$_3$, [BETS = BEDT-TSeF = bis(ethylenedithio)tetraselenafulvalene] at ambient pressure.Using a tight-binding (TB) model obtained by first-principles relativistic density-functi onal theory method [Eur. Phys. J. B 94, 17 (2021)], we calculate $S$ in the presence of the impurity and electron--phonon (e--p) scatterings. It is shown that $S_x &lt; 0$ and $S_y &gt;0$ at high temperatures, where $S_x$ ($S_y$) denotes $S$ perpendicular (parallel) to the molecular stacking axis. There is a sign change of $S_y$ with increasing $T$. It is found that, at low temperatures the absolute value of $S$ is enhanced by the spin-orbit coupling. The Seebeck coefficient is examined by dividing into components of the conduction and valence bands to find that the electron and hole contributions compete each other. Such $T$ dependence of $S$ is clarified using the spectral conductivity, which determines $L_{12}$ and $L_{11}$.</description>

      <title>Braids and Beams: Exploring Fractional Statistics with Mesoscopic Anyon Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04319v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Anyon colliders -- quantum Hall devices where dilute quasiparticle beams collide at a quantum point contact -- provide an interferometer-free probe of anyonic exchange phases through current cross correlations. Within a non-equilibrium bosonization framework, the normalized cross-correlations take a universal form depending only on the exchange phase and the dynamical exponent, enabling experimental demonstration of anyonic statistics. This result can be interpreted as time-domain interference -- braiding in time rather than spatial exclusion or real-space interferometry. Extension to hierarchical states shows that the semiclassical step-function description of quasiparticles fails at large statistical angles. Introducing a finite soliton width resolves this issue and enables quantitative modeling of charge-$e/5$ quasiparticle collisions.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Limited Acoustoelectric Amplification in a Piezoelectric-2DEG Heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09248v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a quantum mechanical description of phonon amplification in a heterostructure consisting of a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) stacked on top of a piezoelectric material. An applied drift voltage effectively creates a population inversion in the momentum states of the 2DEG electrons, giving rise to spontaneous emission of phonons. Once an acoustic wave is launched, the pumped electrons release phonons via stimulated emission, returning to depleted ground states before being pumped back to the excited states. We show that whereas efficient amplification using a 1D electron gas requires the acoustic wavelength to roughly equal the average electron-electron spacing, a 2DEG enables efficient amplification for any wavelength greater than the average electron-electron spacing. We derive the imaginary and real parts of the 2DEG first-order acoustic susceptibility as functions of electronic drift velocity in specific limits and derive the gain per unit length for the signal and the quantum noise, with the gain matching the classical result in the short-electronic-lifetime (low-mobility) regime. Moreover, we analyze the gain clamping due to pump depletion and calculate the maximum achievable intensity. Our results provide a framework for designing novel acoustic devices including a quantum phononic laser and phase-insensitive quantum phononic amplifiers.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Charge Noise Sources in Quantum Dot Spin Qubits via Impedance Spectroscopy, DLTS, and C-V Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10861v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The coherence and fidelity of quantum dot (QD) spin qubits are fundamentally limited by charge noise arising from electrically active trap states at oxide interfaces, heterostructure boundaries, and within the bulk semiconductor. These traps introduce electrostatic fluctuations that couple to the qubit via spin-orbit interactions or charge-sensitive confinement potentials, leading to dephasing and gate errors. In this work, we present a general trap characterization framework for identifying and quantifying the spectral signatures of these trap states using AC impedance spectroscopy, deep-level transient spectroscopy (DLTS), and conventional capacitance-voltage (C-V) analysis. While our case study focuses on strained Ge/SiGe quantum well heterostructures, the approach is broadly applicable to other material systems and qubit types. We demonstrate that each class of traps (oxide interface, quantum well interface, and bulk) exhibits distinct fingerprints across frequency- and time-domain measurements. Oxide traps dominate the low-frequency conductance peaks and appear strongly in Nyquist and transient spectra. QW interface traps, despite being nearly invisible at low densities in conventional C-V and AC impedance analysis, are clearly resolved through multi-exponential decay signatures in time-domain response. Bulk traps contribute to high-frequency admittance and steady-state leakage currents. By correlating each trap type to its characteristic time constant, spatial location, and spectral impact, we provide a diagnostic toolset for disentangling noise sources that degrade qubit performance. This unified methodology bridges traditional defect metrology with emerging qubit noise analysis and enables material- and process-level strategies for coherence optimization in scalable quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic probe of ultrafast magnetization dynamics in the extreme ultraviolet spectral range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18312</link>

Abstract: The development of spectroscopic techniques in the extreme ultraviolet (XUV) spectral range has significantly advanced the understanding of ultrafast interactions in magnetic systems triggered by optical excitation. In this work, we introduce a previously missing geometry that facilitates the observation of the ultrafast magnetization dynamics of magnetic systems with an out-of-plane magnetization grown on XUV opaque substrates. This approach to probing ultrafast magnetization dynamics combines the magneto-optical Kerr effect with the strong dependence of a sample's reflectance near its Brewster angle. It therefore works with linearly polarized light and does not require any additional polarizing optics. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the technique by presenting both simulations and experimental data as a function of the energy and the polarization of the XUV probe radiation as well as of the delay time after optical excitation.</description>

      <title>Design and Dynamics of High-Fidelity Two-Qubit Gates with Electrons on Helium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13946v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Systems of individual electrons electrostatically trapped on condensed noble gas surfaces have recently attracted considerable interest as potential platforms for quantum computing. The electrons form the qubits of the system, and the purity of the noble gas surface protects the relevant quantum properties of each electron. Previous work has indicated that manipulation of a confining double-well potential for electrons on superfluid helium can generate entanglement suitable for two-qubit gate operations. In this work, we incorporate a time-dependent tuning of the potential shape to further explore operation of two-qubit gates with the superfluid helium system. Through numerical time evolution, we show that fast, high-fidelity two-qubit gates can be achieved. In particular, we simulate operation of the $\sqrt{i\mathrm{SWAP}}$ and CZ gates and obtain fidelities of 0.999 and 0.996 with execution times of 2.9 ns and 9.4 ns, respectively. Furthermore, we examine the stability of these gate fidelities under non-ideal execution conditions, which reveals new properties to consider in the device design. With the insights gained from this work, we believe that an experimental realization of two-qubit gates using electrons on helium is feasible.</description>
