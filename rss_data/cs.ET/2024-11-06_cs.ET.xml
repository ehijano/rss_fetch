      <title>Towards Intelligent Augmented Reality (iAR): A Taxonomy of Context, an Architecture for iAR, and an Empirical Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Augmented Reality (AR) research have highlighted the critical role of context awareness in enhancing interface effectiveness and user experience. This underscores the need for intelligent AR (iAR) interfaces that dynamically adapt across various contexts to provide optimal experiences. In this paper, we (a) propose a comprehensive framework for context-aware inference and adaptation in iAR, (b) introduce a taxonomy that describes context through quantifiable input data, and (c) present an architecture that outlines the implementation of our proposed framework and taxonomy within iAR. Additionally, we present an empirical AR experiment to observe user behavior and record user performance, context, and user-specified adaptations to the AR interfaces within a context-switching scenario. We (d) explore the nuanced relationships between context and user adaptations in this scenario and discuss the significance of our framework in identifying these patterns. This experiment emphasizes the significance of context-awareness in iAR and provides a preliminary training dataset for this specific Scenario.</description>

      <title>Instant Resonance: Dual Strategy Enhances the Data Consensus Success Rate of Blockchain Threshold Signature Oracles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid development of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and Real-World Assets (RWA), the importance of blockchain oracles in real-time data acquisition has become increasingly prominent. Using cryptographic techniques, threshold signature oracles can achieve consensus on data from multiple nodes and provide corresponding proofs to ensure the credibility and security of the information. However, in real-time data acquisition, threshold signature methods face challenges such as data inconsistency and low success rates in heterogeneous environments, which limit their practical application potential. To address these issues, this paper proposes an innovative dual-strategy approach to enhance the success rate of data consensus in blockchain threshold signature oracles. Firstly, we introduce a Representative Enhanced Aggregation Strategy (REP-AG) that improves the representativeness of data submitted by nodes, ensuring consistency with data from other nodes, and thereby enhancing the usability of threshold signatures. Additionally, we present a Timing Optimization Strategy (TIM-OPT) that dynamically adjusts the timing of nodes' access to data sources to maximize consensus success rates. Experimental results indicate that REP-AG improves the aggregation success rate by approximately 56.6\% compared to the optimal baseline, while the implementation of TIM-OPT leads to an average increase of approximately 32.9\% in consensus success rates across all scenarios.</description>

      <title>GIS Copilot: Towards an Autonomous GIS Agent for Spatial Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Generative AI offer promising capabilities for spatial analysis. Despite their potential, the integration of generative AI with established GIS platforms remains underexplored. In this study, we propose a framework for integrating LLMs directly into existing GIS platforms, using QGIS as an example. Our approach leverages the reasoning and programming capabilities of LLMs to autonomously generate spatial analysis workflows and code through an informed agent that has comprehensive documentation of key GIS tools and parameters. The implementation of this framework resulted in the development of a "GIS Copilot" that allows GIS users to interact with QGIS using natural language commands for spatial analysis. The GIS Copilot was evaluated based on three complexity levels: basic tasks that require one GIS tool and typically involve one data layer to perform simple operations; intermediate tasks involving multi-step processes with multiple tools, guided by user instructions; and advanced tasks which involve multi-step processes that require multiple tools but not guided by user instructions, necessitating the agent to independently decide on and executes the necessary steps. The evaluation reveals that the GIS Copilot demonstrates strong potential in automating foundational GIS operations, with a high success rate in tool selection and code generation for basic and intermediate tasks, while challenges remain in achieving full autonomy for more complex tasks. This study contributes to the emerging vision of Autonomous GIS, providing a pathway for non-experts to engage with geospatial analysis with minimal prior expertise. While full autonomy is yet to be achieved, the GIS Copilot demonstrates significant potential for simplifying GIS workflows and enhancing decision-making processes.</description>

      <title>The Future of Intelligent Healthcare: A Systematic Analysis and Discussion on the Integration and Impact of Robots Using Large Language Models for Healthcare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The potential use of large language models (LLMs) in healthcare robotics can help address the significant demand put on healthcare systems around the world with respect to an aging demographic and a shortage of healthcare professionals. Even though LLMs have already been integrated into medicine to assist both clinicians and patients, the integration of LLMs within healthcare robots has not yet been explored for clinical settings. In this perspective paper, we investigate the groundbreaking developments in robotics and LLMs to uniquely identify the needed system requirements for designing health specific LLM based robots in terms of multi modal communication through human robot interactions (HRIs), semantic reasoning, and task planning. Furthermore, we discuss the ethical issues, open challenges, and potential future research directions for this emerging innovative field.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Simulation Framework for CXL Disaggregated Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02282v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Compute eXpress Link (CXL) is a pivotal technology for memory disaggregation in future heterogeneous computing systems, enabling on-demand memory expansion and improved resource utilization. Despite its potential, CXL is in its early stages with limited market products, highlighting the need for a reliable system-level simulation tool. This paper introduces CXL-DMSim, an open-source, high-fidelity full-system simulator for CXL disaggregated memory systems, comparable in speed to gem5. CXL-DMSim includes a flexible CXL memory expander model, device driver, and support for CXL\.io and CXL\.mem protocols. It supports both app-managed and kernel-managed modes, with the latter featuring a NUMA-compatible mechanism. Rigorous verification against real hardware testbeds with FPGA-based and ASIC-based CXL memory prototypes confirms CXL-DMSim's accuracy, with an average simulation error of 4.1%. Benchmark results using LMbench and STREAM indicate that CXL-FPGA memory has approximately ~2.88x higher latency than local DDR, while CXL-ASIC latency is about ~2.18x. CXL-FPGA achieves 45-69% of local DDR's memory bandwidth, and CXL-ASIC reaches 82-83%. The performance of CXL memory is significantly more sensitive to Rd/Wr patterns than local DDR, with optimal bandwidth at a 74%:26% ratio rather than 50%:50% due to the current CXL+DDR controller design. The study also shows that CXL memory can markedly enhance the performance of memory-intensive applications, with the most improvement seen in Viper (~23x) and in bandwidth-sensitive scenarios like MERCI (16%). CXL-DMSim's observability and expandability are demonstrated through detailed case studies, showcasing its potential for research on future CXL-interconnected hybrid memory pools.</description>

      <title>Waveguide-multiplexed photonic matrix-vector multiplication processor using multiport photodetectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05956v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The slowing down of Moore's law has driven the development of application-specific processors for deep learning. Analog photonic processors offer a promising solution for accelerating matrix-vector multiplications (MVMs) in deep learning by leveraging parallel computations in the optical domain. Intensity-based photonic MVM processors, which do not utilize the phase information of light, are appealing due to their simplified operations. However, existing intensity-based schemes for such processors often employ wavelength multiplexing or mode multiplexing, both of which have limited scalability due to high insertion loss or wavelength crosstalk. In this work, we present a scalable intensity-based photonic MVM processor based on the concept of waveguide multiplexing. This scheme employs multiport photodetectors (PDs) to sum the intensities of multiple optical signals, eliminating the need for multiple wavelengths or modes. A 16-port Ge PD with a 3 dB bandwidth of 11.8 GHz at a bias voltage of -3 V is demonstrated, and it can be further scaled up to handle 250 ports while maintaining a 6.1 GHz operation bandwidth. A 4 $\times$ 4 circuit fabricated on a Si-on-insulator (SOI) platform is used to perform MVMs in a 3-layer neural network designed for classifying Iris flowers, achieving a classification accuracy of 93.3%. Furthermore, the performance of large-scale circuits in a convolutional neural network (CNN) for Fashion-MNIST is simulated, resulting in a classification accuracy of 90.53%. This work provides a simplified and scalable approach to photonic MVM, laying a foundation for large-scale and multi-dimensional photonic matrix-matrix multiplication in optical neural networks.</description>
