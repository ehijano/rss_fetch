      <title>Random Reed-Solomon Codes Achieve the Half-Singleton Bound for Insertions and Deletions over Linear-Sized Alphabets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that with high probability, random Reed-Solomon codes approach the half-Singleton bound - the optimal rate versus error tradeoff for linear insdel codes - with linear-sized alphabets. More precisely, we prove that, for any $\epsilon&gt;0$ and positive integers $n$ and $k$, with high probability, random Reed--Solomon codes of length $n$ and dimension $k$ can correct $(1-\varepsilon)n-2k+1$ adversarial insdel errors over alphabets of size $n+2^{\mathsf{poly}(1/\varepsilon)}k$. This significantly improves upon the alphabet size demonstrated in the work of Con, Shpilka, and Tamo (IEEE TIT, 2023), who showed the existence of Reed--Solomon codes with exponential alphabet size $\widetilde O\left(\binom{n}{2k-1}^2\right)$ precisely achieving the half-Singleton bound.
  Our methods are inspired by recent works on list-decoding Reed-Solomon codes. Brakensiek-Gopi-Makam (STOC 2023) showed that random Reed-Solomon codes are list-decodable up to capacity with exponential-sized alphabets, and Guo-Zhang (FOCS 2023) and Alrabiah-Guruswami-Li (STOC 2024) improved the alphabet-size to linear. We achieve a similar alphabet-size reduction by similarly establishing strong bounds on the probability that certain random rectangular matrices are full rank. To accomplish this in our insdel context, our proof combines the random matrix techniques from list-decoding with structural properties of Longest Common Subsequences.</description>

      <title>Proactive Eavesdropping in Relay Systems via Trajectory and Power Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wireless relays can effectively extend the transmission range of information. However, if relay technology is utilized unlawfully, it can amplify potential harm. Effectively surveilling illegitimate relay links poses a challenging problem. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can proactively surveil wireless relay systems due to their flexible mobility. This work focuses on maximizing the eavesdropping rate (ER) of UAVs by jointly optimizing the trajectory and jamming power. To address this challenge, we propose a new iterative algorithm based on block coordinate descent and successive convex approximation technologies. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly enhances the ER through trajectory and jamming power optimization.</description>

      <title>Several new classes of optimal ternary cyclic codes with two or three zeros</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cyclic codes are a subclass of linear codes and have wide applications in data storage systems, communication systems and consumer electronics due to their efficient encoding and decoding algorithms. Let $\alpha $ be a generator of $\mathbb{F}_{3^m}^*$, where $m$ is a positive integer. Denote by $\mathcal{C}_{(i_1,i_2,\cdots, i_t)}$ the cyclic code with generator polynomial $m_{\alpha^{i_1}}(x)m_{\alpha^{i_2}}(x)\cdots m_{\alpha^{i_t}}(x)$, where ${{m}_{\alpha^{i}}}(x)$ is the minimal polynomial of ${{\alpha }^{i}}$ over ${{\mathbb{F}}_{3}}$. In this paper, by analyzing the solutions of certain equations over finite fields, we present four classes of optimal ternary cyclic codes $\mathcal{C}_{(0,1,e)}$ and $\mathcal{C}_{(1,e,s)}$ with parameters $[3^m-1,3^m-\frac{3m}{2}-2,4]$, where $s=\frac{3^m-1}{2}$. In addition, by determining the solutions of certain equations and analyzing the irreducible factors of certain polynomials over $\mathbb{F}_{3^m}$, we present four classes of optimal ternary cyclic codes $\mathcal{C}_{(2,e)}$ and $\mathcal{C}_{(1,e)}$ with parameters $[3^m-1,3^m-2m-1,4]$. We show that our new optimal cyclic codes are inequivalent to the known ones.</description>

      <title>Aging-Resistant Wideband Precoding in 5G and Beyond Using 3D Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To meet the ever-increasing demand for higher data rates, 5G and 6G technologies are shifting transceivers to higher carrier frequencies, to support wider bandwidths and more antenna elements. Nevertheless, this solution poses several key challenges: i) increasing the carrier frequency and bandwidth leads to greater channel frequency selectivity in time and frequency domains, and ii) the greater the number of antennas the greater the the pilot overhead for channel estimation and the more prohibitively complex it becomes to determine the optimal precoding matrix. This paper presents two deep-learning frameworks to solve these issues. Firstly, we propose a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) that is based on image super-resolution and captures the correlations between the transmitting and receiving antennas and the frequency domains to combat frequency selectivity. Secondly, we devise a deep learning-based framework to combat the time selectivity of the channel that treats channel aging as a distortion that can be mitigated through deep learning-based image restoration techniques. Simulation results show that combining both frameworks leads to a significant improvement in performance compared to existing techniques with little increase in complexity.</description>

      <title>Alternating Subspace Approximate Message Passing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerous renowned algorithms for tackling the compressed sensing problem employ an alternating strategy, which typically involves data matching in one module and denoising in another. Based on an in-depth analysis of the connection between the message passing and operator splitting, we present a novel approach, the Alternating Subspace Method (ASM), which intuitively combines the principles of the greedy methods (e.g., the orthogonal matching pursuit type methods) and the splitting methods (e.g., the approximate message passing type methods). Essentially, ASM modifies the splitting method by achieving fidelity in a subspace-restricted fashion. We reveal that such confining strategy still yields a consistent fixed point iteration and establish its local geometric convergence on the lasso problem. Numerical experiments on both the lasso and channel estimation problems demonstrate its high convergence rate and its capacity to incorporate different prior distributions. Further theoretical analysis also demonstrates the advantage of the motivated message-passing splitting by incorporating quasi-variance degree of freedom even for the classical lasso optimization problem. Overall, the proposed method is promising in efficiency, accuracy and flexibility, which has the potential to be competitive in different sparse recovery applications.</description>

      <title>Transmission Design for XL-RIS-Aided Massive MIMO System with Visibility Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a two-timescale transmission scheme for extremely large-scale (XL)-reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS)-aided massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems considering visibility regions (VRs). The beamforming of base stations (BS) is designed based on rapidly changing instantaneous channel state information (CSI), while the phase shifts of RIS are configured based on slowly changing statistical CSI. Specifically, we first formulate a system model with spatially correlated Rician fading channels and introduce the concept of VRs. Then, we derive a closed-form approximate expression for the achievable rate applicable to any number of BS antennas and RIS elements, and analyze the impact of VRs on system performance and complexity. Next, we solve the problem of maximizing the minimum user rate by optimizing the phase shifts of RIS through an algorithm based on accelerated gradient ascent. Finally, we present numerical results to demonstrate the performance of the gradient algorithm from different aspects and reveal the low system complexity of deploying XL-RIS in massive MIMO systems with the help of VRs.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Self-Supervised Learning for MIMO-OFDM Channel Representation and Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In communications theory, the capacity of multiple input multiple output-orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) systems is fundamentally determined by wireless channels, which exhibit both diversity and correlation in spatial, frequency and temporal domains. It is further envisioned to exploit the inherent nature of channels, namely representation, to achieve geolocation-based MIMO transmission for 6G, exemplified by the fully-decoupled radio access network (FD-RAN). Accordingly, this paper first employs self-supervised learning to obtain channel representation from unlabeled channel, then proposes a channel generation assisted approach for determining MIMO precoding matrix solely based on geolocation. Specifically, we exploit the small-scale temporal domain variations of channels at a fixed geolocation, and design an ingenious pretext task tailored for contrastive learning. Then, a Transformer-based encoder is trained to output channel representations. We further develop a conditional diffusion generator to generate channel representations from geolocation. Finally, a Transformer-encoder-based decoder is utilized to reconstruct channels from generated representations, where the optimal channel is selected for calculating the precoding matrix for both single and dual BS transmission. We conduct experiments on a public ray-tracing channel dataset, and the extensive simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our channel representation method, and also showcase the performance improvement in geolocation-based MIMO transmission.</description>

      <title>Group Projected Subspace Pursuit for Block Sparse Signal Reconstruction: Convergence Analysis and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a convergence analysis of the Group Projected Subspace Pursuit (GPSP) algorithm proposed by He et al. [HKL+23] (Group Projected subspace pursuit for IDENTification of variable coefficient differential equations (GP-IDENT), Journal of Computational Physics, 494, 112526) and extend its application to general tasks of block sparse signal recovery. We prove that when the sampling matrix satisfies the Block Restricted Isometry Property (BRIP) with a sufficiently small Block Restricted Isometry Constant (BRIC), GPSP exactly recovers the true block sparse signals. When the observations are noisy, this convergence property of GPSP remains valid if the magnitude of true signal is sufficiently large. GPSP selects the features by subspace projection criterion (SPC) for candidate inclusion and response magnitude criterion (RMC) for candidate exclusion. We compare these criteria with counterparts of other state-of-the-art greedy algorithms. Our theoretical analysis and numerical ablation studies reveal that SPC is critical to the superior performances of GPSP, and that RMC can enhance the robustness of feature identification when observations contain noises. We test and compare GPSP with other methods in diverse settings, including heterogeneous random block matrices, inexact observations, face recognition, and PDE identification. We find that GPSP outperforms the other algorithms in most cases for various levels of block sparsity and block sizes, justifying its effectiveness for general applications.</description>

      <title>Joint Constellation Shaping Using Gradient Descent Approach for MU-MIMO Broadcast Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a learning-based approach to optimize a joint constellation for a multi-user MIMO broadcast channel ($T$ Tx antennas, $K$ users, each with $R$ Rx antennas), with perfect channel knowledge. The aim of the optimizer (MAX-MIN) is to maximize the minimum mutual information between the  transmitter and each receiver, under a sum-power constraint. The proposed optimization method do neither impose the transmitter to use superposition coding (SC) or any other linear precoding, nor to use successive interference cancellation (SIC) at the receiver. Instead, the approach designs a joint constellation, optimized such that its projection into the subspace of each receiver $k$, maximizes the minimum mutual information $I(W_k;Y_k)$ between each transmitted binary input $W_k$ and the output signal at the intended receiver $Y_k$. The rates obtained by our method are compared to those achieved with linear precoders.</description>

      <title>Multi-User Localization and Tracking with Spatiotemporal Correlation in Multi-RIS-Assisted Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a promising technique, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) exhibit its tremendous potential for high accuracy positioning. In this paper, we investigates multi-user localization and tracking problem in multi-RISs-assisted system. In particular, we incorporate statistical spatiotemporal correlation of multi-user locations and develop a general spatiotemporal Markov random field model (ST-+MRF) to capture multi-user dynamic motion states. To achieve superior performance, a novel multi-user tracking algorithm is proposed based on Bayesian inference to effectively utilize the correlation among users. Besides that, considering the necessity of RISs configuration for tracking performance, we further propose a predictive RISs beamforming optimization scheme via semidefinite relaxation (SDR). Compared to other pioneering work, finally, we confirm that the proposed strategy by alternating tracking algorithm and RISs optimization, can achieve significant performance gains over benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>Model-based learning for multi-antenna multi-frequency location-to-channel mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Years of study of the propagation channel showed a close relation between a location and the associated communication channel response. The use of a neural network to learn the location-to-channel mapping can therefore be envisioned. The Implicit Neural Representation (INR) literature showed that classical neural architecture are biased towards learning low-frequency content, making the location-to-channel mapping learning a non-trivial problem. Indeed, it is well known that this mapping is a function rapidly varying with the location, on the order of the wavelength. This paper leverages the model-based machine learning paradigm to derive a problem-specific neural architecture from a propagation channel model. The resulting architecture efficiently overcomes the spectral-bias issue. It only learns low-frequency sparse correction terms activating a dictionary of high-frequency components. The proposed architecture is evaluated against classical INR architectures on realistic synthetic data, showing much better accuracy. Its mapping learning performance is explained based on the approximated channel model, highlighting the explainability of the model-based machine learning paradigm.</description>

      <title>An hybrid framework OTFS OFDM based on mobile speed estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Future wireless communication systems face the challenging task of simultaneously providing high quality of service (QoS) and broadband data transmission, while also minimizing power consumption, latency, and system complexity. Although Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing OFDM has been widely adopted in 4G and 5G systems, it struggles to cope with the significant delay and Doppler spread in high mobility scenarios. To address these challenges, a novel waveform called Orthogonal Time Frequency Space OTFS has emerged, aiming to outperform OFDM by closely aligning signals with the channel behaviour. In this paper, we propose a switching strategy that empowers operators to select the most appropriate waveform based on the estimated speed of the mobile user. This strategy enables the base station to dynamically choose the waveform that best suits the mobile users speed. Additionally, we suggest integrating an Integrated Sensing and Communication radar for accurate Doppler estimation, providing precise information to aid in waveform selection. By leveraging the switching strategy and harnessing the Doppler estimation capabilities of an ISAC radar, our proposed approach aims to enhance the performance of wireless communication systems in scenarios of high mobility. Considering the complexity of waveform processing, we introduce an optimized hybrid system that combines OTFS and OFDM, resulting in reduced complexity while still retaining performance benefits. This hybrid system presents a promising solution for improving the performance of wireless communication systems in scenarios with a high mobility. The simulation results validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating its potential advantages for future wireless communication systems. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated by simulation results as it will be shown.</description>

      <title>Understanding is Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have previously shown all understanding or learning are compression, under reasonable assumptions. In principle, better understanding of data should improve data compression. Traditional compression methodologies focus on encoding frequencies or some other computable properties of data. Large language models approximate the uncomputable Solomonoff distribution, opening up a whole new avenue to justify our theory.
  Under the new uncomputable paradigm, we present LMCompress based on the understanding of data using large models. LMCompress has significantly better lossless compression ratios than all other lossless data compression methods, doubling the compression ratios of JPEG-XL for images, FLAC for audios and H264 for videos, and tripling or quadrupling the compression ratio of bz2 for texts. The better a large model understands the data, the better LMCompress compresses.</description>

      <title>UAV-assisted Unbiased Hierarchical Federated Learning: Performance and Convergence Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of the sixth generation (6G) of wireless networks is bound to streamline the transition of computation and learning towards the edge of the network. Hierarchical federated learning (HFL) becomes, therefore, a key paradigm to distribute learning across edge devices to reach global intelligence. In HFL, each edge device trains a local model using its respective data and transmits the updated model parameters to an edge server for local aggregation. The edge server, then, transmits the locally aggregated parameters to a central server for global model aggregation. The unreliability of communication channels at the edge and backhaul links, however, remains a bottleneck in assessing the true benefit of HFL-empowered systems. To this end, this paper proposes an unbiased HFL algorithm for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted wireless networks that counteracts the impact of unreliable channels by adjusting the update weights during local and global aggregations at UAVs and terrestrial base stations (BS), respectively. To best characterize the unreliability of the channels involved in HFL, we adopt tools from stochastic geometry to determine the success probabilities of the local and global model parameter transmissions. Accounting for such metrics in the proposed HFL algorithm aims at removing the bias towards devices with better channel conditions in the context of the considered UAV-assisted network.. The paper further examines the theoretical convergence guarantee of the proposed unbiased UAV-assisted HFL algorithm under adverse channel conditions. One of the developed approach's additional benefits is that it allows for optimizing and designing the system parameters, e.g., the number of UAVs and their corresponding heights. The paper results particularly highlight the effectiveness of the proposed unbiased HFL scheme as compared to conventional FL and HFL algorithms.</description>

      <title>Science-Informed Deep Learning (ScIDL) With Applications to Wireless Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given the extensive and growing capabilities offered by deep learning (DL), more researchers are turning to DL to address complex challenges in next-generation (xG) communications. However, despite its progress, DL also reveals several limitations that are becoming increasingly evident. One significant issue is its lack of interpretability, which is especially critical for safety-sensitive applications. Another significant consideration is that DL may not comply with the constraints set by physics laws or given security standards, which are essential for reliable DL. Additionally, DL models often struggle outside their training data distributions, which is known as poor generalization. Moreover, there is a scarcity of theoretical guidance on designing DL algorithms. These challenges have prompted the emergence of a burgeoning field known as science-informed DL (ScIDL). ScIDL aims to integrate existing scientific knowledge with DL techniques to develop more powerful algorithms. The core objective of this article is to provide a brief tutorial on ScIDL that illustrates its building blocks and distinguishes it from conventional DL. Furthermore, we discuss both recent applications of ScIDL and potential future research directions in the field of wireless communications.</description>

      <title>Belief Information based Deep Channel Estimation for Massive MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the next generation wireless communication system, transmission rates should continue to rise to support emerging scenarios, e.g., the immersive communications. From the perspective of communication system evolution, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology remains pivotal for enhancing transmission rates. However, current MIMO systems rely on inserting pilot signals to achieve accurate channel estimation. As the increase of transmit stream, the pilots consume a significant portion of transmission resources, severely reducing the spectral efficiency. In this correspondence, we propose a belief information based mechanism. By introducing a plug-and-play belief information module, existing single-antenna channel estimation networks could be seamlessly adapted to multi-antenna channel estimation and fully exploit the spatial correlation among multiple antennas. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can either improve 1 ~ 2 dB channel estimation performance or reduce 1/3 ~ 1/2 pilot overhead, particularly in bad channel conditions.</description>

      <title>Quantization of KLT Matrices via GMRF Modeling of Image Blocks for Adaptive Transform Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Forward adaptive transform coding of images requires a codebook of transform matrices from which the best transform can be chosen for each macroblock. Codebook construction is a problem of designing a quantizer for Karhunen-L\'{o}eve transform (KLT) matrices estimated from sample image blocks. We present a novel method for KLT matrix quantization based on a finite-lattice non-causal homogeneous Gauss-Markov random field (GMRF) model with asymmetric Neumann boundary conditions for blocks in natural images. The matrix quantization problem is solved in the GMRF parameter space, simplifying the harder problem of quantizing a large matrix subject to an orthonormality constraint to a low-dimensional vector quantization problem. Typically used GMRF parameter estimation methods such as maximum-likelihood (ML) do not necessarily maximize the coding performance of the resulting transform matrices. To this end we propose a method for GMRF parameter estimation from sample image data, which maximizes the high-rate transform coding gain. We also investigate the application of GMRF-based transforms to variable block-size adaptive transform coding.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we investigate the construction of quantum CSS duadic codes with dimensions greater than one. We introduce a method for extending smaller splittings of quantum duadic codes to create larger, potentially degenerate quantum duadic codes. Furthermore, we present a technique for computing or bounding the minimum distances of quantum codes constructed through this approach. Additionally, we introduce quantum CSS triadic codes, a family of quantum codes with a rate of at least $\frac{1}{3}$.</description>

      <title>Finite Blocklength Performance of Capacity-achieving Codes in the Light of Complexity Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the work of Polyanskiy, Poor and Verd\'u on the finite blocklength performance of capacity-achieving codes for discrete memoryless channels, many papers have attempted to find further results for more practically relevant channels. However, it seems that the complexity of computing capacity-achieving codes has not been investigated until now. We study this question for the simplest non-trivial Gaussian channels, i.e., the additive colored Gaussian noise channel. To assess the computational complexity, we consider the classes $\mathrm{FP}_1$ and $\#\mathrm{P}_1$. $\mathrm{FP}_1$ includes functions computable by a deterministic Turing machine in polynomial time, whereas $\#\mathrm{P}_1$ encompasses functions that count the number of solutions verifiable in polynomial time. It is widely assumed that $\mathrm{FP}_1\neq\#\mathrm{P}_1$. It is of interest to determine the conditions under which, for a given $M \in \mathbb{N}$, where $M$ describes the precision of the deviation of $C(P,N)$, for a certain blocklength $n_M$ and a decoding error $\epsilon &gt; 0$ with $\epsilon\in\mathbb{Q}$, the following holds: $R_{n_M}(\epsilon)&gt;C(P,N)-\frac{1}{2^M}$. It is shown that there is a polynomial-time computable $N_*$ such that for sufficiently large $P_*\in\mathbb{Q}$, the sequences $\{R_{n_M}(\epsilon)\}_{{n_M}\in\mathbb{N}}$, where each $R_{n_M}(\epsilon)$ satisfies the previous condition, cannot be computed in polynomial time if $\mathrm{FP}_1\neq\#\mathrm{P}_1$. Hence, the complexity of computing the sequence $\{R_{n_M}(\epsilon)\}_{n_M\in\mathbb{N}}$ grows faster than any polynomial as $M$ increases. Consequently, it is shown that either the sequence of achievable rates $\{R_{n_M}(\epsilon)\}_{n_M\in\mathbb{N}}$ as a function of the blocklength, or the sequence of blocklengths $\{n_M\}_{M\in\mathbb{N}}$ corresponding to the achievable rates, is not a polynomial-time computable sequence.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Assisted Design of mmWave Wireless Transceiver Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As fifth-generation (5G) and upcoming sixth-generation (6G) communications exhibit tremendous demands in providing high data throughput with a relatively low latency, millimeter-wave (mmWave) technologies manifest themselves as the key enabling components to achieve the envisioned performance and tasks. In this context, mmWave integrated circuits (IC) have attracted significant research interests over the past few decades, ranging from individual block design to complex system design. However, the highly nonlinear properties and intricate trade-offs involved render the design of analog or RF circuits a complicated process. The rapid evolution of fabrication technology also results in an increasingly long time allocated in the design process due to more stringent requirements. In this thesis, 28-GHz transceiver circuits are first investigated with detailed schematics and associated performance metrics. In this case, two target systems comprising heterogeneous individual blocks are selected and demonstrated on both the transmitter and receiver sides. Subsequently, some conventional and large-scale machine learning (ML) approaches are integrated into the design pipeline of the chosen systems to predict circuit parameters based on desired specifications, thereby circumventing the typical time-consuming iterations found in traditional methods. Finally, some potential research directions are discussed from the perspectives of circuit design and ML algorithms.</description>

Abstract: Let $q$ be an odd prime power and let $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$ be the finite field with $q^2$ elements. In this paper, we determine the differential spectrum of the power function $F(x)=x^{2q+1}$ over $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$. When the characteristic of $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$ is $3$, we also determine the value distribution of the Walsh spectrum of $F$, showing that it is $4$-valued, and use the obtained result to determine the weight distribution of a $4$-weight cyclic code.</description>

      <title>Random unitaries in extremely low depth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that random quantum circuits on any geometry, including a 1D line, can form approximate unitary designs over $n$ qubits in $\log n$ depth. In a similar manner, we construct pseudorandom unitaries (PRUs) in 1D circuits in $\text{poly} \log n $ depth, and in all-to-all-connected circuits in $\text{poly} \log \log n $ depth. In all three cases, the $n$ dependence is optimal and improves exponentially over known results. These shallow quantum circuits have low complexity and create only short-range entanglement, yet are indistinguishable from unitaries with exponential complexity. Our construction glues local random unitaries on $\log n$-sized or $\text{poly} \log n$-sized patches of qubits to form a global random unitary on all $n$ qubits. In the case of designs, the local unitaries are drawn from existing constructions of approximate unitary $k$-designs, and hence also inherit an optimal scaling in $k$. In the case of PRUs, the local unitaries are drawn from existing unitary ensembles conjectured to form PRUs. Applications of our results include proving that classical shadows with 1D log-depth Clifford circuits are as powerful as those with deep circuits, demonstrating superpolynomial quantum advantage in learning low-complexity physical systems, and establishing quantum hardness for recognizing phases of matter with topological order.</description>

      <title>Hashing Beam Training for Integrated Ground-Air-Space Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04913v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In integrated ground-air-space (IGAS) wireless networks, numerous services require sensing knowledge including location, angle, distance information, etc., which usually can be acquired during the beam training stage. On the other hand, IGAS networks employ large-scale antenna arrays to mitigate obstacle occlusion and path loss. However, large-scale arrays generate pencil-shaped beams, which necessitate a higher number of training beams to cover the desired space. These factors motivate our investigation into the IGAS beam training problem to achieve effective sensing services. To address the high complexity and low identification accuracy of existing beam training techniques, we propose an efficient hashing multi-arm beam (HMB) training scheme. Specifically, we first construct an IGAS single-beam training codebook for the uniform planar arrays. Then, the hash functions are chosen independently to construct the multi-arm beam training codebooks for each AP. All APs traverse the predefined multi-arm beam training codeword simultaneously and the multi-AP superimposed signals at the user are recorded. Finally, the soft decision and voting methods are applied to obtain the correctly aligned beams only based on the signal powers. In addition, we logically prove that the traversal complexity is at the logarithmic level. Simulation results show that our proposed IGAS HMB training method can achieve 96.4% identification accuracy of the exhaustive beam training method and greatly reduce the training overhead.</description>

Abstract: We study the connection between mixing properties for bipartite graphs and materialization of the mutual information in one-shot settings. We show that mixing properties of a graph imply impossibility to extract the mutual information shared by the ends of an edge randomly sampled in the graph. We apply these impossibility results to some questions motivated by information-theoretic cryptography. In particular, we show that communication complexity of a secret key agreement in one-shot setting is inherently uneven: for some inputs, almost all communication complexity inevitably falls on only one party.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07275v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Distribution-preserving integrated sensing and communication with secure reconstruction is investigated in this paper. In addition to the distortion constraint, we impose another constraint on the distance between the reconstructed sequence distribution and the original state distribution to force the system to preserve the statistical property of the channel states. An inner bound of the distribution-preserving capacity-distortion region is provided with some capacity region results under special cases. A numerical example demonstrates the tradeoff between the communication rate, reconstruction distortion and distribution preservation. Furthermore, we consider the case that the reconstructed sequence should be kept secret from an eavesdropper who also observes the channel output. An inner bound of the tradeoff region and a capacity-achieving special case are presented.</description>

      <title>When Do Low-Rate Concatenated Codes Approach The Gilbert-Varshamov Bound?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08584v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Gilbert--Varshamov (GV) bound is a classical existential result in coding theory. It implies that a random linear binary code of rate $\epsilon^2$ has relative distance at least $\frac{1}{2} - O(\epsilon)$ with high probability. However, it is a major challenge to construct explicit codes with similar parameters.
  One hope to derandomize the Gilbert--Varshamov construction is with code concatenation: We begin with a (hopefully explicit) outer code ${C}_\mathrm{out}$ over a large alphabet, and concatenate that with a small binary random linear code ${C}_\mathrm{in}$. It is known that when we use independent small codes for each coordinate, then the result lies on the GV bound with high probability, but this still uses a lot of randomness. In this paper, we consider the question of whether code concatenation with a single random linear inner code ${C}_\mathrm{in}$ can lie on the GV bound; and if so what conditions on ${C}_\mathrm{out}$ are sufficient for this.
  We show that first, there do exist linear outer codes ${C}_\mathrm{out}$ that are "good" for concatenation in this sense (in fact, most linear codes codes are good). We also provide two sufficient conditions for ${C}_\mathrm{out}$, so that if ${C}_\mathrm{out}$ satisfies these, ${C}_\mathrm{out}\circ {C}_\mathrm{in}$ will likely lie on the GV bound. We hope that these conditions may inspire future work towards constructing explicit codes ${C}_\mathrm{out}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03606v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose efficient minimum-distance decoding and list-decoding algorithms for a certain class of analog subspace codes, referred to as character-polynomial (CP) codes, recently introduced by Soleymani and the second author. In particular, a CP code without its character can be viewed as a subcode of a Reed-Solomon (RS) code, where a certain subset of the coefficients of the message polynomial is set to zeros. We then demonstrate how classical decoding methods, including list decoders, for RS codes can be leveraged for decoding CP codes. For instance, it is shown that, in almost all cases, the list decoder behaves as a unique decoder. We also present a probabilistic analysis of the improvements in list decoding of CP codes when leveraging their certain structure as subcodes of RS codes.</description>

      <title>Non-Coherent Over-the-Air Decentralized Gradient Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.10777v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Implementing Decentralized Gradient Descent (DGD) in wireless systems is challenging due to noise, fading, and limited bandwidth, necessitating topology awareness, transmission scheduling, and the acquisition of channel state information (CSI) to mitigate interference and maintain reliable communications. These operations may result in substantial signaling overhead and scalability challenges in large networks lacking central coordination. This paper introduces a scalable DGD algorithm that eliminates the need for scheduling, topology information, or CSI (both average and instantaneous). At its core is a Non-Coherent Over-The-Air (NCOTA) consensus scheme that exploits a noisy energy superposition property of wireless channels. Nodes encode their local optimization signals into energy levels within an OFDM frame and transmit simultaneously, without coordination. The key insight is that the received energy equals, on average, the sum of the energies of the transmitted signals, scaled by their respective average channel gains, akin to a consensus step. This property enables unbiased consensus estimation, utilizing average channel gains as mixing weights, thereby removing the need for their explicit design or for CSI. Introducing a consensus stepsize mitigates consensus estimation errors due to energy fluctuations around their expected values. For strongly-convex problems, it is shown that the expected squared distance between the local and globally optimum models vanishes at a rate of $\mathcal O(1/\sqrt{k})$ after $k$ iterations, with suitable decreasing learning and consensus stepsizes. Extensions accommodate a broad class of fading models and frequency-selective channels. Numerical experiments on image classification demonstrate faster convergence in terms of running time compared to state-of-the-art schemes, especially in dense network scenarios.</description>

      <title>FedGT: Identification of Malicious Clients in Federated Learning with Secure Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.05506v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose FedGT, a novel framework for identifying malicious clients in federated learning with secure aggregation. Inspired by group testing, the framework leverages overlapping groups of clients to identify the presence of malicious clients in the groups via a decoding operation. The clients identified as malicious are then removed from the model training, which is performed over the remaining clients. By choosing the size, number, and overlap between groups, FedGT strikes a balance between privacy and security. Specifically, the server learns the aggregated model of the clients in each group - vanilla federated learning and secure aggregation correspond to the extreme cases of FedGT with group size equal to one and the total number of clients, respectively. The effectiveness of FedGT is demonstrated through extensive experiments on the MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ISIC2019 datasets in a cross-silo setting under different data-poisoning attacks. These experiments showcase FedGT's ability to identify malicious clients, resulting in high model utility. We further show that FedGT significantly outperforms the private robust aggregation approach based on the geometric median recently proposed by Pillutla et al. in multiple settings.</description>

      <title>Blackwell-Monotone Information Costs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15158v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Blackwell-monotone information cost function assigns higher costs to Blackwell more informative experiments. This paper provides simple necessary and sufficient conditions for a cost function to be Blackwell monotone over finite experiments. The key condition involves a system of linear differential inequalities. By using this characterization, we show that when a cost function is additively separable, it is Blackwell monotone if and only if it is the sum of sublinear functions. This identifies a wide range of practical information cost functions. Finally, we apply our results to bargaining and persuasion problems with costly information, broadening and strengthening earlier findings.</description>
