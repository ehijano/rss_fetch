      <title>Three-dimensional Interaction between a Planet and an Isothermal Gaseous Disk. III. Locally Isothermal Cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We performed linear calculations to determine the Type I planetary migration rate for three-dimensional locally isothermal disks with radial temperature gradients. For 3D disks with radial temperature gradients, the linear wave equation has a divergent term of the third pole, which makes corotation a non-removal singularity. We suppressed the divergence with the Landau prescription to obtain the wave solutions. Despite the singularity at corotation, we derived a definite torque on the planet because the divergent term amplifies the waves only in the neighborhood of corotation and has little effect on the planetary torque. Consequently, we derived the formulas for the total, Lindblad, and corotation torques for locally isothermal disks. The resulting torque term due to the disk temperature gradient agrees well with the results of previous 3D hydrodynamical simulations for locally isothermal disks. Our linear calculation also provides the 3D horseshoe torque, which is close to the results of previous 3D hydrodynamical simulations.</description>

      <title>Asteroid (101955) Bennu in the Laboratory: Properties of the Sample Collected by OSIRIS-REx</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On 24 September 2023, the NASA OSIRIS-REx mission dropped a capsule to Earth containing approximately 120 g of pristine carbonaceous regolith from Bennu. We describe the delivery and initial allocation of this asteroid sample and introduce its bulk physical, chemical, and mineralogical properties from early analyses. The regolith is very dark overall, with higher-reflectance inclusions and particles interspersed. Particle sizes range from sub-micron dust to a stone about 3.5 cm long. Millimeter-scale and larger stones typically have hummocky or angular morphologies. A subset of the stones appears mottled by brighter material that occurs as veins and crusts. Hummocky stones have the lowest densities and mottled stones have the highest. Remote sensing of the surface of Bennu detected hydrated phyllosilicates, magnetite, organic compounds, carbonates, and scarce anhydrous silicates, all of which the sample confirms. We also find sulfides, presolar grains, and, less expectedly, Na-rich phosphates, as well as other trace phases. The sample composition and mineralogy indicate substantial aqueous alteration and resemble those of Ryugu and the most chemically primitive, low-petrologic-type carbonaceous chondrites. Nevertheless, we find distinct hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen isotopic compositions, and some of the material we analyzed is enriched in fluid-mobile elements. Our findings underscore the value of sample return, especially for low-density material that may not readily survive atmospheric entry, and lay the groundwork for more comprehensive analyses.</description>

      <title>TOI-4336 A b: A temperate sub-Neptune ripe for atmospheric characterization in a nearby triple M-dwarf system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Small planets transiting bright nearby stars are essential to our understanding of the formation and evolution of exoplanetary systems. However, few constitute prime targets for atmospheric characterization, and even fewer are part of multiple star systems. This work aims to validate TOI-4336 A b, a sub-Neptune-sized exoplanet candidate identified by the TESS space-based transit survey around a nearby M-dwarf. We validate the planetary nature of TOI-4336 A b through the global analysis of TESS and follow-up multi-band high-precision photometric data from ground-based telescopes, medium- and high-resolution spectroscopy of the host star, high-resolution speckle imaging, and archival images. The newly discovered exoplanet TOI-4336 A b has a radius of 2.1$\pm$0.1R$_{\oplus}$. Its host star is an M3.5-dwarf star of mass 0.33$\pm$0.01M$_{\odot}$ and radius 0.33$\pm$0.02R$_{\odot}$ member of a hierarchical triple M-dwarf system 22 pc away from the Sun. The planet's orbital period of 16.3 days places it at the inner edge of the Habitable Zone of its host star, the brightest of the inner binary pair. The parameters of the system make TOI-4336 A b an extremely promising target for the detailed atmospheric characterization of a temperate sub-Neptune by transit transmission spectroscopy with JWST.</description>

      <title>The open-source sunbather code: modeling escaping planetary atmospheres and their transit spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atmospheric escape is thought to significantly influence the evolution of exoplanets, especially for sub-Jupiter planets on short orbital periods. Theoretical models predict that hydrodynamic escape could erode the atmospheres of such gaseous planets, leaving only a rocky core. Deriving atmospheric mass-loss rates from observations is necessary to check these predictions. One of the ways to obtain mass-loss rate estimates is to fit transit spectra of the 10830 {\AA} helium or UV metal lines with Parker wind models. We aim to provide the community with a tool that enables performing this type of analysis, and present sunbather, an open-source Python code to model escaping exoplanet atmospheres and their transit spectra. sunbather incorporates the Parker wind code p-winds and the photoionization code Cloudy, with the ability to calculate any currently known spectral tracer at an arbitrary atmospheric composition. With sunbather, we investigate how the atmospheric structure of a generic hot Neptune planet depends on the metallicity. We find that the mass-loss rate drops by roughly one order of magnitude as we increase the metallicity from solar to 50 times solar. Line cooling by metal species is important already for a solar composition, and more so at higher metallicity. We then demonstrate how sunbather can be used to interpret observations of spectral lines that form in the upper atmosphere. We fit the observed helium spectrum of the mini-Neptune TOI-2134 b and show how even for helium data, the inferred mass-loss rate depends on the metallicity by up to a factor of three.</description>

      <title>Cliff collapse on Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko -- II. Imhotep and Hathor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cliff collapses on Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko expose relatively pristine nucleus matter and offer rare opportunities to characterise ice-rich comet material. Here, Microwave Instrument for \emph{Rosetta} Orbiter (MIRO) observations of two collapsed or crumbling cliffs in the Imhotep and Hathor regions have been assembled. The empirical diurnal antenna temperature curves are analysed with thermophysical and radiative transfer models in order to place constraints on the physical properties and degrees of stratification in the near-surface material. The Imhotep site consists of an exposed dust/water-ice mixture with thermal inertia 100-$160\,\mathrm{J\,m^{-2}\,K^{-1}\,s^{-1/2}}$, having sublimating $\mathrm{CO_2}$ ice located $11\pm 4\,\mathrm{cm}$ below the surface. Its estimated age is consistent with an outburst observed on 2014 April 27-30. The Hathor site has a $0.8\pm 0.2\,\mathrm{cm}$ dust mantle, a thermal inertia of $40\pm 20\,\mathrm{J\,m^{-2}\,K^{-1}\,s^{-1/2}}$, no $\mathrm{CO_2}$ ice to within $1.0\,\mathrm{m}$ depth, and a mantle bulk density of $340\pm 80\,\mathrm{kg\,m^{-3}}$ that is higher than the theoretically expected $180\pm 10\,\mathrm{kg\,m^{-3}}$, suggesting that compression has taken place.</description>

      <title>The James Webb Interferometer: Space-based interferometric detections of PDS 70 b and c at 4.8 $\mu$m</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We observed the planet-hosting system PDS 70 with the James Webb Interferometer, JWST's Aperture Masking Interferometric (AMI) mode within NIRISS. Observing with the F480M filter centered at 4.8 $\mu$m, we simultaneously fit a geometric model to the outer disk and the two known planetary companions. We re-detect the protoplanets PDS 70 b and c at an SNR of 21 and 11, respectively. Our photometry of both PDS 70 b and c provide evidence for circumplanetary disk emission through fitting SED models to these new measurements and those found in the literature. We also newly detect emission within the disk gap at an SNR of $\sim$4, at a position angle of $207^{+11}_{-10}$ degrees, and an unconstrained separation within $\sim$200 mas. Follow-up observations will be needed to determine the nature of this emission. We place a 5$\sigma$ upper limit of $\Delta$mag = 7.56 on the contrast of the candidate PDS 70 d at 4.8 $\mu$m, which indicates that if the previously observed emission at shorter wavelengths is due to a planet, this putative planet has a different atmospheric composition than PDS 70 b or c. Finally, we place upper limits on emission from any additional planets in the disk gap. We find an azimuthally averaged 5$\sigma$ upper limit of $\Delta$mag $\approx$ 7.5 at separations greater than 125 mas. These are the deepest limits to date within $\sim$250 mas at 4.8 $\mu$m and the first space-based interferometric observations of this system.</description>

      <title>OGLE-2015-BLG-0845L: A low-mass M dwarf from the microlensing parallax and xallarap effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the analysis of the microlensing event OGLE-2015-BLG-0845, which was affected by both the microlensing parallax and xallarap effects. The former was detected via the simultaneous observations from the ground and Spitzer, and the latter was caused by the orbital motion of the source star in a relatively close binary. The combination of these two effects led to a direct mass measurement of the lens object, revealing a low-mass ($0.14 \pm 0.05 M_{\odot}$) M-dwarf at the bulge distance ($7.6 \pm 1.0$ kpc). The source binary consists of a late F-type subgiant and a K-type dwarf of $\sim1.2 M_{\odot}$ and $\sim 0.9 M_{\odot}$, respectively, and the orbital period is $70 \pm 10$ days. OGLE-2015-BLG-0845 is the first single-lens event in which the lens mass is measured via the binarity of the source. Given the abundance of binary systems as potential microlensing sources, the xallarap effect may not be a rare phenomenon. Our work thus highlights the application of the xallarap effect in the mass determination of microlenses, and the same method can be used to identify isolated dark lenses.</description>

      <title>Direct imaging of exoplanets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05797v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the past 4 decades, the exploration of planets beyond our solar system has yielded the discovery of over 5600 exoplanets orbiting different stars. Continuous advancements in instrumentation and cutting-edge techniques empower astronomers to unveil and characterize new exoworlds with increasing frequency. Notably, direct imaging, also called high-contrast imaging (HCI), stands out as the only method capable of capturing photons emitted directly from the planetary bodies. This innovative technique proves particularly advantageous for scrutinizing nascent planetary systems, where planets shine brilliantly and emit significant heat during their initial developmental phases. HCI provides comprehensive visuals of the entire system, encompassing the central star, potential circumstellar disks, and any additional companions. However, the complexity of imaging an object 10^6 fainter than its parent star necessitates state-of-the-art instrumentation. HCI demands cutting-edge tools such as exAO systems, telescopes exceeding 8 meters in diameter, coronagraphs, and modern imagers. The pivotal role of post-processing cannot be overstated in the quest for detecting and characterizing planets through HCI. This method has not only facilitated the discovery of numerous planets but has also presented invaluable opportunities to explore the properties of young substellar companions, both planets and brown dwarfs. Insights into their interactions with parent disks or other companions within the system, the composition of their atmospheres, and the identification of still accreting planets, also known as "protoplanets," contribute significantly to our understanding of planet formation scenarios. The continued refinement of HCI promises to unveil further revelations in the captivating field of exoplanetary exploration.</description>
