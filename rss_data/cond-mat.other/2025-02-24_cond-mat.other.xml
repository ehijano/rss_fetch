      <title>Evidence for magnetic crystallization waves at the surface of $^3$He crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultralow temperature crystals of the helium isotopes $^3$He and $^4$He are intriguing quantum systems. Deciphering the complex features of these unusual materials has been made possible in large part by Alexander Andreev's groundbreaking research. In 1978, Andreev and Alexander Parshin predicted the existence of melting/freezing waves at the surface of a solid $^4$He crystal, which was subsequently promptly detected. Successively, for the fermionic $^3$He superfluid/solid interface, even more intricate crystallization waves were anticipated, although they have not been observed experimentally so far. In this work, we provide preliminary results on $^3$He crystals at the temperature $T = 0.41$\;mK, supporting the existence of spin supercurrents in the melting/freezing waves on the crystal surface below the antiferromagnetic ordering temperature $T_N= 0.93$\;mK, as predicted by Andreev. The spin currents that accompany such a melting-freezing wave make it a unique object, in which the inertial mass is distinctly different from the gravitational mass.</description>

      <title>The Modified Airy Function Approximation Applied to the Double-Well Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The single harmonic oscillator and double-well potentials are important systems in quantum mechanics. The single harmonic oscillator is {\it the} paradigm in physics, and is taught in nearly all beginner undergraduate classes, while the double-well potential illustrates the two important principles of quantum tunnelling and linear superposition. While exact analytical solutions of the Schrodinger equation exist for both of these potentials, they are also employed to benchmark the use of approximate techniques which may be the only recourse for more complicated potentials. In this paper, we review the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approximation for both these potentials. While this approximation is known for its accurate energies, we will instead emphasize how poor the WKB wave functions are. The inaccuracy of the WKB wave functions will then motivate us to adopt the lesser-known Modified Airy Function (MAF) approximation, which alleviates the deficiencies of the WKB wave functions. We will review the MAF solution to the simple harmonic oscillator potential, and then apply the MAF to the double-well potential. We find accurate eigenvalues and, more importantly, very accurate wave functions. We conclude with the suggestion that an introduction to the MAF should be included in undergraduate courses to complement the WKB.</description>

      <title>Boundary-Driven Complex Brillouin Zone in Non-Hermitian Electric Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex-valued physical quantities, often non-conserved, represent key phenomena in non-Hermitian systems such as dissipation and localization. Recent advancements in non-Hermitian physics have revealed boundary-condition-sensitive band structures, characterized by a continuous manifold of complex-valued momentum known as the generalized Brillouin zone (GBZ). However, the ability to actively manipulate the GBZ and its associated topological properties has remained largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate a controllable manipulation of the GBZ by adjusting the boundary Hamiltonian and leveraging the boundary sensitivity in a circuit lattice. Our observations reveal that the GBZ forms multiple separated manifolds containing both decaying and growing wave functions, in contrast to the previously observed non-Hermitian skin effect under open boundary condition (OBC). By continuously deforming the GBZ, we observe the topological phase transitions of innate topological structure of GBZ that are enriched by complex properties of non-Hermitian physical variables. Notably, such topological phase transition is governed by boundary conditions rather than bulk properties, underscoring the extreme boundary sensitivity unique to non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>Cavity QED Control of Quantum Hall Stripes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlling quantum phases of materials with vacuum field fluctuations in engineered cavities is a novel route towards the optical control of emergent phenomena. We demonstrate, using magnetotransport measurements of a high-mobility two-dimensional electron gas, striking cavity-induced anisotropies in the electronic transport, including the suppression of the longitudinal resistance well below the resistivity at zero magnetic field. Our cavity-induced effects occur at ultra-low temperatures (&lt; 200 mK) when the magnetic field lies between quantized Hall plateaus. We interpret our results as arising from the stabilization of thermally-disordered quantum Hall stripes. Our work presents a clear demonstration of the cavity QED control of a correlated electronic phase.</description>

      <title>Mobility and Threshold Voltage Extraction in Transistors with Gate-Voltage-Dependent Contact Resistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19022v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The mobility of emerging (e.g., two-dimensional, oxide, organic) semiconductors is commonly estimated from transistor current-voltage measurements. However, such devices often experience contact gating, i.e., electric fields from the gate modulate the contact resistance during measurements, which can lead conventional extraction techniques to estimate mobility incorrectly even by a factor &gt;2. This error can be minimized by measuring transistors at high gate-source bias, |$V_\mathrm{gs}$|, but this regime is often inaccessible in emerging devices that suffer from high contact resistance or early gate dielectric breakdown. Here, we propose a method of extracting mobility in transistors with gate-dependent contact resistance that does not require operation at high |$V_\mathrm{gs}$|, enabling accurate mobility extraction even in emerging transistors with strong contact gating. Our approach relies on updating the transfer length method (TLM) and can achieve &lt;10% error even in regimes where conventional techniques overestimate mobility by &gt;2$\times$.</description>
