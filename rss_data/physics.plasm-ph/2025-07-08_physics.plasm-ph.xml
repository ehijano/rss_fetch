      <title>Heat-flux Instabilities of Regularized Kappa Distributed Strahl Electrons Resolved with ALPS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fluid behavior of the solar wind is affected by the heat flux carried by the suprathermal electron populations, especially the electron strahl (or beam) that propagates along the magnetic field. In turn, the electron strahl cannot be stable, and in the absence of collisions, its properties are regulated mainly by self-generated instabilities. This paper approaches the description of these heat-flux instabilities in a novel manner using regularized Kappa distributions (RKDs) to characterize the electron strahl. RKDs conform to the velocity distributions with suprathermal tails observed in situ, and at the same time allow for consistent macromodeling, based on their singularity-free moments. In contrast, the complexity of RKD models makes the analytical kinetic formalism complicated and still inaccessible, and therefore, here heat-flux instabilities are resolved using the advanced solver ALPS. Two primary types of instabilities emerge depending on plasma conditions: the whistler and firehose heat-flux instabilities. The solver is successfully tested for the first time for such instabilities by comparison with previous results for standard distributions, such as Maxwellian and Kappa. Moreover, the new RKD results show that idealized Maxwellian models can overrate or underestimate the effects of these instabilities, and also show differences from those obtained for the standard Kappa, which, for instance, underestimate the firehose heat-flux growth rates.</description>

      <title>Multi-messenger dynamic imaging of laser-driven shocks in water using a plasma wakefield accelerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding dense matter hydrodynamics is critical for predicting plasma behavior in environments relevant to laser-driven inertial confinement fusion. Traditional diagnostic sources face limitations in brightness, spatiotemporal resolution, and inability to detect relevant electromagnetic fields. In this work, we present a dual-probe, multi-messenger laser wakefield accelerator platform combining ultrafast X-rays and relativistic electron beams at 1 Hz, to interrogate a free-flowing water target in vacuum, heated by an intense 200 ps laser pulse. This scheme enables high-repetition-rate tracking of the interaction evolution using both particle types. Betatron X-rays reveal a cylindrically symmetric shock compression morphology assisted by low-density vapor, resembling foam-layer-assisted fusion targets. The synchronized electron beam detects time-evolving electromagnetic fields, uncovering charge separation and ion species differentiation during plasma expansion - phenomena not captured by photons or hydrodynamic simulations. We show that combining both probes provides complementary insights spanning kinetic to hydrodynamic regimes, highlighting the need for hybrid physics models to accurately predict fusion-relevant plasma behavior</description>

      <title>Numerical investigation of the effect of high voltage frequency on the density of RONS species in the air atmospheric pressure gas discharge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the last few decades, studies in various fields of plasma technology have expanded and its application in different processes has increased. Therefore, the achievement of a desirable and practical plasma with specific characteristics is of particular importance. The frequency of the applied voltage is one of the important factors that play a role in the physical and chemical characteristics. In this research, changes in the density of active species produced in an electrical discharge using a dielectric barrier and air working gas have been investigated from a frequency of 500 Hz to 500 kHz, and by applying a constant voltage of 2 kV, have been investigated. For this purpose, 87 different reactions with specific collision cross-sections were defined in COMSOL Multiphysics. Other parameters, including current-voltage waveform, electric field, and species densitywere evaluated. The results show that under completely identical conditions, the electron temperature distribution changes with increasing applied frequency, and the density of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species RONS decreases, but O shows an increasing trend. It should be noted that the simulation results are in good agreement with previous experimental and simulation reports. These results offer valuable insights into optimizing plasma parameters for different applications, potentially resulting in better treatment outcomes across a range of therapeutic domains.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Mixing of Waves in a Yukawa One Component Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phenomenon of nonlinear wave mixing is investigated in a Yukawa one-component plasma using two-dimensional classical Langevin molecular dynamics simulations. The wave spectrum indicates that nonlinear interactions between the excited modes are primarily governed by a three-wave mixing mechanism, as confirmed by bispectral analysis. In particular, the mixing characteristics observed in the simulations closely resemble those reported in previous numerical studies of the forced Korteweg-de Vries (fKdV) model [ Phys. Plasmas 29, 032303 (2022)]. This similarity further validates the applicability of the fKdV fluid model in capturing the weakly nonlinear dynamics of dusty plasmas with reasonable accuracy.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Approach to Model the Influence of Magnetic Geometry in the Confinement of Fusion Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design of fusion energy devices involves a balance between competing performance metrics to achieve an energy gain. In stellarators, the geometry is very flexible and involves a large number of free parameters. These can be optimized to achieve good performance. One of the main optimization targets is omnigenity, that is, the confinement of alpha particles stemming from the fusion reactions. In this work, two classes of omnigenous stellarators are studied, namely quasisymmetric and quasi-isodynamic stellarators. The goal is to determine the influence of the geometry on omnigenity, which can lead to greater insight into the design space of stellarators. For this purpose, a database of stellarator configurations is created and analyzed for correlations, pair-wise distributions, and dimensionality reduction using a supervised autoencoder framework. Then, a classification model is trained on this database to predict the convergence of numerical solvers. Finally, two regression models, LightGBM and its probabilistic version, LightGBM LSS, as well as a feed-forward neural network, are trained to predict quasisymmetry and quasi-isodynamiticity and find the design parameters that most influence omnigenity.</description>

      <title>Laser Amplification in $e^{-}$-$\mu^{-}$-ion Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate laser amplification in $e^{-}$-$\mu^{-}$-ion plasmas, where negative muons partially replace electrons. Theoretical results reveal a hybrid plasma wave, called $\mu$-wave that exhibits ion-acoustic behavior in long-wavelength regime and Langmuir-like behavior in short-wavelength regime. Besides, the Landau damping of $\mu$-wave is smaller than that of Langmuir wave. Particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations confirm the theoretical results of instabilities in$e^{-}$-$\mu^{-}$-ion plasmas. The $\mu$-wave enables efficient laser amplification by suppressing pump-driven spontaneous instabilities through enhanced Landau damping of Langmuir waves. Compared to Raman amplification, $\mu$-wave amplification can maintain the Gaussian waveform of the seed laser, avoiding pulse splitting. Compared to strongcoupling Brillouin amplification, $\mu$-wave amplification exhibits weaker filamentation instability. Our theoretical model can be generalized to other plasma systems containing two species of negatively charged particles, such as two-temperature electron plasmas and negative-ion plasma. These findings establish $e^{-}$-$\mu^{-}$-ion plasma as a promising medium for advanced laser amplification schemes.</description>

      <title>From Filamentation to Stratification: Instability Dynamics in Scissors-Shaped Relativistic Beam-Plasma System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Counter-streaming systems are a canonical model for beam-plasma instabilities, such as the filamentation instability, which is critical in high energy density physics. However, scenarios involving intersecting fast electron beams break the cylindrical symmetry inherent to such systems. Here, we introduce the scissors-shaped configuration, a fundamental multi-velocity-component system that captures this broken symmetry. Through theoretical analysis and particle-in-cell simulations, we reveal a dramatic shift in the instability dynamics: the system undergoes a stratification mode instead of filamentation. This mode is rapidly quenched by magnetic reconnection, leading to a quasi-stable state with magnetic energy two orders of magnitude lower than in the counter-streaming case. This discovery establishes a new principle of passive instability control via geometric configuration, offering a new perspective on beam-plasma interactions in astrophysics and inertial confinement fusion. The underlying physics is verifiable in upcoming multi-laser experiments.</description>

      <title>Fluid approach of current-driven Langmuir waves associated with type III radiation and whistler waves: Relevance to PSP and other solar wind observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A theoretical model on the basis of fluid-Maxwell equations for an electron-ion plasma is presented which describes the conversion of current-driven Langmuir waves into type III radiation whereby simultaneously an excitation of whistler waves may occur. In contrast to the classical approach of Ginzburg and Zhelezniakov (1958) after which beam-excited Langmuir waves in a two-step process are converted in electromagnetic radiation, the presented mechanism works without any instability and wave coalescence. Rather the electric field oscillations at the electron plasma frequency can be triggered by different realisations of the driving current, e.g. by the (uncompensated) net current of the strahl at t=0 in a core-strahl plasma or by given current variations which may represent different situations in space, as shocks, magnetic switch-backs etc.. A linearized system of equations is used to describe the mode coupling occurring at oblique propagation between the mostly electrostatic Langmuir wave and the adjacent electromagnetic left-hand polarized (L) wave. The simplicity of the fluid model allows without great effort the parameters of the current profiles to be varied and thus to simulate a wide range of possible experimental conditions. Measurements of Langmuir waves, type III radiation and whistler waves on board various satellites in the solar wind, and in particular some of the recent results of the Parker Solar Probe are interpreted in the light of the theoretical model presented. For the case of the uncompensated strahl, the fluid approach is confirmed by fully kinetic PIC simulations. One comparison is shown in the Appendix.</description>

      <title>PIC simulation of current-driven solar type III radiation and whistler waves in an electron core-strahl plasma: Relevance to PSP and other space observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of the paper is to demonstrate that electron current oscillations may generate electromagnetic waves as type III radiation and whistler waves without the involvement of the classical plasma emission via the coalescence of waves. PIC simulation results of an electron-core-strahl plasma without initial current compensation are presented which describe the conversion of current-driven Langmuir oscillations/waves into type III radiation whereby simultaneously whistler waves are excited. In contrast to the classical approach of Ginzburg and Zhelezniakov (1958) after which beam-excited Langmuir waves in a two-step process are converted in electromagnetic radiation, any instability is suppressed by selecting a low strahl velocity. Rather electric field oscillations at the electron plasma frequency are triggered by the initially non-compensated current of the strahl. The arising electromagnetic fields exhibit amplitude oscillations which are caused by the superposition of the two wave modes of mixed polarisation at the point of mode coupling. This basic mechanism of wave generation and transformation has already been described in earlier papers using simple fluid models. It is also the topic of the companion paper. Besides the fundamental electromagnetic radiation, the second harmonic of nearly the same intensity has been obtained which is an indication for nonlinear currents. Measurements of Langmuir waves, type III radiation and whistler waves on board various satellites in the solar wind, in particular Parker Solar Probe (PSP) observations are analysed in the light of our results. Interpretations of earlier PIC simulations are critically reviewed.</description>

      <title>Coherent synchrotron radiation by excitation of surface plasmon polariton on near-critical solid microtube surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherent synchrotron radiation (CSR) is vital for developing powerful ultrashort light sources. We introduce a CSR generation mechanism using surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) resonantly excited on a solid, near-critical-density microtube. A high-intensity, circularly polarised laser pulse, propagating along the microtube axis, efficiently couples the cylindrical SPP modes. This process creates azimuthally structured, rotating electromagnetic fields. These rotating fields subsequently confine, modulate, and directly accelerate surface electrons, causing them to emit CSR in the Valilov-Cherenkov angle. We further demonstrate that by improving the azimuthal symmetry, the helical modulation enables CSR emission across all azimuthal directions, significantly enhancing radiation intensity even when full coherence is imperfect. The harmonics can be well isolated for a high charge beam. Our full 3D Particle-in-Cell simulations indicate this scheme can generate X-rays with coherence enhanced by up to two orders of magnitude compared to incoherent emission.</description>

      <title>Compressed Ultrafast Photography of Plasmas Formed from Laser Breakdown of Dense Gases Reveals that Internal Processes Dominate Evolution at Early Times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compressed ultrafast photography (CUP) is applied to laser breakdown in argon and xenon under pressures up to 40atm to obtain 2D images of the plasma dynamics of single events with a spatial resolution of 250x100 pixels and an equivalent frame rate of 500 GHz. Light emission as a function of position and time is measured through red, green, blue, and broad-band filters. The spatially encoded and temporally sheared image normally used in CUP is now enhanced by the introduction of a constraint given by a spatially integrated and temporally sheared unencoded signal. The data yield insights into the temperature, opacity, the plasma formation process, and heat flow within the plasma and to the surrounding ambient gas. Contours of constant emission indicate that plasmas formed from sufficiently dense gas contract rather than expand despite having a temperature of a few eV. Plasmas formed from relatively low pressure gases such as 7atm argon can radiate with emissivity near unity. Modeling transport and opacity as arising from inverse Bremsstrahlung requires a degree of ionization that strongly exceeds expectations based on Saha's equation even as customarily modified to include density and screening. According to this model, both electrons and ions are strongly coupled with a plasma coefficient &gt;1. During the first few nanoseconds after formation, Stefan-Boltzmann radiation and thermal conduction to ambient gas are too weak to explain the observed cooling rates, suggesting that transport within the plasma dominates its evolution. Yet, thermal conduction within the plasma itself is also small as indicated by the persistence of thermal inhomogeneities for far longer timescales. The fact that plasma is isolated from the surroundings makes it an excellent system for the study of the equation of state and hydrodynamics of such dense plasmas via the systems and techniques described.</description>

      <title>Hexagonal boron nitride thin film synthesis with a ns-pulsed MHCD: in-situ plasma diagnostics and post-growth film characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is deposited on Si &lt;100&gt; wafer ($\approx$20 cm2) via Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition (PECVD) using a ns-pulsed N2/Ar Micro Hollow Cathode Discharge (MHCD) as a microplasma source. For the first time, aluminum nitride (AIN) is employed as the dielectric material in the MHCD to mitigate film contamination by atomic oxygen, an issue previously observed with conventional Al 2O3 dielectrics. A comprehensive multi-diagnostic approach is followed to characterize the deposited h-BN, including Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and X-ray photoelectron microscopy (XPS). In parallel, in-situ diagnostics such as optical emission spectroscopy (OES) and intensified CCD (ICCD) imaging are used to monitor plasma properties, including emission profiles, gas temperature and discharge morphology. Raman spectra reveal the E2g phonon mode of h-BN around 1366 cm_____, confirming successful synthesis. SEM imaging reveals an almost complete surface coverage by the film, with localized delamination. This is probably due to an uneven resistive heating of the Si wafer, rapid post-deposition cooling ($\sim$13 K/min) and ambient exposure. AFM analysis indicates an average thickness of about 33 nm after 90 minutes of deposition ($\sim$22 nm/h deposition rate). XPS measurements reveal an average B/N atomic ratio of $\sim$1.5 along the wafer diameter. Deviations from ideal film properties (e.g., stoichiometric unity, uniform morphology) are attributed to plasma-induced inhomogeneities (such as non-uniform species flux and temperature gradients) among other factors (e.g., ambient exposure post-deposition), which affect nitrogen and boron incorporation and localized film properties. Despite these challenges, the MHCD-driven PECVD process demonstrates strong potential for scalable h-BN synthesis, with further optimization of the reactor design, plasma conditions, and gas chemistry required to grow ideal films.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Resolution Limits in Pedestal Profile Measurements with Gaussian Process Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Edge transport barriers (ETBs) in magnetically confined fusion plasmas, commonly known as pedestals, play a crucial role in achieving high confinement plasmas. However, their defining characteristic, a steep rise in plasma pressure over short length scales, makes them challenging to diagnose experimentally. In this work, we use Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) to develop first-principles metrics for quantifying the spatiotemporal resolution limits of inferring differentiable profiles of temperature, pressure, or other quantities from experimental measurements. Although we focus on pedestals, the methods are fully general and can be applied to any setting involving the inference of profiles from discrete measurements. First, we establish a correspondence between GPR and low-pass filtering, giving an explicit expression for the effective `cutoff frequency' associated with smoothing incurred by GPR. Second, we introduce a novel information-theoretic metric, \(N_{eff}\), which measures the effective number of data points contributing to the inferred value of a profile or its derivative. These metrics enable a quantitative assessment of the trade-off between `over-fitting' and `over-regularization', providing both practitioners and consumers of GPR with a systematic way to evaluate the credibility of inferred profiles. We apply these tools to develop practical advice for using GPR in both time-independent and time-dependent settings, and demonstrate their usage on inferring pedestal profiles using measurements from the DIII-D tokamak.</description>

      <title>Dequantized particle algorithm for the nonlinear Vlasov-Poisson system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a dequantization algorithm for the Vlasov--Poisson (VP) system, termed the dequantized particle algorithm, by systematically dequantizing the underlying many-body quantum theory. Starting from the second-quantized Hamiltonian description, we derive a finite-dimensional dequantized system and show that it furnishes a structure-preserving discretization of the Schr\"odinger--Poisson (SP) equations. Through the Wigner or Husimi transformations, this discretization provides an efficient approximation of the VP system when quantum effects are negligible. Unlike conventional structure-preserving algorithms formulated in 6D phase space, this dequantized particle algorithm operates in 3D configuration space, potentially offering more compact and efficient representations of physical information under appropriate conditions. A numerical example of the classical nonlinear two-stream instability, simulated using merely 97 dequantized particles, demonstrates the efficiency, accuracy, and conservation properties of the algorithm and confirms its potential as a foundation for developing quantum and quantum-inspired classical algorithms for kinetic plasma dynamics.</description>

      <title>Bootstrap Current Modeling in M3D-C1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bootstrap current plays a crucial role in the equilibrium of magnetically confined plasmas, particularly in quasisymmetric (QS) stellarators and in tokamaks, where it can represent bulk of the electric current density. Accurate modeling of this current is essential for understanding the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equilibrium and stability of these configurations. This study expands the modeling capabilities of M3D-C1, an extended-MHD code, by implementing self-consistent physics models for bootstrap current. It employs two analytical frameworks: a generalized Sauter model (Sauter et al. (1999)), and a revised Sauter-like model (Redl et al. (2021)). The isomorphism described by Landreman et al. (2022) is employed to apply these models to quasisymmetric stellarators. The implementation in M3D-C1 is benchmarked against neoclassical codes, including NEO, XGCa, and SFINCS, showing excellent agreement. These improvements allow M3D-C1 to self-consistently calculate the neoclassical contributions to plasma current in axisymmetric and quasisymmetric configurations, providing a more accurate representation of the plasma behavior in these configurations. A workflow for evaluating the neoclassical transport using SFINCS with arbitrary toroidal equilibria calculated using M3D-C1 is also presented. This workflow enables a quantitative evaluation of the error in the Sauter-like model in cases that deviate from axi- or quasi-symmetry (e.g., through the development of an MHD instability).</description>

      <title>Regulation Compliant AI for Fusion: Real-Time Image Analysis-Based Control of Divertor Detachment in Tokamaks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While artificial intelligence (AI) has been promising for fusion control, its inherent black-box nature will make compliant implementation in regulatory environments a challenge. This study implements and validates a real-time AI enabled linear and interpretable control system for successful divertor detachment control with the DIII-D lower divertor camera. Using D2 gas, we demonstrate feedback divertor detachment control with a mean absolute difference of 2% from the target for both detachment and reattachment. This automatic training and linear processing framework can be extended to any image based diagnostic for regulatory compliant controller necessary for future fusion reactors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03119v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel approach to compute three-dimensional Magnetohydrodynamic equilibria by parametrizing Fourier modes with artificial neural networks and compare it to equilibria computed by conventional solvers. The full nonlinear global force residual across the volume in real space is then minimized with first order optimizers. Already,we observe competitive computational cost to arrive at the same minimum residuals computed by existing codes. With increased computational cost,lower minima of the residual are achieved by the neural networks,establishing a new lower bound for the force residual. We use minimally complex neural networks,and we expect significant improvements for solving not only single equilibria with neural networks,but also for computing neural network models valid over continuous distributions of equilibria.</description>

      <title>Real-time prediction of plasma instabilities with sparse-grid-accelerated optimized dynamic mode decomposition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parametric data-driven reduced-order models (ROMs) that embed dependencies in a large number of input parameters are crucial for enabling many-query tasks in large-scale problems. These tasks, including design optimization, control, and uncertainty quantification, are essential for developing digital twins in real-world applications. However, standard training data generation methods are computationally prohibitive due to the curse of dimensionality, as their cost scales exponentially with the number of inputs.This paper investigates efficient training of parametric data-driven ROMs using sparse grid interpolation with (L)-Leja points, specifically targeting scenarios with higher-dimensional input parameter spaces. (L)-Leja points are nested and exhibit slow growth, resulting in sparse grids with low cardinality in low-to-medium dimensional settings, making them ideal for large-scale, computationally expensive problems. Focusing on gyrokinetic simulations of plasma micro-instabilities in fusion experiments as a representative real-world application, we construct parametric ROMs for the full 5D gyrokinetic distribution function via optimized dynamic mode decomposition (optDMD) and sparse grids based on (L)-Leja points. We perform detailed experiments in two scenarios: First, the Cyclone Base Case benchmark assesses optDMD ROM prediction capabilities beyond training time horizons and across variations in the binormal wave number. Second, for a real-world electron temperature gradient driven micro-instability simulation featuring six input parameters, we demonstrate that an accurate parametric optDMD ROM can be constructed at a cost of only $28$ high-fidelity gyrokinetic simulations thanks to sparse grids. In the broader context of fusion research, these results demonstrate the potential of sparse grid-based parametric ROMs to enable otherwise intractable many-query tasks.</description>

      <title>Kappa distributions in the language of superstatistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The kappa distribution of velocities appears routinely in the study of collisionless plasmas present in Earth's magnetosphere, the solar wind among other contexts where particles are unable to reach thermal equilibrium. Originally justified through the use of Tsallis' non-extensive statistics, nowadays there are alternative frameworks that provide insight into these distributions, such as superstatistics. In this work we review the derivation of the multi-particle and single-particle kappa distributions for collisionless plasmas within the framework of superstatistics, as an alternative to the use of non-extensive statistics. We also show the utility of the superstatistical framework in the computation of expectation values under kappa distributions. Some consequences of the superstatistical formalism regarding correlations, temperature and entropy of kappa-distributed plasmas are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Memory- and compute-optimized geometric multigrid GMGPolar for curvilinear coordinate representations -- Applications to fusion plasma</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tokamak fusion reactors are actively studied as a means of realizing energy production from plasma fusion. However, due to the substantial cost and time required to construct fusion reactors and run physical experiments, numerical experiments are indispensable for understanding plasma physics inside tokamaks, supporting the design and engineering phase, and optimizing future reactor designs. Geometric multigrid methods are optimal solvers for many problems that arise from the discretization of partial differential equations. It has been shown that the multigrid solver GMGPolar solves the 2D gyrokinetic Poisson equation in linear complexity and with only small memory requirements compared to other state-of-the-art solvers. In this paper, we present a completely refactored and object-oriented version of GMGPolar which offers two different matrix-free implementations. Among other things, we leverage the Sherman-Morrison formula to solve cyclic tridiagonal systems from circular line solvers without additional fill-in and we apply reordering to optimize cache access of circular and radial smoothing operations. With the Give approach, memory requirements are further reduced and speedups of four to seven are obtained for usual test cases. For the Take approach, speedups of 16 to 18 can be attained.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superfluid vortices in neutron star crusts are thought to be pinned to the lattice of nuclei in the crust. The unpinning of superfluid vortices in spin glitches therefore motivates us to study the vortex-crust interaction explicitly with molecular dynamics. In this work, we present a new molecular dynamics methods to characterize the response of the crust to a rigid vortex. When vortex pinning forces and nearest neighbor Coulomb forces are comparable, we observe a qualitatively new phenomena of lattice entrainment with implications for the elastic evolution of the crust.</description>

Abstract: This work shows that the interiors of perturbed zero-helicity vortices display simply connected topology with a crescent-shaped boundary. Flux surfaces in fluid and magnetic vortices were explored analytically, while particle trajectories in the context of plasma confinement were examined numerically, demonstrating the existence of both toroidal and simply connected topologies. This new topology appears for perturbations in a broad class, with amplitudes and spatial variance allowed to be arbitrarily small. A corollary of this work proves the closedness of field lines under odd-parity perturbations of zero-helicity vortices.</description>

      <title>On the interpretation of XRISM X-ray measurements of turbulence in the intracluster medium: a comparison with cosmological simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate whether the properties of turbulent gas motions recently measured via X-ray spectroscopy in the Coma cluster of galaxies by XRISM are in tension with the "classical" fluid picture of the intracluster medium on large scales, as produced by a typical high-resolution cosmological simulation. We use a high-resolution simulation of Coma-like cluster of galaxies and show that the Kolmogorov-like turbulence measured in the simulation yields to velocity structure functions and line-width that fully compatible with those measured by the XRISM observation of Coma. These results highlight the combined biases driven by the inhomogeneity of turbulence in the intracluster medium and by the X-ray weighting in observations, and appear to release the tension between the XRISM data and current numerical simulations, showing that a turbulent spectrum much steeper than Kolmogorov is not required by current observational data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12016v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A subgrid electron-temperature-gradient (ETG) model is demonstrated here which averages local electron-scale turbulence from the GENE code over intermediate scales in space and time to include in global ion-temperature-gradient (ITG) GEM simulations. This approach results in ion-scale equations which include the electron heat transport from ETG turbulence and the effects of electron-scale turbulence on the ion scale. Flux-tube ETG Cyclone Base Case simulations are carried out using GENE at different radial locations and a kinetic form of the flux is added to ion-scale global GEM simulations as a source term. Analytic radial profiles of ETG heat flux are constructed and compared to flux-tube results at multiple radial locations. Different ratios of ITG to ETG turbulent heat flux levels are considered and the results of capturing ETG heat transport in global GEM simulations are discussed. Possibilities for coupling of the ETG streamer potential and intermediate-scale zonal flows found in ETG simulations to the ion scale are further discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07725v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a comprehensive Hamiltonian formulation for plasma dynamics that unifies collisionless gyrokinetic and collisional processes. Our framework rigorously describes the evolution of free energy and entropy during the transition from Maxwellian to non-Maxwellian distributions, explicitly coupling microscopic turbulent processes with macroscopic measures of energy confinement and fusion performance. Unlike standard gyrokinetic treatments that treat collisions as a minor perturbation, our approach incorporates a collision operator directly into the Hamiltonian structure, thereby accounting for irreversible dissipation and entropy production. We derive quantitative relations linking turbulence intensity, entropy production, energy confinement time and fusion yield. Our work builds on recent energetic bounds and optimal mode analyses by Helander and Plunk and on Zhdankin's generalised entropy-production framework, thus providing a bridge between microscopic kinetics and reactor-scale performance.</description>

      <title>Effective theory for stochastic particle acceleration, with application to magnetized turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.19136v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The physics of particle acceleration in turbulent plasmas is a topic of broad interest, which is making rapid progress thanks to dedicated, large-scale numerical experiments. The first part of this paper presents an effective theory of stochastic Fermi acceleration, which subsumes all forms of non-resonant acceleration in ideal electric fields and is applicable in generic settings. It combines an exact equation connecting the energization rate to the statistics of the velocity field with a statistical model of particle transport through the structures (i.e., the regions of strong velocity gradients). In a second part, this formalism is applied to magnetohydrodynamic turbulence to obtain a comprehensive assessment of the scale-by-scale contributions to the advection and diffusion coefficients. Acceleration peaks on scales where particles can be trapped inside structures for an eddy turn-around time, or in intense structures associated with sharp bends of the magnetic field lines in large-amplitude turbulence (as reported earlier). These spatially inhomogeneous, rapid acceleration regimes pave the way for a rich phenomenology. We discuss the scalings obtained, their interpretation and show that the findings compare satisfactorily with existing numerical results.</description>

      <title>Fast solvers for Tokamak fluid models with PETSC -- Part I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16676v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work begins the development of fast, scalable solvers for scientific and engineering-relevant magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) models of tokamaks using multigrid methods. These tokamak models are characterized by a distinguished direction in the toroidal coordinate that is partially aligned with the magnetic guide field, which dominates the plasma dynamics. All tokamak models exploit this structure, for example, NIMROD at https://nimrodteam.org uses $2D$, unstructured, high-order finite elements in the poloidal plane with Fourier modes in the toroidal coordinate, and the $3D$, extended MHD code \textit{M3D-C1}\footnote{https://m3dc1.pppl.gov} uses $2D$, unstructured $C^1$ elements in the poloidal plane with cubic Hermite functions in the toroidal direction. This structure suggests addressing the toroidal coordinate first, which \textit{NIMROD} does at the formulation level, but the \textit{M3D-C1} approach leaves in the algebraic system to be solved at each time step in an implicit time integrator. This work addressed the toroidal coordinate in the \textit{M3D-C1} velocity solve by adding semi-coarsening multigrid to the existing PETSC at https://petsc.org -- Portable, Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computation -- block Jacobi solver, with the addition of little new code that allows for smaller Jacobi subdomains that are better suited to contemporary, highly parallel, hardware. Competitive performance of this new solver configuration is demonstrated on a self-consistent runaway electron model of a SPARC at https://cfs.energy/technology/sparc disruption, and the next steps in the development of this new approach are outlined.</description>
