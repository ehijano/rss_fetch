      <title>ARTEMIS observations of electrostatic shocks inside the lunar wake</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When the solar wind encounters the Moon, a plasma void forms downstream of it, known as the lunar wake. In regions where the magnetic field is quasi-parallel to the plasma-vacuum boundary normal, plasma refills the wake primarily along magnetic field lines. As faster electrons outpace slower ions, an ambipolar electric field is generated, accelerating ions and decelerating electrons. Recent particle-in-cell simulations have shown that when accelerated supersonic ion beams from opposite sides of the wake meet near the wake center, electrostatic shocks may form, decelerating ions and heating electrons into flat-top velocity distributions. Using data from the Acceleration, Reconnection, Turbulence and Electrodynamics of the Moon's Interaction with the Sun (ARTEMIS) spacecraft, we present the first observational evidence of the predicted electrostatic shocks. Near the wake center of one event, we observed an electrostatic solitary structure with an amplitude of ~2 mV/m and a spatial scale of ~50 local Debye lengths. This structure generated a potential increase of ~50 V from upstream to downstream, heating incoming electrons by ~50 eV in the parallel direction while decelerating ions by ~60 km/s leading to a density enhancement. At a second event representing a more evolved stage, we observed more dissipated structures dominated by strong electrostatic waves, with persistent potential increases driving continued field-aligned electron heating and ion deceleration. These observations confirm simulation predictions of electrostatic shock formation and the associated particle dynamics within the lunar wake, with potential applications to understanding plasma interactions around other airless celestial bodies.</description>

      <title>Interplanetary magnetic correlation and low-frequency spectrum over many solar rotations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fluctuations and structure across a wide range of spatial and temporal scales are frequently studied in the solar wind. The properties of the low-frequency fluctuations are of relevance to turbulent energy injection into the plasma and the transport of high-energy cosmic rays. Correlation analysis of decade-long intervals of interplanetary data permits study of fluctuations at time scales much longer than suitably defined correlation times, and therefore at frequencies well below those associated with the Kolmogorov inertial range of in situ turbulence. At the frequencies of interest, we study the familiar occurrence of the 1/f spectral signature. We also study point spectral features due to solar rotation and their relation with the 1/f signal. We report novel properties at timescales ranging from minutes up to years, using data selected by wind speed, phase of solar cycle, and cartesian components of the magnetic field. A surprising finding is that the power in solar rotation harmonics is consistent with an extension of the 1/f spectrum, down to frequencies as low as around 5e-7 Hz. The presence of a broadband 1/f spectrum across different wind types supports the interpretation that 1/f signals may be related to or even originate from the solar dynamo.</description>

      <title>The Sustainability of the Leo Orbit Capacity via Risk-Driven Active Debris Removal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing number of space debris in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) jeopardizes long-term orbital sustainability, requiring efficient risk assessment for active debris removal (ADR) missions. This study presents the development and validation of Filtered Modified MITRI (FMM), an enhanced risk index designed to improve the prioritization of high-criticality debris. Leveraging the MOCAT-MC simulation framework, we conducted a comprehensive performance evaluation and sensitivity analysis to probe the robustness of the FMM formulation. The results demonstrate that while the FMM provides superior identification of high-risk targets for annual removal campaigns, a nuanced performance trade-off exists between risk models depending on the operational removal cadence. The analysis also confirms that physically grounded mass terms are indispensable for practical risk assessment. By providing a validated open source tool and critical insights into the dynamics of risk, this research enhances our ability to select optimal ADR targets and ensure the long-term viability of LEO operations.</description>

      <title>Modelling gyrosynchrotron emission from coronal energetic electrons in a CME flux rope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) can accelerate electrons, causing bursts such as type IV emissions in the solar radio continuum. Although radio spectroscopy is a powerful diagnostic tool for the corona, the origin and mechanisms of type IV bursts remain uncertain. In situ measurements can occasionally shed some light on these mechanisms, but they are limited in space and time. Sophisticated numerical modelling offers the best approach to improve our understanding of the physical processes involved. This research examines type IV radio bursts, exploring the effects of various electron distribution properties and CMEs on their generation and characteristics. To transcend idealised assumptions, we employ realistic, anisotropic electron distributions - obtained from particle transport simulations within complex magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) environments - as input for radio emission models. We use the 3D MHD model COCONUT to generate coronal background configurations, including a CME modelled as a modified Titov-D\'{e}moulin magnetic flux rope (MFR). These MHD simulations are used by the PARADISE particle transport code, which injects energetic electrons into the MFR and tracks their evolution. Finally, we feed the electron distributions and solar wind parameters into the Ultimate Fast Gyrosynchrotron (GS) Codes to compute radio emission along lines of sight. Electrons injected close to the MFR's central axis remain largely confined, producing a GS emission spectrum resembling observed type IV characteristics. Varying observer positions, CME properties, and spectral indices of the electron energy distributions modify the intensities and durations of the observed bursts. The strongest GS emission is observed to originate from the CME flanks. Our results indicate that GS emission is the major component in type IV spectra, although additional contributors cannot be ruled out.</description>

      <title>Variability in Footpoint Mapping of BBFs Using Tsyganenko Models: Impact on Swarm Conjunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18494v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetospheric-ionospheric coupling studies often rely on multi-spacecraft conjunctions, which require accurate magnetic field mapping tools. For example, linking measurements from the magnetotail with those in the ionosphere involves determining when the orbital magnetic footpoint of THEMIS or MMS intersects with the footpoint of Swarm. The Tsyganenko models are commonly used for tracing magnetic field lines. In this study, we aim to analyze how the footpoint locations are impacted by the input parameters of these models, including solar wind conditions, geomagnetic activity, and the location in the magnetotail. A dataset of 2394 bursty bulk flows (BBFs) detected by MMS was mapped to Earth's ionosphere with six different Tsyganenko models. Approximately 90% of the ionospheric footpoints are concentrated within 70{\deg} +/-5{\deg} magnetic latitude (MLAT) and +/-3 hours of magnetic local time (MLT) around midnight, with a pronounced peak in the pre-midnight sector. The MLT position showed a difference of approximately +/-1 hour MLT across the models. Footpoint locations were linked to the dawn-dusk position of the BBFs, with differences between models associated with variations in the interplanetary magnetic field clock angle. The MLAT values exhibited similar differences of approximately +/-4{\deg} around the mean value, with a systematic shift toward lower latitudes in the T89 model. This position is also influenced by the input parameters of the model representing the dynamics of Earth's magnetosphere, where stronger magnetospheric activity typically corresponds to lower latitudes. The uncertainty on the BBF footpoint location impacts the number of conjunctions with Swarm. Generally, Swarm B exhibited more conjunctions than Swarm A or C in the Northern Hemisphere.</description>
