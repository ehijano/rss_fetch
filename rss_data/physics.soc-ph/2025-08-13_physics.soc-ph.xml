      <title>Research on Quality Measurement and Dynamic Transmission of Higher Education in China from the Perspective of Dual Circulation: An Empirical Analysis Based on Entropy Weight-TOPSIS and PVAR Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Drawing on the new pattern of 'dual circulation', an evaluation system for the development level of China's higher education has been constructed, utilizing data from Chinese provinces over the period 2020 to 2022. Initially, the evaluation model is established, followed by the screening of initial indicators through correlation analysis. Subsequently, an entropy weight-TOPSIS model are employed for static quantification, and the PVAR model is introduced for the first time to describe the dynamic transmission from educational resources input to teaching effectiveness output. The empirical analysis reveals that, for effective development at this stage, higher education institutions should continuously optimize their educational structures, resource allocations, and talent cultivation strategies to align with the requirements of the new development paradigm, thereby contributing to national economic development through the provision of high-quality education.</description>

      <title>Safety Perspective on Assisted Lane Changes: Insights from Open-Road, Live-Traffic Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the assisted lane change functionality of five different vehicles equipped with advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). The goal is to examine novel, under-researched features of commercially available ADAS technologies. The experimental campaign, conducted in the I-24 highway near Nashville, TN, US, collected data on the kinematics and safety margins of assisted lane changes in real-world conditions. The results show that the kinematics of assisted lane changes are consistent for each system, with four out of five vehicles using slower speeds and decelerations than human drivers. However, one system consistently performed more assertive lane changes, completing the maneuver in around 5 seconds. Regarding safety margins, only three vehicles are investigated. Those operated in the US are not restricted by relevant UN regulations, and their designs were found not to adhere to these regulatory requirements. A simulation method used to classify the challenge level for the vehicle receiving the lane change, showing that these systems can force trailing vehicles to decelerate to keep a safe gap. One assisted system was found to have performed a maneuver that posed a hard challenge level for the other vehicle, raising concerns about the safety of these systems in real-world operation. All three vehicles were found to carry out lane changes that induced decelerations to the vehicle in the target lane. Those decelerations could affect traffic flow, inducing traffic shockwaves.</description>

      <title>Coupling between risk and cautious behavior affect epidemic morbidity, mortality and dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Models for epidemic spread typically account for variable risk factors but do not account for the correlation between behavior and risk. Here we extend these models to account for such correlations. We find that a positive correlation between behavior and risk, i.e., voluntary risk aversion by individuals at high risk and risk-taking behavior by individuals at low risk, leads to a linear reduction in morbidity and mortality and load on healthcare services compared to the uncorrelated case. We show that increasing caution in response to news from countries with a preceding outbreak leads to a more graded response to a lock-down. We also show that if vaccinated individuals are less cautious an increase in herd immunity threshold ensues.</description>

      <title>Climate2Energy: a framework to consistently include climate change into energy system modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supply and demand in future energy systems depend on the weather. We therefore need to quantify how climate change and variability impact energy systems. Here, we present Climate2Energy (C2E), a framework to consistently convert climate model outputs into energy system model inputs, covering all relevant types of renewable generation and demand for heating and cooling. C2E performs bias correction, uses established open-source tools where possible, and provides outputs tailored to energy system models. Moreover, C2E introduces a new hydropower model based on river discharge. We analyze dedicated hourly CESM2 Climate Model Simulations under the SSP3-7.0 scenario in Europe, covering climate variability through multiple realizations. We find large reductions in heating demand (-10% to -50%) and Southern European hydropower potentials (-10% to -40%) and increases in cooling demand (&gt;100%). Based on stochastic optimizations with AnyMOD, we confirm that energy systems are highly sensitive to climate conditions, particularly on the demand side.</description>

      <title>Connected components in networks with higher-order interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03060v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the problem of defining connected components in hypergraphs, which are models for systems with higher-order interactions. For graphs with dyadic interactions, connected components are defined in terms of paths connecting nodes along the graph. However, defining connected components in hypergraphs is a more involved problem, as one needs to consider the higher-order nature of the interactions associated with the hyperedge. Higher-order interactions can be taken into consideration through a logic associated with the hyperedges, two examples being OR-logic and AND-logic; these logical operations can be considered two limiting cases corresponding to non-cooperative and fully cooperative interactions, respectively. In this paper we show how connected components can be defined in hypergraphs with OR or AND logic. While OR-logic and AND-logic provide the same connected components for nondirected hypergraphs, for directed hypergraphs the strongly connected component of AND-logic is a subset of the OR-logic strongly connected component. Interestingly, higher-order interactions change the general topological properties of connected components in directed hypergraphs. Notably, while for directed graphs the strongly connected component is the intersection of its in- and out-component, in hypergraphs with AND-logic the intersection of in- and out-component does not equal the strongly connected component. We develop a theory for the fraction of nodes that are part of the largest connected component and through comparison with real-world data we show that degree-cardinality correlations play a significant role.</description>

      <title>Citation Issues in Wave Mechanics Theory of Microwave Absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06522v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The wave mechanics theory of microwave absorption challenges the long-standing impedance-matching and quarter-wavelength paradigms by demonstrating that conventional models mistakenly conflate bulk material parameters with thin-film phenomena. Drawing on a corpus of 35 peer-reviewed papers and preprints, the study performs a citation-pattern analysis and a logical audit of established theory. Results reveal a striking asymmetry in scholarly engagement, only a handful of supportive or neutral citations appear amid widespread silence, alongside critical logical flaws in impedance matching, notably its inconsistent treatment of penetration, reflection, and absorption from film. By re-framing absorption as a wave-mechanics process governed by interference at parallel interfaces, the wave mechanics framework restores energy-conservation consistency and provides experimentally verified design rules for film thickness, phase response, and broadband performance. The paper further situates the citation neglect within broader issues of peer-review bias and paradigm inertia, illustrating how cargo-cult scientific practices can impede theoretical progress. Recommendations are offered for researchers, editors, and institutions to foster open discourse, rigorously test competing models, and update curricula and design tools accordingly.</description>
