      <title>Correlations versus noise in the NFT market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The non-fungible token (NFT) market emerges as a recent trading innovation leveraging blockchain technology, mirroring the dynamics of the cryptocurrency market. To deepen the understanding of the dynamics of this market, in the current study, based on the capitalization changes and transaction volumes across a large number of token collections on the Ethereum platform, the degree of correlation in this market is examined by using the multivariate formalism of detrended correlation coefficient and correlation matrix. It appears that correlation strength is lower here than that observed in previously studied markets. Consequently, the eigenvalue spectra of the correlation matrix more closely follow the Marchenko-Pastur distribution, still, some departures indicating the existence of correlations remain. The comparison of results obtained from the correlation matrix built from the Pearson coefficients and, independently, from the detrended cross-correlation coefficients suggests that the global correlations in the NFT market arise from higher frequency fluctuations. Corresponding minimal spanning trees (MSTs) for capitalization variability exhibit a scale-free character while, for the number of transactions, they are somewhat more decentralized.</description>

      <title>Variational Deep Survival Machines: Survival Regression with Censored Outcomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Survival regression aims to predict the time when an event of interest will take place, typically a death or a failure. A fully parametric method [18] is proposed to estimate the survival function as a mixture of individual parametric distributions in the presence of censoring. In this paper, We present a novel method to predict the survival time by better clustering the survival data and combine primitive distributions. We propose two variants of variational auto-encoder (VAE), discrete and continuous, to generate the latent variables for clustering input covariates. The model is trained end to end by jointly optimizing the VAE loss and regression loss. Thorough experiments on dataset SUPPORT and FLCHAIN show that our method can effectively improve the clustering result and reach competitive scores with previous methods. We demonstrate the superior result of our model prediction in the long-term. Our code is available at https://github.com/qinzzz/auton-survival-785.</description>

      <title>PST: Improving Quantitative Trading via Program Sketch-based Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05551</link>

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has revolutionized quantitative finance by achieving decent performance without significant human expert knowledge. Despite its achievements, we observe that the current state-of-the-art DRL models are still ineffective in identifying the market trend, causing them to miss good trading opportunities or suffer from large drawdowns when encountering market crashes. To tackle this limitation, a natural idea is to embed human expert knowledge regarding the market trend. Whereas, such knowledge is abstract and hard to be quantified. In this paper, we propose a universal neuro-symbolic tuning framework, called program sketch-based tuning (PST). Particularly, PST first proposes using a novel symbolic program sketch to embed the abstract human expert knowledge of market trends. Then we utilize the program sketch to tune a trained DRL policy according to the different market trend of the moment. Finally, in order to optimize this neural-symbolic framework, we propose a novel hybrid optimization method. Extensive evaluations on two popular quantitative trading tasks demonstrate that PST can significantly enhance the performance of previous state-of-the-art DRL strategies while being extremely lightweight.</description>

      <title>Controlgym: Large-Scale Control Environments for Benchmarking Reinforcement Learning Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18736v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce controlgym, a library of thirty-six industrial control settings, and ten infinite-dimensional partial differential equation (PDE)-based control problems. Integrated within the OpenAI Gym/Gymnasium (Gym) framework, controlgym allows direct applications of standard reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms like stable-baselines3. Our control environments complement those in Gym with continuous, unbounded action and observation spaces, motivated by real-world control applications. Moreover, the PDE control environments uniquely allow the users to extend the state dimensionality of the system to infinity while preserving the intrinsic dynamics. This feature is crucial for evaluating the scalability of RL algorithms for control. This project serves the learning for dynamics &amp; control (L4DC) community, aiming to explore key questions: the convergence of RL algorithms in learning control policies; the stability and robustness issues of learning-based controllers; and the scalability of RL algorithms to high- and potentially infinite-dimensional systems. We open-source the controlgym project at https://github.com/xiangyuan-zhang/controlgym.</description>
