      <title>Berry-dipole Semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce ''Berry-dipole semimetals'', whose band degeneracies are characterized by quantized Berry dipoles. Through a two-band model constructed by Hopf map, we reveal that the Berry-dipole semimetals display a multitude of salient properties distinct from other topological semimetals. On the boundary, we find that the first-order Berry-dipole semimetal harbors anomalous paired Fermi arcs with the same spin polarization, even though the layer Chern number is zero, and the second-order Berry-dipole semimetal hosts dispersionless hinge arcs. In the bulk, we find that the low-energy Berry-dipole Hamiltonian near the band node has a quadratic energy dispersion and peculiar Berry curvature, which give rise to rather unique characteristics in the intrinsic anomalous Hall effect, orbital magnetization and Landau levels. Our study shows that Berry-dipole semimetals are a class of topological gapless phases supporting rich intriguing physics.</description>

      <title>Superpolarized Electron-Hole Liquid and Multiferroicity in Multilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a many-body state termed superpolarized electron-hole liquid to explain the multiferroic properties observed in a recent experiment on rhombohedral pentalayer graphene by Han et al. [Nature 623, 41-47, 2023] . Superpolarization refers to a state where electrons and holes are fully polarized in opposite directions within the extended spin-valley space, resulting in a polarization per charge that exceeds the saturated value of one. This state exhibits multiferroic order, characterized by spontaneous spin, layer, and valley polarization. We demonstrate the independent control of valley polarization and orbital magnetization in this state through the application of electric-displacement field and weak magnetic fields. The large magnetoelectric effect observed in the experiment is attributed to the substantial Berry curvature concentrated near the band edge. The concept of superpolarization can be probed experimentally through magnetic oscillation and local current distribution measurements to determine the area of the Fermi surfaces and their magnetic moments.</description>

      <title>Communicating skyrmions as the main mechanism underlying skyrmionium (meta)stability in quasi-two-dimensional chiral magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We re-examine the internal structure of skyrmioniums stabilized in quasi-two-dimensional chiral magnets with easy-axis uniaxial anisotropy. Skyrmioniums are particle-like states of two nested skyrmions with opposite polarities contributing to zero topological charge. The physical principles of skyrmionium stability are drawn from both the analytical analysis with a trial function and from numerical simulations within the framework of micromagnetism. We deduce that the radii of the internal skyrmion with the positive polarity and the ring-shaped external skyrmion with the negative polarity are mutually dependent, which constitutes the paradigm of communicating skyrmions. For large central skyrmions, the skyrmionium transforms into a narrow circular domain wall, whereas for small internal radii, the ring expands, which occurs at the verge of collapsing into an ordinary isolated skyrmion. We show that skyrmioniums may form lattices of two varieties depending on the polarity of the internal skyrmion. At the phase diagram (magnetic field)-(uniaxial anisotropy), both skyrmionium lattices share the same area with one-dimensional spiral states and remain metastable solutions for the whole range of control parameters. By expanding at the critical line, skyrmionium lattices do not release isolated skyrmioniums. Isolated skyrmioniums of just one type exist apart from the corresponding lattice in a narrow field region restricted by the critical line of expansion from below and by the line of collapse above.</description>

      <title>Electronic states and quantum transport in bilayer graphene Sierpinski-carpet fractals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct Sierpinski-carpet (SC) based on AA or AB bilayer graphene by atom vacancies, namely, SC-AA and SC-AB, to investigate the effects of interlayer coupling on the electronic properties of fractals. Compared with monolayer graphene SC, their density of states have similar features, such as Van-Hove singularities and edge states corresponding to the central peaks near zero energy, but remarkable energy broadening of edge states emerges in SC-AA(AB). Calculated conductance spectrum shows that the conductance fluctuations still hold the Hausdorff fractal dimension behavior even with the interlayer coupling. Thus, the high correlation between quantum conductance and fractal geometry dimension is not affected by the interlayer coupling in bilayer graphene SC. We further reveal the quasi-eigenstates in fractal-like pressure-modulated bilayer graphene, namely, SC-pAA and SC-pAB. Numerical results show that the density of states of SC-pAA(pAB) show an asymptotic behavior to those of SC-AA(AB) especially for high energy quasi-eigenstates. Within a certain energy range, stronger pressure can lead to stronger localization, forming an efficient fractal space.</description>

      <title>Spin Hall Nano-Oscillator Empirical Electrical Model for Optimal On-chip Detector Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As nascent nonlinear oscillators, nano-constriction spin Hall nano-oscillators (SHNOs) represent a promising potential for integration into more complicated systems such as neural networks, magnetic field sensors, and radio frequency (RF) signal classification, their tunable high-frequency operating regime, easy synchronization, and CMOS compatibility can streamline the process. To implement SHNOs in any of these networks, the electrical features of a single device are needed before designing the signal detection CMOS circuitry. This study centers on presenting an empirical electrical model of the SHNO based on a comprehensive characterization of the output impedance of a single SHNO, and its available output power in the range of 2-10 GHz at various bias currents.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable spin-wave platform based on interplay between nanodots and waveguide in hybrid magnonic crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a hybrid magnonic crystal composed of a chain of nanodots with strong perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, positioned above a permalloy waveguide. The study examines two different magnetization states in the nanodots: a single-domain state and an egg-shaped skyrmion state. Due to the dipolar coupling between the dot and the waveguide, a strongly bound hybrid magnetization texture is formed in the system. Our numerical results show complex spin-wave spectra, combining the effects of periodicity, magnetization texture, and hybridization of the propagating waves in the waveguide with the dot/skyrmion modes. The systems are characterized by different band gap sizes. For the skyrmion state, the azimuthal modes confined to the skyrmion domain wall lead to the formation of flat bands at low frequencies, while at higher frequencies we identify among them modes interacting with the propagating waves, which can introduce additional non-Bragg band gaps, as well as isolated modes leading to the formation of bound states. On the other hand, the system with a single-domain state in nanodots offers a wide range of frequencies where the spin waves are predominantly in the waveguide. Thus, the study shows that the proposed hybrid magnonic crystals have many distinct functionalities, highlighting their reconfigurable potential, magnon-magnon couplings, mode localization, and bound states overlapping with the propagating waves. This opens up potential applications in analog and quantum magnonics, spin-wave filtering, and the establishment of magnonic neural networks.</description>

      <title>Keeping the photon in the dark: Enabling full quantum dot control by chirped pulses and magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Because dark excitons in quantum dots are not directly optically accessible, so far they have not played a significant role in using quantum dots for photon generation. They possess significantly longer lifetimes than their brighter counterparts and hence offer enormous potential for photon storage or manipulation. In this work, we demonstrate an all-optical storage and retrieval of the spin-forbidden dark exciton in a quantum dot from the ground state employing chirped pulses and an in-plane magnetic field. Our experimental findings are in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions of the dynamics calculated using state-of-the-art product tensor methods. Our scheme enables an all-optical control of dark states without relying on any preceding decays. This opens up a new dimension for optimal quantum control and time-bin entangled photon pair generation from quantum dots.</description>

      <title>Grover's algorithm in a four-qubit silicon processor above the fault-tolerant threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin qubits in silicon are strong contenders for realizing a practical quantum computer. This technology has made remarkable progress with the demonstration of single and two-qubit gates above the fault-tolerant threshold and entanglement of up to three qubits. However, maintaining high fidelity operations while executing multi-qubit algorithms has remained elusive, only being achieved for two spin qubits to date due to the small qubit size, which makes it difficult to control qubits without creating crosstalk errors. Here, we use a four-qubit silicon processor with every operation above the fault tolerant limit and demonstrate Grover's algorithm with a ~95% probability of finding the marked state, one of the most successful implementations to date. Our four-qubit processor is made of three phosphorus atoms and one electron spin precision-patterned into 1.5 nm${}^2$ isotopically pure silicon. The strong resulting confinement potential, without additional confinement gates that can increase cross-talk, leverages the benefits of having both electron and phosphorus nuclear spins. Significantly, the all-to-all connectivity of the nuclear spins provided by the hyperfine interaction not only allows for efficient multi-qubit operations, but also provides individual qubit addressability. Together with the long coherence times of the nuclear and electron spins, this results in all four single qubit fidelities above 99.9% and controlled-Z gates between all pairs of nuclear spins above 99% fidelity. The high control fidelities, combined with &gt;99% fidelity readout of all nuclear spins, allows for the creation of a three-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state with 96.2% fidelity, the highest reported for semiconductor spin qubits so far. Such nuclear spin registers can be coupled via electron exchange, establishing a path for larger scale fault-tolerant quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric Effect in Altermagnet-Superconductor Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose altermagnet-superconductor junctions as a way to achieve a thermoelectric response in metals free of external or stray magnetic fields. We combine qualitative analysis in a simplified model with a more rigorous approach based on the inverse proximity effect in the functional-integral formulation. We show that coupling an altermagnet to a superconductor in a bilayer induces a momentum-dependent spin-splitting in the superconductor. When tunneling occurs between this bilayer and a different altermagnet, a spin-dependent particle-hole symmetry breakdown arises in the transport, which leads to a thermoelectric response. Our results show that the altermagnet-superconductor junctions may achieve comparable thermoelectric performance to ferromagnet-superconductor junctions, featuring a nonmonotonic dependence of the figure of merit on the strength of the altermagnetic splitting. We also point out an often overlooked fact regarding the inverse proximity effect in superconductors, namely that even in a normal metal-superconductor junction there is a minigap in the superconductor, which gives rise to a four-peak structure in the DOS reminiscent of spin-split superconductors. Our results show that altermagnetic metals, unlike conventional antiferromagnets, can be used for efficient cryogenic thermoelectricity.</description>

      <title>Landau-Zener without a Qubit: Unveiling Multiphoton Interference, Synthetic Floquet Dimensions, and Dissipative Quantum Chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Landau-Zener-St\"uckelberg-Majorana (LZSM) interference emerges when the parameters of a $\textit{qubit}$ are periodically modulated across an avoided level crossing. Here, we investigate the occurrence of the LZSM phenomenon in nonlinear multilevel bosonic systems, where the interference pattern is determined by multiple energy levels and cannot be described by a level crossing between only two states. We fabricate two superconducting resonators made of flux-tunable Josephson junction arrays. The first device is very weakly nonlinear (the nonlinearity is smaller than the photon-loss rate) and, when a weak driving field is applied, it behaves as a linear resonator, yet shows the same LZSM interference as in a two-level system. Notably, here the interference originates from multiple avoided level crossings of the harmonic ladder. When subjected to a stronger drive, nonlinear effects start playing a role, and the interference pattern departs from the one observed in two-level systems. We demonstrate that, when two or more LZSM interference peaks merge, dissipative quantum chaos emerges. In the second device, where the nonlinearity surpasses the photon-loss rate, we observe additional LZSM interference peaks due to Kerr multiphoton resonances. When described under the light of the Floquet theory, these resonances can be interpreted as synthetic modes of an array of coupled cavities. We derive a simple effective model highlighting the essential features of the entirety of these phenomena. As the control of LZSM in qubit systems led to the implementation of fast protocols for characterization and state preparation, our findings pave the way to better control of nonlinear resonators, with implications for diverse quantum technological platforms.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous splitting of d-wave surface states: Circulating currents or edge magnetization?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pair-breaking edges of $d$-wave superconductors feature Andreev bound states at the Fermi energy. Since these states are energetically highly unfavorable they are susceptible to effects that shift them to finite energy. We investigate the free energy of two different mechanisms: spontaneous phase gradients in the superconducting order parameter and surface ferromagnetism caused by Fermi liquid interaction effects. We find that the surface magnetization appears at lower temperatures than the spontaneous current flow of the phase-crystal state. The magnetic state can, however, be energetically favorable at lower temperatures for sufficiently strong Fermi liquid effects. As a result, first-order transitions between the two states are possible, suggesting a rich low-temperature phase diagram in $d$-wave superconductors.</description>

      <title>Observation of thermal microwave photons with a Josephson junction detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When measuring electromagnetic radiation of frequency $f$, the most sensitive detector is the one that counts the single quanta of energy $h f$. Single photon detectors (SPDs) were demonstrated from $\gamma$-rays to infrared wavelengths, and extending this range down to the microwaves is the focus of intense research. The energy of $10\,\mathrm{GHz}$ microwave photon, about $40\,\mathrm{\mu eV}$ or $7\, \mathrm{yJ},$ is enough to force a superconducting Josephson junction into its resistive state, making it suitable to be used as a sensor. In this work, we use an underdamped Josephson junction to detect single thermal photons stochastically emitted by a microwave copper cavity at millikelvin temperatures. After characterizing the source and detector, we vary the temperature of the resonant cavity and measure the increased photon rate. The device shows an efficiency up to 40% and a dark count rate of $0.1\,\mathrm{Hz}$ in a bandwidth of several gigahertz. To confirm the thermal nature of the emitted photons we verify their super-Poissonian statistics, which is also a signature of quantum chaos. We discuss detector application in the scope of Dark Matter Axion searches, and note its importance for quantum information, metrology and fundamental physics.</description>

      <title>Millisecond-resolved infrared spectroscopy study of polymer brush swelling dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the study of millisecond-resolved polymer brush swelling dynamics using infrared spectroscopy with a custom-built quantum cascade laser-based infrared spectrometer at a 1 kHz sampling rate after averaging. By cycling the humidity of the environment of the polymer brush, we are able to measure the swelling dynamics sequentially at different wavenumbers. The high sampling rate provides us with information on the reconformation of the brush at a higher temporal resolution than previously reported. Using spectroscopic ellipsometry, we study the brush swelling dynamics as a reference experiment and to correct artefacts of the infrared measurement approach. This technique informs on the changes in the brush thickness and refractive index. Our results indicate that the swelling dynamics of the polymer brush are poorly described by Fickian diffusion and the Berens-Hopfenberg formalism, pointing toward more complicated underlying transport.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric dynamical charges in two-dimensional ferroelectrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ferroelectricity is commonly understood in terms of dynamical charges, which represent the dipole moments generated by atomic displacements or the forces induced by electric fields. In ferroelectrics with a high degree of symmetry, the dynamical charges are typically symmetric tensors, and can be visualized as ellipsoids. In van der Waals (vdW) materials which break centrosymmetry, a new type of ferroelectricity arises which differs greatly from conventional ferroelectrics. The polarization is purely electronic, arising from an interlayer charge transfer, and most of the polarization generated is perpendicular to atomic motion. We show that the unconventional properties of vdW ferroelectrics are manifested in their dynamical charges, which exhibit spatial modulation and intrinsic asymmetry. Dynamical charges in vdW ferroelectrics, and more generally, any strongly anisotropic ferroelectric, can be visualized as deformable, non-ideal ellipsoids dependent on the atomic configuration. Furthermore, we show that, due to the mixed electrostatic boundary conditions employed for two-dimensional materials, non-diagonal dynamical charges in 2D materials are always asymmetric.</description>

      <title>Strain-dependent one-dimensional confinement channels in twisted bilayer 1T$'$-WTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The low symmetry and anistropic lattice of 1T$'$ WTe$_2$ is responsible for the existence of parallel one-dimensional channels in the moir\'e patterns of twisted bilayers. This gives the opportunity to explore moir\'e physics of a different nature to that widely observed in twisted bilayers of materials with hexagonal symmetries. Here, we combine plane-wave and linear-scaling density functional theory calculations to describe the electronic properties of twisted bilayer 1T$'$ WTe$_2$. For a small change in the lattice parameters of the constituent 1T$'$ WTe$_2$ monolayers, we find a substantial moir\'e-induced striped electrostatic potential landscape in the twisted bilayer, with a peak-to-trough magnitude $&gt;$200~meV.</description>

Abstract: The attachment of redox active molecules to transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), such as MoS2, constitutes a promising approach for designing electrochemically switchable devices through the control of the material charge/spin transport properties by the redox state of the grafted molecule and thus the applied electrical potential. In this work, defective plasma treated MoS2 is functionalized by a ferrocene derivative and thoroughly investigated by various characterization techniques, such as Raman, photoluminescence, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and electrochemistry. Furthermore, in-plane and out-of-plane conductive-AFM measurements (I-V and first derivative dI/dV-V curves) are measured to investigate the effect of the chemical functionalization of MoS2 on the electron transport properties. While the conduction and valence bands are determined at +0.7 and -1.2 eV with respect of the electrode Fermi energy for pristineMoS2, additional states in an energy range of ca. 0.45 eV below the MoS2 conduction band are measured after plasma treatment, attributed to S-vacancies. For ferrocene functionalized MoS2, the S-vacancy states are no longer observed resulting from the defect healing. However, two bumps at lower voltages in the dI/dV-V indicate a contribution to the electron transport through ferrocene HOMO, which is located in the MoS2 band gap at ca. 0.4-0.6 eV below the Fermi energy. These results are in good agreement with theoretical density functional theory (DFT) calculations and UV photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements.</description>

Abstract: We report on a certain class of three-dimensional topological insulators and semimetals protected by spinless $\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$ symmetry, hosting an integer-valued bulk invariant. We show using homotopy arguments that these phases host multi-gap topology, providing a realization of a single $\mathbb{Z}$ invariant in three spatial dimensions that is distinct from the Hopf index. We identify this invariant with the Pontryagin index, which describes BPST instantons in particle physics contexts and corresponds to a 3-sphere winding number. We study naturally arising multi-gap linked nodal rings, topologically characterized by split-biquaternion charges, which can be removed by non-Abelian braiding of nodal rings, even without closing a gap. We additionally connect the describing winding number in terms of gauge-invariant combinations of non-Abelian Berry connection elements, indicating relations to Pontryagin characteristic class in four dimensions. These topological configurations are furthermore related to fully non-degenerate multi-gap phases that are characterized by a pair of winding numbers relating to two isoclinic rotations in the case of four bands and can be generalized to an arbitrary number of bands. From a physical perspective, we also analyze the edge states corresponding to this Pontryagin index as well as their dissolution subject to the gap-closing disorder. Finally, we elaborate on the realization of these novel non-Abelian phases, their edge states and linked nodal structures in acoustic metamaterials and trapped-ion experiments.</description>

      <title>Twisted bilayer graphene revisited: minimal two-band model for low-energy bands</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12308v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An accurate description of the low-energy electronic bands in twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG) is of great interest due to their relation to correlated electron phases, such as superconductivity and Mott-insulator behavior at half-filling. The paradigmatic model of Bistritzer and MacDonald [PNAS 108, 12233 (2011)], based on the moir\'e pattern formed by tBLG, predicts the existence of "magic angles" at which the Fermi velocity of the low-energy bands goes to zero, and the bands themselves become dispersionless. Here, we reexamine the low-energy bands of tBLG from the ab initio electronic structure perspective, motivated by features related to the atomic relaxation in the moir\'e pattern, namely circular regions of AA stacking, triangular regions of AB/BA stacking and domain walls separating the latter. We find that the bands are never perfectly flat and the Fermi velocity never vanishes, but rather a "magic range" exists where the lower band becomes extremely flat and the Fermi velocity attains a non-zero minimum value. We propose a simple $(2+2)$-band model, comprised of two different pairs of orbitals, both on a honeycomb lattice: the first pair represents the low-energy bands with high localization at the AA sites, while the second pair represents highly dispersive bands associated with domain-wall states. This model gives an accurate description of the low-energy bands with few (13) parameters which are physically motivated and vary smoothly in the magic range. In addition, we derive an effective two-band hamiltonian which also gives an accurate description of the low-energy bands. This minimal two-band model affords a connection to a Hubbard-like description of the occupancy of sub-bands and can be used a basis for exploring correlated states.</description>

      <title>Odd non-linear conductivity under spatial inversion in chiral Tellurium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.08267v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electrical transport in non-centrosymmetric materials departs from the well-established phenomenological Ohm's law. Instead of a linear relation between current and electric field, a non-linear conductivity emerges along specific crystallographic directions. This non-linear transport is fundamentally related to the lack of spatial inversion symmetry. However, the experimental implications of an inversion symmetry operation on the non-linear conductivity remain to be explored. Here, we report on a large, non-linear conductivity in chiral Tellurium. By measuring samples with opposite handedness, we demonstrate that the non-linear transport is odd under spatial inversion. Furthermore, by applying an electrostatic gate, we modulate the non-linear output by a factor of 300, reaching the highest reported value excluding engineered heterostructures. Our results establish chiral Te as an ideal compound not just to study the fundamental interplay between crystal structure, symmetry operations and non-linear transport, but also to develop wireless rectifiers and energy-harvesting chiral devices.</description>

Abstract: Hole qubits in germanium quantum dots are promising candidates for coherent control and manipulation of the spin degree of freedom through electric dipole spin resonance. We theoretically study the time dynamics of a single heavy-hole qubit in a laser-driven planar germanium quantum dot confined laterally by a harmonic potential in presence of linear and cubic Rashba spin-orbit couplings and an out-of-plane magnetic field. We obtain an approximate analytical formula of the Rabi frequency using a Schrieffer-Wolff transformation and establish a connection of our model with the ESDR results obtained for this system. For stronger beams, we employ different methods such as unitary transformation and Floquet theory to study the time evolution numerically. We observe that high radiation intensity is not suitable for the qubit rotation due to the presence of high frequency noise superimposed on the Rabi oscillations. We display the Floquet spectrum and highlight the quasienergy levels responsible for the Rabi oscillations in the Floquet picture. We study the interplay of both the types of Rashba couplings and show that the Rabi oscillations, which are brought about by the linear Rashba coupling, vanish for typical values of the cubic Rashba coupling in this system.</description>

Abstract: Excitons in van der Waals heterostructures based on atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenides are considered as potential candidates for the formation of a superfluid state in two-dimensional systems. A number of studies reported observations of ultrafast nondiffusive propagation of excitons in van der Waals heterostructures, which was considered by their authors as possible evidence of collective effects in excitonic systems. In this paper, after a brief analysis of exciton propagation regimes in two-dimensional semiconductors, an alternative model of ultrafast exciton transport is proposed, based on the formation of waveguide modes in van der Waals heterostructures and the radiation transfer by these modes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08215v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Real topological phases protected by the spacetime inversion (P T) symmetry are a current research focus. The basis is that the P T symmetry endows a real structure in momentum space, which leads to Z2 topological classifications in 1D and 2D. Here, we provide solutions to two outstanding problems in the diagnosis of real topology. First, based on the stable equivalence in K-theory, we clarify that the 2D topological invariant remains well defined in the presence of nontrivial 1D invariant, and we develop a general numerical approach for its evaluation, which was hitherto unavailable. Second, under the unit-cell convention, noncentered P T symmetries assume momentum dependence, which violates the presumption in previous methods for computing the topological invariants. We clarify the classifications for this case and formulate the invariants by introducing a twisted Wilson-loop operator for both 1D and 2D. A simple model on a rectangular lattice is constructed to demonstrate our theory, which can be readily realized using artificial crystals.</description>

      <title>Stability of fractional Chern insulators with a non-Landau level continuum limit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.05758v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The stability of fractional Chern insulators is widely believed to be predicted by the resemblance of their single-particle spectra to Landau levels. We investigate the scope of this geometric stability hypothesis by analyzing the stability of a set of fractional Chern insulators that explicitly do not have a Landau level continuum limit. By computing the many-body spectra of Laughlin states in a generalized Hofstadter model, we analyze the relationship between single-particle metrics, such as trace inequality saturation, and many-body metrics, such as the magnitude of the many-body and entanglement gaps. We show numerically that the geometric stability hypothesis holds for Chern bands that are not continuously connected to Landau levels, as well as conventional Chern bands, albeit often requiring larger system sizes to converge for these configurations.</description>

Abstract: We performed molecular dynamics simulations of Zr$_{50}$Cu$_{50}$ metallic glass samples submitted to mechanical deformation at different strain rates. The simultaneous measurements of the stress-strain curve, and of the temperature evolution during the cyclic mechanical load, are used to determine the thermo-mechanical constitutive laws at the continuum scale. It is shown that plastic deformation acts as a heat source, but strong finite size effects affect the unfolding of shear bands and its related dissipation rate. Finally, a thermo-mechanical constitutive law is proposed to reproduce quantitavely self-heating processes at different scales.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07117v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a multi-terminal device consisting of an $s$-wave superconductor coupled to an altermagnet, to generate highly correlated spin currents via Cooper pair splitting. Remarkably, we find that the correlated spin currents are induced by specular Andreev reflections in the altermagnet, an effect that has up to now been predicted to occur only in a very limited number of systems, e.g., Dirac/Weyl materials coupled to superconductors. We demonstrate that positive non-local charge currents and positive noise cross-correlations are unambiguous fingerprints of the specular Andreev reflections in our proposed device.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10347v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a variational wave function to represent quantum skyrmions as bosonic operators. The operator faithfully reproduces two fundamental features of quantum skyrmions: their classical magnetic order and a "quantum cloud" of local spin-flip excitations. Using exact numerical simulations of the ground states of a 2D chiral magnetic model, we find two regions in the single-skyrmion state diagram distinguished by their leading quantum corrections. We use matrix product state simulations of the adiabatic braiding of two skyrmions to verify that the operator representation of skyrmions is valid at large inter-skyrmion distances. Our work demonstrates that skyrmions can be approximately coarse-grained and represented by bosonic quasiparticles, which paves the way toward a field theory of many-skyrmion quantum phases and, unlike other approaches, incorporates the microscopic quantum fluctuations of individual skyrmions.</description>
