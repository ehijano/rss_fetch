      <title>Development Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Throughout mathematics there are constructions where an object is obtained as a limit of an infinite sequence. Typically, the objects in the sequence improve as the sequence progresses, and the ideal is reached at the limit. I introduce a view that understands this as a development process by which a dynamic mathematical object develops teleologically. In particular, this paper elaborates and clarifies the intuition that such constructions operate on a single dynamic object that maintains its identity throughout the process, and that each step consists in a transformation of this dynamic object, rather than in a genesis of an entirely new static object. This view is supported by a general philosophical discussion, and by a formal modal first-order framework of development processes. In order to exhibit the ubiquity of such processes in mathematics, and showcase the advantages of this view, the framework is applied to wide range of examples: The set of real numbers, forcing extensions of models of set theory, non-standard numbers of arithmetic, the reflection theorem schema of set theory, and the revision semantics of truth. Thus, the view proposed promises to yield a unified dynamic ontology for infinitary mathematics.</description>

      <title>A Solovay-like model at $\aleph_\omega$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assuming the consistency of ZFC with appropriate large cardinal axioms we produce a model of ZFC where $\aleph_\omega$ is a strong limit cardinal and the inner model $L(\mathcal{P}(\aleph_\omega))$ satisfies the following properties: (1) Every set $A\subseteq (\aleph_\omega)^\omega$ has the $\aleph_\omega$-PSP. (2) There is no scale at $\aleph_\omega$. (3) The Singular Cardinal Hypothesis (SCH) fails at $\aleph_\omega$. (4) Shelah's Approachability property (AP) fails at $\aleph_\omega$. (5) The Tree Property (TP) holds at $\aleph_{\omega+1}$. The above provides the first example of a Solovay-type model at the level of the first singular cardinal, $\aleph_\omega$. Our model also answers, in the context of ZF+$\mathrm{DC}_{\aleph_\omega}$, a well-known question by Woodin on the relationship between the SCH, the AP and the TP at $\aleph_\omega$.</description>

      <title>Continuous colorings on compact spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study several natural classes of graphs on a zero-dimensional metrizable compact space having no continuous coloring. We compare these graphs with the quasi-order associated with injective continuous homomorphisms. We prove the existence of an antichain basis for these classes. We determine the size of such an antichain basis. We provide a concrete antichain basis when there is a countable one. We also provide some related quasi-orders and equivalence relations which are analytic complete as sets.</description>

      <title>Multi-representation associated to the numbering of a subbasis and formal inclusion relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15861v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit Dieter Spreen's notion of a representation associated to a numbered basis equipped with a strong inclusion relation. We show that by relaxing his requirements, we obtain different classically considered representations as subcases, including representations considered by Grubba, Weihrauch and Schr\"oder. We show that the use of an appropriate strong inclusion relation guarantees that the representation associated to a computable metric space seen as a topological space always coincides with the Cauchy representation. We also show how the use of a formal inclusion relation guarantees that when defining multi-representations on a set and on one of its subsets, the obtained multi-representations will be compatible, i.e. inclusion will be a computable map. The proposed definitions are also more robust under change of equivalent bases.</description>
