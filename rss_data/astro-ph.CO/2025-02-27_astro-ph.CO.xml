      <title>CHEX-MATE: Scaling relations of radio halo profiles for clusters in the LoTSS DR2 area</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The thermal and non-thermal components in galaxy clusters have properties that, although shaped from different physical phenomena, can share some similarities, mainly driven by their halo mass and the accretion processes. Scaling relations have been proven to exist for both components and studied in X-ray (thermal) and radio (non-thermal) bands. At the radio wavelength, such investigations are so far limited to the integrated quantities (e.g. total power and mass). We aimed to investigate the scaling relations between the mass of a galaxy cluster and its radio emission at low frequencies, treating both the integrated and the spatially resolved quantities for a sample of well-selected targets. We crossmatched LoTSS DR2 and CHEX-MATE datasets in order to get the deepest and most homogeneous radio data of a representative sample of objects. We analytically derived the expected relation between the radio power ($P_{\nu}$) and radio surface brightness profile, and performed a comparison with observational results. We obtained that properly accounting for the mass and redshift dependence in the radio profile can reduce the overall scatter by a factor of $\sim 4$, with an evident residual dependence on the cluster dynamical status. We showed that assuming no relation between the halo size ($R_{H}$) and the cluster mass ($M$) allowed us to reconcile the observed radio profile mass scaling and the one predicted starting from the $P_{\nu}-M$ relation. We discuss the implications of a lack of $R_H-M$ relation, assessing possible systematics and biases in the analyses, and interpreting it as a natural consequence of the structure formation process. Finally, we also considered the role of the magnetic field in the $P_{\nu}-M$ relation, putting constraints on its dependence upon the cluster mass and finding consistent results with expectations from our radio power mass scaling.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Substructure or Source Model Systematics? A Case Study of Cluster Lens Abell S1063</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mapping the small-scale structure of the universe through gravitational lensing is a promising tool for probing the particle nature of dark matter. Curved Arc Basis (CAB) has been proposed as a local lensing formalism in galaxy clusters, with the potential to detect low-mass dark matter substructure. In this work, we analyze the cluster lens Abell S1063 in search of dark matter substructure with the CAB formalism, using multi-band imaging data from JWST. We use two different source modeling methods: shapelets and pixel-based source reconstruction based on Delaunay triangulation. We find that source modeling systematics from shapelets result in a disagreement between Curved Arc Basis parameters measured from different filters. Source modeling with Delaunay significantly alleviates this systematic, as seen in the improvement in agreement across filters. We also find that inadequate complexity in source modeling can result in convincing spurious detections of dark matter substructure from strong gravitational lenses, as seen by our $\Delta \text{BIC} &gt; 20$ measurement of a $M \sim 10^{10}$ $M_{\odot}$ subhalo with shapelets, a spurious detection that is not reproduced with Delaunay source modeling. We demonstrate that multi-band analysis with different JWST filters is key for disentangling source and lens model systematics from dark matter substructure detections.</description>

      <title>A Louder Gravitational Wave Bang from a Fast-Expanding Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A strong first-order phase transition in a dark sector may produce all or part of the low-frequency gravitational wave signal recently reported by the NANOGrav Collaboration and other pulsar timing arrays. Here we point out, with a simple toy model, that even if the amplitude of the gravitational wave background from the dark phase transition is insufficient to match the NANOGrav signal, a modified expansion rate at early times may considerably enhance the gravitational wave signal. In particular, a faster-than-standard expansion rate, triggered, for instance, by the presence of one or more additional sources of energy density redshifting with higher powers of temperatures than radiation, boosts upper limits on the gravitational wave signal from first-order cosmological phase transitions, enlarging the slate of possible dark sector scenarios matching the NANOGrav signal.</description>

      <title>The distribution of galaxy rotation in JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: JWST provides a view of the Universe never seen before, and specifically fine details of galaxies in deep space. JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) is a deep field survey, providing unprecedentedly detailed view of galaxies in the early Universe. The field is also in relatively close proximity to the Galactic pole. Analysis of spiral galaxies by their direction of rotation in JADES shows that the number of galaxies in that field that rotate in the opposite direction relative to the Milky Way galaxy is ~50% higher than the number of galaxies that rotate in the same direction relative to the Milky Way. The analysis is done using a computer-aided quantitative method, but the difference is so extreme that it can be noticed and inspected even by the unaided human eye. These observations are in excellent agreement with deep fields taken at around the same footprint by HST and JWST. The reason for the difference may be related to the structure of the early Universe, but it can also be related to the physics of galaxy rotation and the internal structure of galaxies. In that case the observation can provide possible explanations to other puzzling anomalies such as the Ho tension and the observation of massive mature galaxies at very high redshifts.</description>

      <title>Delensing for Precision Cosmology: Optimizing Future CMB B-mode Surveys to Constrain r</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of primordial B-modes, a key probe of cosmic inflation, is increasingly challenged by contamination from weak gravitational lensing B-modes induced by large-scale structure (LSS). We present a delensing pipeline designed to enhance the sensitivity to the inflationary parameter r, minimizing reliance on foreground mitigation during lensing reconstruction. Using simulations of Simons Observatory-like CMB observations and Euclid-like LSS surveys in the Northern hemisphere, we demonstrate that excluding low-l modes (l&lt;200) effectively mitigates foreground biases, enabling robust lensing potential reconstruction using observed CMB polarization maps. We reconstruct the lensing potential with a minimum-variance (MV) quadratic estimator (QE) applied to CMB polarization data and combine this with external LSS tracers to improve delensing efficiency. Two complementary methods, the Gradient-order template and the Inverse-lensing approach, are used to generate lensing B-mode templates, which are cross-correlated with observed B-modes. This achieves a 40 percent reduction in the uncertainty of r with CMB-only reconstruction, improving to 60 percent when incorporating external LSS tracers. We validate our results using both the Hamimeche and Lewis likelihood and a Gaussian approximation, finding consistent constraints on r. Our work establishes a streamlined framework for ground-based CMB experiments, demonstrating that synergies with LSS surveys significantly enhance sensitivity to primordial gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Constraints on the Bouncing Energy Scale of Big Bounce Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Big bounce cosmology provides a solution to the Universe's initial singularity, and stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) searches offer a promising avenue for testing this paradigm. In this work, we establish an analytical relation between the bouncing energy scale, $\rho_{s\downarrow}^{1/4}$, and SGWB spectrum, $\Omega_\mathrm{GW}(f)h^2$, for big bounce cosmology. By combining sensitivities from major GW detectors (e.g., Planck/BICEP, PTA, and LIGO/Virgo across low, medium, and high frequencies, respectively), we provide the first systematic GW constraint on $\rho_{s\downarrow}^{1/4}$. Our results show that the region $-\tfrac{1}{3} &lt; w_1 &lt; -0.17$ is excluded by current SGWB searches, given the constraint $\rho_{s\downarrow}^{1/4} &gt; 1~\mathrm{TeV}$, where $w_1$ is the contraction-phase equation of state parameter. Additionally, no detectable SGWB can be generated for $0.038 &lt; w_1 &lt; \infty$ with $\rho_{s\downarrow}^{1/4} &lt; 10^{16}~\mathrm{TeV}$. We identify a window, $-0.17 &lt; w_1 &lt; 0.038$, in which a detectable SGWB can be produced, disfavoring nearly all big bounce models except for the matter-dominated contraction model ($w_1 \simeq 0$).</description>

      <title>New insights on a sign-switching $\Lambda$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proposal for a sudden sign-switching cosmological constant $\Lambda$ in the local universe, emulating a phase transition from anti-de Sitter (AdS) to de Sitter (dS) space, has markedly revamped the fit to observational data and lays out a propitious framework for ameliorating major cosmological tensions, such as the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions. This proposal is widely known as $\Lambda_s$CDM. We investigate the possibility that $\Lambda$ does not only flip sign at the transition but has also different curvature radii in the AdS and dS phases. We show that the critical redshift of the transition $z_c$ is strongly correlated with the vacuum energy in the AdS phase $\Omega_{\Lambda_-}$, and that these two variables do not correlate strongly with the other cosmological parameters. We also show that the cost of adding an additional parameter to the $\Lambda_s$CDM cosmological model does not improve the goodness of fit. Armed with our findings, we demonstrate that for a proper choice of $z_c$, the vacuum energy in the dS phase may not necessarily be $-\Omega_{\Lambda_-}$, for comparable degree of conformity between the model prediction and experimental data.</description>

      <title>Limits and challenges of the detection of cluster-scale diffuse radio emission at high redshift: The Massive and Distant Clusters of WISE Survey (MaDCoWS) in LoTSS-DR2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffuse radio emission in galaxy clusters is a tracer of ultra-relativistic particles and $\mu$G-level magnetic fields, and is thought to be triggered by cluster merger events. In the distant Universe (i.e. $z&gt;0.6$), such sources have been observed only in a handful of systems, and their study is important to understand the evolution of large-scale magnetic fields over the cosmic time. Previous studies of nine {\it Planck} clusters up to $z\sim0.9$ suggest a fast amplification of cluster-scale magnetic fields, at least up to half of the current Universe's age, and steep spectrum cluster scale emission, in line with particle re-acceleration due to turbulence. In this paper, we investigate the presence of diffuse radio emission in a larger sample of galaxy clusters reaching even higher redshifts (i.e. $z\gtrsim1$). We selected clusters from the Massive and Distant Clusters of {\it WISE} Survey (MaDCoWS) with richness $\lambda_{15}&gt;40$ covering the area of the second data release of the LOFAR Two-Meter Sky Survey (LoTSS-DR2) at 144 MHz. These selected clusters are in the redshift range $0.78-1.53$ (with a median value of 1.05). We detect the possible presence of diffuse radio emission, with the largest linear sizes of $350-500$ kpc, in 5 out of the 56 clusters in our sample. If this diffuse radio emission is due to a radio halo, these radio sources lie on or above the scatter of the $P_\nu-M_{500}$ radio halo correlations (at 150 MHz and 1.4 GHz) found at $z&lt;0.6$, depending on the mass assumed. We also find that these radio sources are at the limit of the detection by LoTSS, and therefore deeper observations will be important for future studies.</description>

      <title>Cosmological implications of Tracker scalar fields as dynamical dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The preference for dynamical dark energy over the standard $\Lambda$CDM model has gained attention in recent cosmological studies, particularly with results from the DESI experiment. We investigate this claim by analysing tracker scalar field models, which can alleviate the cosmic coincidence problem and transition to a cosmological constant-like behaviour at late times. Focusing on the inverse axionlike and inverse steep exponential potentials, we study their background evolution and perturbations, finding a mild suppression in the matter power spectrum compared to $\Lambda$CDM but no distinguishing features in the bispectrum. Using a combined dataset of ${\rm CMB}+{\rm BAO}+{\rm Pantheon~Plus}+{\rm Hubble\; parameter}+{\rm RSD}$, we perform a statistical comparison based on the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). Our results indicate that standard $\Lambda$CDM model remains the most favoured model. While the inverse axionlike model is preferred over the inverse steep exponential model in terms of statistical evidence, neither provides compelling support for dynamical dark energy over the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm.</description>

      <title>An emulation-based model for the projected correlation function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data from the ongoing \textit{Euclid} survey will map out billions of galaxies in the Universe, covering more than a third of the sky. This data will provide a wealth of information about the large-scale structure (LSS) of the Universe and will have a significant impact on cosmology in the coming years. In this paper, we introduce an emulator-based halo model approach to forward model the relationship between cosmological parameters and the projected galaxy-galaxy two-point correlation function (2PCF). Utilizing the large \textsc{AbacusSummit} simulation suite, we emulate the 2PCF by generating mock-galaxy catalogues within the Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) framework. Our emulator is designed to predict the 2PCF over scales $0.1 \leq r / (h^{-1}\text{Mpc}) \leq 105$, from which we derive the projected correlation function, independent of redshift space distortions. We demonstrate that the emulator accurately predicts the projected correlation function over scales $0.5 \leq r_\perp/(h^{-1}\text{Mpc}) \leq 40$, given a set of cosmological and HOD parameters. This model is then employed in a parameter inference analysis, showcasing its ability to constrain cosmological parameters. Our findings indicate that while the projected correlation function places weak constraints on several cosmological parameters due to its intrinsic lack of information, additional clustering statistics are necessary to better probe the underlying cosmology. Despite the simplified covariance matrix used in the likelihood model, the posterior distributions of several cosmological parameters remain broad, underscoring the need for a more comprehensive approach.</description>

      <title>The End of Easy Phenomenology for CMB Experiments: A Case Study in the Dark Sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The precision of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) experiments, specifically its lensing reconstruction, has reached the limit where non-linear corrections cannot be ignored. Neglecting these corrections results in biased constraints on cosmological parameters. In this work, we use lensing data from Planck and the South Pole Telescope third generation camera (SPT-3G) taken in 2018 to highlight the impact of these biases in two ways. First, we estimate the shifts due to ignoring non-linear corrections in $\Lambda$CDM. We find 0.2-0.6$\sigma$ shifts in the Dark Matter (DM) fraction, the Hubble constant, and the amplitude of matter fluctuations at $8 h^{-1}$ Mpc. Second, we estimate the loss in constraining power for not including data sensitive to non-linear corrections. As a case study, we consider two interacting DM models, for which such corrections are not readily available in existing CMB Boltzmann codes. The first one is DM interacting with baryons, while the second is DM interacting with Dark Radiation (DR). For the former case, when we add primary CMB data from SPT-3G 2018 observations, we find that constraints on model parameters improve by 10-20% compared to previous studies. However, we forecast a further 50% improvement on these constraints if one could include current or upcoming SPT-3G lensing data. For the case of DM interacting with DR, no meaningful constraints on the model parameters are found without including information from CMB lensing. We also highlight that the codes used to calculate non-linear corrections in $\Lambda$CDM, specifically HaloFit and HMCode, provide unstable results when improperly used for these extended models. These outcomes constitute a reason for caution if using CMB lensing data when constraining such models, as well as a motivation for estimating their non-linear corrections.</description>

      <title>Radiative Transfer Simulations of Ly$\alpha$ Intensity Mapping During Cosmic Reionization Including Sources from Galaxies and the Intergalactic Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present new simulations of Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) intensity maps that include Ly$\alpha$ radiative transfer in the intergalactic medium (IGM) and all significant sources of Ly$\alpha$ photons. The sources considered include Ly$\alpha$ directly from galaxies, cooling at the edges of ionized bubbles, recombinations within these bubbles, and reprocessing of galaxy continuum emission in the IGM. We also vary astrophysical parameters including the average neutral fraction of the IGM, the dust absorption of Ly$\alpha$ in galaxies, and the ionizing escape fraction. Previous work has suggested that Ly$\alpha$ intensity mapping can be used to constrain the neutral fraction of the IGM when accounting for radiative transfer in the IGM. When radiative transfer is ignored, direct Ly$\alpha$ emission from galaxies has the highest amplitude of power on all scales. When we include radiative transfer in our simulations, we find continuum emission reprocessed as Ly$\alpha$ is comparable to the Ly$\alpha$ emission directly from galaxies. For high neutral fraction in the IGM, emission from recombinations is comparable to galaxies on large scales. We find that the slope of the power spectrum is sensitive to the neutral fraction of the IGM when radiative transfer is included, suggesting that this may be useful for placing constraints on cosmic reionization. In addition, we find the power of galaxies is decreased across all scales due to dust absorption. We also find the escape fraction must be large for recombinations and bubble edges to contribute significantly to the power. We find the cross power is observable between SPHEREx and a hypothetical galaxy survey with a total signal-to-noise of 4 from $k = 0.035$ Mpc$^{-1}$ to $k = 1$ Mpc$^{-1}$.</description>

Abstract: The geometric distances of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are challenging to measure because of their exceptionally compact structure yet vast cosmic distances. A combination of spectroastrometry and reverberation mapping (SARM) of broad-line regions (BLRs) constitutes a novel means to probe the geometric distance of AGNs, which has recently become practically feasible owing to successful interferometric observations with VLTI/GRAVITY. Here, we perform SARM analysis of four nearby quasars: Mrk 509, PDS 456, 3C 273, and NGC 3783. Results for the former two are reported for the first time and the latter two are revisited using our improved BLR dynamical modeling that includes the radial-dependent responsivity of BLRs. This allows us to self-consistently account for the emissivity weighting of the BLR in spectroastrometry and responsivity weighting in reverberation mapping. We obtain angular-diameter distances of the four quasars, from which we derive a Hubble constant of $H_0=69_{-10}^{+12}\,\rm km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}$. Although this consititutes a large uncertainty for a measurement of $H_0$, it is anticipated that the precision will improve to a competitive level once a greater number of AGNs are accessible following the upgrade of GRAVITY in the near future. From SARM analysis, the black hole masses of the four quasars are also measured with the statistical uncertainty ranging from 0.06 to 0.23 dex, consistent with the correlations between black hole masses and properties of the host bulges.</description>

      <title>The size of the continuum emission region and its scaling relations with active galactic nucleus luminosity and the broad-line region size</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a continuum lag analysis for a sample of 37 relatively high-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGNs) from the Seoul National University AGN Monitoring Project (SAMP), utilizing the light curve data in $B$ and $V$ bands from SAMP and in $g,r,i$ bands from the Zwicky Transient Facility. We find that the inter-band lags ($\tau$) increase with wavelength (i.e., $\tau \propto \lambda^{\sim 4/3}$) as prescribed by the standard disk model (SSD), suggesting consistency with the "lamp-post" reprocessing model. We report that the size of the continuum emitting region (CER) normalized at 2500 {\AA} ($R_{2500}$) is a factor of $\sim$5 (i.e, $0.69\pm0.04$ dex) larger than predicted by SSD. By combining our new measurements with the re-measurements of the literature sample, we report a correlation between $R_{2500}$ and AGN continuum luminosity as $R_{2500} \, \propto \, L_{5100}^{0.58\pm0.03}$, which suggests that the observed continuum could be composed of both the disk emission and the diffuse emission from the broad line region (BLR). The size of CER shows a tight relation with the size of H$\beta$ BLR with a sublinear slope (i.e., $R_{\text{BLR}} \, \propto \, R_{\text{2500}}^{0.87\pm0.07}$) and a scatter of 0.29 dex. This empirical relation offers a promising method for estimating single-epoch black hole masses, once established over a large dynamic range of AGN luminosity.</description>

      <title>A strike of luck: could the KM3-230213A event be caused by an evaporating primordial black hole?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate whether the ultra high energy neutrino inferred by the recent KM3NeT observation could have originated from an evaporating black hole. Given the characteristics of black hole (BH) evaporation mechanism, any object capable of producing particles in the energy range of the detected event (around 100-800 PeV) must have a mass below 10^7 g. No known astrophysical mechanism can generate black holes of such low mass, leaving primordial black holes (PBHs)-potentially formed at the end of cosmic inflation-as the only viable candidates. Black holes with masses below 10^7 g have lifetimes shorter than 10^-5 seconds, meaning PBHs in this mass range should have fully evaporated by now. However, recent studies suggest that quantum effects, collectively referred to as the "memory burden", may slow down black hole evaporation, potentially extending the lifetimes of low-mass PBHs to timescales comparable to or exceeding the Hubble time. We systematically explore the parameter space of memory-burdened PBHs, assuming that they constitute a fraction of the dark matter (f-PBH) within current constraints, and identify viable regions that could explain the KM3-230213A event. We further predict the occurrence rate of similar events and find that KM3NeT's current configuration could test this scenario within a few years.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Magnetic Fields from Ultralight Dark Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a mechanism for the generation of magnetic fields on cosmological scales that is operative after recombination. An essential ingredient is an instability (of parametric resonance type) of the electromagnetic field driven by an oscillating pseudo-scalar dark matter field, $\phi$, that is coupled to the electromagnetic field tensor via a $\phi F \wedge F$ term in the Lagrangian of axion-electrodynamics. We find that magnetic fields larger than the observational lower bounds can be generated soon after recombination on scales of $1 {\rm{Mpc}}$.</description>

      <title>On a critical acceleration scale of dark matter in Lambda-CDM and dynamical dark energy</title>

Abstract: Universal acceleration $a_0$ emerges in various empirical laws, yet its fundamental nature remains unclear. Using Illustris and Virgo N-body simulations, we propose $a_0$ is the scale of acceleration fluctuations in collisionless dark matter involving long-range gravity. In contrast, in the kinetic theory of gases, molecules undergo random elastic collisions involving short-range interactions, where only velocity fluctuations are relevant. We identify the redshift evolution $a_0\propto (1+z)^{3/4}$ that is in good agreement with Magneticum and EAGLE simulations and in reasonable agreement with limited observations. This suggests a larger $a_0$ at a higher redshift such that galaxies of fixed baryonic mass rotate faster at a higher redshift. The velocity fluctuations involve a critical velocity $u_c\propto (1+z)^{-3/4}$. The acceleration fluctuations involve a critical acceleration $a_c\propto (1+z)^{3/4}$. Two critical quantities are related by the rate of energy cascade $\varepsilon_{u}\approx -{a_c u_c/[2(3\pi)^2]}$, where factor $3\pi$ is from the angle of incidence and $\varepsilon_u\approx -10^{-7}$m$^2$/s$^3$. With critical velocity $u_c$ on the order of 300 km/s at $z=0$, the critical acceleration is determined to be $a_{c0}\equiv a_c(z=0) \approx 10^{-10}$m/s$^2$, suggesting $a_c$ might explain the universal acceleration $a_0\approx 10^{-10}$m/s$^2$ in the empirical Tully-Fisher relation or modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND). Note that dark energy (DE) density $\rho_{DE0}\approx {a_{c0}^{2}/G}=10^{-10}$J/m$^3$, we postulate an entropic origin of the dark energy from acceleration fluctuations of dark matter, in analogy to the gas pressure from velocity fluctuations. This leads to a dynamical dark energy coupled to the structure evolution involving a relatively constant DE density followed by a slow weakening phase, suggesting possible deviations from the standard $\Lambda$CDM.</description>

      <title>SASHIMI-SIDM: Semi-analytical subhalo modelling for self-interacting dark matter at sub-galactic scales</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16633v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We combine the semi-analytical structure formation model, SASHIMI, which predicts subhalo populations in collisionless, cold dark matter (CDM), with a parametric model that maps CDM halos to self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) halos. The resulting model, SASHIMI-SIDM, generates SIDM subhalo populations down to sub-galactic mass scales, for an arbitrary input cross section, in minutes. We show that SASHIMI-SIDM agrees with SIDM subhalo populations from high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations in resolved regimes. Crucially, we predict that the fraction of core-collapsed subhalos peaks at a mass scale determined by the input SIDM cross section and decreases toward higher halo masses, consistent with the predictions of gravothermal models and cosmological simulations. For the first time, we also show that the core-collapsed fraction decreases toward lower halo masses. While the dependence of the collapse time on mass and concentration implies such behaviour, our semi-analytical approach allows us to quantify and illustrate this trend clearly across the full mass spectrum of subhalos, including for subhalo masses below the resolution limit of any current cosmological SIDM simulation. As a proof of principle, we apply SASHIMI-SIDM to predict the boost to the local dark matter density and annihilation rate from core-collapsed SIDM subhalos, which can be enhanced relative to CDM by an order of magnitude for viable SIDM models. Thus, SASHIMI-SIDM provides an efficient and reliable tool for scanning SIDM parameter space and testing it with astrophysical observations.

Abstract: We perform fits to DESI, CMB and supernova data to understand the physical origin of the DESI hint for dynamical dark energy. We find that the linear parametrization of the equation of state $w$ may guide to misleading interpretations, such as the hint for a phantom Universe, which are not preferred by the data. Instead, physical quintessence models fit the data well. Model-independently, present observations prefer deviations from the constant dark energy, $w=-1$, only at very low redshifts, $z &lt; \mathcal{O}(0.1)$. We find that this result is driven by low-$z$ supernova data. Therefore, either the fundamental properties of our Universe, characterised by the equation of state $w$ and the Hubble parameter $H$, underwent dramatic changes very recently or, alternatively, we do not fully understand the systematics of our local Universe in a radius of about $300\,h^{-1}\rm Mpc$.</description>

      <title>Induced Gravitational Waves probing Primordial Black Hole Dark Matter with Memory Burden</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06365v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum evaporation of a black hole is conventionally studied semiclassically by assuming self-similarity of the black hole throughout the evaporation process. However, its validity was recently questioned, and the lifetime of a black hole is conjectured to be much extended by the memory burden effect. It gives rise to the possibility that the primordial black holes (PBHs) lighter than $10^{10}$ grams are the dark matter in the Universe. To probe such PBH dark matter, we study gravitational waves (GWs) induced by primordial curvature perturbations that produced the PBHs. We find $\Omega_\text{GW}(f_\text{peak})h^2 = 7 \times 10^{-9}$ with the peak frequency $f_\text{peak} = 1\times 10^{3} \, (M_\text{PBH}/(10^{10}\,\mathrm{g}))^{-1/2}\, \mathrm{Hz}$, and the induced GWs associated with the PBH dark matter whose initial mass is greater than about $10^7$ grams can be tested by future observations such as Cosmic Explorer. Furthermore, the scenario can be in principle confirmed by detecting another GW signal from the mergers of PBHs, which leads to high-frequency GWs with $f_\text{peak} = 2 \times 10^{27}\, (M_\text{PBH, ini}/(10^{10}\, \mathrm{g}))^{-1} \, \mathrm{Hz} $. On the other hand, the induced GW signals stronger than expected would contradict the dark matter abundance and exclude the memory burden effect.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02591v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) from the early Universe that can contribute to dark matter (DM) abundance have been linked to gravitational wave observations. Super-massive black holes (SMBHs) at the centers of galaxies are expected to modify distribution of DM in their vicinity, and can result in highly concentrated DM spikes. We revisit PBH merger rates in the presence of DM spikes, tracking their history. We find novel peaked structure in the redshift-evolution of PBH merger rates at low redshifts around $z \sim 5$. These effects are generic and are present for distinct PBH mass functions and spike profiles, and also can be linked to peaked structure in redshift evolution of star formation rate. Redshift evolution characteristics of PBH merger rates can be distinguished from astrophysical black hole contributions and observable with gravitational waves, enabling them to serve as probes of DM in galactic centers.</description>

Abstract: Weak gravitational lensing (WL) convergence peaks contain valuable cosmological information in the regime of non-linear collapse. Using the FLAMINGO suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, we study the physical origin and redshift distributions of the objects generating WL peaks selected from a WL convergence map mimicking a $\textit{Euclid}$ signal. We match peaks to individual haloes and show that the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR$~&gt;~5$) WL peaks measured by Stage IV WL surveys primarily trace $M_{\mathrm{200c}} &gt; 10^{14}~\mathrm{M_\odot}$ haloes. We find that the WL peak sample can compete with the purity and completeness of state-of-the-art X-ray and Sunyaev-Zel'dovich cluster abundance inferences. By comparing the distributions predicted by simulation variations that have been calibrated to the observed gas fractions of local clusters and the present-day galaxy stellar mass function, or shifted versions of these, we illustrate that the shape of the redshift distribution of SNR$~&gt;~5$ peaks is insensitive to baryonic physics while it does change with cosmology. The difference highlights the potential of using WL peaks to constrain cosmology. As the WL convergence and redshift number densities of WL peaks scale differently with cosmology and baryonic feedback, WL peak statistics can simultaneously calibrate baryonic feedback and constrain cosmology.</description>

      <title>Reassessing the Cepheid-based distance ladder: implications for the Hubble constant</title>

Abstract: The Hubble constant ($H_0$) is a key parameter in cosmology, yet its precise value remains contentious due to discrepancies between early- and late-universe measurement methods, a problem known as the "Hubble tension." In this study, we revisit the Cepheid-based distance ladder calibration, focusing on two potential sources of bias in the period-luminosity relation (PLR): (1) the assumed prior for the residual parallax offset of the Milky Way (MW) Cepheids and (2) systematic differences between Cepheid periods in anchor galaxies versus supernova host galaxies. To address the latter, we adopt two different strategies alongside a renewed MW Cepheid calibration. The first strategy involves resampling anchor and host Cepheids from a common distribution of periods. This approach provides a conservative estimate of $H_0 = (72.18 \pm 1.76) \, \mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$, including the renewed MW analysis. The increased uncertainty reflects the reduced sample size -- about 700 Cepheids per resampling compared to 3200 in the original dataset. This method reduces the Hubble tension from $5.4 \, \sigma$ (as reported by the SH0ES collaboration with $H_0 = (73.17 \pm 0.86) \, \mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$) to $2.4 \, \sigma$. The second strategy allows the PLR slope to vary with the period, yielding $H_0 = (72.35 \pm 0.91) \, \mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$, including the renewed MW analysis, and the tension reduced to $4.4 \, \sigma$. A statistical comparison of the model with the single-linear PLR shows a significant preference for the broken PLR (p-value $&lt; 0.001$). Both strategies consistently indicate a downward shift of approximately $-1 \, \mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$ in $H_0$. Our findings underscore the importance of careful consideration of Cepheid population characteristics for precise $H_0$ calibrations.</description>

      <title>Is cosmological data suggesting a nonminimal coupling between matter and gravity?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09348v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Theoretical predictions from a modified theory of gravity with a nonminimal coupling between matter and curvature are compared to data from recent cosmological surveys. We use type Ia supernovae data from the Pantheon+ sample and the recent 5-year Dark Energy Survey (DES) data release along with baryon acoustic oscillation measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) to constrain the modified model's parameters and to compare its fit quality to the Flat-$\Lambda$CDM model. We find moderate to strong evidence for a preference of the nonminimally coupled theory over the current standard model for all dataset combinations. Although the modified model is shown to be capable of matching early-time observations from the cosmic microwave background and late-time supernovae data, we find that there is still some incoherence with respect to the conclusions drawn from baryon acoustic oscillation observations.</description>

Abstract: Both particle physics experiments and cosmological observations have been used to explore neutrino properties. Cosmological researches of neutrinos often rely on the early-universe cosmic microwave background observations or other late-universe probes, which mostly focus on large-scale structures. We introduce a distinct probe, the 21-cm forest, that differs from other probes in both time and scale. Actually, the 21-cm forest is a unique tool for studying small-scale structures in the early universe. Below the free-streaming scale, massive neutrinos suppress the matter power spectrum, influencing small-scale fluctuations in the distribution of matter. The one-dimensional (1D) power spectrum of the 21-cm forest can track these fluctuations across different scales, similar to the matter power spectrum, providing an effective method to constrain neutrino mass. Although heating effects in the early universe can also impact the 1D power spectrum of the 21-cm forest, we assess the potential of the 21-cm forest as a tool for measuring neutrino mass, given that the temperature of the intergalactic medium can be constrained using other methods within a certain range. In the ideal scenario, the 21-cm forest observation will have the ability to constrain the total neutrino mass to around 0.1 eV. With the accumulation of observational data and advancements in observational technology, the 21-cm forest holds great promise as an emerging and potent tool for measuring neutrino mass.</description>

      <title>A Sizable Discrepancy in Ground-Based JAGB Distances to Nearby Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07882v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, Freedman et al. (2024) report agreement of distances derived from the Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB) and the J-Region Asymptotic Giant Branch (JAGB) at the 1$\%$ level for both nearby galaxies with ground-based imaging (0.5-4 Mpc) as well distant galaxies with JWST imaging (7-23 Mpc). Here we compare the same ground-based JAGB distances to uniformly reduced space-based optical TRGB distances from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). We uncover a significant offset between these two distance scales of $\Delta\mu$ = 0.17 $\pm$ 0.04 (stat) $\pm$ 0.06 (sys) mag (9$\%$ in distance), with the HST TRGB distances being further. Inspections of the HST color-magnitude diagrams make a compelling case that the issue lies in the underlying JAGB distances. The source of the disagreement may lie with the lower resolution or photometric calibration of the ground-based near-infrared data, a contrast to the general agreement found between JWST JAGB and other space-based, second-rung distance indicators (Cepheids, Miras, TRGB) presented within Riess et al. (2024). High-resolution, near-infrared observations from an ongoing HST program will enable the simultaneous measurement of Cepheid, JAGB, and TRGB distances in four of these nearby galaxies and allow us to investigate whether the discrepancy noted here is due to ground-based observational systematics, or something intrinsic to the JAGB method relevant for this particular sample. A resolution of this discrepancy is required if the JAGB is to be used to determine a highly precise local value of the Hubble constant.</description>

      <title>Cosmological information content of Betti curves and $k$-nearest neighbor distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09709v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compare the cosmological constraints that can be obtained from halo clustering on non-linear scales ($2 h^{-1}$ Mpc &lt; $r$ &lt; $50 h^{-1}$ Mpc) using Betti curves, a topological summary statistic, and $k$-th nearest neighbor ($k$NN) distributions. We quantify the information content of each summary statistic through Fisher matrices computed from the Quijote simulations. Due to the use of simulation-based Fisher forecasts, we pay careful attention to the convergence of the Fisher matrices by looking at their eigendecompositions. We find that, in general, only two directions in the parameter space have constraints that are well converged given the number of Quijote simulations available. We then compare the information content of each summary statistic in the reduced parameter space $\{\Omega_m, \sigma_8\}$. We find that almost all of the information present in the Betti curves comes from the first two, $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$, which track the number of connected components and one-dimensional loops respectively, and almost no constraining power comes from $\beta_2$ which tracks the number of topological voids. In comparison, we find that the $k$NNs provide very competitive constraints along with several potential advantages in regards to real data. Finally, we find that while the $k$NNs and Betti curves provide some complementary constraints, they are not fully independent, potentially indicating a connection between the two statistics.</description>

      <title>Dissipative Dark Substructure: The Consequences of Atomic Dark Matter on Milky Way Analog Subhalos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02148v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using cosmological hydrodynamical zoom-in simulations, we explore the properties of subhalos in Milky Way analogs that contain a sub-component of Atomic Dark Matter (ADM). ADM differs from Cold Dark Matter (CDM) due to the presence of self interactions that lead to energy dissipation and bound-state formation, analogous to Standard Model baryons. This model can arise in complex dark sectors that are natural and theoretically-motivated extensions to the Standard Model. The simulations used in this work were carried out using GIZMO and utilize the FIRE-2 galaxy formation physics in the Standard Model baryonic sector. For the parameter points we consider, the ADM gas cools efficiently, allowing it to collapse to the center of subhalos. This increases a subhalo's central density and affects its orbit, with more subhalos surviving small pericentric passages. The subset of subhalos that host visible satellite galaxies have cuspier density profiles and smaller stellar-half-mass radii relative to CDM. The entire population of dwarf galaxies produced in the ADM simulations is much more compact than those seen in CDM simulations, unable to reproduce the entire diversity of observed dwarf galaxy structures. Additionally, we also identify a population of highly compact subhalos that consist nearly entirely of ADM and form in the central region of the host, where they can leave distinctive imprints in the baryonic disk. This work presents the first detailed exploration of subhalo properties in a strongly dissipative dark matter scenario, providing intuition for how other regions of ADM parameter space, as well as other dark sector models, would impact galactic-scale observables.</description>

      <title>Studies of the Inhomogeneous Cosmology in Higher Dimensional space-time with a Cosmological Constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15114v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have studied the inhomogeneous cosmology in Kaluza-Klein spacetime with a positive cosmological constant in a dust dominated era ($p = 0$). Depending on the integration constant we have derived two types of solutions. The dimensional reduction of extra dimensional scale factor is possible due to inhomogeneity depending on the curvature of the metric for positive cosmological constant for all solutions. The high value of entropy in present observable universe and the possible matter leakage in $4D$ world due to reduction of extra dimension are also discussed. Our solutions show the early deceleration and late accelerating nature of the universe. Findings are verified by the wellknown Raychaudhuri equation.</description>

      <title>Searching for heavy millicharged particles from the atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01668v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: If millicharged particles (MCPs) exist they can be created in the atmosphere when high energy cosmic rays collide with nuclei and could subsequently be detected at neutrino experiments. We extend previous work, which considered MCPs from decays of light mesons and proton bremsstrahlung, by including production from $\Upsilon$ meson decays and the Drell-Yan process. MCPs with masses below a GeV primarily arise from proton bremsstrahlung, while heavier MCPs predominantly originate from heavy meson decays and Drell-Yan. We analyse the resulting single scatter and multiple scatter signals at SuperK and JUNO. Searches for low energy coincident signals at JUNO will be sensitive to MCPs with milli-charges up to an order of magnitude beyond current constraints for MCP masses between 2 GeV and 10 GeV.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Search for Galaxies with Extended Emission Line and Potential Outflows in JADES Medium-Band Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11464v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For the first time, we present a systematic search for galaxies with extended emission line and potential outflow features using \textit{JWST} medium-band images in the GOODS-S field. This is done by comparing the morphology in medium-band images to adjacent continuum and UV bands. We look for galaxies that have a maximum extent 50\% larger, an excess area 30\% greater, or an axis ratio difference of more than 0.3 in the medium band compared to the reference bands. After visual inspection, we find 326 candidate galaxies at $1.4 &lt; z &lt; 8.4$, with a peak in the population near cosmic noon, benefiting from the good coverage of the medium-band filters. By fitting their SEDs, we find that the candidate galaxies are at least 20\% more bursty in their star-forming activity and have 50\% more young stellar populations compared to a control sample selected based on the continuum band flux. Additionally, these candidates exhibit a significantly higher production rate of ionizing photons. We further find that candidates hosting known AGN produce extended emission that is more anisotropic compared to non-AGN candidates. A few of our candidates have been spectroscopically confirmed to have prominent outflow signatures through NIRSpec observations, showcasing the robustness of the photometric selection. Future spectroscopic follow-up will better help verify and characterize the kinematics and chemical properties of these systems.</description>

      <title>Testing leptogenesis and dark matter production during reheating with primordial gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19048v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the generation of baryon asymmetry as well as dark matter (DM) in an extended reheating period after the end of slow-roll inflation. Within the regime of perturbative reheating, we consider different monomial potential of the inflaton field during reheating era. The inflaton condensate reheats the Universe by decaying into the Standard Model (SM) bath either via fermionic or bosonic decay modes. Assuming the leptogenesis route to baryogenesis in a canonical seesaw framework, we consider both the radiation bath and perturbative inflaton decay to produce such RHNs during the period of reheating when the maximum temperature of the SM bath is well above the reheating temperature. The DM, assumed to be a SM gauge singlet field, also gets produced from the bath during the reheating period via UV freeze-in. In addition to obtaining different parameter space for such non-thermal leptogenesis and DM for both bosonic and fermionic reheating modes and the type of monomial potential, we discuss the possibility of probing such scenarios via spectral shape of primordial gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Numerical analysis of melting domain walls and their gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21971v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study domain walls (DWs) arising in field theories where $Z_2$-symmetry is spontaneously broken by a scalar expectation value decreasing proportionally to the Universe temperature. The energy density of such melting DWs redshifts sufficiently fast not to overclose the Universe. For the first time, evolution of melting DWs and the resulting gravitational waves (GWs) is investigated numerically using lattice simulations. We show that formation of closed melting DWs during radiation domination is much more efficient compared to the scenario with constant tension DWs. This suggests that it can be the main mechanism responsible for reaching the scaling regime similarly to the case of cosmic strings. However, the scaling behaviour of melting DWs is observed, provided only that the initial scalar field fluctuations are not very large. Otherwise, simulations reveal violation of the scaling law, potentially of the non-physical origin. The spectrum of GWs emitted by melting DWs is also significantly different from that of constant tension DWs. Whether the system has reached scaling or not, the numerical study reveals a GW spectrum described in the infrared by the spectral index $n \approx 1.6$ followed by the causality tail. We attribute the difference from the value $n=2$ predicted in our previous studies to a finite lifetime of the DW network. Notably, the updated index is still in excellent agreement with the recent findings by pulsar timing arrays, which confirms that melting DWs can be responsible for the observed (GW) signal. We also point out that results for evolution of melting DWs in the radiation-dominated Universe are applicable to constant tension DW evolution in the flat spacetime.</description>

      <title>Repeated pattern of $\gamma$-ray flares in the blazar PKS 1502+106 coincident with the IC190730A neutrino event</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15640v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been demonstrated that at least 10 percent of the brightest blazars in the fourth Fermi-LAT catalog of $\gamma$-ray sources exhibit repeating patterns of $\gamma$-ray flares. These events may be associated with the presence of a non-uniform sheath surrounding a fast jet spine in some blazars. Theoretical models suggest that such a sheath could facilitate neutrino production in these structured jets. We aim to test the marginal statistical evidence previously reported for a connection between repeating patterns of $\gamma$-ray flares in blazars and high-energy neutrino events that are positionally consistent with these sources. We identified a repeating pattern of flares in the $\gamma$-ray light curve of the blazar PKS 1502+106, which lies within the 50\% uncertainty region of the IC190730A neutrino candidate event. This occurrence is combined with two other high-energy ($\ge 200$ TeV) neutrino events from ICECAT-1, which arrived in both positional and temporal coincidence with two blazars exhibiting ongoing repeating flare patterns. We conducted a Monte Carlo simulation to evaluate the likelihood of accidental coincidences between the repeating flare patterns and neutrino events, accounting for potential unrecognized systematic uncertainties in the arrival directions of the ICECAT-1 events. Our findings indicate the probability of a random coincidence, in both time and arrival direction for three high-energy neutrino candidates and three blazars with ongoing recurring patterns of $\gamma$-ray flares, is $1.56\times 10^{-3}$ ($3.2\sigma$).</description>

      <title>$f(R)$ Gravity: Gravitational Waves Tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17519v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This review explores modified theories of gravity, particularly $f(R)$ gravity, as extensions to General Relativity (GR) that offer alternatives to dark energy for explaining cosmic acceleration. These models generalize the Einstein-Hilbert action to include functions of the Ricci scalar, providing new insights into cosmology and astrophysics. The detection of gravitational waves (GWs) has enabled rigorous tests of $f(R)$ gravity, as deviations in GW propagation, speed, and polarization can signal modifications to GR. Constraints on $f(R)$ models arise from LIGO-Virgo observations of binary mergers, the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB), and complementary tests in cosmology and weak-field regimes. Future GW detectors, such as LISA and the Einstein Telescope, will enhance sensitivity to smaller deviations from GR, necessitating advancements in theoretical modeling. Among competing theories -- including scalar-tensor, massive gravity, and Horndeski models -- $f(R)$ gravity remains a pivotal framework for understanding fundamental gravitational physics and cosmology. This review highlights key developments, challenges, and future directions in the field.</description>
