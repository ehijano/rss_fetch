      <title>Understanding Modal Interactions in Non-classically Damped Linear Oscillators with Closely Spaced Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work addresses non-classically damped coupled oscillators with closely spaced modes focusing on the physics of modal interactions. Considering the simplest representative example in the form of an impulsively excited two-degree-of-freedom (two-DOF) system, we show that there is a single parameter defined as a coupling versus damping non-proportionality ratio, that separates two different dynamical regimes. Based on complexification-averaging analysis, we show that, below the critical value of this parameter, the system response possesses two distinct dissipation rates but only one frequency of oscillation; as a result, energy is slowly exchanged between modes in a single beat phenomenon. However, above the critical parameter value, the response has a single dissipation rate but two distinct oscillation frequencies; this yields an infinity of beat phenomena as energy is interchanged at a faster rate between modes. Our analytical predictions are fully validated by experimental measurements. Our findings highlight the physics of modal interactions in coupled oscillators and provide a framework for system identification and reduced-order modeling of systems with closely spaced modes.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetics of deeply subwavelength metamaterial particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article discusses electromagnetic properties of volumetric metamaterial samples with essentially discrete structure, that is, assembled as a periodic array of electromagnetic resonators. We develop an efficient numerical procedure for calculating quasi-static electromagnetic response precisely to analyse samples containing several million meta-atoms. We demonstrate that, contrary to a common belief, even million-``atoms'' samples with sharp edges are still quite different from uniform (``homogenised'') materials, and their properties are critically sensitive to their shape and boundary structure. We also compare our results with calculations based on the discrete dipole approximation as well as with an integral model for continuous particles, and analyse distinctions and similarities between the different approaches. In particular, discrete metamaterials present themselves as a stringent platform for assessing continuous models developed for finite objects with sharp edges. Overall, the reported results should be important for understanding mesoscopic systems with strongly interacting elements.</description>

      <title>A mathematical model for Nordic skiing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02767v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nordic skiing provides fascinating opportunities for mathematical modelling studies that exploit methods and insights from physics, applied mathematics, data analysis, scientific computing and sports science. A typical ski course winds over varied terrain with frequent changes in elevation and direction, and so its geometry is naturally described by a three-dimensional space curve. The skier travels along a course under the influence of various forces, and their dynamics can be described using a nonlinear system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that are derived from Newton's laws of motion. We develop an algorithm for solving the governing equations that combines Hermite spline interpolation, numerical quadrature and a high-order ODE solver. Numerical simulations are compared with measurements of skiers on actual courses to demonstrate the effectiveness of the model. Throughout, we aim to illustrate how elementary concepts from undergraduate courses in calculus and scientific computing can be applied to study real problems in sport, which we hope will provide stimulating examples for both instructors and students. At the same time, we demonstrate how these concepts are capable of providing novel insights into skiing that should also be of interest to sport scientists.</description>

      <title>On the Derivation of the Cosmological Gurzadyan's Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02897v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In cosmology, the Gurzadyan's theorem identifies the most general force law consistent with the finding of Newton's first shell theorem -- that a spherical symmetric mass exerts the same gravitational force as a point mass at its center. This theorem has found important applications in cosmological modeling, particularly in the context of MoND (Modified Newtonian Dynamics), which has recently gained renewed attention as a potential alternative to dark matter. The derivation by Gurzadyan is written in an extremely concise and dense style, making it difficult to follow. Recent proofs of the theorem based on power-series methods offer valuable perspectives, though they differ from the original derivation, which is based on perturbation analysis. Our note aims to clarify the underlying logic in a pedagogical way -- accessible to advanced high school or undergraduate students -- while preserving conceptual clarity and mathematical elegance of his insight.</description>
