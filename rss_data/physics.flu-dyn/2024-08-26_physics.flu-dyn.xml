      <title>Identifying Locally Turbulent Vortices within Instabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents an approach for the automatic detection of locally turbulent vortices within turbulent 2D flows such as instabilites. First, given a time step of the flow, methods from Topological Data Analysis (TDA) are leveraged to extract the geometry of the vortices. Specifically, the enstrophy of the flow is simplified by topological persistence, and the vortices are extracted by collecting the basins of the simplified enstrophy's Morse complex. Next, the local kinetic energy power spectrum is computed for each vortex. We introduce a set of indicators based on the kinetic energy power spectrum to estimate the correlation between the vortex's behavior and that of an idealized turbulent vortex. Our preliminary experiments show the relevance of these indicators for distinguishing vortices which are turbulent from those which have not yet reached a turbulent state and thus known as laminar.</description>

      <title>Unifying theory of scaling in drop impact: Forces &amp; maximum spreading diameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of drop impact on a rigid surface -- omnipresent in nature and technology -- strongly depends on the droplet's velocity, its size, and its material properties. The main characteristics are the droplet's force exerted on the surface and its maximal spreading radius. The crucial question is: How do they depend on the (dimensionless) control parameters, which are the Weber number $We$ (non-dimensionalized kinetic energy) and the Ohnesorge number $Oh$ (dimensionless viscosity)? Here we perform direct numerical simulations over the huge parameter range $1\le We \le 10^3$ and $10^{-3}\le Oh \le 10^2$ and in particular develop a unifying theoretical approach, which is inspired by the Grossmann-Lohse theory for wall-bounded turbulence [J. Fluid Mech. 407, 27 (2000); PRL 86, 3316 (2001)]. The key idea is to split the energy dissipation rate into the different phases of the impact process, in which different physical mechanisms dominate. The theory can consistently and quantitatively account for the $We$ and $Oh$ dependences of the maximal impact force and the maximal spreading diameter over the huge parameter space. It also clarifies why viscous dissipation plays a significant role during impact, even for low-viscosity droplets (low $Oh$), in contrast to what had been assumed in prior theories.</description>

      <title>Understanding the effects of rotation on the wake of a wind turbine at high Reynolds number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The wake of a horizontal-axis wind turbine was studied at $Re_D=4\times10^6$ with the aim of revealing the effects of the tip speed ratio, $\lambda$, on the wake. Tip speed ratios of $4&lt;\lambda&lt;7$ were investigated and measurements were acquired up to 6.5 diameters downstream of the turbine. Through an investigation of the turbulent statistics, it is shown that the wake recovery was accelerated due to the higher turbulence levels associated with lower tip speed ratios. The energy spectra indicate that larger broadband turbulence levels at lower tip speed ratios contributes to a more rapidly recovering wake. Wake meandering and a coherent core structure were also studied, and it is shown that these flow features are tip speed ratio invariant, when considering their Strouhal numbers. This finding contradicts some previous studies regarding the core structure, indicating that the structure was formed by a bulk rotor geometric feature, rather than by the rotating blades. Finally, the core structure was shown to persist farther into the near wake with decreasing tip speed ratio. The structure's lifetime is hypothesized to be related to its strength relative to the turbulence in the core, which decreases with increasing tip speed ratio.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear estimation in turbulent channel flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We design a nonlinear estimator for channel flows at $Re_{\tau}=180$ and $590$. The nonlinear estimator uses a linear estimator structure based on the linearised Navier-Stokes equations and explicitly calculates the nonlinear forcing from the estimated velocities in physical space. The goal is to use the velocities at one wall-normal height to estimate the velocities at other wall-normal heights. The estimation performance is compared among the nonlinear estimator, the linear estimator and the linear estimator augmented with eddy viscosity. At $Re_{\tau}=180$, the nonlinear estimator and the linear estimator augmented with eddy viscosity outperform the linear estimator in terms of estimating the velocity magnitudes, structures and energy transfer (production and dissipation) across the channel height. The limitations of using measurement data at one wall-normal height are discussed. At $Re_{\tau}=590$, the nonlinear estimator does not work well with only one measurement plane, whereas the linear estimator augmented with eddy viscosity performs well. The performance of the nonlinear estimator at $Re_{\tau}=590$ is significantly enhanced by providing multiple measurement planes.</description>

      <title>Programmable Jumping-Droplet Condensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-propelled droplet jumping during condensation has attractive prospects for energy harvesting, water collection and thermal management, but its real-life applications are greatly limited to the challenge of enabling a sustainable control on the entire droplet lifecycle. Herein, we propose a programmable jumping-droplet condensation that evolves along an artificially designed pathway without external stimulations, where the droplets can uniformly form at specific sites, spontaneously migrate and coalesce with their neighboring droplets, and jump off effectively to continuously refresh surface, significantly enhancing the heat transfer performance and durability of condensation. The programmable jumping-droplet condensation is achieved using a wedge-walled rhombus lattice structure surface inspired from the structures and functions of Namib desert beetle skin, shorebird beak and setaria viridis leaf vein. This surface integrates wetting contrast patterns with dual-gradient hierarchical structures, providing persistent and multidimensional droplet rectifications and thus realizing a sustainable control on the entire droplet lifecycle. Furthermore, we systematically investigate the morphology and behavior evolutions of droplets throughout their entire lifecycle, and fully elucidate the programmable control mechanisms of the lattice structure determined by its topology and wettability features. This work not only serves as theoretical foundations and reference framework to realize a durable jumping-droplet condensation and achieve its performance ceiling in a controlled manner, but also promotes the design and fabrication of functional structured surfaces for droplet manipulation and delivery, self-cleaning and anti-fogging/icing.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic interaction between coaxially rising bubbles in elasto-visco-plastic materials: Bubbles with a wide range of relative sizes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the buoyancy-driven rise and interaction between two gravity-aligned bubbles of wide radii ratio and constant volume in an elasto-visco-plastic (EVP) material, extending our previous work on equal bubbles [Kordalis et al., Phys. Rev. Fluids 8, 083301, (2023)]. Primarily we consider a 0.1% aqueous Carbopol solution and model it with the Saramito-Herschel-Bulkley model. Initially, we investigate the dynamics for a specific initial separation distance in a wide range of bubble radii and we determine the conditions leading to three distinct patterns: bubble approach, bubble separation and establishment of a constant distance between them. Specifically, when the leading bubble (LB) is smaller than the trailing bubble (TB), the bubbles approach each other due to the smaller buoyancy of the LB. Strong attraction also occurs when the ratio of buoyant over viscous force of both bubbles is considerable. On the other hand, when the size of the TB is such that this ratio is moderate or small, the pattern is dictated by the size of the LB: A significantly larger LB compared to the TB causes separation of the pair. On the contrary, an only slightly larger LB may result in the bubbles rising with the same terminal velocity establishing a constant distance between them, the magnitude of which is mainly determined by the elastic response of the surrounding medium. The coupling of a negative wake behind the LB with a slight modification of the stresses exerted at its rear pole generates this dynamic equilibrium. The same equilibrium may be achieved by other specific pairs of bubble sizes for different initial distances of the pair, if a critical initial distance is exceeded. Below this critical value, the bubbles approach each other. Finally, we construct maps of the three patterns with TB radius versus bubble radii ratio for different initial separation distances and material properties.</description>

      <title>Turbulent convection in emulsions: the Rayleigh-B\'enard configuration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores heat and turbulent modulation in three-dimensional multiphase Rayleigh-B\'enard convection using direct numerical simulations. Two immiscible fluids with identical reference density undergo systematic variations in dispersed-phase volume fractions, $0.0 \leq \Upphi \leq 0.5$, and ratios of dynamic viscosity, $\lambda_{\mu}$, and thermal diffusivity, $\lambda_{\alpha}$, within the range $[0.1-10]$. The Rayleigh, Prandtl, Weber, and Froude numbers are held constant at $10^8$, $4$, $6000$, and $1$, respectively. Initially, when both fluids share the same properties, a 10\% Nusselt number increase is observed at the highest volume fractions. In this case, despite a reduction in turbulent kinetic energy, droplets enhance energy transfer to smaller scales, smaller than those of single-phase flow, promoting local mixing. By varying viscosity ratios, while maintaining a constant Rayleigh number based on the average mixture properties, the global heat transfer rises by approximately 25\% at $\Upphi=0.2$ and $\lambda_{\mu}=10$. This is attributed to increased small-scale mixing and turbulence in the less viscous carrier phase. In addition, a dispersed phase with higher thermal diffusivity results in a 50\% reduction in the Nusselt number compared to the single-phase counterpart, owing to faster heat conduction and reduced droplet presence near walls. The study also addresses droplet-size distributions, confirming two distinct ranges dominated by coalescence and breakup with different scaling laws.</description>

      <title>Fluid-network relations: decay laws meet with spatial self-similarity, scale-invariance, and control scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diverse implicit structures of fluids are discovered lately, providing opportunities to study the physics of fluids applying network analysis. Although considerable works devote to identifying informative network structures of fluids, we have limited understanding about the information these networks convey about fluids. To analyze how fluid mechanics is embodied in network topology or vice versa, we reveal a set of fluid-network relations that quantify the interactions between fundamental fluid properties (e.g., kinetic energy and enstrophy decay laws) and defining network characteristics (e.g., spatial self-similarity, scale-invariance, and control scaling). By analyzing spatial self-similarity in classic and generalized contexts, we first assess the self-similarity of vortical interactions in fluid flows. Deviations from self-similarity in networks exhibit power-law scaling behaviors with respect to fluid properties, suggesting the diversity among vortex as essential to self-similar fluid flows. Then, the same paradigm is adopted to investigate scale-invariance using renormalization groups, which reveals that the breaking extents of scale-invariance in networks, similar to those of spatial self-similarity, also scale with fluid properties in power-law manners. Furthermore, we define a control problem on networks to study the propagation of perturbations through vortical interactions over different ranges. The minimum cost of controlling vortical networks exponentially scales with range diameters (i.e., control distances), whose growth rates experiences temporal decays. We show that this temporal decay speed is fully determined by fluid properties in power-law scaling behaviours. In summary, these fluid-network relations enable a deeper understanding of implicit fluid structures and their interactions with fluid dynamics.</description>

      <title>Stratified Resistive Tearing Instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resistive tearing instabilities are common in fluids that are highly electrically conductive and carry strong currents. We determine the effect of stable stratification on the tearing instability under the Boussinesq approximation. Our results generalise previous work that considered only specific parameter regimes, and we show that the length scale of the fastest growing mode depends non-monotonically on the stratification strength. We confirm our analytical results by solving the linearised equations numerically, and we discuss whether the instability could operate in the solar tachocline.</description>

      <title>Liquid droplet morphology on the fiber of a fog harvester mesh and the droplet detachment conditions under gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Liquid droplets on fiber are often observed both in nature and in different engineering applications, like a fog harvesting mesh. Knowledge about drop-on-fiber morphology and its shedding under the influence of gravity can allow for the design of better separation technology. Mutual interaction of surface tension forces arising out of the surface energies of the liquid and the fiber solid, and the weight of the liquid droplet gives rise to different morphologies of the droplet, which may occur in a stable or meta-stable configuration. Predicting the droplet shape on a fiber of specified dimension and surface wettability accurately for a given volume of liquid is challenging since the curvature of both the droplet and the cylinder influence the phenomenon. We have numerically investigated the droplet shape and transition criterion for various volumes at different contact angles under the effect of varying Bond numbers using an open-source surface evolver code. It is observed that depending upon the relative dimensions of the liquid droplet, the fiber diameter, wettability, and gravity, the liquid exists on the fiber either in 'barrel' or in 'clamshell' shape. A relation between shedding volume and the Bond number is deduced, and the detachment volumes are calculated.</description>

      <title>Resolvent-Based Optimisation for Approximating the Statistics of Chaotic Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel framework for approximating the statistical properties of turbulent flows by combining variational methods for the search of unstable periodic orbits with resolvent analysis for dimensionality reduction. Traditional approaches relying on identifying all short, fundamental Unstable Periodic Orbits to compute ergodic averages via cycle expansion are computationally prohibitive for high-dimensional fluid systems. Our framework stems from the observation in Lasagna, Phys. Rev. E (2020), that a single unstable periodic orbit with a period sufficiently long to span a large fraction of the attractor captures the statistical properties of chaotic trajectories. Given the difficulty of identifying unstable periodic orbits for high-dimensional fluid systems, approximate trajectories residing in a low-dimensional subspace are instead constructed using resolvent modes, which inherently capture the temporal periodicity of unstable periodic orbits. The amplitude coefficients of these modes are adjusted iteratively with gradient-based optimisation to minimise the violation of the projected governing equations, producing trajectories that approximate, rather than exactly solve, the system dynamics. A first attempt at utilising this framework on a chaotic system is made here on the Lorenz 1963 equations, where resolvent analysis enables an exact dimensionality reduction from three to two dimensions. Key observables averaged over these trajectories produced by the approach as well as probability distributions and spectra rapidly converge to values obtained from long chaotic simulations, even with a limited number of iterations. This indicates that exact solutions may not necessary to approximate the system's statistical behaviour, as the trajectories obtained from partial optimisation provide a sufficient ``sketch'' of the attractor in state space.</description>
