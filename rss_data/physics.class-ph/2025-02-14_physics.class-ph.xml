      <title>Nonlinear Cauchy Elasticity</title>

Abstract: Most theories and applications of elasticity rely on an energy function that depends on the strains from which the stresses can be derived. This is the traditional setting of Green elasticity, also known as hyper-elasticity. However, in its original form the theory of elasticity does not assume the existence of a strain-energy function. In this case, called Cauchy elasticity, stresses are directly related to the strains. Since the emergence of modern elasticity in the 1940s, research on Cauchy elasticity has been relatively limited. One possible reason is that for Cauchy materials, the net work performed by stress along a closed path in the strain space may be nonzero. Therefore, such materials may require access to both energy sources and sinks. This characteristic has led some mechanicians to question the viability of Cauchy elasticity as a physically plausible theory of elasticity. In this paper, motivated by its relevance to recent applications, such as the modeling of active solids, we revisit Cauchy elasticity in a modern form.</description>

      <title>Ohm's law, Joule heat, and Planckian dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01797v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Previously, we have shown that the gradient of the chemical potential force arises from the time-component of the Berry connection from many-electron wave functions. We will demonstrate the importance of it in electron conduction problems in metals in this work. We first revisit the well-studied dissipation problem, Joule heating by electric current in a metallic wire connected to an electric battery. It is known that Poynting's theorem explains it in a strange manner: The energy for the Joule heating enters from the outside of the wire as radiation. We show that a sensible explanation is given if the generation of the current is due to the chemical potential gradient generated inside the wire by the battery connection. Next, we demonstrate its importance in the discharging of a capacitor problem where the capacitor plays a role of a battery; and the tunneling supercurrent through the Josephson junction problem, where the original derivation of the Josephson relation does not include the capacitor contribution inherently exists in the junction. Lastly, we argue that the gauge fluctuation of the time-component of the Berry connection included in the chemical potential gradient force explains the Planckian dissipation observed in strange metals.</description>
