      <title>Safe Reinforcement Learning-based Automatic Generation Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Amidst the growing demand for implementing advanced control and decision-making algorithms|to enhance the reliability, resilience, and stability of power systems|arises a crucial concern regarding the safety of employing machine learning techniques. While these methods can be applied to derive more optimal control decisions, they often lack safety assurances. This paper proposes a framework based on control barrier functions to facilitate safe learning and deployment of reinforcement learning agents for power system control applications, specifically in the context of automatic generation control. We develop the safety barriers and reinforcement learning framework necessary to establish trust in reinforcement learning as a safe option for automatic generation control - as foundation for future detailed verification and application studies.</description>

      <title>Trusted Data Fusion, Multi-Agent Autonomy, Autonomous Vehicles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-agent collaboration enhances situational awareness in intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) missions. Ad hoc networks of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) allow for real-time data sharing, but they face security challenges due to their decentralized nature, making them vulnerable to cyber-physical attacks. This paper introduces a trust-based framework for assured sensor fusion in distributed multi-agent networks, utilizing a hidden Markov model (HMM)-based approach to estimate the trustworthiness of agents and their provided information in a decentralized fashion. Trust-informed data fusion prioritizes fusing data from reliable sources, enhancing resilience and accuracy in contested environments. To evaluate the assured sensor fusion under attacks on system/mission sensing, we present a novel multi-agent aerial dataset built from the Unreal Engine simulator. We demonstrate through case studies improved ISR performance and an ability to detect malicious actors in adversarial settings.</description>

      <title>Rapid Modeling Architecture for Lightweight Simulator to Accelerate and Improve Decision Making for Industrial Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing industrial systems, such as building, improving, and automating distribution centers and manufacturing plants, involves critical decision-making with limited information in the early phases. The lack of information leads to less accurate designs of the systems, which are often difficult to resolve later. It is effective to use simulators to model the designed system and find out the issues early. However, the modeling time required by conventional simulators is too long to allow for rapid model creation to meet decision-making demands. In this paper, we propose a Rapid Modeling Architecture (RMA) for a lightweight industrial simulator that mitigates the modeling burden while maintaining the essential details in order to accelerate and improve decision-making. We have prototyped a simulator based on the RMA and applied it to the actual factory layout design problem. We also compared the modeling time of our simulator to that of an existing simulator, and as a result, our simulator achieved a 78.3% reduction in modeling time compared to conventional simulators.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Damping Calculation and Compensation Method for Global Stability Improvement of Inverter-Based Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Small-signal stability issues-induced broadband oscillations pose significant threats to the secure operation of multi-inverter systems, attracting extensive research attention. Researches revealed that system instability is led by the lacking of positive damping, yet it has not been clearly specified how much the exact amount of damping compensation required to sufficiently ensure system global stability. This paper presents a feasible solution for quantitative damping calculation and compensation to enhance the global stability of inverter-based systems. First, based on the system nodal admittance model, a quantitative damping calculation algorithm is presented, which can suggest the required damping compensation as well as compensation location for sufficient stability improvement. Then, we propose a specific AD with output current feedforward control strategy, which make the AD be quasi-pure resistive and can effectively enhance system damping efficiency. Finally, a testing system with three inverters is used as case study, showing that the proposed method provides a promising solution to efficiently enhance the global stability improvement of inverter-based systems. Simulations and experiments validate the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Carbon Emission Flow Tracing: Fast Algorithm and California Grid Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Power systems decarbonization are at the focal point of the clean energy transition. While system operators and utility companies increasingly publicize system-level carbon emission information, it remains unclear how emissions from individual generators are transported through the grid and how they impact electricity users at specific locations. This paper presents a novel and computationally efficient approach for exact quantification of nodal average and marginal carbon emission rates, applicable to both AC and DC optimal power flow problems. The approach leverages graph-based topological sorting and directed cycle removal techniques, applied to directed graphs formed by generation dispatch and optimal power flow solutions. Our proposed algorithm efficiently identifies each generator's contribution to each node, capturing how emissions are spatially distributed under varying system conditions. To validate its effectiveness and reveal locational and temporal emission patterns in the real world, we simulate the 8,870-bus realistic California grid using actual CAISO data and the CATS model. Based on year long hourly data on nodal loads and renewable generation, obtained or estimated from CAISO public data, our method accurately estimates power flow conditions, generation mixes, and systemwide emissions, and delivers fine grained spatiotemporal emission analysis for every California county. Both our algorithm and the California study are open-sourced, providing a foundation for future research on grid emissions, planning, operations, and energy policy.</description>

      <title>Towards Microgrid Resilience Enhancement via Mobile Power Sources and Repair Crews: A Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mobile power sources (MPSs) have been gradually deployed in microgrids as critical resources to coordinate with repair crews (RCs) towards resilience enhancement owing to their flexibility and mobility in handling the complex coupled power-transport systems. However, previous work solves the coordinated dispatch problem of MPSs and RCs in a centralized manner with the assumption that the communication network is still fully functioning after the event. However, there is growing evidence that certain extreme events will damage or degrade communication infrastructure, which makes centralized decision making impractical. To fill this gap, this paper formulates the resilience-driven dispatch problem of MPSs and RCs in a decentralized framework. To solve this problem, a hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning method featuring a two-level framework is proposed, where the high-level action is used to switch decision-making between power and transport networks, and the low-level action constructed via a hybrid policy is used to compute continuous scheduling and discrete routing decisions in power and transport networks, respectively. The proposed method also uses an embedded function encapsulating system dynamics to enhance learning stability and scalability. Case studies based on IEEE 33-bus and 69-bus power networks are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in load restoration.</description>

      <title>Regional Frequency-Constrained Planning for the Optimal Sizing of Power Systems via Enhanced Input Convex Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large renewable penetration has been witnessed in power systems, resulting in reduced levels of system inertia and increasing requirements for frequency response services. There have been plenty of studies developing frequency-constrained models for power system security. However, most existing literature only considers uniform frequency security, while neglecting frequency spatial differences in different regions. To fill this gap, this paper proposes a novel planning model for the optimal sizing problem of power systems, capturing regional frequency security and inter-area frequency oscillations. Specifically, regional frequency constraints are first extracted via an enhanced input convex neural network (ICNN) and then embedded into the original optimisation for frequency security, where a principled weight initialisation strategy is adopted to deal with the gradient vanishing issues of non-negative weights in traditional ICNNs and enhance its fitting ability. An adaptive genetic algorithm with sparsity calculation and local search is developed to separate the planning model into two stages and effectively solve it iteratively. Case studies have been conducted on three different power systems to verify the effectiveness of the proposed frequency-constrained planning model in ensuring regional system security and obtaining realistic investment decisions.</description>

      <title>Two-Stage TSO-DSO Services Provision Framework for Electric Vehicle Coordination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High renewable penetration has been witnessed in power systems, resulting in reduced system inertia and increasing requirements for frequency response services. Electric vehicles (EVs), owing to their vehicle-to-grid (V2G) capabilities, can provide cost-effective frequency services for transmission system operators (TSOs). However, EVs that are inherently connected to distribution networks may pose voltage security issues for distribution system operators (DSOs) when supporting TSO frequency. To coordinate both TSO frequency and DSO voltage, this paper proposes a two-stage service provision framework for multi-EVs. At stage one, EVs participate in day-ahead TSO-DSO interactions for frequency reserve schedules; at stage two, EVs make real-time dispatching behaviors in distribution networks for reserve delivery while supporting DSO voltage. Considering the potentially large EV number and environment complexity, a decentralized operation paradigm is introduced for real-time EV dispatches at stage two, while a communication-efficient reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm is proposed to reduce the communication overhead during large-scale multi-agent RL training without compromising policy performance. Case studies are carried out on a 6-bus transmission and 33-bus distribution network as well as a 69-bus distribution network to evaluate the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed method in enabling EVs for frequency service and voltage support.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Model Order Reduction for Continuous- and Discrete-Time Nonlinear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model order reduction simplifies high-dimensional dynamical systems by deriving lower-dimensional models that preserve essential system characteristics. These techniques are crucial to controller design for complex systems while significantly reducing computational costs. Nevertheless, constructing effective reduced-order models (ROMs) poses considerable challenges, particularly for dynamical systems characterized by highly nonlinear terms. These challenges are further exacerbated when the actual system model is unavailable, a scenario frequently encountered in real-world applications. In this work, we propose a data-driven framework for the construction of ROMs for both continuous- and discrete-time nonlinear dynamical systems with unknown mathematical models. By leveraging two sets of data collected from the system, referred to as two input-state trajectories, we first construct a data-based closed-loop representation of the system. We then establish a similarity relation between the output trajectories of the original system and those of its data-driven ROM employing the notion of simulation functions (SFs), thereby enabling a formal characterization of their closeness. To achieve this, we propose data-dependent semidefinite programs as sufficient conditions to simultaneously construct both ROMs and SFs, while offering correctness guarantees. We demonstrate that the obtained data-driven ROMs can be employed for synthesizing controllers that ensure the unknown system satisfies high-level logic properties. This is accomplished by first designing controllers for the data-driven ROMs and then translating the results back to the original system through an interface function. We evaluate the efficacy of our data-driven findings through four benchmark case studies involving unknown dynamics with highly nonlinear terms.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Incremental GAS Certificate of Nonlinear Homogeneous Networks: A Formal Modular Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work focuses on a compositional data-driven approach to verify incremental global asymptotic stability (delta-GAS) over interconnected homogeneous networks of degree one with unknown mathematical dynamics. Our proposed approach leverages the concept of incremental input-to-state stability (delta-ISS) of subsystems, characterized by delta-ISS Lyapunov functions. To implement our data-driven scheme, we initially reframe the delta-ISS Lyapunov conditions as a robust optimization program (ROP). However, due to the presence of unknown subsystem dynamics in the ROP constraints, we develop a scenario optimization program (SOP) by gathering data from trajectories of each unknown subsystem. We solve the SOP and construct a delta-ISS Lyapunov function for each subsystem with unknown dynamics. We then leverage a small-gain compositional condition to facilitate the construction of an incremental Lyapunov function for an unknown interconnected network with unknown dynamics based on its data-driven delta-ISS Lyapunov functions of individual subsystems, while providing correctness guarantees. We demonstrate that our data-driven compositional approach aligns sample complexity with subsystem granularity, resulting in a linear increase in required data as the number of subsystems rises. In contrast, the existing monolithic approach in the literature exhibits exponential growth in sample complexity with increasing number of subsystems, rendering it impractical for real-world applications. To validate the effectiveness of our compositional data-driven approach, we apply it to an unknown nonlinear homogeneous network of degree one, comprising 10000 subsystems. By gathering data from each unknown subsystem, we demonstrate that the interconnected network is delta-GAS with a correctness guarantee.</description>

      <title>Unit Commitment Framework for Nuclear Reactors with Reactivity Decline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nuclear reactors are often modeled as inflexible, baseload generators with fixed downtimes and restrictive ramping limits. In practice, however, a reactor's operational flexibility is closely tied to it's fuel cycle stage and the associated reactivity margin. A key physical constraint to power maneuverability is xenon poisoning, caused by an increase in neutron absorbing xenon concentration following a power ramp down. This can delay or even prevent subsequent power ramp up due to suppressed core reactivity. Additionally, if a reactor is shutdown during periods of low reactivity, restart times can vary significantly due to these xenon transients, leading to longer downtimes. This work introduces a physics informed, metaheuristic modeling approach that embeds fuel cycle dynamics directly with a unit commitment (UC) framework. The framework tracks reactivity margin, dynamically activates xenon related constraints, and endogenously implements refueling outages based on the core conditions. By capturing intra-cycle reactivity evolution and the conditional onset of xenon poisoning, the formulation allows for operation dependent nuclear dispatch that reflects both regulatory limits and physical behavior. When applied to a representative reactor fleet operating in distinct modes of operation -- ranging from baseload to part load -- the framework reveals that flexible operation can slow reactivity degradation and extend fuel cycles. The results show that fuel cycle aware flexibility modeling is critical for accurate scheduling of nuclear reactors and offers a tractable pathway to integrate nuclear power in energy system models.</description>

      <title>Stability Constrained Voltage Control in Distribution Grids with Arbitrary Communication Infrastructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of designing learning-based reactive power controllers that perform voltage regulation in distribution grids while ensuring closed-loop system stability. In contrast to existing methods, where the provably stable controllers are restricted to be decentralized, we propose a unified design framework that enables the controllers to take advantage of an arbitrary communication infrastructure on top of the physical power network. This allows the controllers to incorporate information beyond their local bus, covering existing methods as a special case and leading to less conservative constraints on the controller design. We then provide a design procedure to construct input convex neural network (ICNN) based controllers that satisfy the identified stability constraints by design under arbitrary communication scenarios, and train these controllers using supervised learning. Simulation results on the the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) microgrid testbed illustrate the effectiveness of the framework and highlight the role of communication in improving control performance.</description>

      <title>Optimal Integration Of Heat-Pump And Solar Thermal Energy In The Pre-heating Loop Of Wood And Gas Boiler Based District Heating System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of renewable sources is essential for decarbonizing heat production in district energy networks. Beyond biomass-based solutions, solar thermal energy, with or without heat pumps, presents a significant opportunity. However, system performance is highly dependent on outdoor and setpoint temperatures. This study aims to optimize system design using a multi-criteria approach that considers techno-economic and environmental (CO2) factors. A Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model is developed, incorporating temperature discretization for problem linearization and capturing key dynamic characteristics of heat generators. The model improves convergence, reducing a 19% MIP gap in 26 hours to 10% in 12 hours by dissipating 6% excess solar heat. A multi-scenario analysis under two carbon taxation levels and different CO2 emission cases revealed solar integration up to 11,932 m${}^2$ but increased gas reliance (50%) and TES losses (49%). Wood boiler inclusion reduced solar dependency, covering 45% of heat, lowered LCOH, but limited renewable penetration. Higher carbon taxes boosted solar adoption but faced storage inefficiencies, while biomass enhanced cost efficiency and system stability.</description>

      <title>Designing efficient interventions for pre-disease states using control theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To extend healthy life expectancy in an aging society, it is crucial to prevent various diseases at pre-disease states. Although dynamical network biomarker theory has been developed for pre-disease detection, mathematical frameworks for pre-disease treatment have not been well established. Here I propose a control theory-based approach for pre-disease treatment, named Markov chain sparse control (MCSC), where time evolution of a probability distribution on a Markov chain is described as a discrete-time linear system. By designing a sparse controller, a few candidate states for intervention are identified. The validity of MCSC is demonstrated using numerical simulations and real-data analysis.</description>

      <title>Maneuvering-based Dynamic Thrust Allocation for Fully-Actuated Vessels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new approach to solving the thrust allocation problem using the maneuvering problem in the maritime domain for fully actuated vessels. The method uses a control Lyapunov function to create a nonlinear reference filter for the thruster forces. The filter ensures dynamic tracking of the optimal thrust allocation solution with rate limitation in the output thruster references. It further uses control barrier functions to ensure that the thruster force saturation limits are respected. The approach aims for simplicity and effectiveness, as well as smooth and dynamic thruster reference signals, in the implementation of thrust allocation for marine vessels.</description>

      <title>Toward Sustainable Vertical Farming: Impacts of Environmental Factors and Energy Mix on Performance and Costs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing interest in vertical farming arises from its ability to ensure consistent, high-quality, and pest-free vegetable production while supporting synergies with energy systems and urban development. Accordingly, standardized design and operation guidelines are essential to improve energy efficiency and lower costs. This study analyzes the production performance and energy consumption of a vertical farming system, assessing its efficiency, sustainability, and economic viability. A total of 162 scenarios were evaluated by combining three levels of temperature, photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD), and CO2 concentration across three distinct climatic zones, namely Norway, China, and Dubai, which also differ from a socio-environmental viewpoint. Two insulation thicknesses were also tested in each scenario. Results indicate that due to the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning and dehumidification (HVACD) system, neither the insulation layer nor the external climate significantly influences crop productivity. PPFD proved to be the dominant factor in crop growth (correlation: 0.85), followed by CO2 (0.36) and indoor temperature (0.22). PPFD also emerged as the primary driver of overall energy consumption (correlation: 0.73), as it affects both lighting and HVACD loads. Notably, the lowest specific energy consumption (SEC) coincided with the lowest crop productivity (55 kg/m2). The levelized cost of lettuce (LCoL), balancing productivity and energy use, identified the most cost-effective setup as 24C, 250 PPFD, 1400 ppm CO2, with insulation, consistent across all climates. Ultimately, only nearly decarbonized energy systems can support vertical farming without increasing CO2 emissions compared to imported lettuce.</description>

      <title>A Robust Predictive Control Method for Pump Scheduling in Water Distribution Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Water utilities aim to reduce the high electrical costs of Water Distribution Networks (WDNs), primarily driven by pumping. However, pump scheduling is challenging due to model uncertainties and water demand forecast errors. This paper presents a Robust Model Predictive Control (RMPC) method for optimal and reliable pump scheduling, extending a previous efficient robust control method tailored to our model. A linear model with bounded additive disturbances is used to represent tank water level evolution, with uncertainty bounds derived from WDN simulation and demand data. At each time step, a pump scheduling policy, affine in past disturbances, is optimized to satisfy system constraints over a prediction horizon. The resulting policies are then applied in a receding horizon fashion. The optimization problem is formulated to require $\mathcal{O}(N^6)$ computations per iteration with an interior-point method, which is reduced to $\mathcal{O}(N^3)$ by reformulating it into a sparse form. When evaluated on a model representing the water distribution network of Randers, a medium-sized town in Denmark, the method surpasses nominal and constraint-tightening model predictive control (MPC) approaches in terms of meeting constraints and provides comparable economic outcomes.</description>

      <title>Global Observer Design for a Class of Linear Observed Systems on Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear observed systems on groups encode the geometry of a variety of practical state estimation problems. In this paper, we propose a unified observer framework for a class of linear observed systems by restricting a bi-invariant system on a Lie group to its normal subgroup. This structural property powerfully enables a system immersion of the original system into a linear time-varying system. Leveraging the immersion, an observer is constructed by first designing a Kalman-like observer for the immersed system and then reconstructing the group-valued state via optimization. Under a rank condition, global exponential stability (GES) is achieved provided one global optimum of the reconstruction optimization is found, reflecting the topological difficulties inherent to the non-Euclidean state space. Semi-global stability is guaranteed when input biases are jointly estimated. The theory is applied to the GES observer design for two-frame systems, capable of modeling a family of navigation problems. Two non-trivial examples are provided to illustrate implementation details.</description>

      <title>Design and optimization of a novel leaf-shape antenna for RF energy transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this research, the design and optimization of a novel leaf-shaped antenna inspired by natural leaf structures for radio frequency energy transfer is presented. The objectives of this study are to develop a bio-inspired antenna, optimize its performance through impedance matching for the 915 MHz frequency band, and evaluate its efficiency in capturing RF energy. The design process involves selecting an appropriate leaf shape, modeling the antenna using AutoCAD and HFSS software, and fabricating a printed circuit board (PCB) prototype. Simulations and physical tests are conducted to optimize the antennas performance, achieving an S11 parameter of nearly -20 dB at 915 MHz, indicating effective energy capture. Experimental results demonstrate the antennas ability to power a device at distances up to 200 cm, with charging times reflecting its efficiency. The study concludes that the bio-inspired design of the proposed antenna improves RF energy transfer. Future work should focus on testing the antennas penetration through concrete and developing a feedback system for autonomous alignment.</description>

      <title>A Step-by-step Guide on Nonlinear Model Predictive Control for Safe Mobile Robot Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing a Model Predictive Control (MPC) scheme that enables a mobile robot to safely navigate through an obstacle-filled environment is a complicated yet essential task in robotics. In this technical report, safety refers to ensuring that the robot respects state and input constraints while avoiding collisions with obstacles despite the presence of disturbances and measurement noise. This report offers a step-by-step approach to implementing Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) schemes addressing these safety requirements. Numerous books and survey papers provide comprehensive overviews of linear MPC (LMPC) \cite{bemporad2007robust,kouvaritakis2016model}, NMPC \cite{rawlings2017model,allgower2004nonlinear,mayne2014model,grune2017nonlinear,saltik2018outlook}, and their applications in various domains, including robotics \cite{nascimento2018nonholonomic,nguyen2021model,shi2021advanced,wei2022mpc}. This report does not aim to replicate those exhaustive reviews. Instead, it focuses specifically on NMPC as a foundation for safe mobile robot navigation. The goal is to provide a practical and accessible path from theoretical concepts to mathematical proofs and implementation, emphasizing safety and performance guarantees. It is intended for researchers, robotics engineers, and practitioners seeking to bridge the gap between theoretical NMPC formulations and real-world robotic applications.

      <title>Sparse optimal control for infinite-dimensional linear systems with applications to graphon control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale networked systems typically operate under resource constraints, and it is also difficult to exactly obtain the network structure between nodes. To address these issues, this paper investigates a sparse optimal control for infinite-dimensional linear systems and its application to networked systems where the network structure is represented by a limit function called a graphon that captures the overall connection pattern. The contributions of this paper are twofold: (i) To reduce computational complexity, we derive a sufficient condition under which the sparse optimal control can be obtained by solving its corresponding L1 optimization problem. Furthermore, we introduce a class of non-convex optimal control problems such that the optimal solution always coincides with a sparse optimal control, provided that the non-convex problems admit optimal solutions. (ii) We show that the sparse optimal control for large-scale finite-dimensional networked systems can be approximated by that of the corresponding limit graphon system, provided that the underlying graph is close to the limit graphon in the cut-norm topology. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is illustrated through numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Modular Robot and Landmark Localisation Using Relative Bearing Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we propose a modular nonlinear least squares filtering approach for systems composed of independent subsystems. The state and error covariance estimate of each subsystem is updated independently, even when a relative measurement simultaneously depends on the states of multiple subsystems. We integrate the Covariance Intersection (CI) algorithm as part of our solution in order to prevent double counting of information when subsystems share estimates with each other. An alternative derivation of the CI algorithm based on least squares estimation makes this integration possible. We particularise the proposed approach to the robot-landmark localization problem. In this problem, noisy measurements of the bearing angle to a stationary landmark position measured relative to the SE(2) pose of a moving robot couple the estimation problems for the robot pose and the landmark position. In a randomized simulation study, we benchmark the proposed modular method against a monolithic joint state filter to elucidate their respective trade-offs. In this study we also include variants of the proposed method that achieve a graceful degradation of performance with reduced communication and bandwidth requirements.</description>

      <title>Auto-SGCR: Automated Generation of Smart Grid Cyber Range Using IEC 61850 Standard Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Digitalization of power grids have made them increasingly susceptible to cyber-attacks in the past decade. Iterative cybersecurity testing is indispensable to counter emerging attack vectors and to ensure dependability of critical infrastructure. Furthermore, these can be used to evaluate cybersecurity configuration, effectiveness of the cybersecurity measures against various attack vectors, as well as to train smart grid cybersecurity experts defending the system. Enabling extensive experiments narrows the gap between academic research and production environment. A high-fidelity cyber range is vital as it is often infeasible to conduct such experiments and training using production environment. However, the design and implementation of cyber range requires extensive domain knowledge of physical and cyber aspect of the infrastructure. Furthermore, costs incurred for setup and maintenance of cyber range are significant. Moreover, most existing smart grid cyber ranges are designed as a one-off, proprietary system, and are limited in terms of configurability, accessibility, portability, and reproducibility. To address these challenges, an automated Smart grid Cyber Range generation framework is presented in this paper. Initially a human-/machine-friendly, XML-based modeling language called Smart Grid Modeling Language was defined, which incorporates IEC 61850 System Configuration Language files. Subsequently, a toolchain to parse SG-ML model files and automatically instantiate a functional smart grid cyber range was developed. The developed SG-ML models can be easily shared and/or modified to reproduce or customize for any cyber range. The application of Auto-SGCR is demonstrated through case studies with large-scale substation models. The toolchain along with example SG-ML models have been open-sourced.</description>

      <title>On the Role of Age and Semantics of Information in Remote Estimation of Markov Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the semantics-aware remote estimation of a finite-state Markov chain. We employ the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator and aim to devise a transmission policy to optimize estimation performance subject to a transmission frequency constraint. We leverage two metrics, namely the Age of Consecutive Error (AoCE) and the Age of Information (AoI), to quantify, respectively, the significance of estimation error at the transmitter and the predictability of outdated information at the receiver. The optimal transmission problem is formulated as a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) with unbounded costs. We show the existence of an optimal simple mixture policy, which randomly selects between two deterministic switching policies with a fixed probability. Notably, each switching policy triggers a transmission only when the AoCE exceeds a threshold value that depends on both the AoI and the instantaneous estimation error. We further derive sufficient conditions under which the switching policy reduces to a simple threshold policy; that is, it admits identical thresholds for all estimation errors. Leveraging these results, we develop an efficient structure-aware algorithm, Insec-SPI, that computes the optimal policy with reduced computation overhead. Our results demonstrate that incorporating both AoI and AoCE yields significantly improved estimation quality compared to using either metric alone.</description>

      <title>Partial-State DADS Control for Matched Unmodeled Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the Deadzone-Adapted Disturbance Suppression (DADS) control to time-invariant systems with dynamic uncertainties that satisfy the matching condition and for which no bounds for the disturbance and the unknown parameters are known. This problem is equivalent to partial-state adaptive feedback, where the states modeling the dynamic uncertainty are unmeasured. We show that the DADS controller can bypass small-gain conditions and achieve robust regulation for systems in spite of the fact that the strength of the interconnections has no known bound. Moreover, no gain and state drift arise, regardless of the size of the disturbances and unknown parameters. Finally, the paper provides the detailed analysis of a control system where the unmeasured state (or the dynamic uncertainty) is infinite-dimensional and described by a reaction-diffusion Partial Differential Equation, where the diffusion coefficient and the reaction term are unknown. It is shown that even in the infinite-dimensional case, a DADS controller can be designed and guarantees robust regulation of the plant state.</description>

      <title>Gait Recognition Based on Tiny ML and IMU Sensors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This project presents the development of a gait recognition system using Tiny Machine Learning (Tiny ML) and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors. The system leverages the XIAO-nRF52840 Sense microcontroller and the LSM6DS3 IMU sensor to capture motion data, including acceleration and angular velocity, from four distinct activities: walking, stationary, going upstairs, and going downstairs. The data collected is processed through Edge Impulse, an edge AI platform, which enables the training of machine learning models that can be deployed directly onto the microcontroller for real-time activity classification.The data preprocessing step involves extracting relevant features from the raw sensor data using techniques such as sliding windows and data normalization, followed by training a Deep Neural Network (DNN) classifier for activity recognition. The model achieves over 80% accuracy on a test dataset, demonstrating its ability to classify the four activities effectively. Additionally, the platform enables anomaly detection, further enhancing the robustness of the system. The integration of Tiny ML ensures low-power operation, making it suitable for battery-powered or energy-harvesting devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This report details the successful construction of an ultrasound imaging platform and the design and fabrication of a novel ultrasound endoscope probe. The projects primary objective was to establish a functional system for acquiring and processing ultrasound signals, specifically targeting minimally invasive endoscopic applications. The ultrasound imaging platform was primarily designed and developed based on Texas Instruments (TI) Evaluation Modules (EVMs). It enables the transmission of 32-channel high-voltage signals and the reception of echo signals, with on-chip signal amplification and acquisition capabilities. Furthermore, the platform integrates a complete Time Gain Control (TGC) imaging path and a ContinuousWave Doppler (CWD) path. In conjunction with host computer software, it supports imaging with linear array, convex array, and phased array probes. Concurrently, a 64-element, 5MHz center frequency, phased array linear ultrasound endoscopic probe was designed, aiming for miniaturization and optimal imaging performance. The fabrication and assembly of its matching layer, backing layer, 2-2 piezoelectric composite material, and electrodes were completed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09261v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents the open-source stochastic model predictive control framework GRAMPC-S for nonlinear uncertain systems with chance constraints. It provides several uncertainty propagation methods to predict stochastic moments of the system state and can consider unknown parts of the system dynamics using Gaussian process regression. These methods are used to reformulate a stochastic MPC formulation as a deterministic one that is solved with GRAMPC. The performance of the presented framework is evaluated using examples from a wide range of technical areas. The experimental evaluation shows that GRAMPC-S can be used in practice for the control of nonlinear uncertain systems with sampling times in the millisecond range.</description>

Abstract: The reconfiguration of electrical power distribution systems is a crucial optimization problem aimed at minimizing power losses by altering the system topology through the operation of interconnection switches. This problem, typically modelled as a mixed integer nonlinear program demands high computational resources for large scale networks and requires specialized radiality constraints for maintaining the tree like structure of distribution networks. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis that integrates and compares the computational burden associated with different radiality constraint formulations proposed in the specialized literature for the reconfiguration of distribution systems. By using consistent hardware and software setups, we evaluate the performance of these constraints across several well known test cases. Our findings reveal significant differences in computational efficiency depending on the chosen set of radiality constraints, providing valuable insights for optimizing reconfiguration strategies in practical distribution networks.</description>

      <title>Integrated Learning and Optimization for Congestion Management and Profit Maximization in Real-Time Electricity Market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18003v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop novel integrated learning and optimization (ILO) methodologies to solve economic dispatch (ED) and DC optimal power flow (DCOPF) problems for better economic operation. The optimization problem for ED is formulated with load being an unknown parameter while DCOPF consists of load and power transfer distribution factor (PTDF) matrix as unknown parameters. PTDF represents the incremental variations of real power on transmission lines which occur due to real power transfers between two regions. These values represent a linearized approximation of power flows over the transmission lines. We develop novel ILO formulations to solve post-hoc penalties in electricity market and line congestion problems using ED and DCOPF optimization formulations. Our proposed methodologies capture the real-time electricity market and line congestion behavior to train the regret function which eventually train unknown loads at different buses and line PTDF matrix to achieve the afore-mentioned post-hoc goals. The proposed methodology is compared to sequential learning and optimization (SLO) which train load and PTDF forecasts for accuracy rather than economic operation. Our experimentation prove the superiority of ILO in minimizing the post-hoc penalties in electricity markets and minimizing the line congestion thereby improving the economic operation with noticeable amount.</description>

      <title>Fast Bilateral Teleoperation and Imitation Learning Using Sensorless Force Control via Accurate Dynamics Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06174v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the advancement of imitation learning has led to increased interest in teleoperating low-cost manipulators to collect demonstration data. However, most existing systems rely on unilateral control, which only transmits target position values. While this approach is easy to implement and suitable for slow, non-contact tasks, it struggles with fast or contact-rich operations due to the absence of force feedback. This work demonstrates that fast teleoperation with force feedback is feasible even with force-sensorless, low-cost manipulators by leveraging 4-channel bilateral control. Based on accurately identified manipulator dynamics, our method integrates nonlinear terms compensation, velocity and external force estimation, and variable gain corresponding to inertial variation. Furthermore, using data collected by 4-channel bilateral control, we show that incorporating force information into both the input and output of learned policies improves performance in imitation learning. These results highlight the practical effectiveness of our system for high-fidelity teleoperation and data collection on affordable hardware.</description>

      <title>BEAVER: Building Environments with Assessable Variation for Evaluating Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07769v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent years have seen significant advancements in designing reinforcement learning (RL)-based agents for building energy management. While individual success is observed in simulated or controlled environments, the scalability of RL approaches in terms of efficiency and generalization across building dynamics and operational scenarios remains an open question. In this work, we formally characterize the generalization space for the cross-environment, multi-objective building energy management task, and formulate the multi-objective contextual RL problem. Such a formulation helps understand the challenges of transferring learned policies across varied operational contexts such as climate and heat convection dynamics under multiple control objectives such as comfort level and energy consumption. We provide a principled way to parameterize such contextual information in realistic building RL environments, and construct a novel benchmark to facilitate the evaluation of generalizable RL algorithms in practical building control tasks. Our results show that existing multi-objective RL methods are capable of achieving reasonable trade-offs between conflicting objectives. However, their performance degrades under certain environment variations, underscoring the importance of incorporating dynamics-dependent contextual information into the policy learning process.</description>
