      <title>Advanced Targeted Drug Delivery for Colon Cancer Using Pristine and Surface-modified Hydroxyapatite Nanoparticles: Synthesis, Characterization, and pH-Responsive Release</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydroxyapatite nanoparticles (HANs) have emerged as a promising candidate for targeted drug delivery in the treatment of colon cancer, a disease that remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths globally. In this study, we synthesized and characterized HANs for their potential use as drug delivery vehicle for anticancer drugs specifically targeting colon cancer treatment. Through various in vitro assays, including drug loading efficiency, release kinetics, we demonstrated that HANs exhibit efficient drug loading capacity, and sustained release behavior, which could collectively contribute to enhanced therapeutic outcomes against colon cancer cells. The findings highlight the potential of HANs to serve as a versatile platform for the targeted drug delivery of chemotherapeutic agents, offering a novel approach that could improve treatment efficacy while minimizing side effects due to biocompatibility of the particles. Future research should focus on in vivo studies and clinical translation to further validate the potential of HANs in cancer therapy as drug carrier.</description>

      <title>Mesoporous Silica Nanoparticles-based Smart Nanocarriers for Targeted Drug Delivery in Colorectal Cancer Therapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, highlighting the urgent need for advanced therapeutic strategies. Nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems have emerged as a promising approach to improve the specificity and efficacy of anticancer treatments. This review examines three cutting-edge mesoporous silica nanoparticle (MSN)-based drug delivery to introduce novel CRC therapy, each utilizing unique functionalization strategies for targeted drug release. The first system, hyaluronidase-responsive MSN-HA/DOX, employs biotin-modified hyaluronic acid to facilitate dual-stimulus drug release in the tumor microenvironment, exhibiting enhanced in vivo tumor inhibition. The DOX/SLN-PEG-Biotin utilizes polyethylene glycol and biotin to improve drug stability and target biotin-overexpressing CRC cells, demonstrating superior anti-cancer efficacy in vitro and in vivo. Lastly, galactosylated chitosan-functionalized MSNs enable targeted delivery through asialoglycoprotein receptors, providing controlled drug release and strong therapeutic potential. Collectively, these systems highlight the advancements in nanoparticle functionalization for CRC treatment, offering a pathway to overcome the limitations of conventional chemotherapy. Further research is required to translate these innovations into clinical practice, ensuring safety and scalability.</description>

      <title>Score-Based Generative Models for Designing Binding Peptide Backbones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07051v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Score-based generative models (SGMs) have proven to be powerful tools for designing new proteins. Designing proteins that bind a pre-specified target is highly relevant to a range of medical and industrial applications. Despite the flurry of new SGMs in the last year, there has been little systematic exploration of the impact of design choices in SGMs for protein design. Here we present LoopGen, a flexible SGM framework for the design of short binding peptide structures. We apply our framework to design antibody binding loop structures conditional on a target epitope and evaluate a variety of modelling choices in SGM-based protein design. We demonstrate that modelling residue orientations in addition to positions improves not only the quality of the output structures but also their diversity. Additionally, we identify variance schedules that result in significant performance improvements and observe patterns that may motivate the development of better schedules for protein design. Finally, we develop three novel tests to evaluate whether the model generates structures that are appropriately conditioned on an epitope, demonstrating that LoopGen's generated structures are dependent on the structure, sequence, and position of the epitope. Our findings will help guide future development and evaluation of generative models for binding proteins.</description>

      <title>Emergent time scales of epistasis in protein evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09436v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a data-driven epistatic model of protein evolution, capable of generating evolutionary trajectories spanning very different time scales reaching from individual mutations to diverged homologs. Our in silico evolution encompasses random nucleotide mutations, insertions and deletions, and models selection using a fitness landscape, which is inferred via a generative probabilistic model for protein families. We show that the proposed framework accurately reproduces the sequence statistics of both short-time (experimental) and long-time (natural) protein evolution, suggesting applicability also to relatively data-poor intermediate evolutionary time scales, which are currently inaccessible to evolution experiments. Our model uncovers a highly collective nature of epistasis, gradually changing the fitness effect of mutations in a diverging sequence context, rather than acting via strong interactions between individual mutations. This collective nature triggers the emergence of a long evolutionary time scale, separating fast mutational processes inside a given sequence context, from the slow evolution of the context itself. The model quantitatively reproduces epistatic phenomena such as contingency and entrenchment, as well as the loss of predictability in protein evolution observed in deep mutational scanning experiments of distant homologs. It thereby deepens our understanding of the interplay between mutation and selection in shaping protein diversity and novel functions, allows one to statistically forecast evolution, and challenges the prevailing independent-site models of protein evolution, which are unable to capture the fundamental importance of epistasis.</description>

      <title>Relaxation to statistical equilibrium in stochastic Michaelis-Menten kinetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.10362v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The equilibration of enzyme and complex concentrations in deterministic Michaelis-Menten reaction networks underlies the hyperbolic dependence between the input (substrates) and output (products). This relationship was first obtained by Michaelis and Menten and then Briggs and Haldane in two asymptotic limits: `fast equilibrium' and `steady state'. In stochastic Michaelis-Menten networks, relevant to catalysis at single-molecule and mesoscopic concentrations, the classical analysis cannot be directly applied due to molecular discreteness and fluctuations. Instead, as we show here, such networks require a more subtle asymptotic analysis based on the decomposition of the network into reversible and irreversible sub-networks and the exact solution of the chemical master equation (CME). The reversible and irreversible sub-networks reach detailed balance and stationarity, respectively, through a relaxation phase that we characterise in detail through several new statistical measures. Since stochastic enzyme kinetics encompasses the single-molecule, mesoscopic and thermodynamic limits, our work provides a broader molecular viewpoint of the classical results, in much the same manner that statistical mechanics provides a broader understanding of thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Large-Scale Multi-omic Biosequence Transformers for Modeling Peptide-Nucleotide Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16245v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The transformer architecture has revolutionized bioinformatics and driven progress in the understanding and prediction of the properties of biomolecules. Almost all research on large-scale biosequence transformers has focused on one domain at a time (single-omic), usually nucleotides or peptides. These models have seen incredible success in downstream tasks in each domain and have achieved particularly noteworthy breakthroughs in sequences of peptides and structural modeling. However, these single-omic models are naturally incapable of modeling multi-omic tasks, one of the most biologically critical being nucleotide-peptide interactions.
  We present our work training the first multi-omic nucleotide-peptide foundation models. We show that these multi-omic models (MOMs) can learn joint representations between various single-omic distributions that are emergently consistent with the Central Dogma of molecular biology, despite only being trained on unlabeled biosequences. We further demonstrate that MOMs can be fine-tuned to achieve state-of-the-art results on peptide-nucleotide interaction tasks, namely predicting the change in Gibbs free energy ({\Delta}G) of the binding interaction between a given oligonucleotide and peptide, as well as the effect on this binding interaction due to mutations in the oligonucleotide sequence ({\Delta}{\Delta}G).
  Remarkably, we show that multi-omic biosequence transformers emergently learn useful structural information without any prior structural training, allowing us to predict which peptide residues are most involved in the peptide-nucleotide binding interaction. Lastly, we provide evidence that multi-omic biosequence models are non-inferior to foundation models trained on single-omics distributions, suggesting a more generalized or foundational approach to building these models.</description>
