      <title>In situ observations of large amplitude Alfv\'en waves heating and accelerating the solar wind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: After leaving the Sun's corona, the solar wind continues to accelerate and cools, but more slowly than expected for a freely expanding adiabatic gas. We use in situ measurements from the Parker Solar Probe and Solar Orbiter spacecrafts to investigate a stream of solar wind as it traverses the inner heliosphere. The observations show heating and acceleration of the the plasma between the outer edge of the corona and near the orbit of Venus, in connection to the presence of large amplitude Alfv\'en waves. Alfv\'en waves are perturbations in the interplanetary magnetic field that transport energy. Our calculations show the damping and mechanical work performed by the Alfv\'en waves is sufficient to power the heating and acceleration of the fast solar wind in the inner heliosphere.</description>

      <title>Detection of the [C I] $\lambda$8727 emission line. Low-ionization structures in NGC 7009</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the first spatially resolved detection of the near-infrared [C I] $\lambda$8727 emission from the outer pair of low-ionization structures in the planetary nebula NGC 7009 from data obtained by the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer integral field unit. This atomic carbon emission marks the transition zone between ionized and neutral gas, and for the first time offers direct evidence that LISs are photodominated regions. The outer LIS pair exhibits intense [C I] $\lambda$8727 emission, but He I $\lambda$8733 is absent. Conversely, the inner pair of knots shows both lines, likely due to the host nebula emission. Furthermore, the [C I] $\lambda$8727 line is absent in the host nebula emission, but He I $\lambda$8733 is present. Although the origin of the [C I] $\lambda$8727 line is still debated, its detection supports the scenario of photoevaporated dense molecular clumps.</description>

      <title>[Fe II] 1.644$\mu$m imaging survey of planetary nebulae with low-ionisation structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-ionisation structures (LISs) are commonly found in planetary nebulae (PNe) but they are still poorly understood. The recent discovery of unforeseen molecular hydrogen gas (H2) has changed what we think we know about these microstructures and PNe. For an overall understanding of LISs, an [Fe II] 1.644$\mu$m imagery survey in PNe with LISs was carried out with the aim to detect the [Fe II] 1.644$\mu$m emission line, a common tracer of shocks. We present the first detection of [Fe II] 1.644$\mu$m line directly associated with the LISs in four out of five PNe. The theoretical H I 12-4 recombination line is also computed either from the Br$\gamma$ or the H$\beta$ line and subtracted from the observed narrowband line fluxes. [Fe II] 1.644$\mu$m flux ranges from 1 to 40x10$^{-15}$ ergs cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ and the surface brightness from 2 to 90x10$^{-5}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ sr$^{-1}$. The R(Fe)=[Fe II] 1.644$\mu$m/Br$\gamma$ line ratio is also computed and varies between 0.5 and 7. In particular, the [Fe II] 1.644$\mu$m line is detected in NGC 6543 (R(Fe)&lt;0.15), the outer pairs of LISs in NGC 7009 (R(Fe)&lt;0.25), the jet-like LISs in IC 4634 (R(Fe)$\sim$1) and in several LISs in NGC 6571 (2&lt;R(Fe)&lt;7). The low R(Fe) in NGC 6543 is attributed to the UV radiation from the central star. Contrarily, the higher values in NGC 6571 and IC 4634 are indicative to shocks. The moderate R(Fe) in NGC 7009 likely indicates the contribution of both mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Evolution of the Convective Core Mass during the Main Sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a semi-analytical model that describes the convective core mass evolution of massive stars experiencing mass loss during the main-sequence stage. We first conduct a suite of 1D stellar evolution calculations to build insight into how convective core masses behave under idealized mass loss. Based on these simulations, we find several universal relations between global properties of the star that hold regardless of the mass loss history. By combining these relations, we construct a semi-analytic framework that can predict the convective core mass evolution for arbitrary mass loss histories and hence the helium core mass at the end of the main sequence. Our formulae improve upon existing methods for predicting the core mass in rapid population synthesis codes.</description>

      <title>The GAPS Programme at TNG. LXI. Atmospheric parameters and elemental abundances of TESS young exoplanet host stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of exoplanets at different evolutionary stages can shed light on their formation, migration, and evolution. The determination of exoplanet properties depends on the properties of their host stars. It is therefore important to characterise the host stars for accurate knowledge on their planets. Our final goal is to derive, in a homogeneous and accurate way, the stellar atmospheric parameters and elemental abundances of ten young TESS transiting planet-hosting GK stars followed up with the HARPS-N at TNG spectrograph within the GAPS programme. We derived stellar kinematic properties, atmospheric parameters, and abundances of 18 elements. Lithium line measurements were used as approximate age estimations. We exploited chemical abundances and their ratios to derive information on planetary composition. Elemental abundances and kinematic properties are consistent with the nearby Galactic thin disk. All targets show C/O&lt;0.8 and 1.0&lt;Mg/Si&lt;1.5, compatible with silicate mantles made of a mixture of pyroxene and olivine assemblages. The Fe/Mg ratios, with values of $\sim$0.7-1.0, show a propensity for the planets to have big (iron) cores. All stars hosting very low-mass planets show Mg/Si values consistent with the Earth values, thus demonstrating their similar mantle composition. Hot Jupiter host stars show a lower content of O/Si, which could be related to the lower presence of water content. We confirm a trend found in the literature between stellar [O/Fe] and total planetary mass, implying an important role of the O in shaping the mass fraction of heavy elements in stars and their disks. The detailed host star abundances provided can be employed for further studies on the composition of the planets within the current sample, when their atmospheres will be exploited.</description>

      <title>The imprint of the first stars on the faint end of the white dwarf luminosity function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Population III stars are characterized by extremely low metallicities as they are thought to be formed from a pristine gas in the early Universe. Although the existence of Population III stars is widely accepted, the lack of direct observational evidence hampers the study of the nature of the putative stars. In this article, we explore the possibilities of constraining the nature of the oldest stars by using the luminosity function of their remnants -- white dwarfs. We study the formation and evolution of white dwarf populations by following star formation in a Milky Way-like galaxy using the semi-analytic model A-SLOTH. We derive the white dwarf luminosity function by applying a linear Initial-Final Mass Relation and Mestel's cooling model. The obtained luminosity function is generally in agreement with available observations and theoretical predictions -- with an exponential increase to a maximum of Mabs = 16 and a sudden drop for Mabs &gt; 16. We explore the uncertainties of our model and compare them to the observational estimates. We adopt two different models of the initial mass function of Population III stars to show that the faint end of the luminosity function imprints the signature of Population III remnants. If the feature is detected in future observations, it would provide a clue to Population III stars and would also be an indirect evidence of low- to intermediate-mass Population III stars. We discuss the challenges and prospects for detecting the signatures.</description>

      <title>Magnetic helicity and energy budgets of jet events from an emerging solar active region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using photospheric vector magnetograms obtained by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager on board the Solar Dynamic Observatory and a magnetic connectivity-based method, we compute the magnetic helicity and free magnetic energy budgets of a simple bipolar solar active region (AR) during its magnetic flux emergence phase which lasted $\sim$47 hrs. The AR did not produce any coronal mass ejections (CMEs) or flares with an X-ray class above C1.0 but it was the site of 60 jet events during its flux emergence phase. The helicity and free energy budgets of the AR were below established eruption-related thresholds throughout the interval we studied. However, in addition to their slowly-varying evolution, each of the time profiles of the helicity and free energy budgets showed discrete localized peaks, with eight pairs of them occurring at times of jets emanating from the AR. These jets featured larger base areas and longer durations than the other jets of the AR. We estimated, for the first time, the helicity and free magnetic energy changes associated with these eight jets which were in the ranges of $0.5-7.1 \times 10^{40}$ Mx$^2$ and $1.1-6.9 \times 10^{29}$ erg, respectively. Although these values are one to two orders of magnitude smaller than those usually associated with CMEs, the relevant percentage changes were significant and ranged from 13% to 76% for the normalized helicity and from 9% to 57% for the normalized free magnetic energy. Our study indicates that occasionally jets may have a significant imprint in the evolution of helicity and free magnetic energy budgets of emerging active regions.</description>

      <title>Asteroseismic Signatures of Core Magnetism and Rotation in Hundreds of Low-Luminosity Red Giants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Red Giant stars host solar-like oscillations which have mixed character, being sensitive to conditions both in the outer convection zone and deep within the interior. The properties of these modes are sensitive to both core rotation and magnetic fields. While asteroseismic studies of the former have been done on a large scale, studies of the latter are currently limited to tens of stars. We aim to produce the first large catalogue of both magnetic and rotational perturbations. We jointly constrain these parameters by devising an automated method for fitting the power spectra directly. We successfully apply the method to 302 low-luminosity red giants. We find a clear bimodality in core rotation rate. The primary peak is at $\delta \nu_{\mathrm{rot}}$ = 0.32 $\mu$Hz, and the secondary at $\delta \nu_{\mathrm{rot}}$ = 0.47 $\mu$Hz. Combining our results with literature values, we find that the percentage of stars rotating much more rapidly than the population average increases with evolutionary state. We measure magnetic splittings of 2$\sigma$ significance in 23 stars. While the most extreme magnetic splitting values appear in stars with masses &gt; 1.1M$_{\odot}$, implying they formerly hosted a convective core, a small but statistically significant magnetic splitting is measured at lower masses. Asymmetry between the frequencies of a rotationally split multiplet has previously been used to diagnose the presence of a magnetic perturbation. We find that of the stars with a significant detection of magnetic perturbation, 43\% do not show strong asymmetry. We find no strong evidence of correlation between the rotation and magnetic parameters.</description>

      <title>On Thermal Conduction in the Solar Atmosphere: An Analytical Solution for Nonlinear Diffusivity without Compact Support</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scientific community employs complicated multiphysics simulations to understand the physics in Solar, Stellar, and Interstellar media. These must be tested against known solutions to ensure their validity. Several well-known tests exist, such as the Sod shock tube test. However, a test for nonlinear diffusivity is missing. This problem is highly relevant in the Solar atmosphere, where various events release energy that subsequently diffuses by Spitzer thermal conductivity. The aim is to derive an analytical solution for nonlinear diffusivity in 1D, 2D, and 3D, which allows for a nonzero background value. The solution will be used to design a test for numerical solvers and study Spitzer conductivity in the Solar atmosphere. There existed an ideal solution assuming zero background value. We perform an analytical first-order perturbation of this solution. The first-order solution is first tested against a dedicated nonlinear diffusion solver, whereupon it is used to benchmark the single- and multifluid radiative magnetohydrodynamics code Ebysus, used to study the Sun. The theory and numerical modeling are used to investigate the role of Spitzer conductivity in the transport of energy released in a nanoflare. The derived analytical solution models nonlinear diffusivity accurately within its region of validity and approximately beyond. Various numerical schemes in the Ebysus code have been found to model Spitzer conductivity correctly. The energy from a representative nanoflare has been found to diffuse 9 Mm within the first second of its lifetime due to Spitzer conductivity alone, strongly dependent on the electron density. The analytical first-order solution is a step forward in ensuring the physical validity of intricate simulations of the Sun. Additionally, since the derivation and argumentation are general, they can easily be followed to treat other nonlinear diffusion problems.</description>

      <title>Surface Flux Transport Modelling using Physics Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying the magnetic field properties on the solar surface is crucial for understanding the solar and heliospheric activities, which in turn shape space weather in the solar system. Surface Flux Transport (SFT) modelling helps us to simulate and analyse the transport and evolution of magnetic flux on the solar surface, providing valuable insights into the mechanisms responsible for solar activity. In this work, we demonstrate the use of machine learning techniques in solving magnetic flux transport, making it accurate. We have developed a novel Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)-based model to study the evolution of Bipolar Magnetic Regions (BMRs) using SFT in one-dimensional azimuthally averaged and also in two-dimensions. We demonstrate the efficiency and computational feasibility of our PINNs-based model by comparing its performance and accuracy with that of a numerical model implemented using the Runge-Kutta Implicit-Explicit (RK-IMEX) scheme. The mesh-independent PINNs method can be used to reproduce the observed polar magnetic field with better flux conservation. This advancement is important for accurately reproducing observed polar magnetic fields, thereby providing insights into the strength of future solar cycles. This work paves the way for more efficient and accurate simulations of solar magnetic flux transport and showcases the applicability of PINNs in solving advection-diffusion equations with a particular focus on heliophysics.</description>

      <title>Full abundance study of two newly discovered barium giants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Barium (Ba) stars are chemically peculiar stars that show enhanced surface abundances of heavy elements produced by the slow-neutron-capture process, the so-called s-process. These stars are not sufficiently evolved to undergo the s-process in their interiors, so they are considered products of binary interactions. Ba stars form when a former Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) companion, which is now a white dwarf, pollutes them with s-process-rich material through mass transfer. This paper presents a detailed chemical characterization of two newly discovered Ba giants. Our main goal is to confirm their status as extrinsic s-process stars and explore potential binarity and white dwarf companions. We obtained high-resolution spectra with UVES on the Very Large Telescope to determine the chemical properties of the targets. We perform line-by-line analyses and measure 22 elements with an internal precision up to 0.04 dex. The binary nature of the targets is investigated through radial velocity variability and spectral energy distribution fitting. We found that both targets are enhanced in all the measured s-process elements, classifying our targets as Ba giants. This is the first time they are classified as such in the literature. Additionally, both stars present a mild enhancement in Eu, but less than in pure s-process elements, suggesting that the sources that polluted them were pure s-process sources. Finally, we confirmed that the two targets are RV variable and likely binary systems. The abundances in these two newly discovered polluted binaries align with classical Ba giants, providing observational constraints to better understand the s-process in AGB stars.</description>

      <title>Binary progenitor systems for Type Ic supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Core-collapse supernovae are explosions of massive stars at the end of their evolution. They are responsible for metal production and for halting star formation, having a significant impact on galaxy evolution. The details of these processes depend on the nature of supernova progenitors, but it is unclear if Type Ic supernovae (without hydrogen or helium lines in their spectra) originate from core-collapses of very massive stars (&gt; 30 Msun) or from less massive stars in binary systems. Here we show that Type II (with hydrogen lines) and Ic supernovae are located in environments with similar molecular gas densities, therefore their progenitors have comparable lifetimes and initial masses. This supports a binary interaction for most Type Ic supernova progenitors, which explains the lack of hydrogen and helium lines. This finding can be implemented in sub-grid prescriptions in numerical cosmological simulations to improve the feedback and chemical mixing.</description>

      <title>Decoding the formation of hammerhead ion populations observed by Parker Solar Probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In situ observations by the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) have revealed new properties of the proton velocity distributions, including hammerhead features that suggest non-isotropic broadening of the beams. The present work proposes a very plausible explanation for the formation of these populations through the action of a proton firehose-like instability triggered by the proton beam. The quasi-linear (QL) theory proposed here shows that the resulting right-hand (RH) waves have two consequences on the protons: (i) reduce the relative drift between the beam and the core, but above all, (ii) induce a strong perpendicular temperature anisotropy, specific to the observed hammerhead ion strahl. Moreover, the long-run QL results suggest that these hammerhead distributions are rather transitory states, still subject to relaxation mechanisms, of which instabilities like the one discussed here are very likely involved.</description>

      <title>SIP-IFVM: An efficient time-accurate implicit MHD model of corona and CME with strong magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CMEs are one of the main drivers of space weather. However, robust and efficient numerical modeling of the initial stages of CME propagation and evolution process in the sub-Alfvenic corona is still lacking. Based on the highly efficient quasi-steady-state implicit MHD coronal model (Feng et al. 2021; Wang et al. 2022a), we further develop an efficient and time-accurate coronal model and employ it to simulate the CME's evolution and propagation. A pseudo-time marching method, where a pseudo time, tau, is introduced at each physical time step to update the solution by solving a steady-state problem on tau, is devised to improve the temporal accuracy. Moreover, an RBSL flux rope whose axis can be designed in an arbitrary shape is inserted into the background corona to trigger the CME event. We call it the SIP-IFVM coronal model and utilize it to simulate a CME evolution process from the solar surface to 20 Rs in the background corona of CR 2219. It can finish the CME simulation covering 6 hours of physical time by less than 0.5 hours (192 CPU cores, 1 M cells) without much loss in temporal accuracy. Besides, an ad hoc simulation with initial magnetic fields artificially increased shows that this model can effectively deal with time-dependent low-beta problems (beta&lt;0.0005). Additionally, an Orszag-Tang MHD vortex flow simulation demonstrates that the pseudo-time-marching method adopted in this coronal model is also capable of simulating small-scale unsteady-state flows. The simulation results show that this MHD coronal model is very efficient and numerically stable and is promising to timely and accurately simulate time-varying events in solar corona with low plasma beta.</description>

      <title>An efficient, time-evolving, global MHD coronal model based on COCONUT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MHD coronal models are critical in the Sun-to-Earth model chain and the most complex and computationally intensive component, particularly the time-evolving coronal models, typically driven by a series of time-evolving photospheric magnetograms. There is an urgent need to develop efficient and reliable time-evolving MHD coronal models to further improve our ability to predict space weather. COCONUT is a rapidly developing MHD coronal model. Adopting the efficient implicit algorithm makes it suitable for performing computationally intensive time-evolving coronal simulations. This paper aims to extend COCONUT to an efficient time-evolving MHD coronal model. In this MHD model, as usual, an implicit temporal integration algorithm is adopted to avoid the CFL stability restriction and increase computational efficiency by large time steps. The Newton iteration method is applied within each time step to enhance the temporal accuracy. The unstructured geodesic mesh is used for flexibility in mesh division and to avoid degeneracy at the poles. Furthermore, an HLL Riemann solver with a self-adjustable dissipation term accommodates both low- and high-speed flows. A series of time-evolving photospheric magnetograms are utilized to drive the evolution of coronal structures from the solar surface to 25Rs during two Carrington rotations (CRs) around the 2019 eclipse in an inertial coordinate system. It shows that COCONUT can mimic the coronal evolution during a full CR within 9 hours (1080 CPU cores, 1.5M cells). We also compare the simulation results of time-evolving versus quasi-steady-state coronal simulations in the thermodynamic MHD model to validate the time-evolving approach. Additionally, we evaluate the effect of time steps on the simulation results to find an optimal time step that simultaneously maintains high efficiency and necessary numerical stability and accuracy.</description>

      <title>It's written in the massive stars: The role of stellar physics in the formation of black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the age of gravitational-wave (GW) sources and newly discovered local black holes (BH) and neutron stars (NS), understanding the fate of stars is a key question. Not every massive star is expected to successfully explode as a supernova and leave behind a NS; some stars form BHs. The remnant depends on explosion physics but also on the final core structure, often summarized by the compactness parameter or iron core mass, where high values have been linked to BH formation. Several groups have reported similar patterns in these parameters as a function of mass, characterized by a prominent compactness peak followed by another peak at higher masses, pointing to a common underlying physical mechanism. Here, we investigate its origin by computing single-star models from 17 to 50 solar masses with MESA. The first and second compactness increases originate from core carbon and neon burning, respectively, becoming neutrino dominated, which enhances the core contraction and ultimately increases the iron-core mass and compactness. An early core neon ignition during carbon burning, and an early silicon ignition during oxygen burning help counter the core contraction and decrease the final iron core mass and compactness. Shell mergers between C/Ne and O-burning shells further decrease the compactness and we show that they are due to an enhanced entropy production in these layers. We find that the final structure of massive stars is not random but already written in their cores at core helium exhaustion. The same mechanisms determine the final structure of any star in this core mass range, including binary products, though binary interactions systematical shift the range of expected BH formation. Finally, we discuss the role of stellar physics uncertainties and how to apply these findings to studies of GW sources. [Abridged]</description>

      <title>The Accelerating Decline of the Mass Transfer Rate in the Recurrent Nova T Pyxidis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recurrent nova T Pyxidis has erupted six times since 1890, with its last outburst in 2011, and the relatively short recurrence time between classical nova explosions indicates that T Pyx must have a massive white dwarf accreting at a high rate. It is believed that, since its outburst in 1890, the mass transfer rate in T Pyx was very large due to a feedback loop where the secondary is heated by the hot white dwarf. The feedback loop has been slowly shutting off, reducing the mass transfer rate, and thereby explaining the magnitude decline of T Pyx from $\sim13.8$ (before 1890) to 15.7 just before the 2011 eruption. We present an analysis of the latest $Hubble~Space~Telescope$ (HST) far ultraviolet and optical spectra, obtained 12 years after the 2011 outburst, showing that the mass transfer rate has been steadily declining and is now below its pre-outburst level by about 40%: $\dot{M} \sim 1-3\times 10^{-7}M_\odot$/yr for a WD mass of $\sim 1.0-1.4 M_\odot$, an inclination of $50^\circ - 60^\circ$, reddening $E(B-V)=0.30 \pm 0.05$ and a Gaia DR3 distance of $2860^{+816}_{-471}$~pc. This steady decrease in the mass transfer rate in the $\sim$decade after the 2011 ourbutst is in sharp contrast with the more constant pre-outburst UV continuum flux level from archival international ultraviolet explorer (IUE) spectra. The flux (i.e. $\dot{M}$) decline rate is 29 times faster now in the last $\sim$decade than observed since 1890 to $\sim$2010. The feedback loop shut off seems to be accelerating, at least in the decade following its 2011 outburst. In all eventualities, our analysis confirms that T Pyx is going through an unusually peculiar short-lived phase.</description>

      <title>Probing the Physics of Star-Formation (ProPStar) III. No evidence for dissipation of turbulence down to 20 mpc (4 000 au) scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. Turbulence is a key component of molecular cloud structure. It is usually described by a cascade of energy down to the dissipation scale. The power spectrum for subsonic incompressible turbulence is $k^{-5/3}$, while for supersonic turbulence it is $k^{-2}$. Aims. We aim to determine the power spectrum in an actively star-forming molecular cloud, from parsec scales down to the expected magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) wave cutoff (dissipation scale). Methods. We analyze observations of the nearby NGC 1333 star-forming region in three different tracers to cover the different scales from $\sim$10 pc down to 20 mpc. The largest scales are covered with the low density gas tracer $^{13}$CO (1-0) obtained with single dish, the intermediate scales are covered with single-dish observations of the C$^{18}$O (3-2) line, while the smallest scales are covered in H$^{13}$CO$^+$ (1-0) and HNC (1-0) with a combination of NOEMA interferometer and IRAM 30m single dish observations. The complementarity of these observations enables us to generate a combined power spectrum covering more than two orders of magnitude in spatial scale. Results. We derive the power spectrum in an active star-forming region spanning more than 2 decades of spatial scales. The power spectrum of the intensity maps shows a single power-law behavior, with an exponent of 2.9$\pm$0.1 and no evidence of dissipation. Moreover, there is evidence for the power-spectrum of the ions to have more power at smaller scales than the neutrals, which is opposite from theoretical expectations. Conclusions. We show new possibilities of studying the dissipation of energy at small scales in star-forming regions provided by interferometric observations.</description>

      <title>Review of the August 1972 and March 1989 Space Weather Events: Can We Learn Anything New From Them?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Updated summaries of the August 1972 and March 1989 space weather events have been constructed. The features of these two events are compared to the Carrington 1859 event and a few other major space weather events. It is concluded that solar active regions release energy in a variety of forms (X-rays, EUV photons, visible light, coronal mass ejection (CME) plasmas and fields) and they in turn can produce other energetic effects (solar energetic particles (SEPs), magnetic storms) in a variety of ways. It is clear that there is no strong one-to-one relationship between these various energy sinks. The energy is often distributed differently from one space weather event to the next. Concerning SEPs accelerated at interplanetary CME (ICME) shocks, it is concluded that the Fermi mechanism associated with quasi-parallel shocks is relatively weak and that the gradient drift mechanism (electric fields) at quasi-perpendicular shocks will produce harder spectra and higher fluxes. If the 4 Augusut 1972 intrinsic magnetic cloud condition (southward interplanetary magnetic field instead of northward) and the interplanetary Sun to 1 au conditions were different, a 4 August 1972 magnetic storm and magnetospheric dawn-to-dusk electric fields substantially larger than the Carrington event would have occurred. Under these special interplanetary conditions, a Miyake et al. (2012)-like extreme SEP event may have been formed. The long duration complex 1989 storm was probably greater than the Carrington storm in the sense that the total ring current particle energy was larger.</description>

      <title>Influence of planets on debris discs in star clusters -- II. The impact of stellar density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present numerical simulations of planetary systems in star clusters with different initial stellar densities, to investigate the impact of the density on debris disc dynamics. We use LPS+ to combine N-body codes NBODY6++GPU and REBOUND for simulations. We simulate debris discs with and without a Jupiter-mass planet at 50 au, in star clusters with N = 1k - 64k stars. The spatial range of the remaining planetary systems decreases with increasing N. As cluster density increases, the planet's influence range first increases and then decreases. For debris particles escaping from planetary systems, the probability of their direct ejection from the star cluster decreases as their initial semi-major axis (a0) or the cluster density increases. The eccentricity and inclination of surviving particles increase as cluster density increases. The presence of a planet leads to lower eccentricities and inclinations of surviving particles. The radial density distribution of the remaining discs decays exponentially in sparse clusters. We derive a general expression of the gravitational encounter rate. Our results are unable to directly explain the scarcity of debris discs in star clusters. Nevertheless, given that many planetary systems have multiple planets, the mechanism of the planet-cluster combined gravitational influence on the disc remains appealing as a potential explanation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the spherical tensorial formalism for polarization to the treatment of electric- and magnetic-multipole transitions of any order. We rely on the spherical-wave expansion to derive the tensor form of the operator describing the interaction of the atomic system with a polarized radiation field, which naturally leads to the introduction of spherical tensors describing the polarization properties of the interacting field. As a direct application, the formalism is used to model the radiation anisotropy affecting the scattering of radiation in an electric-quadrupole transition, and the associated Hanle effect in the presence of a magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Thermal conductivity and thermal Hall effect in dense electron-ion plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we examine thermal conductivity and the thermal Hall effect in electron-ion plasmas relevant to hot neutron stars, white dwarfs, and binary neutron star mergers, focusing on densities found in the outer crusts of neutron stars and the interiors of white dwarfs. We consider plasma consisting of single species of ions, which could be either iron $\isotope[56]{Fe}$, carbon $\isotope[12]{C}$, helium $\isotope[4]{He}$, or hydrogen $\isotope[1]{H}$ nuclei. The temperature range explored is from the melting temperature of the solid $T\sim10^9$~K up to $10^{11}$~K. This covers both degenerate and non-degenerate electron regimes. We find that thermal conductivity increases with density and temperature for which we provide analytical scaling relations valid in different regimes. The impact of magnetic fields on thermal conductivity is also analyzed, showing anisotropy in low-density regions and the presence of the thermal Hall effect characterized by Leduc-Righi coefficient. The transition from degenerate to non-degenerate regime is characterized by a minimum ratio of thermal conductivity to temperature, which is analogous to the minimum observed already in the case of electrical conductivity.</description>

      <title>Experimental and computational study of ethanolamine ices at astrochemical conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ethanolamine (NH2CH2CH2OH) has recently been identified in the molecular cloud G+0.693-0.027, situated in the SgrB2 complex in the Galactic center. However, its presence in other regions, and in particular in star-forming sites, is still elusive. Given its likely role as a precursor to simple amino acids, understanding its presence in the star-forming region is required. Here, we present the experimentally obtained temperature-dependent spectral features and morphological behavior of pure ethanolamine ices under astrochemical conditions in the 2 - 12 micro meter (MIR) and 120 - 230 nm (VUV) regions for the first time. These features would help in understanding its photochemical behavior. In addition, we present the first chemical models specifically dedicated to ethanolamine. These models include all the discussed chemical routes from the literature, along with the estimated binding energies and activation energies from quantum chemical calculations reported in this work. We have found that surface reactions: CH2OH + NH2CH2 --&gt; NH2CH2CH2OH and NH2 + C2H4OH --&gt; NH2CH2CH2OH in warmer regions (60-90 K) could play a significant role in the formation of ethanolamine. Our modeled abundance of ethanolamine complements the upper limit of ethanolamine column density estimated in earlier observations in hot core/corino regions. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical estimation of the rotational and distortional constants for various species (such as HNCCO, NH2CHCO, and NH2CH2CO) related to ethanolamine that have not been studied in existing literature. This study could be valuable for identifying these species in the future.</description>

      <title>The time evolution of the ultraviolet habitable zone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For stars hosting Circumstellar Habitable Zone (CHZ) exoplanets, we investigate the time-evolution of their ultraviolet habitable zone (UHZ), the annular region around a star where an exoplanet could experience a suitable ultraviolet environment for the presence and emergence of life, and the possible intersection of the UHZ with the CHZ. To estimate their UV luminosity evolution, and therefore the evolution of their UHZ, we analyse Swift-UV/Optical telescope observations and adopt the near-UV luminosity evolutionary tracks derived using GALEX observations of young moving groups. We find that an intersection between CHZ and UHZ could exist (or have existed) around all stars of our sample at different epochs, except for the coldest M-dwarfs (temperature &lt; 2800 K, e.g. Trappist-1). For hotter M-dwarfs the formation of RNA precursors through cyanosulfidic chemistry triggered by near-UV radiation could occur during the first 1-2 Gyrs. The radial-extension and time-duration of the CHZ-UHZ intersection increase with the stellar effective temperature and the exoplanet atmospheric transmissivity at near-UV wavelengths. Within our sample, Proxima Centauri represents a golden target for the quest of life outside the Solar system because it experienced a long-lasting and more extended, compared to similar M-dwarfs, CHZ-UHZ intersection.</description>

      <title>Derivation of generalized Kappa distribution from scaling properties of solar wind magnetic field fluctuations at kinetic scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kinetic scale dynamics in weakly-collisional space plasmas usually exhibits a self-similar statistics of magnetic field fluctuations which implies the existence of an invariant probability density function (master curve). We provide an analytical derivation of the master curve by assuming that perpendicular fluctuations can be modeled through a scale-dependent Langevin equation. In our model, magnetic field fluctuations are the stochastic variable and their scale-to-scale evolution is assumed to be a Langevin process. We propose a formal derivation of the master curve describing the statistics of the fluctuations at kinetic scales. Model predictions are tested on independent data samples of fast solar wind measured near the Sun by Parker Solar Probe and near the Earth by Cluster. The master curve is a generalization of the Kappa distribution with two parameters: one regulating the tails and the other one controlling the asymmetry. Model predictions match the spacecraft observations up to 5$\sigma$ and even beyond in the case of perpendicular magnetic field fluctuations.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Catalog of UVIT Observations I: Catalog Description and First Release of Source Catalog (UVIT DR1)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first comprehensive source catalog (UVIT DR1) of ultraviolet (UV) photometry in four far-UV (FUV $\sim$1300$-$1800 \AA) and five near-UV (NUV $\sim$2000$-$3000 \AA) filters of the Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) on board {\em AstroSat}. UVIT DR1 includes bright UV sources in 291 fields that UVIT detected during its first two years of pointed observation, encompassing an area of 58 square degrees. We used the {\sc ccdlab} pipeline to reduce the L1 data, source-extractor for source detection, and four photometric procedures to determine the magnitudes of the detected sources. We provided the 3$\sigma$ and 5$\sigma$ detection limits for all the filters of UVIT. We describe the details of observation, source extraction methods, and photometry procedures applied to prepare the catalog. In the final UVIT DR1 catalog, we have point sources, extended sources, clumps from nearby galaxies, There are 239,520 unique sources in the combined UVIT DR1, of which 70,488 sources have FUV magnitudes, and 211,410 have NUV magnitudes. We cross-matched and compared non-crowded sources of UVIT with the {\em Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX)} and {\em Gaia} source catalogs. We provide a clean catalog of the unique sources in various UVIT filters that will help further multi-wavelength scientific analysis of the objects.</description>

      <title>A broad set of solar and cosmochemical data indicates high C-N-O abundances for the solar system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the role of refractory organics as a major C carrier in the outer protosolar nebula and its implications for the compositions of large Kuiper belt objects (KBOs) and CI chondrites. By utilizing Rosetta measurements of refractory organics in comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, we show that they would make up a large fraction of the protosolar C inventory in the KBO-forming region based on the current widely adopted solar abundances. However, this would free up too much O to form water ice, producing solid material that is not sufficiently rock-rich to explain the uncompressed density of the Pluto-Charon system and other large KBOs; the former has been argued as the most representative value we have for the bulk composition of large KBOs (Barr &amp; Schawmb 2016, Bierson &amp; Nimmo 2019). This inconsistency further highlights the solar abundances problem - an ongoing challenge in reconciling spectroscopically determined heavy element abundances with helioseismology constraints. By employing a new dataset from solar CNO neutrinos and solar wind measurements of C, N, and O, we show that the uncompressed density of the Pluto-Charon system can be reproduced over a wide range of scenarios. We show that a lack of sulfates in Ryugu and Bennu samples implies a lower amount of water ice initially accreted into CI chondrite parent bodies than previously thought. These data are found to be consistent with the solar C/O ratio implied by the new dataset. Our predictions can be tested by future neutrino, helioseismology, and cosmochemical measurements.</description>

      <title>Scattering polarization of hydrogen lines in the presence of turbulent electric fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0511148</link>
      <description>arXiv:astro-ph/0511148v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract:   We study the broadband polarization of hydrogen lines produced by scattering of radiation, in the presence of isotropic electric fields. In this paper, we focus on two distinct problems: a) the possibility of detecting the presence of turbulent electric fields by polarimetric methods, and b) the influence of such fields on the polarization due to a macroscopic, deterministic magnetic field. We found that isotropic electric fields decrease the degree of linear polarization in the scattered radiation, with respect to the zero-field case. On the other hand, a distribution of isotropic electric fields superimposed onto a deterministic magnetic field can generate a significant increase of the degree of magnetic-induced, net circular polarization. This phenomenon has important implications for the diagnostics of magnetic fields in plasmas using hydrogen lines, because of the ubiquitous presence of the Holtsmark, microscopic electric field from neighbouring ions. In particular, previous solar magnetographic studies of the Balmer lines of hydrogen may need to be revised because they neglected the effect of turbulent electric fields on the polarization signals. In this work, we give explicit results for the Lyman-alpha and Balmer-alpha lines.</description>

Abstract: $\textit{AIMS.}$ To investigate processes associated with generation of type-III radiation.
  $\textit{METHODS.}$ Measure the amplitudes and phase velocities of Parker Solar Probe observed electric fields, magnetic fields, and plasma density fluctuations.
  $\textit{RESULTS.}$ (1) There are slow electrostatic waves near the Langmuir frequency and at as many as six harmonics, the number of which increases with the amplitude of the Langmuir wave. Their electrostatic nature is shown by measurement of the plasma density fluctuations. From these density fluctuations and the electric field magnitude, the k-value of the Langmuir wave is estimated to be 0.14 and $k \lambda_d$ = 0.4. Even with a large uncertainty in this quantity (more than a factor of two) the phase velocity of the Langmuir wave was &lt;10,000 km/sec. (2) There is an electromagnetic wave near the Langmuir frequency having a phase velocity &lt;50,000 km/sec. (3) Whether there are electromagnetic waves at the harmonics of the Langmuir frequency cannot be determined because, if they existed, their magnetic field components would be below the noise level of the measurement. (4) The rapid (less than one msec) amplitude variations typical of the Langmuir wave and its harmonics are artifacts resulting from addition of two waves, one of which has small frequency variations that arise from traveling through density irregularities. None of these results are expected in or consistent with the conventional model of the three-wave interaction of two counter-streaming Langmuir waves that coalesce to produce the type-III wave. They are consistent with a new model in which electrostatic antenna waves are produced at the harmonics by radiation of the Langmuir wave, after which at least the first harmonic wave evolved through density irregularities such that its wave number decreased and it became the type-III radiation.</description>

      <title>Characterizing NGC 6383: A study of pre-main sequence stars, mass segregation, and age using Gaia DR3 and 2MASS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09145v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The presence of pre-main-sequence and low-mass stars, combined with the new data from Gaia DR3 and with 2MASS, significantly enhances the relevance of studying this cluster. We aim to accurately identify cluster members, determine fundamental parameters, assess mass segregation, and establish precise age and distance using Gaia DR3 and 2MASS data. We employed Bayesian analysis and machine learning techniques, including the Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (HDBSCAN) for member identification, the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS) from PyMC for modeling, the Sagitta neural network for the identification and age estimation of pre-main sequence stars, and ASteCA for isochrone fitting. We identified 254 probable cluster members with a mode cluster age of $3.53^{+1.40}_{-1.00}$ Myr and a distance of $1.11\pm 0.06$ kpc. The core and tidal radius were determined to be $1.95 \pm 0.19$ and $40.4 \pm 14.3\,\mathrm{arcmin}$, respectively. The analysis revealed primordial mass segregation among binary stars, indicating that NGC 6383 is not fully relaxed. The color magnitude diagram (CMD) shows a well-defined main sequence and a population of pre-main sequence stars, suggesting recent star formation activity from approximately 1 to 6 Myr ago. The software used for this investigation is released with the paper. Our analysis provides updated parameters for NGC 6383, confirming relative recent star formation and mass segregation, and demonstrating the effectiveness of combining advanced computational techniques with traditional methods for studying stellar clusters.</description>

      <title>Detection of high-frequency pulsation in WR 135: investigation of stellar wind dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12613v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the detection of high-frequency pulsations in WR\,135 from short cadence (10\,minutes) optical photometric and spectroscopic time series surveys. The harmonics up to $6^{th}$ order are detected from the integrated photometric flux variations while the comparatively weaker $8^{th}$ harmonic is detected from the strengths of the emission lines. We investigate the driving source of the stratified winds of WR\,135 using the radiative transfer modeling code, CMFGEN, and find the physical conditions that can explain the propagation of such pulsations. From our study, we find that the optically thick sub-sonic layers of the atmosphere are close to the Eddington limit and are launched by the Fe-opacity. The outer optically thin super-sonic winds ($\tau_{ross}=0.1-0.01$) are launched by the He\,$\textsc{ii}$ and C\,$\textsc{iv}$ opacities. The stratified winds above the sonic point undergo velocity perturbation that can lead to clumps. In the optically thin supersonic winds, dense clumps of smaller size ($f_{VFF}=0.27-0.3$, where $f_{VFF}$ is the volume filling factor) pulsate with higher-order harmonics. The larger clumps ($f_{VFF}=0.2$) oscillate with lower-order harmonics of the pulsation and affect the overall wind variability.</description>

      <title>X-Shooting ULLYSES: Massive stars at low metallicity. IV. Spectral analysis methods and exemplary results for O stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03137v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: CONTEXT: The spectral analysis of hot, massive stars is a fundamental astrophysical method to obtain their intrinsic properties and their feedback. Quantitative spectroscopy for hot, massive stars requires detailed numerical modeling of the atmosphere and an iterative treatment to obtain the best solution within a given framework. AIMS: We present an overview of different techniques for the quantitative spectroscopy of hot stars employed within the X-Shooting ULLYSES collaboration, from grid-based approaches to tailored fits. By performing a blind test, we gain an overview about the similarities and differences of the resulting parameters. Our study aims to provide an overview of the parameter spread caused by different approaches. METHODS: For three different stars from the sample (SMC O5 star AzV 377, LMC O7 star Sk -69 50, and LMC O9 star Sk -66 171), we employ different atmosphere codes (CMFGEN, Fastwind, PoWR) and strategies to determine their best-fitting model. For our analyses, UV and optical spectra are used to derive the properties with some methods relying purely on optical data for comparison. To determine the overall spectral energy distribution, we further employ additional photometry from the literature. RESULTS: Effective temperatures for each of three sample stars agree within 3 kK while the differences in log g can be up to 0.2 dex. Luminosity differences of up to 0.1 dex result from different reddening assumptions, which seem to be larger for the methods employing a genetic algorithm. All sample stars are nitrogen-enriched. CONCLUSIONS: We find a reasonable agreement between the different methods. Tailored fitting tends to be able to minimize discrepancies obtained with more course or automatized treatments. UV spectral data is essential for the determination of realistic wind parameters. For one target (Sk -69 50), we find clear indications of an evolved status.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05121v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present in this paper an analysis of near-infrared observations of the 0.3-Msun protostar V347 Aur collected with the SPIRou high-resolution spectropolarimeter and velocimeter at the 3.6-m Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope from October 2019 to April 2023. From a set of 79 unpolarized and circularly polarized spectra of V347 Aur to which we applied Least-Squares Deconvolution (LSD), we derived radial velocities and longitudinal fields, along with their temporal variations over our monitoring campaign of 1258 d. Our data show that V347 Aur is an eccentric binary system with an orbital period 154.6$\pm$0.7 d, experiencing strong to extreme accretion events near periastron. The companion is a 29.0$\pm$1.6-Mjup brown dwarf, a rare member of the brown dwarf desert of close companions around M dwarfs. We detect weak longitudinal fields (&lt;100 G) at the surface of V347 Aur, significantly weaker than those of more evolved prototypical T Tauri stars. These fields show small-amplitude rotational modulation, indicating a mainly axisymmetric parent large-scale magnetic topology, and larger fluctuations at half the orbital period, suggesting that what we dub a ``pulsed dynamo'' triggered by orbital motion and pulsed accretion operates in V347 Aur. Applying Zeeman-Doppler imaging to our circularly polarised LSD profiles, we find that the large-scale field of V347 Aur is mainly toroidal for most of our observations, with the toroidal component switching sign near periastron and apoastron. The weak large-scale dipole (~30 G) is not able to disrupt the disc beyond 1.3 Rstar even at the lowest accretion rates, implying longitudinally distributed (rather than localized) accretion at the surface of the protostar.</description>

      <title>On the potential origin of the circumbinary planet Delorme 1 (AB)b</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06231v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many circumbinary gas giant planets have been recently discovered. The formation mechanism of circumbinary planets on wide orbits is unclear. We investigate the formation of Delorme 1 (AB)b, a 13$\pm$5M$_{\rm J}$ planet, orbiting its host binary at 84AU. The planet is accreting while having an estimated age of 40Myr, which is unexpected, as this process should have ceased due to the dissipation of the protoplanetary disc. Using the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics code SEREN, we model three formation scenarios for this planet. In Scenario I the planet forms in-situ on a wide orbit in a massive disc (by gravitational instability), in Scenario II closer to the binary in a massive disc (by gravitational instability), and in Scenario III much closer to the binary in a less massive disc (by core accretion). Planets in Scenario I stay at the observed separation, have mass accretion rates consistent with observed value, but their final mass is too high. In Scenario II, the planet reaches the observed separation through outward migration or scattering by the binary, and has mass accretion rate comparable to the observed; however, the planet mass is above the observed value. In Scenario III, the planet's final mass and mass accretion rate are comparable to the observed ones but the planet's separation is smaller. We conclude that all models may explain some features of the observations but not all of them, raising questions about how gas is accreted onto the planet from its circumplanetary disc, and of the presumed age of the system.</description>

      <title>Unsigned magnetic flux proxy from solar optical intensity spectra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.03522v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The photospheric unsigned magnetic flux has been shown to be highly correlated with radial velocity (RV) variations caused by solar surface activity. This activity indicator is therefore a prime candidate to unlock the potential of RV surveys to discover Earth twins orbiting Sun-like stars. We show for the first time how a precise proxy of the unsigned magnetic flux ($\Delta\alpha B^2$) can be obtained from Sun-as-a-star intensity spectra by harnessing the magnetic information contained in over 4000 absorption lines in the wavelength range from 380 to 690 nm. This novel activity proxy can thus be obtained from the same spectra from which RVs are routinely extracted. We derived $\Delta\alpha B^2$ from 500 randomly selected spectra from the HARPS-N public solar data set, which spans from 2015 to 2018. We compared our estimates with the unsigned magnetic flux values from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) finding excellent agreement (median absolute deviation: 4.9 per cent). The extracted indicator $\Delta\alpha B^2$ correlates with SDO's unsigned magnetic flux estimates on the solar rotational timescale (Pearson correlation coefficient 0.67) and on the three-year timescale of our data set (correlation coefficient 0.91). We find correlations of $\Delta\alpha B^2$ with the HARPS-N solar RV variations of 0.49 on the rotational timescale and 0.78 on the three-year timescale. The Pearson correlation of $\Delta\alpha B^2$ with the RVs is found to be greater than the correlation of the classical activity indicators with the RVs. For solar-type stars, $\Delta\alpha B^2$ therefore represents the best simultaneous activity proxy known to date.</description>

      <title>Merging Hierarchical Triple Black Hole Systems with Intermediate-mass Black Holes in Population III Star Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05393v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Theoretical predictions suggest that very massive stars have the potential to form through multiple collisions and eventually evolve into intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) within Population III star clusters embedded in mini dark matter haloes. In this study, we investigate the long-term evolution of Population III star clusters, including models with a primordial binary fraction of $f_{\rm b}=0$ and 1, using the $N$-body simulation code PETAR. We comprehensively examine the phenomenon of hierarchical triple black holes in the clusters, specifically focusing on their merging inner binary black holes (BBHs), with post-Newtonian correction, by using the TSUNAMI code. Our findings suggest a high likelihood of the inner BBHs containing IMBHs with masses on the order of $\mathcal{O}(100)M_{\odot}$, and as a result, their merger rate could be up to $0.1{\rm Gpc}^{-3}{\rm yr}^{-3}$. The orbital eccentricities of some merging inner BBHs oscillate over time periodically, known as the Kozai-Lidov oscillation, due to dynamical perturbations. Detectable merging inner BBHs for mHz GW detectors LISA/TianQin/Taiji concentrate within $z&lt;3$. More distant sources would be detectable for CE/ET/LIGO/KAGRA/DECIGO, which are sensitive from $\mathcal{O}(0.1)$Hz to $\mathcal{O}(100)$Hz. Furthermore, compared with merging isolated BBHs, merging inner BBHs affected by dynamical perturbations from tertiary BHs tend to have higher eccentricities, with a significant fraction of sources with eccentricities closing to 1 at mHz bands. GW observations would help constrain formation channels of merging BBHs, whether through isolated evolution or dynamical interaction, by examining eccentricities.</description>

      <title>Physics simulation capabilities of LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02091v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: [Abridged abstract] Large Language Models (LLMs) can solve some undergraduate-level to graduate-level physics textbook problems and are proficient at coding. Combining these two capabilities could one day enable AI systems to simulate and predict the physical world.
  We present an evaluation of state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs on PhD-level to research-level computational physics problems. We condition LLM generation on the use of well-documented and widely-used packages to elicit coding capabilities in the physics and astrophysics domains. We contribute $\sim 50$ original and challenging problems in celestial mechanics (with REBOUND), stellar physics (with MESA), 1D fluid dynamics (with Dedalus) and non-linear dynamics (with SciPy). Since our problems do not admit unique solutions, we evaluate LLM performance on several soft metrics: counts of lines that contain different types of errors (coding, physics, necessity and sufficiency) as well as a more "educational" Pass-Fail metric focused on capturing the salient physical ingredients of the problem at hand.
  As expected, today's SOTA LLM (GPT4) zero-shot fails most of our problems, although about 40\% of the solutions could plausibly get a passing grade. About $70-90 \%$ of the code lines produced are necessary, sufficient and correct (coding \&amp; physics). Physics and coding errors are the most common, with some unnecessary or insufficient lines. We observe significant variations across problem class and difficulty. We identify several failure modes of GPT4 in the computational physics domain.
  Our reconnaissance work provides a snapshot of current computational capabilities in classical physics and points to obvious improvement targets if AI systems are ever to reach a basic level of autonomy in physics simulation capabilities.</description>

      <title>Bayesian characterization of the young open cluster NGC 6383 using HDBSCAN and Gaia DR3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01030v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study focuses on determining the characteristics of the young open cluster NGC 6383. To achieve this, the HDBSCAN clustering algorithm is utilized to identify potential cluster members based on proper motions and parallaxes from Gaia Data Release 3. Various parameters of NGC 6383, such as tidal radius, core radius, distance through parallax and isochrone-fitting, proper motion, age, metallicity, and relevant others, are assessed. To perform this analysis, we utilize an extension of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, the No-U-Turn Sampler. The results of this analysis point out that NGC 6383 is a very young open cluster $(\sim 1 - 4~\mathrm{Myr})$, with a distance of $\sim 1.1~\mathrm{kpc}$.</description>

      <title>Neutron star kicks plus rockets as a mechanism for forming wide low-eccentricity neutron star binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20967v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent neutron star surface observations corroborate a long-standing theory that neutron stars may be accelerated over extended periods after their birth. We analyze how these prolonged rocket-like accelerations, combined with rapid birth kicks, impact binary orbits. We find that even a small contribution of rocket kicks combined with instantaneous natal kicks can allow binaries to reach period--eccentricity combinations unattainable in standard binary evolution models. We propose these kick + rocket combinations as a new channel to form wide low-eccentricity neutron star binaries such as Gaia NS1, as well as inducing stellar mergers months to years after a supernova to cause peculiar high-energy transients.</description>
