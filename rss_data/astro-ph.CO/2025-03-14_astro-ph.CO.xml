      <title>The lens mass in the Einstein ring JWST-ER1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: JWST has made several surprising discoveries, underscored by the `too early' appearance of well-formed galaxies and supermassive black holes. It recently also uncovered a compact galaxy (JWST-ER1g) associated with a complete Einstein ring (JWST-ER1r) at photometric redshift $z_l=1.94^{+0.13}_{-0.17}$, produced by a lensed galaxy at $z_s=2.98^{+0.42}_{-0.47}$. In two independent studies, this system ($M_{\rm lens}\sim 6.5\times 10^{11}\;M_\odot$) has yielded different conclusions concerning whether or not it requires an unexpected contribution of mass from sources other than stars and fiducial dark matter. The different redshift inferred by these two analysis for the lensed galaxy appears to be the culprit. In this paper, we examine the impact of the background cosmology on our interpretation of the JWST data. We compare the measured characteristics of JWST-ER1 in flat-$\Lambda$CDM with those emerging in the context of $R_{\rm h}=ct$. We show that, unlike the latter model's mitigation of the tension created by JWST's other discoveries, neither cosmology is favored by this particular Einstein ring. The disparity is common to both models, leaving open the question of whether a new type of mass, or a modified initial mass function, may be present in this source.</description>

      <title>The Extinction Law in SN Ia Hosts from Background Galaxy Measurements: Toward a 1% Determination of $H_0$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the most precise distance ladder determination of $H_0$, the observed near-infrared (NIR) fluxes of Cepheids are corrected for dust, assuming that the extinction law in large, star-forming spiral hosts of Type Ia supernovae (SN Ia) is similar to the Milky Way's average value of $R_V \approx 3.1$. Intriguingly, studies of SNe Ia often point to lower values for their hosts ($R_V \sim 2$). Ambiguities related to $R_V$ may limit future efforts to measure $H_0$ beyond $\sim 1\%$ precision. To better resolve extragalactic extinction laws, we directly measure the wavelength-dependent absorption of background galaxies seen in HST and JWST images (0.5--2.7 $\mu$m). We take the following steps: (i) subtract foreground stars to measure accurate photometry of background galaxies with a tool, $\texttt{SPHOT}$; (ii) measure their redshifts and spectroscopic features with Keck/DEIMOS; (iii) determine their intrinsic spectral energy distributions from the empirical templates which match the absorption lines and breaks in observed spectroscopic features, and (iv) measure $R_V$ by fitting the extinction model to the difference between the template and the observed SEDs. The above steps are tested with artificial datasets to insure they accurately recover the input $R_V$. We apply this set of steps to a first case, NGC 5584, a SN Ia host and a calibrator of the Hubble constant. The estimated value of $R_V$ for NGC 5584, $R_V=3.59^{+0.99}_{-0.62}(\text{stat})\pm0.19(\text{syst})$, is consistent with the MW-like extinction law, and it is $\gtrsim 3.5\sigma$ away from $R_V=2$ as favored by SN Ia. If additional hosts show similar results, it would suggest that SN Ia extinction may not be solely due to mean interstellar dust. We are now undertaking a statistical study of 5-10 SH0ES hosts to determine the distribution of host extinction laws.</description>

      <title>Full-Shape analysis of the power spectrum and bispectrum of DESI DR1 LRG and QSO samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first joint analysis of the power spectrum and bispectrum using the Data Release 1 (DR1) of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), focusing on Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs) and quasars (QSOs) across a redshift range of $0.4\leq z\leq2.1$. By combining the two- and three-point statistics, we are able to partially break the degeneracy between the logarithmic growth rate, $f(z)$, and the amplitude of dark matter fluctuations, $\sigma_\textrm{s8}(z)$, which cannot be measured separately in analyses that only involve the power spectrum. In comparison with the (fiducial) Planck $\Lambda$CDM cosmology we obtain $f/f^\textrm{fid}=\{0.888_{-0.089}^{+0.186},0.977_{-0.220}^{+0.182},1.030_{-0.085}^{+0.368}\}$, $\sigma_{s8}/\sigma^\textrm{fid}_\textrm{s8}=\{1.224_{-0.133}^{+0.091},1.071_{-0.163}^{+0.278},1.000_{-0.223}^{+0.088}\}$ respectively for the three LRG redshift bins, corresponding to a cumulative 10.1\% constraint on $f$, and of 8.4\% on $\sigma_\textrm{s8}$, including the systematic error budget. The cumulative constraints for the ShapeFit compressed parameters from our joint power spectrum-bispectrum analysis are respectively $\sigma_{\alpha_\textrm{iso}}=0.9\%$ (9\% improvement with respect to our power spectrum-only analysis); $\sigma_{\alpha_\textrm{AP}}=2.3\%$ (no improvement with respect to power spectrum-only analysis, which is expected given that the bispectrum monopole has no significant anisotropic signal); $\sigma_{f\sigma_\textrm{s8}}=5.1\%$ (9\% improvement); $\sigma_{m+n}=2.3\%$ (11\% improvement). These results are fully consistent with the main DESI power spectrum analysis, demonstrating the robustness of the DESI cosmological constraints, and compatible with Planck $\Lambda$CDM cosmology.</description>

      <title>Cosmology with Supernova Encore in the strong lensing cluster MACS J0138$-$2155: photometry, cluster members, and lens mass model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The strongly lensed Supernova (SN) Encore at a redshift of $z = 1.949$, discovered behind the galaxy cluster MACS J0138$-$2155 at $z=0.336$, provides a rare opportunity for time-delay cosmography and studies of the SN host galaxy, where previously another SN, called SN Requiem, had appeared. To enable these studies, we combine new James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) imaging, archival Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging, and new Very Large Telescope (VLT) spectroscopic data to construct state-of-the-art lens mass models that are composed of cluster dark-matter (DM) halos and galaxies. We determine the photometric and structural parameters of the galaxies across six JWST and five HST filters. We use the color-magnitude and color-color relations of spectroscopically-confirmed cluster members to select additional cluster members, identifying a total of 84 galaxies belonging to the galaxy cluster. We construct seven different mass models using a variety of DM halo mass profiles, and explore both multi-plane and approximate single-plane lens models. As constraints, we use the observed positions of 23 multiple images from eight multiply lensed sources at four distinct spectroscopic redshifts. In addition, we use stellar velocity dispersion measurements to obtain priors on the galaxy mass distributions. We find that six of the seven models fit well to the observed image positions. Mass models with cored-isothermal DM profiles fit well to the observations, whereas the mass model with a Navarro-Frenk-White cluster DM profile has an image-position $\chi^2$ value that is four times higher. We build our ultimate model by combining four multi-lens-plane mass models and predict the image positions and magnifications of SN Encore and SN Requiem. Our work lays the foundation for building state-of-the-art mass models of the cluster for future cosmological analysis and SN host galaxy studies.</description>

      <title>Observed unequal-time power spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The next generation of galaxy surveys will provide highly precise measurements of galaxy clustering, therefore requiring a corresponding accuracy. Current approaches, which rely on approximations and idealized assumptions, may fall short in capturing the level of detail required for high-precision observations. In order to increase the modeling accuracy, recently, unequal-time contributions to the galaxy power spectrum have been introduced in order to include the effects of radial correlations. We present a generalization of the formalism for the observed unequal-time power spectrum, that includes Doppler and local general relativistic corrections, plus local primordial non-Gaussianity. We find that unequal time corrections can potentially mimic an effective $f_{\mathrm{NL}}$ of order unity. We provide a first assessment of the significance of unequal-time corrections for future galaxy clustering experiments, estimating a Signal-to-Noise-Ratio of $\sim3$ for Stage IV-like surveys.</description>

      <title>Cosmological tensions and $\mathcal{Q}_{\rm CDM}$ as an alternative to $\Lambda$CDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Standard Model of cosmology, $\Lambda$CDM, while enormously successful, is currently unable to account for several cosmological anomalies the most prominent of which are in the measurements of the Hubble parameter and $S_8$. Additionally, the inclusion of the cosmological constant is theoretically unappealing. This has lead to extensions of the model such as the use of fluid equations for interacting dark matter and dark energy which, however, are ad hoc since they do not appear to arise from a Lagrangian. Recently, we have proposed $\mathcal{Q}_{\rm CDM}$ as an alternative to $\Lambda$CDM which is a dynamical model of a quintessence field interacting with dark matter within a field theoretic approach. In this approach, we analyze the effect of the dark matter mass, the dark matter-dark energy interaction strength and the dark matter self-interaction on the cosmological parameters. Further, within $\mathcal{Q}_{\rm CDM}$ we investigate the possible alleviation of the Hubble tension and the $S_8$ anomaly and the nature of dark energy.</description>

      <title>Modified gravity constraints with Planck ISW-lensing bispectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present updated constraints on modified gravity by including the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect from CMB lensing-CMB temperature cross-correlations, based on the latest Planck PR4 maps. Utilizing the Effective Field Theory of dark energy approach and adopting the $w_0w_a$CDM background cosmological model, we find that including the CMB ISW lensing cross-correlations tighten constraints on the modified gravity parameters by approximately $20\%$, reducing the viable parameter space by $50$-$80\%$. We derive constraints from Planck CMB, Planck and ACT CMB lensing, DESI DR1 BAO, CMB ISW-lensing, and type Ia supernovae (SN Ia) data. Our results are consistent with General Relativity (GR) at the $95\%$ CL. The modified gravity model shows a mild preference for an evolving dark energy at the $1.8\sigma$, $2.6\sigma$ and $3.2\sigma$ levels for the combinations with Pantheon+, Union3 and DESY5 supernova datasets. We find that using the latest likelihoods $\texttt{HiLLiPoP}+\texttt{LoLLiPoP}$ alleviates the departure of modified gravity parameters from the GR-values compared to results using Planck 2018 data. This paper underlines the importance of the ISW lensing probe in constraining late-time modifications of gravity.</description>

      <title>The SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Survey : Subaru/HSC-SSP weak-lensing mass measurements for the eRASS1 Galaxy Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform individual weak-lensing (WL) mass measurements for 78 eROSITA's first All-Sky Survey (eRASS1) clusters in the footprint of Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP) S19A, without any priors of the eRASS1 X-ray quantities or assumption of the mass and concentration relation. In the sample, we find 3 clusters are mis-associated with optical counterparts and 12 clusters are poorly fitted with an NFW profile. The average mass for the 12 poor-fit clusters changes from $\sim 10^{14}h_{70}^{-1}M_\odot$ to $\sim 2\times 10^{13}h_{70}^{-1}M_\odot$ when lensing contamination from surrounding mass structures is taken into account. The scaling relations between the true mass and cluster richness and X-ray count-rate agree well with the results of the eRASS1 Western Galactic Hemisphere region based on count-rate-inferred masses, which are calibrated with the HSC-SSP, DES, and KiDS surveys. We develop a Bayesian framework for inferring the mass-concentration relation of the cluster sample, explicitly incorporating the effects of weak-lensing mass calibration in the mass-concentration parameter space. The redshift-dependent mass and concentration relation is in excellent agreement with predictions of dark-matter-only numerical simulations and previous studies using X-ray-selected clusters. Based on the two-dimensional (2D) WL analysis, the offsets between the WL-determined centers and the X-ray centroids for 36 eRASS1 clusters with high WL S/N are described by two Gaussian components. We find that the mis-centering effect with X-ray centroids is smaller than that with peaks in the galaxy maps. The projected halo ellipticity is $\langle \varepsilon \rangle=0.45$ at $M_{200}\sim 4\times10^{14}h_{70}^{-1}M_\odot$, in agreement with results of numerical simulations and previous studies of clusters more than twice our mass.</description>

      <title>Tantalizing Evidence of Reionization Relics in the eBOSS DR16 Ly$\boldsymbol{\alpha}$ Forest Correlations: a Preference for Early Reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic reionization of HI leaves enduring relics in the post-reionization intergalactic medium, potentially influencing the Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) forest down to redshifts as low as $z \approx 2$, which is the so-called ''memory of reionization'' effect. Here, we re-analyze the baryonic acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements from Ly$\alpha$ absorption and quasar correlations using data from the extended Baryonic Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) Data Release 16 (DR16), incorporating for the first time the memory of reionization in the Ly$\alpha$ forest. Three distinct scenarios of reionization timeline are considered in our analyses. We find that the recovered BAO parameters ($\alpha_\parallel$, $\alpha_\perp$) remain consistent with the original eBOSS DR16 analysis. However, models incorporating reionization relics provide a better fit to the data, with a tantalizing preference for early reionization, consistent with recent findings from the James Webb Space Telescope. Furthermore, the inclusion of reionization relics significantly impacts the non-BAO parameters. For instance, we report deviations of up to $3\sigma$ in the Ly$\alpha$ redshift-space distortion parameter and $\sim7\sigma$ in the linear Ly$\alpha$ bias for the late reionization scenario. Our findings suggest that the eBOSS Ly$\alpha$ data is more accurately described by models that incorporate a broadband enhancement to the Ly$\alpha$ forest power spectrum, highlighting the importance of accounting for reionization relics in cosmological analyses.</description>

      <title>Model-independent $H_0$ within FLRW: Joint constraints from GWTC-3 standard sirens and strong lensing time delays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hubble tension has emerged as a critical crisis in cosmology, with the cause remaining unclear. Determining the Hubble constant ($H_0$) independently of cosmological models and distance ladders will help resolve this crisis. In this letter, we for the first time use 47 gravitational-wave (GW) standard sirens from the third Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog to calibrate distances in the strong lensing system, RXJ1131-1231, and constrain $H_0$ through the distance-sum rule, with minimal cosmological assumptions. We assume that light propagation over long distances is described by the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker metric and that geometrical optics holds, but we do not need to assume the universe's contents or the theory of gravity on cosmological scales. Fixing $\Omega_K=0$, we obtain $H_0=73.22^{+5.95}_{-5.43}$ ${\rm km}~{\rm s}^{-1}~{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ and $H_0=70.40^{+8.03}_{-5.60}$ ${\rm km}~{\rm s}^{-1}~{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ by using the deflector galaxy's mass model and kinematic measurements to break mass-sheet transform, respectively. When $\Omega_K$ is not fixed, the central value of $H_0$ increases further. We find that our results are still dominated by statistical errors, and at the same time, we notice the great potential of using GW dark sirens to provide calibration, owing to their higher redshifts. When using 42 binary black holes and RXJ1131-1231, we obtain a $8.46 \%$ $H_0$ constraint precision, which is better than that from the bright siren GW170817 using the Hubble law by about $40\%$. In the future, as the redshift range of GW dark sirens increases, more and more SGLTDs can be included, and we can achieve high-precision, model-independent measurements of $H_0$ without the need for GW bright sirens.</description>

      <title>The stochastic gravitational wave background from cosmic superstrings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the stochastic gravitational wave background sourced by a network of cosmic superstrings and demonstrate that incorporating higher-mass string species, beyond the fundamental string, is crucial for accurately modeling the resulting gravitational wave spectrum across frequencies ranging from nanohertz to kilohertz. Using the multi-tension velocity-dependent one-scale model to evolve the cosmic superstring network, we perform several fits to the NANOGrav 15-year dataset and obtain expectation values for the fundamental string tension, string coupling and effective size of compact extra dimensions. We find that the cosmic superstring best-fits are comparable in likelihood to Supermassive Black Hole models, thought by many to be the leading candidate explanation of the signal. The implications of the best-fit spectra are discussed within the context of future gravitational wave experiments. We obtain expectation values for the fundamental string tension of $\log_{10}(G\mu_1)=-11.5^{+0.3}_{-0.3}$($-11.6^{+0.2}_{-0.3}$) for gravitational waves originating from large cuspy (kinky) cosmic superstring loops and $\log_{10}(G\mu_1)=-9.7^{+0.7}_{-0.7}$($-9.9^{+1.0}_{-0.5}$) for small cuspy (kinky) loops. We also place $2\sigma$ upper bounds on the string coupling, finding $g_s&lt;0.65$ in all cases, and comment on the implication of our results for the effective size of the compact extra dimensions.</description>

      <title>A search for sterile neutrinos in interacting dark energy models using DESI baryon acoustic oscillations and DES supernovae data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sterile neutrinos can influence the evolution of the universe, and thus cosmological observations can be used to search for sterile neutrinos. In this study, we utilized the latest baryon acoustic oscillations data from DESI, combined with the cosmic microwave background data from Planck and the five-year supernova data from DES, to constrain the interacting dark energy (IDE) models involving both cases of massless and massive sterile neutrinos. We consider four typical forms of the interaction term $Q=\beta H \rho_{\rm de}$, $Q=\beta H \rho_{\rm c}$, $Q=\beta H_{0} \rho_{\rm de}$, and $Q=\beta H_{0} \rho_{\rm c}$, respectively. Our analysis indicates that the current data provide only a hint of the existence of massless sterile neutrinos (as dark radiation) at about the $1\sigma$ level. In contrast, no evidence supports the existence of massive sterile neutrinos. Furthermore, in IDE models, the inclusion of (massless/massive) sterile neutrinos has a negligible impact on the constraint of the coupling parameter $\beta$. The IDE model of $Q=\beta H \rho_{\rm c}$ with sterile neutrinos does not favor an interaction. However, the other three IDE models with sterile neutrinos support an interaction in which dark energy decays into dark matter.</description>

      <title>Self-interacting neutrinos in light of recent CMB and LSS data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We update constraints on a simple model of self-interacting neutrinos involving a heavy scalar mediator with universal flavor coupling. According to past literature, such a model is allowed by Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data, with some CMB and large-scale structure data even favoring a strongly-interacting neutrino (SI$\nu$) scenario over $\Lambda$CDM. In this work, we re-evaluate the constraints on this model in light of the new Planck NPIPE data, DESI BAO data, and the Effective Field Theory of Large Scale Structures (EFTofLSS) applied to BOSS data. We find that Planck NPIPE are more permissive to the SI$\nu$ scenario and that DESI data favor the SI$\nu$ over $\Lambda$CDM. However, when considering EFTofBOSS data, this mode is no longer preferred. Therefore, new DESI data analyzed under the EFTofLSS are particularly awaited to shed light on this disagreement.</description>

      <title>Knot reconstruction of the scalar primordial power spectrum with Planck, ACT, and SPT CMB data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a non-parametric Bayesian method for reconstructing the primordial power spectrum (PPS) of scalar perturbations using temperature and polarisation data from the {\em Planck}, ACT, and SPT CMB experiments. This reconstruction method is based on linear splines for the PPS between nodes in $k$-space whose amplitudes and positions are allowed to vary. All three data sets consistently show no significant deviations from a power-law form in the range $0.005 \lesssim k\,\mathrm{Mpc} \lesssim 0.16$ independent of the number of knots adopted to perform the reconstruction. The addition of high-resolution CMB measurements from ACT and SPT slightly improves the range of scales of the scalar PPS which are well constrained around a power law up to $k \simeq 0.25\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ and $k \simeq 0.2\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, respectively. At large scales, a potential oscillatory feature in the primordial power spectrum appears when we consider six or more nodes. We test the robustness of the methodology and our results by varying the detailed number of knots from $N=2$ to $N=10$. We have used the reconstructed scalar PPS to derive several quantities related to inflationary related to inflationary dynamics, such as the effective scalar spectral index, which describes the dependence of the PPS on the scales and parameters associated with the effective field theory of inflation, to provide information on possible departures from the standard single-field canonical case. Finally, we investigate whether the excess of smoothing in the region of the region of the acoustic peaks of the CMB anisotropy temperature power spectrum in the \textit{Planck} PR3 data is degenerate with our reconstructions of the PPS, but find no significant correlation between them.</description>

      <title>Parameter estimation of gravitational-wave signals with frequency-dependent antenna responses and higher-modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We implement frequency-dependent antenna responses and develop likelihood classes (standard likelihood, multibanded likelihood, and the relative binning (RB) likelihood) capable of handling the same within the framework of \texttt{Bilby}. We validate the approximate likelihoods by comparing them with the exact likelihood for a GW170817-like signal (signal-to-noise ratio ~ 1900) containing higher-order modes of radiation. We use the relative-binning likelihood to perform parameter estimation (PE) for a GW170817-like signal, including Earth-rotation effects, detector-size effects, and higher-order modes. We study the system in several detector networks consisting of a single 40 km Cosmic Explorer, a 20 km CE and a present-generation detector at A+ sensitivity. The PE runs with RB take around a day to complete on a typical cluster.</description>

      <title>Enhanced strong lensing model of MACS J0138.0$-$2155 thanks to new JWST and VLT/MUSE observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new parametric strong lensing analysis of the galaxy cluster MACS J0138.0-2155 at z = 0.336, the first known to show two multiply-imaged supernova (SN) siblings, SN Requiem and SN Encore at z= 1.949. We exploit HST and JWST multiband imaging in synergy with new MUSE spectroscopy to develop an improved lens mass model. We include 84 cluster members (of which ~60% are spectroscopically confirmed) and two perturber galaxies along the line of sight. Our observables consist of 23 spectroscopically confirmed multiple images from 8 background sources, spanning a fairly wide redshift range, from 0.767 to 3.420. To accurately characterise the sub-halo mass component, we calibrate the Faber-Jackson scaling relation based on the stellar kinematics of 14 bright cluster galaxies. We build several lens models, with different cluster total mass parametrisations, to assess the statistical and systematic uncertainties on the predicted values of the position and magnification of the observed and future multiple images of SN Requiem and SN Encore. Our reference best-fit lens model reproduces the observed positions of the multiple images with a root-mean-square offset of 0".36, and the multiple image positions of the SNe and their host galaxy with a remarkable mean precision of only 0".05. We measure a projected total mass of $M(&lt;60~ \rm kpc) = 2.89_{-0.03}^{+0.04} \times 10^{13} M_{\odot}$, consistent with that independently derived from the Chandra X-ray analysis. We demonstrate the reliability of the new lens model by reconstructing the extended surface-brightness distribution of the multiple images of the host galaxy. The discrepancy between our model-predicted magnification values with those from previous studies, critical for understanding the intrinsic properties of the SNe and their host galaxy, underscores the need to combine cutting-edge observations with detailed lens modelling.</description>

      <title>Further constraining the neutron star-black hole merger rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current template-based gravitational-wave searches for compact binary mergers neglect the general relativistic phenomenon of spin-induced orbital precession. Owing to their asymmetric masses, gravitational-waves from neutron star-black hole (NSBH) binaries are prime candidates for displaying strong imprints of spin-precession. As a result, current searches may be missing a significant fraction of the astrophysical population, and the detected NSBH population may be significantly suppressed or biased. Here we report the most sensitive search for NSBH binaries to date by including spin-precession for the first time. We analyze data from the entirety of the third LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA gravitational-wave observing run and show that when accounting for spin-precession, our search is up to 100% more sensitive than the search techniques currently adopted by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration (for systems with strong precessional effects). This allows us to more tightly constrain the rate of NSBH mergers in the local Universe. Firstly, we focus on a precessing subpopulation of NSBH mergers; the lack of observed candidates allows us to place an upper limit on the merger rate of $R_{90} = 79\, \mathrm{Gpc}^{-3}\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ with 90% confidence. Secondly, we tighten the overall rate of NSBH mergers; we show that if there is no preferred direction of component spin, the rate of NSBH mergers is on average 16% smaller than previously believed. Finally, we report four new subthreshold NSBH candidates, all with strong imprints of spin precession, but note that these are most likely to be of terrestrial origin.</description>

      <title>Results from NASA's First Radio Telescope on the Moon: Terrestrial Technosignatures and the Low-Frequency Galactic Background Observed by ROLSES-1 Onboard the Odysseus Lander</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radiowave Observations on the Lunar Surface of the photo-Electron Sheath instrument (ROLSES- 1) onboard the Intuitive Machines' Odysseus lunar lander represents NASA's first radio telescope on the Moon, and the first United States spacecraft landing on the lunar surface in five decades. Despite a host of challenges, ROLSES-1 managed to collect a small amount of data over fractions of one day during cruise phase and two days on the lunar surface with four monopole stacer antennas that were in a non-ideal deployment. All antennas recorded shortwave radio transmissions breaking through the Earth's ionosphere -- or terrestrial technosignatures -- from spectral and raw waveform data. These technosignatures appear to be modulated by density fluctuations in the Earth's ionosphere and could be used as markers when searching for extraterrestrial intelligence from habitable exoplanets. After data reduction and marshaling a host of statistical and sampling techniques, five minutes of raw waveforms from the least noisy antenna were used to generate covariances constraining both the antenna parameters and the amplitude of the low-frequency isotropic galactic spectrum. ROLSES- 2 and LuSEE-Night, both lunar radio telescopes launching later in the decade, will have significant upgrades from ROLSES-1 and will be set to take unprecedented measurements of the low-frequency sky, lunar surface, and constrain the cosmological 21-cm signal. ROLSES-1 represents a trailblazer for lunar radio telescopes, and many of the statistical tools and data reduction techniques presented in this work will be invaluable for upcoming lunar radio telescope missions.</description>

      <title>Probing Leptogenesis at LISA: A Fisher analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In JCAP 11 (2024) 051, we discussed how different regimes (flavoured) of leptogenesis can be probed through a ``tomographic'' approach using primordial gravitational waves. By examining the theory's parameter space, we identified regions where right-handed neutrino mass-dependent non-standard cosmological expansion leaves characteristic imprints on propagating gravitational waves. Our analysis focused on inflationary blue-tilted gravitational waves, modeled by a power-law tensor power spectrum with a constant spectral index. The resulting double-peak spectrum -- where peak and dip frequencies are sensitive to leptogenesis parameters -- provided marked signatures of different leptogenesis regimes. In this follow-up article, we conduct a statistical analysis of two-flavour leptogenesis signals, particularly those producing a peak (more generally, a broken power-law signal) within the LISA frequency band. Using a Fisher matrix analysis, we delineate the regions of parameter space that LISA can probe with minimal uncertainty, accounting for galactic and extragalactic foregrounds along with LISA's instrumental noise.</description>

      <title>Modelling subsonic turbulence with SPH-EXA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The numerical simulation of subsonic turbulence with SPH has traditionally been hindered by E0 errors, inaccurate gradient evaluations, and excessive dissipation. In this work, we present numerical results of SPH simulations of subsonic turbulence and compare to state-of-the-art codes such as AREPO and GIZMO. For the first time, SPH can reproduce the results of such codes, showing a similar interval of wavenumber in the inertial range of the Kolmogorov cascade in the subsonic regime. We use the SPH-EXA code to perform these simulations, a GPU-based state-of-the-art SPH code with high performance and extreme scalability at its core. SPH-EXA is coupled with a modern SPH solver based on methods such as an integral approach to gradient calculation, artificial viscosity switches that include a linear field cleaner, a flexible family of pairing-resistant interpolation kernels, generalized volume elements, and a controlled handling of density jumps which maximizes Lagrangian compatibility. In addition, it includes a novel and extremely scalable gravity solver for astrophysical applications.</description>

      <title>Does thermal leptogenesis in a canonical seesaw rely on initial memory?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is a common lore that in the thermal leptogenesis in the type-1 seesaw scenario with the conventional hierarchy of heavy right-handed neutrinos (RHNs), the CP violating, out-of-equilibrium decay of the lightest RHN ($N_1$) is the only relevant source of $B-L$ asymmetry. Any asymmetry produced by the heavier RHNs ($N_2$ and $N_3$) gets washed out by the lepton number violating processes mediated by $N_1$. In this paper, we examine this assumption comprehensively, considering decay and inverse decay processes as well as the inclusion of scatterings. We find that the above said assumption is true only if all the RHNs ($N_1, N_2$ and $N_3$) are in strong washout regime. However, we saw that, to satisfy the neutrino masses and mixing given by the low energy neutrino oscillation data, at most one of the RHNs can be in the weak washout regime. This leads to, if $N_1$ is in the weak washout regime, then the washout parameters of $N_2$ and $N_3$ can be chosen in such a way that the impact of $N_2$ and $N_3$ on the final $B-L$ asymmetry is relatively small. On the other hand, if $N_2$ or $N_3$ is in weak washout regime, then the asymmetry produced by them can affect the final $B-L$ asymmetry even if $N_1$ is in the strong washout regime, which we call the memory effect. We delineated the parameter space where the memory effect is significant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04991v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The primordial power spectrum of curvature perturbations has been well-measured on large scales but remains fairly unconstrained at smaller scales, where significant deviations from $\Lambda$CDM may occur. Measurements of 21-cm intensity mapping in the dark ages promise to access very small scales that have yet to be probed, extending beyond the reach of cosmic microwave background and galaxy surveys. In this paper, we investigate how small-scale power-law enhancements -- or blue tilts -- of the primordial power spectrum affect the 21-cm power spectrum. We consider generic enhancements due to curvature modes, isocurvature modes, and runnings of the spectral tilt. We present forecasts for Earth- and lunar-based instruments to detect a blue-tilted primordial spectrum. We find that an Earth-based instrument capable of reaching the dark ages could detect any enhancements of power on nearly all the scales it can observe, which depends on the baseline of the interferometer. The smallest scales observed by such an instrument can only detect a very strong enhancement. However, an instrument on the far side of the Moon of the same size would be able to probe shallower slopes with higher precision. We forecast results for instruments with $100 \, {\rm km} \, (3000 \, {\rm km})$ baselines and find that they can probe up to scales of order $k_{\rm max} \sim 8 \, {\rm Mpc}^{-1} \, (k_{\rm max} \sim 250 \, {\rm Mpc}^{-1})$, thereby providing invaluable information on exotic physics and testing inflationary models on scales not otherwise accessible.</description>

      <title>A p&lt;0.0001 detection of CMB cooling in galactic halos and its possible relation to dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15307v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We confirm at the $5.7\sigma$ level previous studies reporting Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) temperatures being significantly lower around nearby spiral galaxies than expected in the $\Lambda$CDM model. Results from our earlier work was disputed in a recent paper, but in that paper, areas far beyond the galactic halos were included in the analysis while the neighborhood of the galaxies where the main signal is seen was disregarded. Here we limit the study to pixels well within the galactic halos, focus on galaxies in dense cosmic filaments and improve on signal-to-noise compared to previous studies. The average CMB temperature in discs around these galaxies is always much lower in Planck data than in any of the 10.000 Planck-like CMB simulations. Even when correcting for the look-elsewhere-effect, the detection is still at the $3-4\sigma$ level. We further show that the largest scales ($\ell&lt;16$) of the Planck CMB fluctuations are more correlated with the distribution of nearby galaxies than $99.99\%$ of simulated CMB maps. We argue that the existence of a new CMB foreground cannot be ignored and a physical interaction mechanism, possibly involving dark matter, as well as linked to intergalactic magnetic fields, should be sought.</description>

Abstract: Cosmic shear, galaxy clustering, and the abundance of massive halos each probe the large-scale structure of the Universe in complementary ways. We present cosmological constraints from the joint analysis of the three probes, building on the latest analyses of the lensing-informed abundance of clusters identified by the South Pole Telescope (SPT) and of the auto- and cross-correlation of galaxy position and weak lensing measurements (3$\times$2pt) in the Dark Energy Survey (DES). We consider the cosmological correlation between the different tracers and we account for the systematic uncertainties that are shared between the large-scale lensing correlation functions and the small-scale lensing-based cluster mass calibration. Marginalized over the remaining $\Lambda$ cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) parameters (including the sum of neutrino masses) and 52 astrophysical modeling parameters, we measure $\Omega_\mathrm{m}=0.300\pm0.017$ and $\sigma_8=0.797\pm0.026$. Compared to constraints from Planck primary cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies, our constraints are only 15% wider with a probability to exceed of 0.22 ($1.2\sigma$) for the two-parameter difference. We further obtain $S_8\equiv\sigma_8(\Omega_\mathrm{m}/0.3)^{0.5}=0.796\pm0.013$ which is lower than the Planck measurement at the $1.6\sigma$ level. The combined SPT cluster, DES 3$\times$2pt, and Planck datasets mildly prefer a nonzero positive neutrino mass, with a 95% upper limit $\sum m_\nu&lt;0.25~\mathrm{eV}$ on the sum of neutrino masses. Assuming a $w$CDM model, we constrain the dark energy equation of state parameter $w=-1.15^{+0.23}_{-0.17}$ and when combining with Planck primary CMB anisotropies, we recover $w=-1.20^{+0.15}_{-0.09}$, a $1.7\sigma$ difference with a cosmological constant. The precision of our results highlights the benefits of multiwavelength multiprobe cosmology.</description>

      <title>Future Cosmology: New Physics and Opportunity from the China Space Station Telescope (CSST)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15023v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The China Space Station Telescope (CSST) is the next-generation Stage~IV survey telescope. It can simultaneously perform multi-band imaging and slitless spectroscopic wide- and deep-field surveys in ten years and an ultra-deep field (UDF) survey in two years, which are suitable for cosmological studies. Here we review several CSST cosmological probes, such as weak gravitational lensing, two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) galaxy clustering, galaxy cluster abundance, cosmic void, Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), and baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO), and explore their capabilities and prospects in discovering new physics and opportunities in cosmology. We find that CSST will measure the matter distribution from small to large scales and the expansion history of the Universe with extremely high accuracy, which can provide percent-level stringent constraints on the properties of dark energy and dark matter and precisely test the theories of gravity.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Strings-induced CMB anisotropies in light of Weighted Morphology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00758v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the morphological measures in assessing the geometrical and topological properties of a generic cosmological stochastic field, we propose an extension of the weighted morphological measures, specifically the $n$th conditional moments of derivative (cmd-$n$). This criterion assigns a distinct weight to each excursion set point based on the associated field. We apply the cmd-$n$ on the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) to identify the cosmic string networks (CSs) through their unique Gott-Kaiser-Stebbins effect on the temperature anisotropies. We also formulate the perturbative expansion of cmd-$n$ for the weak non-Gaussian regime up to $\mathcal{O}(\sigma_0^3)$. We propose a comprehensive pipeline designed to analyze the morphological properties of string-induced CMB maps within the flat sky approximation. To evaluate the robustness of our proposed criteria, we employ string-induced high-resolution flat-sky CMB simulated patches of $7.2$ deg$^2$ size with a resolution of $0.42$ arc-minutes. Our results demonstrate that the minimum detectable value of cosmic string tension is $G\mu\gtrsim 1.9\times 10^{-7}$ when a noise-free map is analyzed with normalized cmd-$n$. Whereas for the ACT, CMB-S4, and Planck-like experiments at 95.45\% confidence level, the normalized cmd-$n$ can distinguish the CSs network for $G\mu\gtrsim2.9 \times 10^{-7}$, $G\mu\gtrsim 2.4\times 10^{-7}$ and $G\mu\gtrsim 5.8\times 10^{-7}$, respectively. The normalized cmd-$n$ exhibits a significantly enhanced capability in detecting CSs relative to the Minkowski Functionals.</description>

      <title>Friedmann's Universe Controlled by Gauss-Bonnet Modified Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13860v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The accepted idea that the expansion of the universe is accelerating needs, for compatibility to general relativity, the introduction of some unusual forms of matter. However, several authors have proposed that instead of making weird hypothesis on some yet unobservable species of matter, one should follow the original idea of the first Einstein's paper on cosmology and consider that in the cosmic scene one has to modify the equations that controls the gravitational metric. This possibility led us to re-examine the evolution of the topological invariant containing two duals in a dynamical universe, the so called Gauss-Bonnet topological invariant. The particular interest on this invariant is due to the fact that in a homogeneous and isotropic universe this invariant drives the cosmic acceleration. In a decelerating scenario and as a necessary previous condition of an ulterior acceleration this invariant must have an extremum identified to its maximum value. We will examine the conditions for this to occur, and a description of the universe with epochs of accelerated and decelerated expansion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03725v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To investigate the model and extra frictional effects in standard siren simulation of $f(Q)$ cosmologies, we simulated three types of standard siren data based on different fiducial models ($\Lambda$CDM and $f(Q)$ models). Both effects are important in standard siren simulation. Explicitly, the $f(Q)_P$ and $f(Q)_E$ models need more observational data (e.g.growth factor) to further study. The $f(Q)_{PE}$ model could be ruled out by the EM data. And both the $f(Q)_{HT}$ models will be excluded by the future standard siren data.</description>

      <title>Particle creation from non-geodesic trajectories in multifield inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13843v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Particle production in de Sitter spacetime arises from the exponential expansion of space, rendering the Bunch-Davies vacuum perceived as a particle-containing state by late-time observers. For states defined as eigenstates of both momentum and the Hamiltonian, the Bunch-Davies vacuum exhibits a constant particle density per physical momentum. We explore particle production beyond this baseline, focusing on deviations from exact de Sitter conditions and non-gravitational interactions, such as slow-roll inflation or interactions arising from the coupling of inflation to other fields. Using Bogoliubov transformations, we calculate the number density of energy/momentum eigenstates. In single-field inflation, this density captures the observed spectral index of the primordial power spectrum, while in two-field models, it reflects the non-gravitational coupling driving background trajectory turning. We present analytical results applicable to various scenarios involving particle production from non-adiabatic processes during inflation.</description>

      <title>Mapping the Cosmic Gamma-ray Horizon: The 1CGH Catalogue of Fermi-LAT detections above 10 GeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18431v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the First Cosmic Gamma-ray Horizon (1CGH) catalogue, featuring $\gamma$-ray detections above 10 GeV based on 16 years of observations with the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) satellite. After carefully selecting a sample of blazars and blazar candidates from catalogues in the literature, we performed a binned likelihood analysis and identified 2791 $\gamma$-ray emitters above 10 GeV, at &gt;3$\sigma$ level, including 62 that are new $\gamma$-ray detections. For each source, we estimated the mean energy of the highest-energy bin and analysed them in the context of the cosmic gamma-ray horizon. By adopting a reference model for the Extragalactic Background Light (EBL), we identified a subsample of 525 sources where moderate to severe $\gamma$-ray absorption could be detected across the redshift range of 0 to 3. This work provides the most up-to-date compilation of detections above 10 GeV, along with their redshift information. We condense extensive results from the literature, including reports on observational campaigns dedicated to blazars and $\gamma$-ray sources, thereby delivering an unprecedented review of the redshift information for sources detected above 10 GeV. Additionally, we highlight key 1CGH sources where redshift information remains incomplete, offering guidance for future optical observation campaigns. The 1CGH catalogue aims to track the most significant sources for studying the $\gamma$-ray transparency of the Universe. Furthermore, it provides a targeted subsample where the EBL optical depth, $\tau_{(E,z)}$, can be robustly measured using Fermi-LAT data.</description>

      <title>Cosmology with Supernova Encore in the lensing cluster MACS J0138$-$2155 -- Spectroscopy with MUSE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13250v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a spectroscopic analysis of MACS J0138$-$2155, at $z=0.336$, the first galaxy cluster hosting two strongly-lensed supernovae (SNe), Requiem and Encore, providing us with a chance to obtain a reliable $H_0$ measurement from the time delays between the multiple images. We take advantage of new data from the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) on the Very Large Telescope, covering a central $1 \rm \, arcmin^2$ of the lensing cluster, for a total depth of 3.7 hours, including 2.9 hours recently obtained by our Target of Opportunity programme. Our new spectroscopic catalogue contains reliable redshifts for 107 objects, including 50 galaxy cluster members with secure redshift values in the range $0.324 &lt; z &lt; 0.349$, and 13 lensed multiple images from four background sources between $0.767\leq z \leq 3.420$, including four images of the host galaxy of the two SNe. We exploit the MUSE data to study the stellar kinematics of 14 bright cluster members and two background galaxies, obtaining reliable measurements of their line-of-sight velocity dispersion. Finally, we combine these results with measurements of the total magnitude of the cluster members in the Hubble Space Telescope F160W band to calibrate the Faber-Jackson relation between luminosity and stellar velocity dispersion ($L \propto \sigma^{1/\alpha}$) for the early-type cluster member galaxies, measuring a slope $\alpha=0.25^{+0.05}_{-0.05}$. A pure and complete sample of cluster member galaxies and a reliable characterisation of their total mass structure are key to building accurate total mass maps of the cluster, mitigating the impact of parametric degeneracies, which is necessary for inferring the value of $H_0$ from the measured time delays between the lensed images of the two SNe.</description>

      <title>Axion misalignment with memory-burdened PBH</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04076v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the possibility of producing axion dark matter (DM) via misalignment mechanisms in a non-standard cosmological era dominated by ultra-light primordial black holes (PBH). While the effect of PBH domination on the production of axion via vacuum misalignment is known assuming the PBH evaporation to proceed according to Hawking's semi-classical (SC) approximation, we go beyond these simplest possibilities to include kinetic misalignment of axion and backreaction effect of emitted particles on the PBH themselves, referred to as the memory-burden (MB) effect. We show that, depending upon the type of misalignment mechanism and PBH evaporation regime, the axion as well as PBH parameter space consistent with the observed DM relic changes significantly having interesting implications for axion detection experiments. PBH also offer complementary detection prospects via gravitational wave due to PBH density fluctuations and excess radiation due to emission of hot axions within reach of future cosmic microwave background experiments.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Ultraviolet Freeze-in in General Reheating Scenarios</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04774v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of cosmic reheating, that is, on how the energy stored in the inflaton is transferred to the standard model (SM) thermal bath, is largely unknown. In this work, we show that the phenomenology of the nonbaryonic dark matter (DM) ultraviolet freeze-in production strongly depends on the dynamics of the cosmic-reheating era. Using a general parametrization for the Hubble expansion rate and SM temperature, we thoroughly investigate DM production during reheating, not only recovering earlier findings that focused on specific cases, but also exploring alternative scenarios. Additionally, we derive a generalized framework for DM production via inflaton decays and identify the viable parameter space, while simultaneously addressing constraints from CMB observations. As illustrative examples, we explore gravitational DM production through scatterings of SM particles or inflatons, deriving well-defined parameter regions for these scenarios.</description>

      <title>Determination of galaxy photometric redshifts using Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CGANs)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06532v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate and reliable photometric redshift determination is one of the key aspects for wide-field photometric surveys. Determination of photometric redshift for galaxies, has been traditionally solved by use of machine-learning and artificial intelligence techniques trained on a calibration sample of galaxies, where both photometry and spectrometry are available. On this paper, we present a new algorithmic approach for determining photometric redshifts of galaxies using Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CGANs). The proposed implementation is able to determine both point-estimation and probability-density estimations for photometric redshifts. The methodology is tested with data from Dark Energy Survey (DES) Y1 data and compared with other existing algorithm such as a Mixture Density Network (MDN). Although results obtained show a superiority of MDN, CGAN quality-metrics are close to the MDN results, opening the door to the use of CGAN at photometric redshift estimation.</description>

      <title>Sub-GeV dark matter and nano-Hertz gravitational waves from a classically conformal dark sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19478v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strong first-order phase transitions in a dark sector offer a compelling explanation for the stochastic gravitational wave background in the nano-Hertz range recently detected by pulsar timing arrays (PTAs). We explore the possibility that such a phase transition at the same time gives mass to a stable fermion that accounts for the observed dark matter abundance and leads to testable effects in laboratory experiments. Concretely, we consider a classically conformal dark sector with a hidden $U(1)^\prime$ gauge symmetry that couples to the Standard Model via kinetic mixing. Since the PTA signal requires a phase transition in the MeV temperature range, spontaneous symmetry breaking gives rise to a sub-GeV dark matter candidate that couples to the Standard Model via a dark photon mediator and obtains its relic abundance via annihilations into electrons and dark Higgs bosons. Such a scenario is tightly constrained by laboratory searches for dark photons and cosmological constraints on the decays of dark Higgs bosons after the phase transition. We show that viable parameter regions can be found both for the case that the dark Higgs bosons remain in equilibrium with the Standard Model and that they decouple and only decay much later. In the latter case, the parameter regions preferred by the PTA signal and the dark matter relic abundance can be fully explored by future beam-dump experiments searching for missing energy.</description>
