      <title>Modified Jost solutions of Schr\"odinger operators with locally $H^{-1}$ potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Jost solutions of Schr\"odinger operators with potentials which decay with respect to a local $H^{-1}$ Sobolev norm; in particular, we generalize to this setting the results of Christ--Kiselev for potentials between the integrable and square-integrable rates of decay, proving existence of solutions with WKB asymptotic behavior on a large set of positive energies. This applies to new classes of potentials which are not locally integrable, or have better decay properties with respect to the $H^{-1}$ norm due to rapid oscillations.</description>

      <title>On the (growing) gap between Dirichlet and Neumann eigenvalues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide an answer to a question raised by Levine and Weinberger in their $1986$ paper concerning the difference between Dirichlet and Neumann eigenvalues of the Laplacian on bounded domains in $\R^{n}$. More precisely, we show that for a certain class of domains there exists a sequence $p(k)$ such that $\lambda_{k}\geq \mu_{k+ p(k)}$ for sufficiently large $k$. This sequence, which is given explicitly, grows with $k^{1-1/n}$ as $k$ goes to infinity, which we conjecture to be optimal, and may be chosen independently of the domain. We also prove the existence of a sequence, now not given explicitly and only of order $k^{1-3/n}$ but valid for bounded Lipschitz domains in $\R^{n} (n\geq4)$, for which a similar inequality holds for all $k$. From these results and the analysis of some particular examples we formulate a conjecture for general Euclidean domains.</description>

      <title>On the Laplace operator with a weak magnetic field in exterior domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the magnetic Laplacian in a two-dimensional exterior domain with Neumann boundary condition and uniform magnetic field. For the exterior of the disk we establish accurate asymptotics of the low-lying eigenvalues in the weak magnetic field limit. For the exterior of a star-shaped domain, we obtain an asymptotic upper bound on the lowest eigenvalue in the weak field limit, involving the $4$-moment, and optimal for the case of the disk. Moreover, we prove that, for moderate magnetic fields, the exterior of the disk is a local maximizer for the lowest eigenvalue under a $p$-moment constraint.</description>

      <title>First Eigenvalue of Jacobi operator and Rigidity Results for Constant Mean Curvature Hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we obtain geometric upper bounds for the first eigenvalue $\lambda_1^J$ of the Jacobi operator for both closed and compact with boundary hypersurfaces having constant mean curvature (CMC). As an application, we derive new rigidity results for the area of CMC hypersurfaces under suitable conditions on $\lambda_1^J$ and the curvature of the ambient space. We also address the Jacobi-Steklov problem, proving geometric upper bounds for its first eigenvalue $\sigma_1^J$ and deriving rigidity results related to the length of the boundary. Additionally, we present some results in higher dimensions related to the Yamabe invariants.</description>

      <title>Energy Distribution for Dirichlet Eigenfunctions on Right Triangles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.03555v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we continue the study of eigenfunctions on triangles initiated by the first author in \cite{Chr-tri} and \cite{Chr-simp}. The Neumann data of Dirichlet eigenfunctions on triangles enjoys an equidistribution law, being equidistributed on each side. The proof of this result is remarkably simple, using only the radial vector field and a Rellich type integrations by parts. The equidistribution law, including on higher dimensional simplices, agrees with what Quantum Ergodic Restriction would predict. However, distribution of the Neumann data on subsets of a side is not well understood, and elementary methods do not appear to give enough information to draw conclusions.
  In the present note, we first show that an "obvious" conjecture fails even for the simplest right isosceles triangle using only Fourier series. We then use a result of Marklof-Rudnick \cite{Marklof-Rudnick} in which the authors show an interior {\it spatial} equidistribution law for a density-one subsequence of eigenfunctions to give an estimate on energy distribution of eigenfunctions on the interior. Finally we present some numerical computations suggesting the behaviour of eigenfunctions on almost isosceles triangles is quite complicated.</description>

      <title>A note on the Huijsmans-de Pagter problem on finite dimensional ordered vector spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03046v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A classical problem posed in 1992 by Huijsmans and de Pagter asks whether, for every positive operator $T$ on a Banach lattice with spectrum $\sigma(T) = \{1\}$, the inequality $T \ge \operatorname{id}$ holds true. While the problem remains unsolved in its entirety, a positive solution is known in finite dimensions. In the broader context of ordered Banach spaces, Drnov\v{s}ek provided an infinite-dimensional counterexample. In this note, we demonstrate the existence of finite-dimensional counterexamples, specifically on the ice cream cone and on a polyhedral cone in $\mathbb{R}^3$. On the other hand, taking inspiration from the notion of $m$-isometries, we establish that each counterexample must contain a Jordan block of size at least $3$.</description>

      <title>A Mathematical Theory of Integer Quantum Hall Effect in Photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17200v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates interface modes in a square lattice of photonic crystal composed of gyromagnetic particles with $C_{4v}$ point group symmetry. The study shows that Dirac or linear degenerate points cannot occur at the three high symmetry points in the Brillouin zone where two Bloch bands touch. Instead, a touch point at the M-point has a quadratic degeneracy in the generic case. It is further proved that when a magnetic field is applied to the two sides of an interface in opposite directions, two interface modes that are supported along that interface can be bifurcated from the quadratic degenerate point. The results provide a mathematical foundation for the first experiment realization of the integer quantum Hall effect in the context of photonics.</description>
