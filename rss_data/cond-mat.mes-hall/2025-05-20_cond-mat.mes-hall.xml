      <title>Interplay of magnetic textures with spin-orbit coupled substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic textures such as skyrmions in thin films grown on substrates possess significant technological potential. Inhomogeneous magnetic structures can be described as homogeneous ferromagnetic order in the presence of anisotropic spin-orbit coupling (SOC). It remains unexplored, however, how this {\it induced} SOC stemming from the magnetic textures interacts with the SOC of the substrate. Here we show that these two contributions to SOC are in general {\it not} additive. We demonstrate this by employing a spintronics gauge theory. We further compute local currents which, when considered in the proper frame, match the spintronics gauge theory results. Finally, we analyze global transport quantities and show that they substantiate our previous results quantitatively. The implications for skyrmionics as well as topological superconductivity are discussed.</description>

      <title>Single-photon detection enabled by negative differential conductivity in moir\'e superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting individual light quanta is essential for quantum information, space exploration, advanced machine vision, and fundamental science. Here, we introduce a novel single photon detection mechanism using highly photosensitive non-equilibrium electron phases in moir\'e materials. Using tunable bands in bilayer graphene/hexagonal-boron nitride superlattices, we engineer negative differential conductance and a sensitive bistable state capable of detecting single photons. Operating in this regime, we demonstrate single-photon counting at mid-infrared (11.3 microns) and visible wavelengths (675 nanometres) and temperatures up to 25 K. This detector offers new prospects for broadband, high-temperature quantum technologies with CMOS compatibility and seamless integration into photonic integrated circuits (PICs). Our analysis suggests the mechanism underlying our device operation originates from negative differential velocity, and represents an important milestone in the field of high-bias transport in two-dimensional moir\'e quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Boundary-condition-assisted chiral-symmetry protection of the zeroth Landau level on a two-dimensional lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The massless two-dimensional Dirac equation in a perpendicular magnetic field B supports a B-independent "zeroth Landau level", a dispersionless zero-energy-mode protected by chiral symmetry. On a lattice the zero-mode becomes doubly degenerate with states of opposite chirality, which removes the protection and allows for a broadening when the magnetic field is non-uniform. It is known that this fundamental obstruction can be avoided by spatially separating the doubly degenerate states, adjoining +B and -B regions in a system of twice the size. Here we show that the same objective can be achieved without doubling the system size. The key ingredients are 1) a chirality-preserving "tangent fermion" discretization of the Dirac equation; and 2) a boundary condition that ensures the zero-mode contains only states of a single chirality.</description>

      <title>Combined tight-binding and configuration interaction study of unfolded electronic structure of G-color center in Si</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have theoretically studied the G-center in bulk silicon material using the empirical tight-binding model for calculations of unfolded band structures with configuration interaction correction for the exciton at $\Gamma$ point of the Brillouin zone. The G-center in B configuration (emissive) being a candidate structure as the telecom single- and entangled-photon source has two substitutional carbons and one interstitial atom embedded into the bulk in six equally possible configurations. Taking the advantage of the low computation effort of the tight-binding and unfolding approach, it is possible to calculate and analyze the behavior of a variety of the electronic configurations. Our tight-binding model is able to describe not only the behavior of the G-center in the silicon bulk but using the unfolding approach it can also pinpoint the contributions of different elements of the supercell on the final pseudo-band structure. Moreover, the configuration interaction correction with single-particle basis states computed by our unfolded tight-binding model predicts a very small fine-structure splitting of the ground state exciton both for bright and dark doublet in the studied system. That underscores the possibility of the silicon G-center to become a very good emitter of single and entangled photons for quantum communication and computation applications.</description>

      <title>Temperature dependence of coercivity for isolated Ni nanowires unraveled by high-sensitivity micromagnetometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic nanowires are critical components in fields such as data storage and spintronics, where precise control of their magnetic properties is essential for device optimization. In particular, the behavior of isolated nanowires is often different from that of an ensemble, offering an opportunity to explore the role that dipolar and magnetoelastic interactions play in the latter system. Unfortunately, the comparison between a collection of nanowires and single ones is often poorly characterized, as measuring individual nanowires with weak magnetic signals is a challenging task. In this work, we employ a highly-sensitive micromechanical torsional oscillator to measure the magnetic response of few individual Ni nanowires with 72 +/- 5 nm average diameter, fabricated by electrodeposition in anodic aluminum oxide templates as an array and subsequently released from this membrane. When comparing the magnetic properties as a function of temperature between single nanowires and the array, we show that coercivity values of individual nanowires are at least twice as large as for the array in the range 5 K - 200 K. Also, we characterize the differences in the hysteresis loops, which are more squared for isolated nanowires, with a high magnetic remanence close to 80 % of the saturation value. Our results highlight the crucial role of dipolar and mechanical interactions in modifying the magnetic behavior of nanowires arrays, providing valuable insights for the design and application of nanowires-based magnetic devices.</description>

      <title>Probing and Tuning Strain-localized Exciton Emission in 2D Material Bubbles at Room Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Excitons in 2D material bubbles-nanoscale deformations in atomically thin materials, typically exhibiting a dome-like shape-are confined by the strain effect, exhibiting extraordinary emission properties, such as single photon generation, enhanced light emission, and spectrally tunable excitonic states. While the strain profiles of these bubbles have been extensively studied, this work provides an approach (1) to directly visualize the associated exciton properties, revealing an intrinsic emission wavelength shift of approximately 40 nm, and (2) actively modify local strain, enabling further exciton emission tuning over a range of 50 nm. These are achieved by emission mapping and nanoindentation using a dielectric near-field probe, which enables the detection of local emission spectra and emission lifetimes within individual bubbles. Statistical analysis of 67 bubbles uncovers an emission wavelength distribution centered around 780 nm. Furthermore, saturation behavior in the power-dependent studies and the associated lifetime change reveal the localized nature of the strain-induced states. These findings provide direct insights into the strain-localized emission dynamics in bubbles and establish a robust framework for non-destructive, reversible, and predictable nanoscale emission control, presenting a potential avenue for developing next-generation tunable quantum optical sources.</description>

      <title>Deeply Nonlinear Magnonic Directional Coupler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dipolar coupling between closely spaced magnetic waveguides enables the design of magnonic directional couplers - universal devices capable of functioning as signal combiners, power splitters, demultiplexers, and more. The wavelength-dependent coupling, combined with the weak nonlinear variation of a spin wave's wavelength at constant-frequency, introduces power-dependent characteristics of directional couplers. This property has been leveraged in the development of magnonic logic elements and other applications. Here, we explore another nonlinear phenomenon in a directional coupler arising purely from the nonlinear frequency shift of spin waves. We show that a strong nonlinear frequency shift causes the coupler to behave as if composed of nonidentical waveguides, suppressing the energy transfer between the waveguides. The transition from complete to negligible energy transfer exhibits a sharp threshold behavior, where the critical power is determined by the coupling strength and nonlinear frequency shift parameter. Based on these findings, a switchable directional coupler as a critical component for future integrated magnonic circuits is designed and validated by micromagnetic simulations.</description>

      <title>Significant Enhancement of Carrier Mobility in Finite vs. Infinite Square Quantum Wells: A Comparative Study of GaAs/In$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$As/GaAs Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The geometry of quantum wells (QWs) critically influences carrier mobility, yet systematic comparisons between finite and infinite square QWs remain scarce. We present a comprehensive study of GaAs/In$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$As/GaAs heterostructures using a variational-subband-wave-function model, analyzing key scattering mechanisms: remote impurities (RI), alloy disorder (AD), surface roughness (SR), acoustic (ac) and piezoelectric (PE) phonons, and longitudinal optical (LO) phonons. The mobility ratio $R=\mu_{fin}/\mu_{inf}$ reveals distinct trends: $R_{RI}$ and $R_{LO}&lt;$ 1 (long-range Coulomb/inelastic scattering), while $R_{AD}$, $R_{ac}$, $R_{PE}$, $R_{SR}&gt;$ 1 (static potentials). Finite QWs achieve higher mobility at low temperatures (77 K), narrow widths ($&lt;$ 100 \AA ), and low densities, enhanced by high indium content. Conversely, infinite QWs outperform at 300 K due to dominant LO scattering. These findings provide actionable guidelines for optimizing QW-based devices such as HEMTs and lasers across operational regimes.</description>

      <title>Micromagnetic Study of the Dipolar-Exchange Spin Waves in Antiferromagnetic Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In antiferromagnets, dipolar coupling is often disregarded due to the cancellation of magnetic moments between the two sublattices, leaving spin-wave dispersion predominantly determined by exchange interactions. However, antiferromagnetic spin waves typically involve a slight misalignment of the magnetic moments on the sublattices, giving rise to a small net magnetization that enables long-range dipolar coupling. In this paper, we investigate the role of this dipolar coupling in spin-wave excitations and its influence on the spin-wave dispersion. Our findings show that: (i) when the N\'{e}el vector is perpendicular to the film plane or lies within the film plane and parallel to the wave vector, the dispersion branches can be divided into two groups -- those unaffected by the dipolar field and those influenced by it. In these cases, the total magnetic moment remains linearly polarized, but the polarization directions differ between the two types of branches; (ii) when the N\'{e}el vector lies in the film plane and is perpendicular to the wave vector, the dipolar interactions affect both types of dispersion branches, leading to their hybridization. This hybridization alters the polarization of the magnetic moment, resulting in elliptical polarization.</description>

      <title>Electrical, Thermal and Thermoelectric transport in open long-range Kitaev Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study electrical, thermal and thermoelectric transport in a hybrid device consisting of a long-range Kitaev chain coupled to two metallic leads at two ends. Electrical and thermal currents are calculated in this device under both voltage and thermal bias conditions. We find that the transport characteristics of the long-range Kitaev chain are distinguishably different from its short-range counterpart, which is well known for hosting zero energy Majorana edge modes under some specific range of values of the model parameters. The emergence of massive Dirac fermions, the absence of gap closing at the topological phase transition point and some special features of the energy spectrum which are unique to the long-range Kitaev chain, significantly alter electrical/thermal current vs. voltage/temperature bias characteristics in comparison with that of the short-range Kitaev chain. These novel transport characteristics of the long-range Kitaev model can be helpful in understanding nontrivial topological phases of the long-range Kitaev chain.</description>

      <title>Semiregular tessellation of electronic lattices in untwisted bilayer graphene under anisotropic strain gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) moir\'e superlattices have emerged as a versatile platform for uncovering exotic quantum phases, many of which arise in bilayer systems exhibiting Archimedean tessellation patterns such as triangular, hexagonal, and kagome lattices. Here, we propose a strategy to engineer semiregular tessellation patterns in untwisted bilayer graphene by applying anisotropic epitaxial tensile strain (AETS) along crystallographic directions. Through force-field and first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that AETS can induce a rich variety of semiregular tessellation geometries, including truncated hextille, prismatic pentagon, and brick-phase arrangements. The characteristic electronic bands (Dirac and flat bands) of the lattice models associated with these semiregular tessellations are observed near the Fermi level, arising from interlayer interactions generated by the redistribution of specific stacking registries (AB, BA, and SP). Furthermore, the electronic kagome, distorted Lieb, brick-like, and one-dimensional stripe lattices captured in real-space confirm the tunable nature of the semiregular tessellation lattices enabled by AETS. Our study identifies AETS as a promising new degree of freedom in moir\'e engineering, offering a reproducible and scalable platform for exploring exotic electronic lattices in moir\'e systems.</description>

      <title>Carrier Thermalization and Biexciton Formation in a Polar ZnO/Zn$_{0.84}$Mg$_{0.16}$O Quantum Well Probed by Ultrafast Broadband Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the ultrafast dynamics of excitons in a 2.6 nm-thick $\mathrm{ZnO/Zn_{0.84}Mg_{0.16}O}$ quantum well grown on a c-axis sapphire substrate, using non-degenerate time-resolved pump-probe spectroscopy. A pump pulse at 266 nm generates photocarriers within the ZnMgO barriers, and their dynamics is monitored through time-resolved differential reflectance measurements using a supercontinuum probe spanning the 345-400 nm spectral range. Photocarriers generated in the barriers rapidly relax into the quantum well, where they form excitons within sub-picosecond timescales. These excitons quickly thermalize and become localized, likely due to interface disorder or well-width fluctuations, as supported by photoluminescence measurements showing a clear Stokes shift and the absence of free exciton emission. A phonon-assisted absorption process, leading to the effective thermalization of excitons, is observed and analyzed. We identify moreover a negative differential reflectance feature as a photoinduced absorption into a biexciton state, with a binding energy ranging from 18 to 22 meV depending on temperature.</description>

      <title>Spin-Meissner effect in systems of coupled polariton condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the interplay between Zeeman splitting and TE-TM-induced spin-flip tunneling in coupled exciton-polariton condensates systems and its impact on the spin-Meissner effect. We demonstrate that although a single condensate exhibits the effect of full paramagnetic screening via spin-anisotropic interactions, the inter-site spin-flip tunneling can dramatically alter this behavior. The geometry of the system is shown to play a crucial role. In particular, in a dyad, the chemical potential reveals quadratic scaling with the magnetic field. In a triangle, the competition between Zeeman and TE-TM splittings produces a rich phase diagram that features asymmetric polarization states corresponding to both positive and negative magnetic susceptibility. In a square configuration, the symmetry of the network can restore the spin-Meissner effect, so that the condensate emission frequency becomes magnetic field independent in an extended parameter range. These findings not only shed light on the fundamental physics of polariton lattices but also suggest promising avenues for engineering robust spin-controlled photonic devices and polaritonic simulators.</description>

      <title>Quantum stochastic resonance in a single-photon emitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic resonance is a phenomenon in which fluctuations enhance an otherwise weak signal. It has been found in many different systems in paleoclimatology, biology, medicine, and physics. The classical stochastic resonance due to thermal noise has recently been experimentally extended to the quantum regime, where the fundamental randomness of individual quantum events provides the noise source. Here, we demonstrate quantum stochastic resonance in the single-electron tunneling dynamics of a periodically driven single-photon emitter, consisting of a self-assembled quantum dot that is tunnel-coupled to an electron reservoir. Such highly-controllable quantum emitters are promising candidates for future applications in quantum information technologies. We monitor the charge dynamics by resonant optical excitation and identify quantum stochastic resonance with the help of full counting statistics of tunneling events in terms of the Fano factor and extend the statistical evaluation to factorial cumulants to gain a deeper understanding of this far-reaching phenomenon.</description>

      <title>A General Algorithm For Determining The Conductivity Zeros In Large Molecular Nanostructures: Applications To Rectangular Graphene Sheets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an algorithm for determining the zeros of the electric conductivity in large molecular nanonstructures such as graphene sheets. To this end, we employ the inverse graph method, whereby non-zeros of the Green's functions are represented graphically by a segment connecting two atomic sites, to visually signal the existence of a conductance zero as a line that is missing. In rectangular graphene structures the topological properties of the inverse graph determine the existence of two types of Green's function zeros that correspond to absolute conductance cancellations with distinct behavior in the presence of external disorder. We discuss these findings and their potential applications in some particular cases.</description>

      <title>Insight into the Correlation of Shape and Magnetism of Hematite Nanospindles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is established that the Morin transition, a spin reorientation in hematite, is shifted to lower temperatures with decreasing nanoparticle volume. However, our findings indicate an opposite effect in a series of hematite nanospindles: The particles, synthesized by hydrothermal decomposition of iron(III) chloride solution, with aspect ratios $p$ between $1.0$ and $5.2$ (long axis ca. $70$--$290$ nm) display decreasing Morin transition temperatures $T_{\text{Morin}}$ upon increasing $p$, despite the volume increase. Their inner morphology, determined via (HR)STEM and XRD, shows that they are formed by the epitactical fusion of primary particles, perfectly aligned in terms of crystallographic orientation. Combining magnetometry and M\"ossbauer spectroscopy, we uncover the correlation between particle shape, magnetic properties, and in particular the Morin transition: While more spherical particles undergo said transition at about $200$ K, $T_{\text{Morin}}$ decreases upon higher nanospindle elongation, while also being broadened and showing a wider thermal hysteresis. Our measurements reveal complete suppression of the Morin transition beyond a critical threshold $p \gtrapprox 1.5$, indicating stabilization of the weak ferromagnetic (WFM) state with net particle magnetic moment within the hematite basal plane, despite such behavior being unexpected based on shape anisotropy considerations. For the correlated, magnetic field-dependent spin-flop transition, a comparable trend in particle aspect ratio is detected. We have demonstrated the presence of intermediate spin alignment states that deviate both from the low-temperature antiferromagnetic (AFM) and high-temperature WFM spin structure for slightly elongated particles, likely being connected to the suppression of the Morin transition observed for $p \gtrapprox 1.5$.</description>

      <title>Infrared markers of topological phase transitions in quantum spin Hall insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using first principles techniques, we show that infrared optical response can be used to discriminate between the topological and the trivial phases of two-dimensional quantum spin Hall insulators (QSHI). We showcase germanene and jacutingaite, of recent experimental realization, as prototypical systems where the infrared spectrum is discontinuous across the transition, due to sudden and large discretized jumps of the value of Born effective charges (up to 2). For these materials, the topological transition can be induced via the application of an external electrostatic potential in the field-effect setup. Our results are rationalized in the framework of a low-energy Kane-Mele model and are robust with respect to dynamical effects which come into play when the energy gap of the material is of the same order of the infrared active phonon frequency. In the small gap QSHI germanene, due to dynamical effects, the in-plane phonon resonance in the optical conductivity shows a Fano profile with remarkable differences in the intensity and the shape between the two phases. Instead, the large gap QSHI jacutingaite presents several IR-active phonon modes whose spectral intensities drastically change between the two phases.</description>

      <title>Spin relaxation in a single-electron bilayer graphene quantum dot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the spin relaxation in a single-electron bilayer graphene quantum dot due to the spin-orbit coupling. The spin relaxation is assisted by the emission of acoustic phonons via the bond-length change and deformation potential mechanisms and $1/f$ charge noise. In the perpendicular magnetic-field dependence of the spin relaxation rate $T_1^{-1}$, we predict a monotonic increase of $T_1^{-1}$ at higher fields where the electron-phonon coupling via the deformation potential plays a dominant role in spin relaxation. We show a less pronounced dip in $T_1^{-1}$ at lower magnetic fields due to the competition between the electron-phonon coupling due to bond-length change and $1/f$ charge noise. Finally, detailed comparisons of the magnetic-field dependence of the spin relaxation with the existing experiments by Banszerus et al. [Nat. Commun. 13, 3637 (2022)] and G\"achter et al. [PRX Quantum 3, 020343 (2022)] are reported.</description>

      <title>Spin Pumping into two-dimensional systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this review, we present recent theoretical developments on spin transport phenomena probed by ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) modulation in two-dimensional systems coupled to magnetic materials. We first address FMR linewidth enhancements induced by spin pumping at interfaces, emphasizing their potential as sensitive probes of superconducting pairing symmetries in two-dimensional superconductors. We then examine FMR modulation due to spin pumping into two-dimensional electron gases formed in semiconductor heterostructures, where the interplay of Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit interactions enables gate-controlled spin transport and persistent spin textures. Finally, we investigate spin pumping in monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides, where spin-valley coupling and Berry curvature effects lead to valley-selective spin excitations and a spin-current Hall effect. These developments demonstrate that the spin pumping technique provides a versatile tool for probing spin transport and spin-dependent phenomena in low-dimensional systems, offering a basis for future spintronics applications.</description>

      <title>Autonomous nanoparticle synthesis by design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlled synthesis of materials with specified atomic structures underpins technological advances yet remains reliant on iterative, trial-and-error approaches. Nanoparticles (NPs), whose atomic arrangement dictates their emergent properties, are particularly challenging to synthesise due to numerous tunable parameters. Here, we introduce an autonomous approach explicitly targeting synthesis of atomic-scale structures. Our method autonomously designs synthesis protocols by matching real time experimental total scattering (TS) and pair distribution function (PDF) data to simulated target patterns, without requiring prior synthesis knowledge. We demonstrate this capability at a synchrotron, successfully synthesising two structurally distinct gold NPs: 5 nm decahedral and 10 nm face-centred cubic structures. Ultimately, specifying a simulated target scattering pattern, thus representing a bespoke atomic structure, and obtaining both the synthesised material and its reproducible synthesis protocol on demand may revolutionise materials design. Thus, ScatterLab provides a generalisable blueprint for autonomous, atomic structure-targeted synthesis across diverse systems and applications.</description>

      <title>Experimental and theoretical studies of WO3-Vulcan XC-72 electrocatalyst enhanced H2O2 yield ORR performed in acid and alkaline medium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) plays a pivotal role in clean energy generation and sustainable chemical production, particularly in the synthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H\textsubscript{2}O\textsubscript{2}). In this study, WO\textsubscript{3}/Vulcan-XC72 electrocatalysts were synthesized and characterized for ORR applications, evaluating the WO\textsubscript{3} to Vulcan-XC72 ratio and examining electrolyte pH effects across acidic and alkaline media. Structural characterization confirmed successful synthesis of monoclinic WO\textsubscript{3} with nanoflower morphology, which enhanced surface hydrophilicity and oxygen functional groups. Electrochemical tests demonstrated WO\textsubscript{3}/C's superior H\textsubscript{2}O\textsubscript{2} selectivity compared to pure Vulcan-XC72 in both media, revealing a pH-dependent ORR mechanism. Using WO\textsubscript{3}/C gas diffusion electrodes (GDEs), we achieved 862,mg,L\textsuperscript{-1} H\textsubscript{2}O\textsubscript{2} accumulation after 120,min at 100,mA,cm\textsuperscript{-2}. The enhanced performance stems from increased oxygen functional groups, improved hydrophilicity, and WO\textsubscript{3} nanoflower synergistic effects, as supported by theoretical calculations, establishing WO\textsubscript{3}/Vulcan as a promising catalyst for electrochemical H\textsubscript{2}O\textsubscript{2} production.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fluctuation-induced forces, primarily represented by quantum and critical Casimir effects, play a pivotal role at the nanoscale. This review explores the theoretical and experimental landscapes of these forces, offering a comprehensive analysis of their similarities and distinctions. We emphasize the effects of material properties, geometry, and temperature in shaping these forces and their roles in various nanoscale systems, both colloidal and solid-state. We devote special attention to the Casimir torque, the influence of magnetism on the Casimir force, and the use of Casimir effects for the generation of optical resonators. Through this comparative study, we elucidate the underlying physics of these phenomena, fostering insights that advance applications in nanomechanics, optomechanics, and quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Reference lattice, sound, stiffness, and magnetic transitions of Ising monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A reference lattice, away from which elastic distortions induced by the spin texturing of 2D magnets take hold, is motivated from a picture of pairwise Biot-Savart interactions among identical solenoids that either elongate or compress a (``zero-current'') spring lattice. Applied to a paradigmatic CrSiTe$_3$ monolayer (ML), the reference is given by the average between the atomic positions of FM and N\'eel AFM lattices; such an atomic disposition permits understanding structural distortions and elastic energies due to magnetism readily. Furthermore, the anisotropic speed of sound in the magnetic ground state explains an observed anisotropy of vibrational frequencies on similar magnets. Elastic stiffness constants are reported, too. Magnetic energies in four Ising structural configurations were calculated, and the strain needed for those 2D magnets to undergo an AFM to FM quantum phase transition was determined as well.</description>

      <title>Interplay between altermagnetic order and crystal symmetry probed using magnetotransport in epitaxial altermagnet MnTe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Altermagnets are a new class of magnetic materials characterized by fully compensated spins arranged in alternating local structures, allowing for spin-split bands similar to those found in ferromagnets without net magnetism. Recently, MnTe has emerged as a prototypical altermagnetic material exhibiting spin-polarized electronic bands and anomalous transport phenomena. Although recent work has explored the magnetic and structural properties of MnTe, detailed experimental investigations into the relationship between altermagnetic order and crystal symmetry are lacking. Here, we report the relationship between altermagnetic order and crystal symmetry by investigating magnetotransport properties of MnTe epitaxial altermagnetic thin films grown by molecular beam epitaxy. We observe a spontaneous anomalous Hall effect and show the control of Hall response with the altermagnetic order using the magnetic field and the crystallographic angle dependence. Detailed measurements establish that both the longitudinal and transverse electronic responses depend on the relative orientation of the applied current and N\'eel vector as well as on the crystal orientation and altermagnetic order. These results provide new insights into the interplay between crystal symmetry and altermagnetism for future device applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose quantum simulation experiments of the Kondo impurity problem using cold alkaline-earth(-like) atoms (AEAs) in a combination of optical lattice and optical tweezer potentials. Within an ab initio model for atomic interactions in the optical potentials, we analyze hallmark signatures of the Kondo effect in a variety of observables accessible in cold-atom quantum simulators. We identify additional terms not part of the textbook Kondo problem, mostly ignored in previous works and giving rise to a direct competition between spin and charge correlations--strongly suppressing Kondo physics. Crucially, we show that the Kondo effect can be restored by locally adjusting the chemical potential on the impurity site. We identify realistic parameter regimes and preparation protocols suited to current experiments with AEA arrays. Our work paves the way for novel quantum simulations of the Kondo problem and offers new insights into Kondo physics in unconventional regimes.</description>

      <title>Skyrmion stacking in stray field-coupled ultrathin ferromagnetic multilayers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the energy landscape of ferromagnetic multilayer
  heterostructures that feature magnetic skyrmions -- tiny whirls of
  spins with non-trivial topology -- in each magnetic layer. Such
  magnetic heterostructures have been recently pursued as possible
  hosts of room temperature stable magnetic skyrmions suitable for the
  next generation of low power information technologies and
  unconventional computing. The presence of stacked skyrmions in the
  adjacent layers gives rise to a strongly coupled nonlinear system,
  whereby the induced magnetic field plays a crucial stabilizing
  role. Starting with the micromagnetic modeling framework, we derive
  a general reduced energy functional for a fixed number of ultrathin
  ferromagnetic layers with perpendicular magnetocrystalline
  anisotropy. We next investigate this energy functional in the regime
  in which the energy is dominated by the intralayer exchange
  interaction and formally obtain a finite-dimensional description
  governed by the energy of a system of one skyrmion per layer as a
  function of the position, radius and the rotation angle of each of
  theses skyrmions. For the latter, we prove that energy minimizers
  exist for all fixed skyrmion locations. We then focus on the
  simplest case of stray field-coupled ferromagnetic bilayers and
  completely characterize the energy minimizers. We show that the
  global energy minimizers exist and consist of two stray
  field-stabilized N\'eel skyrmions with antiparallel in-plane
  magnetization components. We also calculate the energy of two
  skyrmions of equal radius as a function of their separation
  distance.</description>

Abstract: Excitons drive the optoelectronic properties of organic semiconductors which underpin devices including solar cells and light-emitting diodes. Here we show that excitons can exhibit topologically non-trivial states protected by inversion symmetry and identify a family of organic semiconductors realising the predicted excitonic topological phases. We also demonstrate that the topological phase can be controlled through experimentally realisable strains and chemical functionalisation of the material. Appealing to quantum Riemannian geometry, we predict that topologically non-trivial excitons have a lower bound on their centre-of-mass spatial spread, which can significantly exceed the size of a unit cell. Furthermore, we show that the dielectric environment allows control over the excitonic quantum geometry. The discovery of excitonic topology and excitonic Riemannian geometry in organic materials brings together two mature fields and suggests many new possibilities for a range of future optoelectronic applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04532v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In multilayer graphene, the stacking order of the layers plays a crucial role in the electronic properties and the manifestation of superconductivity. By applying shear stress, it is possible to induce sliding between different layers, altering the stacking order. Here, focusing on bilayer graphene, we analyze how ionic fluctuations alter the free energy barrier between different stacking equilibria. We calculate the free energy barrier through the state-of-the-art self-consistent harmonic approximation, which can be evaluated at unstable configurations. We find that above 100 K there is a large reduction of the barrier of more than 30% due to thermal vibrations, which significantly improves the agreement between previous first-principles theoretical work and experiments in a single graphite crystal. As the temperature increases, the barrier remains nearly constant up to around 500 K, with a more pronounced decrease only at higher temperatures. Our approach is general and paves the way for systematically accounting for thermal effects in free energy barriers of other macroscopic systems.</description>

      <title>Optical Absorption and Emission from Wannier-Stark Spectra of Moir\'{e} Superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14670v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using a formalism based on the non-Abelian Berry connection, we explore quantum geometric signatures of Wannier-Stark spectra in two-dimensional superlattices. The Stark energy can be written as \textit{intraband} Berry phases, while Zener tunneling is given by \textit{interband} Berry connections. We suggest that the gaps induced by interband hybridization can be probed by THz optical absorption and emission spectroscopy. This is especially relevant to modern moir\'{e} materials wherein mini-bands are often spectrally entangled, leading to strong interband hybridization in the Wannier-Stark regime. Furthermore, owing to their large superlattice constants, both the low-field and high-field regimes can be accessed in these materials using presently available technology. Importantly, even at moderate electric fields, we find that stimulated emission can dominate absorption, raising the possibility of lasing at practically relevant parameter regimes.</description>

      <title>Fully nonequilibrium Hall response from Berry curvature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16675v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In topological materials, Berry curvature leads to intrinsic Hall responses. Focusing on time-reversal symmetric systems with broken inversion symmetry, a spontaneoous (zero magnetic field) Hall effect is expected to develop under an applied electric field. Motivated by recent developments in Weyl-Kondo semimetals, here we advance a fully nonequilibrium (FNE) Hall response due to the Berry curvature. In particular, we show that, while the spontaneous Hall current is quadratic in the previously described regime of weak electric field, due to the contribution from the dipole moment of the Berry curvature, the FNE Hall response for non-perturbative electric fields is not controlled by the Berry curvature dipole. Remarkably, the FNE Hall response resembles what happens in systems that break the microscopic time-reversal symmetry. We illustrate the universality of these results by comparing them with their counterparts in systems with any higher-multipole of the Berry curvature. The implications of our results for the understanding of strongly correlated topological semimetals are discussed.</description>

      <title>Hole subband dispersions and strong `spin'-orbit coupling in a cylindrical Ge nanowire</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16703v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quasi-one-dimensional hole gas is achievable in a semiconductor Ge nanowire. The lowest two subband dispersions of the hole gas are just two shifted parabolic curves with an anticrossing at $k_{z}=0$. This peculiar low-energy subband structure manifests the existence of a strong `spin' (pseudo spin)-orbit coupling. Based on the Luttinger-Kohn Hamiltonian in the axial approximation, we show two sets of combined dispersions that not only isolated from each other but also with strong `spin'-orbit coupling are obtainable in the presence of strong magnetic field. Realistic calculations are performed for three representative nanowire growth directions [001], [111], and [110]. These results are further confirmed via constructing the low-energy effective Hamiltonian of the hole gas. We also calculate the external electric field induced spin splitting for comparison with the magnetic field induced spin splitting.</description>

      <title>Non-linear Transport in Non-centrosymmetric Systems: From Fundamentals to Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05253v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ohm's law has been a cornerstone of electronics since its experimental discovery. This law establishes that in a conductive system, the voltage is directly proportional to the current. Even when time-reversal symmetry is disrupted, leading to the emergence of magnetoresistance and Hall effects, the linear relationship between voltage and current remains intact. However, recent experiments have demonstrated a breakdown of Ohm's law in non-centrosymmetric structures. In these systems, non-linear transport effects are permitted with quadratic scaling between voltages and currents. Here, we review the main demonstrations of non-linear transport in non-centrosymmetric systems, analyzing the connection between non-linear behavior and the system's symmetry. Additionally, we delve into the microscopic mechanisms driving these effects, such as Berry curvature dipole and Berry connection polarizability. Finally, we highlight potential applications of non-linear transport in spintronics and energy harvesting.</description>

Abstract: We consider electronic spectra of twisted carbon nanotubes and their perturbation by impurity atoms absorbed at different positions on nanotube surface within the framework of Anderson hybrid model. A special attention is given to the cases when 1D Weyl (massless Dirac) modes are present in the nanotube spectrum and their hybridization with localized impurity states produces, with growing impurity concentration c, onset of a mobility gap near the impurity level and then opening, at yet higher c, of some narrow range of delocalized states within this mobility gap. Such behaviors are compared with similar effects in the previously studied 2D graphene, carbon nanoribbons, and non-twisted carbon nanotubes. Some possible practical applications are discussed.</description>

      <title>Super-enhanced Sensitivity in Non-Hermitian Systems at Infernal Points</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12875v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The emergence of exceptional points in non-Hermitian systems represents an intriguing phenomenon characterized by the coalescence of eigenenergies and eigenstates. When a system approaches an exceptional point, it exhibits a heightened sensitivity to perturbations compared to the conventional band degeneracy observed in Hermitian systems. This sensitivity, manifested in the splitting of the eigenenergies, is amplified as the order of the exceptional point increases. Infernal points constitute a unique subclass of exceptional points, distinguished by their order escalating with the expansion of the system's size. In this paper, we show that, when a non-Hermitian system is at an infernal point, a perturbation of strength $\epsilon$, which couples the two opposing boundaries of the system, causes the eigenenergies to split according to the law $\sqrt[k]{\epsilon}$, where $k$ is an integer proportional to the system's size. Utilizing the perturbation theory of Jordan matrices, we demonstrate that the exceptional sensitivity of the eigenenergies at infernal points to boundary-coupling perturbations is a ubiquitous phenomenon, irrespective of the specific form of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. Notably, we find that this phenomenon remains robust even when the system deviates substantially from the infernal point. The universal nature and robustness of this phenomenon suggest potential applications in enhancing sensor sensitivity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13367v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Artificial Kitaev chains have emerged as a promising platform for realizing topological quantum computing. Once the chains are formed and the Majorana zero modes are braided/fused, reading out the parity of the chains is essential for further verifying the non-Abelian property of the Majorana zero modes. Here we demonstrate the feasibility of using a superconducting transmon qubit, which incorporates an end of a four-site quantum dot-superconductor chain based on a Ge/Si nanowire, to directly detect the singlet/doublet state, and thus the parity of the entire chain. We also demonstrate that for multiple-dot chains there are two types of 0-{\pi} transitions between different charging states: the parity-flip 0-{\pi} transition and the parity-preserved 0-{\pi} transition. Furthermore, we show that the inter-dot coupling, hence the strengths of cross Andreev reflection and elastic cotunneling of electrons, can be adjusted by local electrostatic gating in chains fabricated on Ge/Si core-shell nanowires. Our exploration would be helpful for the ultimate realization of topological quantum computing based on artificial Kitaev chains.</description>

Here, we consider short potential barriers/wells modelled by delta-functions. We also generalize our analysis by incorporating tilts in the dispersion. Due to the parabolic nature of the spectra, caused by quadratic-in-momentum dependence, there exist evanescent waves, which decay exponentially as we move away from the junction represented by the location of the delta-function potential. Investigating the possibility of the appearance of bound states, we find that their energies appear as pairs of $\pm |E_b |$, reflecting the presence of the imaginary-valued wavevectors at both positive and negative values of energies of the propagating quasiparticles.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of temperature of quantum anomalous Hall effect in two-dimensional germanene/magnetic semiconductor heterostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13355v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) is significant for future low-power electronics devices, where a main challenge is realizing QAHE at high temperatures. In this work, based on experimentally reported two-dimensional (2D) germanene and magnetic semiconductors Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$ and Cr$_2$Si$_2$Te$_6$, and the first principle calculations, germanene/magnetic semiconductor heterostructures are investigated. Topologically nontrivial edge states and quantized anomalous Hall conductance are demonstrated. It is shown that the QAHE temperature can be enhanced to approximately 62 K in germanene/monolayer (ML) Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$ with 2.1\% tensile strain, 64 K in germanene/bilayer (BL) Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$ with 1.4\% tensile strain, and 50 K in germanene/ML Cr$_2$Si$_2$Te$_6$ with 1.3\% tensile strain. With increasing tensile strain of these heterostructures, the band gap decreases and the Curie temperature rises, and the highest temperature of QAHE is obtained. Since these 2D materials were discovered in recent experiments, our results provide promising materials for achieving high-temperature QAHE.</description>

Abstract: We consider the effects of interactions on the edges of "double" quantum spin Hall insulators (DQSHIs), motivated by recent experiments on moir\'e twisted metal dichalcogenides. Without interactions, a DQSHI can be understood as two identical copies of a conventional quantum spin Hall insulator. If interactions are present and $s^z$-spin is conserved, we show that there are two possible phases for the DQSHI edge. First is a weakly-correlated edge which has two pairs of helical modes and is adiabatically equivalent to two conventional quantum spin Hall edges. Second is a strongly-correlated edge with only one pair of helical modes. The strongly-correlated edge also has a gap to single-electrons, but is gapless to pairs of electrons. In a quantum point contact geometry, this single-electron gap leads to a Fano factor of $2$ in shot noise measurements, compared to a Fano factor of $1$ for a weakly-correlated edge.</description>

Abstract: Chirality is a property of a gapped phase of matter in two spatial dimensions that can be manifested through non-zero thermal or electrical Hall conductance. In this paper, we prove two no-go theorems that forbid such chirality for a quantum state in a finite dimensional local Hilbert space with strict area law entanglement entropies. As a crucial ingredient in the proofs, we introduce a new quantum information-theoretic primitive called instantaneous modular flow, which has many other potential applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16630v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a theoretical framework that allows for the systematic and efficient description of the ultrafast nonlinear response of molecular polaritons, i.e., hybrid light-matter states, in the collective regime of large numbers of molecules $\mathcal N$ coupled to the cavity photon mode. Our approach is based on a semiclassical, mean-field evolution of the molecular Hamiltonian and the cavity field, which is complemented by a perturbative expansion of both light and matter counterparts in the input fields entering the cavity. In addition, expansion in terms of the pulse phases enables us to disentangle different excitation pathways in Liouville space, thereby distinguishing contributions to the nonlinear response. The formalism extends traditional free-space nonlinear spectroscopy by incorporating the feedback of matter onto the light field via the induced polarization. We demonstrate the utility of the framework by applying it to the calculation of pump-probe polariton spectra and show how, by storing the pulses, the cavity facilitates additional excitation pathways, which can be used to isolate purely bright state contributions. Our method, which does not scale with $\mathcal N$, is broadly applicable and can be extended to model a wide range of current experiments investigating the dynamical nonlinear response of hybrid light-matter states.</description>

Abstract: We report on tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy of H2 and D2 molecules physisorbed within a plasmonic picocavity at 10 K. The intense Raman peaks resulting from the rotational and vibrational transitions are observed at subnanometer gap distances of the junction formed by an Ag tip and an Ag(111) surface, where a picocavity-enhanced field plays a crucial role. A significant redshift of the H-H stretch frequency is observed as the gap distance decreases, while the D-D stretch frequency is unaffected. Density functional theory, path-integral molecular dynamics, and quantum anharmonic vibrational energy calculations suggest that this unexpected isotope effect is explained by a different molecular density between H2 and D2 on the surface.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17799v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-conventional epitaxial techniques, such as van der Waals epitaxy (vdWE) and remote epitaxy, have attracted substantial attention in the semiconductor research community for their capability to repeatedly produce high-quality free-standing films from a single mother wafer. Successful implementation of these epitaxial techniques depends on creating a robust, uniform two-dimensional (2D) material surface. The conventional method for fabricating graphene on silicon carbide (SiC) is high-temperature graphitization. However, the extremely high temperature required for silicon sublimation (typically above 1500 {\deg}C) causes step-bunching of the SiC surface, forming non-uniform multilayer graphene stripes and an unfavorable surface morphology for epitaxial growth. Here, we developed a wafer-scale graphitization technique that allows fast synthesis of single-crystalline graphene at ultra-low temperatures by metal-assisted graphitization (MAG). We found annealing conditions that enable SiC dissociation while avoiding silicide formation, producing uniform single-crystalline graphene while maintaining the surface morphology of the substrate. The graphene thickness can be controlled by varying the metal thickness or annealing temperature, enabling remote epitaxy or vdWE. We successfully produced freestanding single-crystalline III-N (AlN, GaN) films on graphene/SiC via the 2D material-based layer transfer technique. Our results show that low-temperature graphene synthesis via MAG offers a promising route to producing large-scale ultra-wide bandgap free-standing crystalline membranes.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Multipole Skin Effects Challenge Localization</title>

Abstract: We study the effect of quenched disorder on the non-Hermitian skin effect in systems that conserve a U(1) charge and its associated multipole moments. In particular, we generalize the Hatano-Nelson argument for a localization transition in disordered, non-reciprocal systems to the interacting case. When only U(1) charge is conserved, we show that there is a transition between a skin effect phase, in which charges cluster at a boundary, and a many-body localized phase, in which charges localize at random positions. In the dynamics of entanglement, this coincides with an area to volume law transition. For systems without boundaries, the skin effect becomes a delocalized phase with a unidirectional current. If dipoles or higher multipoles are conserved, we show that the non-Hermitian skin effect remains stable to arbitrary disorder. Counterintuitively, the system is therefore always delocalized under periodic boundary conditions, regardless of disorder strength.</description>
