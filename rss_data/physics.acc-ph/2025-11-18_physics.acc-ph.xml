      <title>Observation of Fine Structure in Channeling of Particles in Bent Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08459v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We observed highly efficient manipulation of the 530 MeV positron beam at Mainz Microtron via bent crystals. The low beam divergence revealed a fine structure in the angular distribution of channeled particles. A compact analytical model, supported by Monte Carlo including multiple scattering, accounts for the measurements. We established a criterion for designing a crystal with reduced angular spread of channeled particles for beam manipulation at any energy. This finding is particularly useful in view of applications of channeling to the highest energies.</description>

      <title>RFSoC Based LLRF System Design at ALS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13192v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Advanced Light Source (ALS) at LBNL is upgrading several LLRF systems for its Linac and Sub-Harmonic Bunchers, where it is desired to have a unified LLRF system design to support various RF frequencies (at 125MHz, 500MHz and 3GHz) and configurations. This paper demonstrates an open-source, direct sampling RFSoC based LLRF system design, featuring: sample-to-sample Multi-Tile Synchronization, deterministic latency, digital up/down conversion, arbitrary waveform generation and acquisition, in-pulse closed loop control, timing and EPICS integration, modular RF frontend and hardware designs. Measured RF characteristics show that the RFSoC based LLRF system is able to meet the system requirements.</description>

      <title>Prospects for the production and detection of Breit-Wheeler tunneling positrons in Experiment 320 at the FACET-II accelerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04992v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The SLAC Experiment 320 collides 10 TW-class laser pulses with the high-quality, 10 GeV electron beam from the FACET-II RF LINAC. This setup is expected to produce a sizable number of $e^+e^-$ pairs via nonlinear Breit-Wheeler mechanism in the strong-field tunneling regime, with an estimated yield of ~0.01-0.1 pairs per collision. This small signal rate typically comes along with large backgrounds originating, e.g., from dumping the high-charge primary beam, secondaries induced by the beam halo, as well as photons and low-energy electrons produced in the electron-laser collision itself. These backgrounds may reach densities of O(100) charged particles per cm^2 (and even more neutral particles) at the surface of the sensing elements, making it a tremendous challenge for an unambiguous detection of single particles. In this work, we demonstrate how detectors and methods adapted from high-energy physics experiments, can enable this measurement. The solution presented is based on a highly granular, multi-layer, radiation-hard pixel detector paired with powerful particle-tracking algorithms. Using a detailed simulation of the existing experimental setup, we show how the false-positive rate due to background processes can be reduced by more than an order of magnitude relative to the expected signal after full reconstruction. Furthermore, we show that the high spatial tracking resolution achievable (&lt;10 microns) allows for positron momentum measurements with a resolution of &lt;2%, enabling spectral characterization of the nonlinear Breit-Wheeler process. Based on our extensive simulation, with a conservatively large background assumption, we show that it is possible to measure single Breit-Wheeler positrons in the coming data taking campaign of E320. That would be the first statistically significant observation and characterization of this elusive process in the (deep) tunneling regime.</description>
