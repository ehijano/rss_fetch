      <title>Dominance regions for affine cluster algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine dominance regions associated to cluster algebras of affine type. In the most interesting cases, the dominance region is a line segment, which we describe explicitly. Motivations for this work include a project to determine all pointed bases for cluster algebras of affine type and a separate project to determine all theta functions in the affine case. The proofs draw on known results from the doubled Cambrian fan and almost-positive roots models, as well as a new tool that we develop: a detailed description of neighboring seeds of affine type (seeds that are, in some sense, as close as possible to the boundary of the g-vector fan).</description>

      <title>Representations of finite matrix monoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathfrak{M}_n$ be the multiplicative monoid of $n \times n$ matrices over a finite field. The monoid algebra $\mathbf{C}[\mathfrak{M}_n]$ has been studied for several decades. One of the important early results is Kov\'acs' theorem that the two-sided ideal spanned by matrices of rank at most $r$ has a unit. Our most significant result is an explicit formula for this unit. Prior to our work, such a formula was only known in a few examples. We also study the module theory of $\mathbf{C}[\mathfrak{M}_n]$. We explicitly describe the simple modules, and establish induction and restriction rules. We show that the simple decomposition of an arbitrary module can be determined using character theory of finite general linear groups; this relies on a Pieri rule of Gurevich--Howe. We also establish a version of Schur--Weyl duality for $\mathbf{C}[\mathfrak{M}_n]$. Many of these results hold over more general coefficient fields.</description>

      <title>Unipotent quantum coordinate ring and minuscule prefundamental representations: twisted case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the prefundamental modules $L_{s,a}^{\pm}$ over the Borel subalgebras of the twisted quantum loop algebras, which are introduced by Wang. A character formula for $L_{s,a}^{\pm}$ is obtained from that for the prefundamental modules over the untwisted quantum loop algebras by applying a character folding map. This allows us to realize minuscule prefundamental modules $L_{s,a}^{\pm}$ for types $A_{2n-1}^{(2)}$ and $D_{n+1}^{(2)}$ in terms of the unipotent quantum coordinate ring associated with the fundamental $s$-th coweight, where $s = 1$ for type $A_{2n-1}^{(2)}$ and $s = n$ for type $D_{n+1}^{(2)}$. This result is a continuation of the realization of (co)minuscule prefundamental modules established by earlier works [J-Kwon-Park, Int. Math. Res. Not., 2023] and [J-Kwon-Park, J. Algebra, 2025].</description>

      <title>Entropies associated with orbits of finite groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For certain groups, parabolic subgroups appear as stabilizers of flags of sets or vector spaces. Quotients by these parabolic subgroups represent orbits of flags, and their cardinalities asymptotically reveal entropies (as rates of exponential or superexponential growth). The multiplicative "chain rules" that involve these cardinalities induce, asymptotically, additive analogues for entropies. Many traditional formulas in information theory correspond to quotients of symmetric groups, which are a particular kind of reflection group; in this case, the cardinalities of orbits are given by multinomial coefficients and are asymptotically related to Shannon entropy. One can treat similarly quotients of the general linear groups over a finite field; in this case, the cardinalities of orbits are given by $q$-multinomials and are asymptotically related to the Tsallis 2-entropy. In this contribution, we consider other finite reflection groups as well as the symplectic group as an example of a classical group over a finite field (groups of Lie type). In both cases, the groups are classified by Dynkin diagrams into infinite series of similar groups $A_n$, $B_n$, $C_n$, $D_n$ and a finite number of exceptional ones. The $A_n$ series consists of the symmetric groups (reflection case) and general linear groups (Lie case). Some of the other series, studied here from an information-theoretic perspective for the first time, are linked to new entropic functionals.</description>

      <title>Three Dixon-Rosenfeld Planes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rosenfeld postulated ``generalized'' projective planes, which exploit a correspondence between rank-one idempotents of Jordan algebras $\mathfrak{J}_3(\mathbb{A})$ and points of projective planes $\mathbb{A}P^2$. The isometry groups of the generalized projective planes (which were later defined rigorously as homogeneous spaces) are entries of the Tits-Freudenthal magic square. Given recent interest in the Dixon algebra $\mathbb{R}\otimes\mathbb{C}\otimes\mathbb{H}\otimes\mathbb{O}$, we extend Rosenfeld's approach and present three new coset manifolds. These "Dixon-Rosenfeld planes" have isometry algebras that are obtained from Tits' magic formula and involve all tensorial components of the Dixon algebra. We show that these are the only three planes obtainable with Tits' formula that preserve the analogy with Rosenfeld's planes. These non-simple Lie algebras generalize $\mathfrak{f}_{4},\mathfrak{e}_{6},\mathfrak{e}_{7}$ and $\mathfrak{e}_{8}$ for the octonionic plane $\mathbb{O}P^{2}$ and in the octonionic Rosenfeld planes $\left(\mathbb{C}\otimes\mathbb{O}\right)P^{2}$, $\left(\mathbb{H}\otimes\mathbb{O}\right)P^{2}$ and $\left(\mathbb{O}\otimes\mathbb{O}\right)P^{2}$. We finally investigate the relationships between the isometry algebras of the Dixon-Rosenfeld planes and the exceptional Lie algebras.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the irreducible smooth $\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}_{2}$-modules recently constructed in arXiv:2404.03855, and demonstrate that these modules admit a Wakimoto-type realization at both critical and non-critical levels. In the critical level case, we identify simple quotients of these modules with the Wakimoto modules whose irreducibility was already established in arXiv:math/0602181, arXiv:1402.6100. We also generalize some Wakimoto modules constructed in arXiv:1409.5354 and identify them as generalized Whittaker modules.</description>

      <title>Slices for reductive group actions in algebraic and holomorphic symplectic geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symplectic slice theorems elucidate the local structure of symplectic manifolds carrying Hamiltonian actions of compact Lie groups. We generalize these theorems in two natural settings. The first is based on the idea that complex reductive algebraic groups are the natural complex-geometric counterparts of compact Lie groups. Using new definitions of Poisson and symplectic slices, we prove analogues of the classical symplectic slice theorems for Hamiltonian actions of complex reductive algebraic groups. These analogues have versions in the complex-algebraic and holomorphic categories, and make extensive use of Slodowy slices and decomposition classes in complex reductive Lie algebras. The starting point for our second setting is the fact that Hamiltonian Lie group actions are special cases of Hamiltonian symplectic groupoid actions. We generalize the classical symplectic slice theorems to the latter case.</description>

Abstract: B\"ackstr\"om orders are a class of algebras over complete discrete valuation rings. Their Cohen-Macaulay representations are in correspondence with the representations of certain quivers/species by Ringel and Roggenkamp. In this paper, we give explicit descriptions of the singularity categories of B\"ackstr\"om orders via certain von Neumann regular algebras and associated bimodules. We further provide singular equivalences between B\"ackstr\"om orders and specific finite dimensional radical square zero algebras. We also classify weakly regular, Gorenstein, Iwanaga-Gorenstein and sg-Hom-finite B\"ackstr\"om orders.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17887v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a definition of Coxeter-Dynkin algebras of canonical type generalising the definition as a path algebra of a quiver. Moreover, we construct two tilting objects over the squid algebra - one via generalised APR-tilting and one via one-point-extensions and reflection functors - and identify their endomorphism algebras with the Coxeter-Dynkin algebra. This shows that our definition gives another representative in the derived equivalence class of the squid algebra, and hence of the corresponding canonical algebra. Finally, we have a closer look at the Grothendieck group and the Euler form which illustrates the connection to Saito's classification of marked extended affine root systems. On the other hand, this enables us to prove that in the domestic case Coxeter-Dynkin algebras are of finite representation type.</description>

      <title>Pure minimal injective resolutions and perfect modules for lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03385v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a recent article, Iyama and Marczinzik showed that a lattice is distributive if and only if the incidence algebra is Auslander regular, giving a new connection between homological algebra and lattice theory. In this article we study when a distributive lattice has a pure minimal injective coresolution, a notion first introduced and studied in a work of Ajitabh, Smith and Zhang. We will see that this problem naturally leads to studying when certain antichain modules are perfect modules. We give a classification of perfect antichain modules under the assumption that their canonical antichain resolution is minimal and use this to give a completion classification in lattice theoretic terms of incidence algebras of distributive lattices with pure minimal injective coresolution. We use our results to answer a question raised by Ajitabh, Smith and Zhang by showing that there exist Auslander-Gorenstein polynomial identity rings without a pure injective coresolution.</description>

      <title>A Uniform Rewriting Algorithm for Twisted Tensor Representations of Finite General Linear Groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.00263v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $q=p^f$ be a prime power and let $H$ be a classical group of type $A$, so $H \cong \mathrm{SL}_d(q)$ or $\mathrm{GL}_d(q)$, acting on its natural module $V$ of dimension $d$ over $\mathbb{F}_q$. Let $W$ be an absolutely irreducible $\mathbb{F}_qH$--module such that, over an algebraic closure, $W$ is isomorphic (up to Frobenius twists) to a tensor product $\bigotimes_{t=1}^r L(\lambda^{(t)})$, where each $L(\lambda^{(t)})$ is an irreducible polynomial representation of $\mathrm{GL}_d$ of degree $k_t$, and the total degree $K=\sum_t k_t$ satisfies $K&lt;q-1$. We prove a base-$q$ injectivity lemma which shows that, for a Singer cycle $s \in H$, the eigenvalues of $s$ on $W \otimes_{\mathbb{F}_q} \mathbb{F}_{q^d}$ are parametrised by digit vectors of length $d$ with entries bounded by $K$. In particular, distinct weights of $W$ correspond to distinct eigenvalues. If in addition $W$ is multiplicity-free for the diagonal torus of $\mathrm{GL}_d$, then every eigenspace of $s$ is one-dimensional, so $s$ has a simple spectrum on $W$. Using this spectral property we design a Las Vegas rewriting algorithm which, given $G \leq \mathrm{GL}(W)$ isomorphic to $H$ and acting irreducibly on $W$, constructs a projective representation of $G$ of degree $d$ equivalent to the natural representation of $H$. The expected running time is polynomial in $d$, $\log q$ and $K$, and in the cost of field operations and discrete logarithm computations in $\mathbb{F}_{q^d}$. This extends earlier rewriting algorithms of Magaard--O'Brien--Seress and of G\"ul--Ankaral{\i}o\u{g}lu to a broader class of twisted tensor products of polynomial modules.</description>

      <title>Complexity theory of orbit closure intersection for tensors: reductions, completeness, and graph isomorphism hardness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04639v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many natural computational problems in computer science, mathematics, physics, and other sciences amount to deciding if two objects are equivalent. Often this equivalence is defined in terms of group actions. A natural question is to ask when two objects can be distinguished by polynomial functions that are invariant under the group action. For finite groups, this is the usual notion of equivalence, but for continuous groups like the general linear groups it gives rise to a new notion, called orbit closure intersection. It captures, among others, the graph isomorphism problem, noncommutative PIT, null cone problems in invariant theory, equivalence problems for tensor networks, and the classification of multiparty quantum states. Despite recent algorithmic progress in celebrated special cases, the computational complexity of general orbit closure intersection problems is currently quite unclear. In particular, tensors seem to give rise to the most difficult problems.
  In this work we start a systematic study of orbit closure intersection from the complexity-theoretic viewpoint. To this end, we define a complexity class TOCI that captures the power of orbit closure intersection problems for general tensor actions, give an appropriate notion of algebraic reductions that imply polynomial-time reductions in the usual sense, but are amenable to invariant-theoretic techniques, identify natural tensor problems that are complete for TOCI, including the equivalence of 2D tensor networks with constant physical dimension, and show that the graph isomorphism problem can be reduced to these complete problems, hence GI$\subseteq$TOCI. As such, our work establishes the first lower bound on the computational complexity of orbit closure intersection problems, and it explains the difficulty of finding unconditional polynomial-time algorithms beyond special cases, as has been observed in the literature.</description>

As an application, we give a temperedness criterion for $L^2 (G/H)$ for any closed subgroup $H$ of $G$, which extends the existing ones of Benoist--Kobayashi for connected subgroups and Lutsko--Weich--Wolf for discrete subgroups.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Obstructions and the Collapse of Elementary Structure in the Kronecker Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22856v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While Kronecker coefficients $g(\lambda,\mu,\nu)$ with bounded rows are polynomial-time computable via lattice-point methods, no explicit closed-form formulas have been obtained for genuinely three-row cases in the 87 years since Murnaghan's foundational work. This paper provides such formulas for the first time and identifies a universal structural boundary at parameter value 5 where elementary combinatorial patterns collapse.
  We analyze two independent families of genuinely three-row coefficients and establish that for $k \leq 4$, the formulas exhibit elementary structure: oscillation bounds follow the triangular-Hogben pattern, and polynomial expressions factor completely over $\mathbb{Z}$. At the critical threshold $k=5$, this structure collapses: the triangular pattern fails, and algebraic obstructions -- irreducible quadratic factors with negative discriminant -- emerge.
  We develop integer forcing, a proof technique exploiting the tension between continuous asymptotics and discrete integrality. As concrete results, we prove that $g((n,n,1)^3) = 2 - (n \mod 2)$ for all $n \geq 3$ -- the first explicit formula for a genuinely three-row Kronecker coefficient -- derive five explicit polynomial formulas for staircase-hook coefficients, and verify Saxl's conjecture for 132 three-row partitions.</description>
