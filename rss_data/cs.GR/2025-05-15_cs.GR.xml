      <title>VRSplat: Fast and Robust Gaussian Splatting for Virtual Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has rapidly become a leading technique for novel-view synthesis, providing exceptional performance through efficient software-based GPU rasterization. Its versatility enables real-time applications, including on mobile and lower-powered devices. However, 3DGS faces key challenges in virtual reality (VR): (1) temporal artifacts, such as popping during head movements, (2) projection-based distortions that result in disturbing and view-inconsistent floaters, and (3) reduced framerates when rendering large numbers of Gaussians, falling below the critical threshold for VR. Compared to desktop environments, these issues are drastically amplified by large field-of-view, constant head movements, and high resolution of head-mounted displays (HMDs). In this work, we introduce VRSplat: we combine and extend several recent advancements in 3DGS to address challenges of VR holistically. We show how the ideas of Mini-Splatting, StopThePop, and Optimal Projection can complement each other, by modifying the individual techniques and core 3DGS rasterizer. Additionally, we propose an efficient foveated rasterizer that handles focus and peripheral areas in a single GPU launch, avoiding redundant computations and improving GPU utilization. Our method also incorporates a fine-tuning step that optimizes Gaussian parameters based on StopThePop depth evaluations and Optimal Projection. We validate our method through a controlled user study with 25 participants, showing a strong preference for VRSplat over other configurations of Mini-Splatting. VRSplat is the first, systematically evaluated 3DGS approach capable of supporting modern VR applications, achieving 72+ FPS while eliminating popping and stereo-disrupting floaters.</description>

      <title>Style Customization of Text-to-Vector Generation with Image Diffusion Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scalable Vector Graphics (SVGs) are highly favored by designers due to their resolution independence and well-organized layer structure. Although existing text-to-vector (T2V) generation methods can create SVGs from text prompts, they often overlook an important need in practical applications: style customization, which is vital for producing a collection of vector graphics with consistent visual appearance and coherent aesthetics. Extending existing T2V methods for style customization poses certain challenges. Optimization-based T2V models can utilize the priors of text-to-image (T2I) models for customization, but struggle with maintaining structural regularity. On the other hand, feed-forward T2V models can ensure structural regularity, yet they encounter difficulties in disentangling content and style due to limited SVG training data.
  To address these challenges, we propose a novel two-stage style customization pipeline for SVG generation, making use of the advantages of both feed-forward T2V models and T2I image priors. In the first stage, we train a T2V diffusion model with a path-level representation to ensure the structural regularity of SVGs while preserving diverse expressive capabilities. In the second stage, we customize the T2V diffusion model to different styles by distilling customized T2I models. By integrating these techniques, our pipeline can generate high-quality and diverse SVGs in custom styles based on text prompts in an efficient feed-forward manner. The effectiveness of our method has been validated through extensive experiments. The project page is https://customsvg.github.io.</description>

      <title>CartoAgent: a multimodal large language model-powered multi-agent cartographic framework for map style transfer and evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid development of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) presents new opportunities to advance the cartographic process. Previous studies have either overlooked the artistic aspects of maps or faced challenges in creating both accurate and informative maps. In this study, we propose CartoAgent, a novel multi-agent cartographic framework powered by multimodal large language models (MLLMs). This framework simulates three key stages in cartographic practice: preparation, map design, and evaluation. At each stage, different MLLMs act as agents with distinct roles to collaborate, discuss, and utilize tools for specific purposes. In particular, CartoAgent leverages MLLMs' visual aesthetic capability and world knowledge to generate maps that are both visually appealing and informative. By separating style from geographic data, it can focus on designing stylesheets without modifying the vector-based data, thereby ensuring geographic accuracy. We applied CartoAgent to a specific task centered on map restyling-namely, map style transfer and evaluation. The effectiveness of this framework was validated through extensive experiments and a human evaluation study. CartoAgent can be extended to support a variety of cartographic design decisions and inform future integrations of GenAI in cartography.</description>

      <title>LAV: Audio-Driven Dynamic Visual Generation with Neural Compression and StyleGAN2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces LAV (Latent Audio-Visual), a system that integrates EnCodec's neural audio compression with StyleGAN2's generative capabilities to produce visually dynamic outputs driven by pre-recorded audio. Unlike previous works that rely on explicit feature mappings, LAV uses EnCodec embeddings as latent representations, directly transformed into StyleGAN2's style latent space via randomly initialized linear mapping. This approach preserves semantic richness in the transformation, enabling nuanced and semantically coherent audio-visual translations. The framework demonstrates the potential of using pretrained audio compression models for artistic and computational applications.</description>

      <title>Single View Garment Reconstruction Using Diffusion Mapping Via Pattern Coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08353v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reconstructing 3D clothed humans from images is fundamental to applications like virtual try-on, avatar creation, and mixed reality. While recent advances have enhanced human body recovery, accurate reconstruction of garment geometry -- especially for loose-fitting clothing -- remains an open challenge. We present a novel method for high-fidelity 3D garment reconstruction from single images that bridges 2D and 3D representations. Our approach combines Implicit Sewing Patterns (ISP) with a generative diffusion model to learn rich garment shape priors in a 2D UV space. A key innovation is our mapping model that establishes correspondences between 2D image pixels, UV pattern coordinates, and 3D geometry, enabling joint optimization of both 3D garment meshes and the corresponding 2D patterns by aligning learned priors with image observations. Despite training exclusively on synthetically simulated cloth data, our method generalizes effectively to real-world images, outperforming existing approaches on both tight- and loose-fitting garments. The reconstructed garments maintain physical plausibility while capturing fine geometric details, enabling downstream applications including garment retargeting and texture manipulation.</description>

      <title>IntrinsicEdit: Precise generative image manipulation in intrinsic space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08889v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative diffusion models have advanced image editing with high-quality results and intuitive interfaces such as prompts and semantic drawing. However, these interfaces lack precise control, and the associated methods typically specialize on a single editing task. We introduce a versatile, generative workflow that operates in an intrinsic-image latent space, enabling semantic, local manipulation with pixel precision for a range of editing operations. Building atop the RGB-X diffusion framework, we address key challenges of identity preservation and intrinsic-channel entanglement. By incorporating exact diffusion inversion and disentangled channel manipulation, we enable precise, efficient editing with automatic resolution of global illumination effects -- all without additional data collection or model fine-tuning. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across a variety of tasks on complex images, including color and texture adjustments, object insertion and removal, global relighting, and their combinations.</description>

      <title>Random Walks Performed by Topologically-Specific Agents on Complex Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00859v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Random walks by single-node agents have been systematically conducted on various types of complex networks in order to investigate how their topologies can affect the dynamics of the agents. However, by fitting any network node, these agents do not engage in topological interactions with the network. In the present work, we describe random walks on complex networks performed by agents that are actually small graphs. These agents can only occupy admissible portions of the network onto which they fit topologically, hence their name being taken as topologically-specific agents. These agents are also allowed to move to adjacent subgraphs in the network, which have each node adjacent to a distinct original respective node of the agent. Given a network and a specific agent, it is possible to obtain a respective associated network, in which each node corresponds to a possible instance of the agent and the edges indicate adjacent positions. Associated networks are obtained and studied respectively to three types of topologically-specific agents (triangle, square, and slashed square) considering three types of complex networks (geometrical, Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi, and Barab\'asi-Albert). Uniform random walks are also performed on these structures, as well as networks respectively obtained by removing the five nodes with the highest degree, and studied in terms of the number of covered nodes along the walks. Several results are reported and discussed, including the fact that substantially distinct associated networks can be obtained for each of the three considered agents and for varying average node degrees. Respectively to the coverage of the networks by uniform random walks, the square agent led to the most effective coverage of the nodes, followed by the triangle and slashed square agents. In addition, the geometric network turned out to be less effectively covered.</description>
