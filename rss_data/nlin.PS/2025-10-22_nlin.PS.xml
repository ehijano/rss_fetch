      <title>Kink-antikink soliton solutions of the nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation on branched structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation on a metric star graph with three semi-infinite bonds. At the branching point, we impose a weighted continuity condition and a generalized weighted Kirchhoff condition for the derivatives of the wave function. By employing both analytical methods and numerical techniques, we construct exact and numerical soliton solutions that satisfy the vertex conditions and conserve energy and momentum. The results of analytic calculations are confirmed through numerical experiments, which demonstrate reflectionless propagation of kink-antikink soliton solutions. We compute and analyze the reflection coefficient, study the impact of various nonlinearity parameters, and further extend the formulation to other graph topologies, such as tree and loop graphs.</description>

      <title>Resonance phenomena in vortex-antivortex collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we provide a full map of scattering scenarios between a Nielsen-Olesen vortex and antivortex. Importantly, in the deep type II regime, such a collision reveals a chaotic pattern in the final state formation with bounce windows immersed into annihilation regions. This structure is due to the energy transfer mechanism triggered by a quasinormal mode, specifically the Feshbach resonant mode, hosted by the vortex.</description>

      <title>Computational Physics Applied to Photonic Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We all know that the first laser device was realised by Theodore Maiman at Hughes Labs in 1960. Less known is that the very first computer simulations of the relaxation oscillations displayed by Maiman's laser were also performed in 1960 on a digital IBM 704 computer. The reason is that lasers and almost all photonic devices are described by nonlinear equations that are more often than not impossible to be solved analytically, i.e. on a piece of paper. Since then the development and applications of lasers and photonic devices has progressed hand in hand with computer simulations and numerical programming. In this review we introduce and numerically solve the model equations for a variety of devices, lasers, lasers with modulated parameters, lasers with injection, Kerr resonators, saturable absorbers and optical parametric oscillators. By using computer simulations we demonstrate stability and instability of nonlinear solutions in these photonic devices via pitchfork, saddle-node, Hopf and Turing bifurcations; bistability, nonlinear oscillations, deterministic chaos, Turing patterns, conservative solitons; bright, dark and grey cavity solitons; frequency combs, spatial disorder, spatio-temporal chaos, defect mediated turbulence and even rogue waves. There has been a one-to-one correspondence between computer simulations of all these nonlinear features and laboratory experiments with applications in ultrafast optical communications, optical memories, neural networks, frequency standards, optical clocks, future GPS, astronomy and quantum technologies. All of this has been made possible by 'novel insights into spatio-temporal dynamics of lasers, nonlinear and quantum optical systems, achieved through the development and application of powerful techniques for small-scale computing' (2011 Occhialini Medal and Prize of the Institute of Physics and Societa' Italiana di Fisica).</description>

      <title>Evolution of perturbed long nonlinear plane, ring and hybrid surface waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12002v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The two-dimensional evolution of perturbed long weakly-nonlinear surface plane, ring, and hybrid waves, consisting, to leading order, of a part of a ring and two tangent plane waves, is modelled numerically within the scope of the 2D Boussinesq-Peregrine system. Numerical runs are initiated and interpreted using the reduced 2+1-dimensional cKdV-type and KPII equations. The cKdV-type equation leads to two different models, the KdV$\theta$ and cKdV equations, depending on whether we use the general or singular (i.e. the envelope of the general) solution of the associated nonlinear first-order differential equation. The KdV$\theta$ equation is also derived directly from the 2D Boussinesq-Peregrine system and used to analytically describe the intermediate 2D asymptotics of line solitons subject to sufficiently long transverse perturbations of finite strength, while the cKdV equation is used to initiate outward- and inward-propagating ring waves with localised and periodic perturbations. Both of these equations, together with the KPII equation, are used to model the evolution of hybrid waves, where we show, in particular, that large localised waves (lumps) can appear as transient (emerging and then disappearing) states in the evolution of inward-propagating waves, contributing to the possible mechanisms for the generation of rogue waves. Detailed comparisons are made between the key features of the non-stationary two-dimensional modelling and relevant predictions of the reduced equations.</description>
