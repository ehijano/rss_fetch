      <title>A Quantum Algorithm for the Classification of Patterns of Boolean Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel quantum algorithm that is able to classify a hierarchy of classes of imbalanced Boolean functions. The fundamental characteristic of imbalanced Boolean functions is that the proportion of elements in their domain that take the value $0$ is not equal to the proportion of elements that take the value $1$. For every positive integer $n$, the hierarchy contains a class of Boolean functions defined based on their behavioral pattern. The common trait of all the functions belonging to the same class is that they possess the same imbalance ratio. Our algorithm achieves classification in a straightforward manner as the final measurement reveals the unknown function with probability $1$. Let us also note that the proposed algorithm is an optimal oracular algorithm because it can classify the aforementioned functions with a single query to the oracle. At the same time we explain in detail the methodology we followed to design this algorithm in the hope that it will prove general and fruitful, given that it can be easily modified and extended to address other classes of imbalanced Boolean functions that exhibit different behavioral patterns.</description>

Abstract: The processual consciousness interpretation (PCI), as developed in Arroyo (2024, chap. 5) and Arroyo, Nunes Filho, and Moreira dos Santos (2024), proposes a process ontology as a solution to the measurement problem. This article presents the standard interpretation taken to its ultimate ontological consequences; introduces the PCI; and offers reflections based on the questions raised about the PCI during the XX ANPOF Meeting, in the session of the WG on Philosophy of the Physical Sciences.</description>

      <title>Power-consumption Backdoor in Quantum Key Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the last decades, Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) has risen as a promising solution for secure communications. However, like all cryptographic protocols, QKD implementations can open security vulnerabilities. Until now, the study of physical vulnerabilities in QKD setups has primarily focused on the optical channel. In classical cryptoanalysis, power and electromagnetic side-channel analysis are powerful techniques used to access unwanted information about the encryption key in symmetric-key algorithms. In QKD they have rarely been used, since they require an eavesdropper to have access to Alice or Bob's setups. However, security proofs of QKD protocols generally assume that these setups are secure, making it crucial to understand the necessary security measures to ensure this protection. In this work, we propose and implement a power side-channel analysis to a QKD system, by exploiting the power consumption of the electronic driver controlling the electro-optical components of the QKD transmitter. QKD modules typically require very precise electronic drivers, such as Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). Here, we show that the FPGA's power consumption can leak information about the QKD operation, and consequently the transmitted key. The analysis was performed on the QKD transmitter at the University of Padua. Our results are consistent and show critical information leakage, having reached a maximum accuracy of 73.35% in predicting transmitted qubits at a 100 MHz repetition frequency.</description>

      <title>Probing prethermal nonergodicity through measurement outcomes of monitored quantum dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Projective measurements are a key element in quantum physics and enable rich phenomena in monitored quantum dynamics. Here, we show that the measurement outcomes, recorded during monitored dynamics, can provide crucial information about the properties of the monitored dynamical system itself. We demonstrate this for a Floquet model of many-body localization, where we find that the prethermal many-body localized regime becomes unstable against rare measurements, yielding an unusual enhancement of quantum entanglement. Through an unsupervised learning and mutual information analysis on the classical dataset of measurement outcomes, we find that the information loss in the system, reflected by the increased entanglement, is compensated by an emergent structure in this classical dataset. Our findings highlight the crucial role of measurements and corresponding classical outcomes in capturing prethermal nonergodicity, offering a promising perspective for applications to other monitored quantum dynamics.</description>

      <title>Noise-strength-adapted approximate quantum codes inspired by machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that machine learning provides a powerful tool for discovering new approximate quantum error-correcting (AQEC) codes beyond conventional algebraic frameworks. Building upon results from hybrid quantum-classical learning, we construct two novel types of noise-strength-adapted (NSA) AQEC codes, namely a self-complementary code and a pair-complementary code, which can outperform conventional codes for amplitude damping (AD) noise. The 4-qubit self-complementary NSA code outperforms its non-NSA counterpart in fidelity and Knill-Laflamme condition violation. The pair-complementary code, which has no known non-NSA analog, achieves even better performance with higher-order loss suppression and better fidelity. We further generalize both approaches to families of NSA AD codes of arbitrary system size, as well as an NSA variant of the 0-2-4 binomial code for single-photon loss. Our results demonstrate that adaptation to noise strength can lead to significant improvements in error correction capability, and highlight how machine learning can help discover new valuable codes that may be missed through conventional algebraic approaches.</description>

      <title>Near-Term Fermionic Simulation with Subspace Noise Tailored Quantum Error Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum error mitigation (QEM) has emerged as a powerful tool for the extraction of useful quantum information from quantum devices. Here, we introduce the Subspace Noise Tailoring (SNT) algorithm, which efficiently combines the cheap cost of Symmetry Verification (SV) and low bias of Probabilistic Error Cancellation (PEC) QEM techniques. We study the performance of our method by simulating the Trotterized time evolution of the spin-1/2 Fermi-Hubbard model (FHM) using a variety of local fermion-to-qubit encodings, which define a computational subspace through a set of stabilizers, the measurement of which can be used to post-select noisy quantum data. We study different combinations of QEM and encodings and uncover a rich phase diagram of optimal combinations, depending on the hardware performance, system size and available shot budget. We then demonstrate how SNT extends the reach of current noisy quantum computers in terms of the number of fermionic lattice sites and the number of Trotter steps, and quantify the required hardware performance beyond which a noisy device may outperform classical computational methods.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium Universality of a Squeezing Phase Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate phase transitions in the nonequilibrium dynamics of power-law interacting spin-1/2 bilayer XXZ models, which have recently been shown to allow generation of entanglement in the form of two-mode squeezing. We find a transition between a phase characterized by Heisenberg limited squeezing and a partially collective phase. We identify universal scaling of the squeezing dynamics in terms of system parameters and a divergent time-scale, establishing these as distinct dynamical phases. Our work demonstrates a novel dynamical phase transition with potential applications in quantum sensing and quantum simulation in cold-atomic, molecular or Rydberg platforms.</description>

      <title>High-Efficiency, Low-Loss Floquet-mode Traveling Wave Parametric Amplifier Characterization and Measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advancing error-corrected quantum computing and fundamental science necessitates quantum-limited amplifiers with near-ideal quantum efficiency and multiplexing capability. However, existing solutions achieve one at the expense of the other. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate the first Floquet-mode traveling-wave parametric amplifier (Floquet TWPA). Fabricated in a superconducting-qubit process, our Floquet TWPA achieves minimal dissipation, quantum-limited noise performance, and broadband operation. Our device exhibits $&gt;20$-dB amplification over a $3$-GHz instantaneous bandwidth, $&lt;\!0.5$-dB average in-band insertion loss, and the highest-reported intrinsic quantum efficiency for a TWPA of $92.1\pm7.6\%$, relative to an ideal phase-preserving amplifier. When measuring a superconducting qubit, our Floquet TWPA enables a system measurement efficiency of $65.1\pm5.8\%$, the highest-reported in a superconducting qubit readout experiment utilizing phase-preserving amplifiers to the best of our knowledge. These general-purpose Floquet TWPAs are suitable for fast, high-fidelity multiplexed readout in large-scale quantum systems and future monolithic integration with quantum processors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum walks in general graphs, or more specifically scattering on graphs, encompass enough complexity to perform universal quantum computation. Any given quantum circuit can be broken down into single- and two-qubit gates, which then can be translated into subgraphs -- gadgets -- that implement such unitaries on the logical qubits, simulated by particles traveling along a sparse graph. In this work, we start to develop a full theory of multi-particle scattering on graphs and give initial applications to build multi-particle gadgets with different properties.</description>

      <title>Application of the Pontryagin Maximum Principle to the robust time-optimal control of two-level quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the time-optimal robust control of a two-level quantum system subjected to field inhomogeneities. We apply the Pontryagin Maximum Principle and we introduce a reduced space onto which the optimal dynamics is projected down. This reduction leads to a complete analytical derivation of the optimal solution in terms of elliptic functions and elliptic integrals. Necessary optimality conditions are then obtained for the original system. These conditions are verified numerically and lead to the optimal control protocol. Various examples, ranging from state-to-state transfer to the generation of a Not gate, illustrate this study. The connection with other geometric optimization approaches that have been used to solve this problem is also discussed.</description>

      <title>The Role of Quantum Measurements when Testing the Quantum Nature of Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to test the quantum nature of gravity, it is essential to explore the construction of classical gravity theories that are as consistent with experiments as possible. In particular, the classical gravity field must receive input regarding matter distribution. Previously, such input has been constructed by taking expectation values of the matter density operator or by using the outcomes of all measurements being performed on the quantum system. We propose a framework that unifies these models, and argue that the Causal Conditional Formulation of Schroedinger-Newton (CCSN) theory, which takes classical inputs only from experimental and environmental channels, is a minimum model within this framework. Since CCSN can be viewed as a quantum feedback control scheme, it can be made causal and free from pathologies that previously plagued SN theories. Since classical information from measurement results are used to generate classical gravity, CCSN can mimic quantum gravity better than one would naively expect for a classical theory. We predict experimental signatures of CCSN in two concrete scenarios: (i) a single test mass and (ii) two objects interacting via mutual gravity. In case (i), we show that the mass-concentration effect of self classical gravity still makes CCSN much easier to test than testing the mutual entanglement, yet the signatures are more subtle than previously thought for classical gravity theories. Using time-delayed and non-stationary measurements, which delay or suspend the flow of classical information into classical gravity, one can make CCSN more detectable. In case (ii), we show that mutual gravity generated by CCSN can lead to correlations that largely mimic signatures of quantum entanglement. Rigorous protocols that rule out LOCC channels, which are experimentally more challenging than simply testing entanglement, must be applied to completely rule out CCSN.</description>

      <title>Nonlinearity-driven Topology via Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topology and nonlinearity are deeply connected. However, whether topological effects can arise solely from the structure of nonlinear interaction terms, and the nature of the resulting topological phases, remain to large extent open questions. Here we consider a chain of parametrically-driven quantum resonators coupled only via weak nearest-neighbour cross-Kerr interaction, without any quadratic tunneling term. We show that, when the drive overcomes a critical threshold value, the system undergoes a transition from the atomic limit of decoupled oscillators to a symmetry-broken topological phase. The topology is dictated by the structure of the Kerr nonlinearity, yielding a non-trivial bulk-boundary correspondence. In the topological phase, we find different effective models for periodic and open boundary conditions and derive analytical approximations for the low-energy spectrum, identifying the conditions to observe topological edge modes.</description>

      <title>Sub-nanometer measuring ellipticity of a suspended optical nanowaveguides based on nondegenerate mechanical modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical waveguides with miniature dimensions to the nanoscale can facilitate the development of highly integrated photonic devices, integrated optical circuits and hybrid quantum system coupling with emitters. Nondegenerate intrinsic flexural mechanical modes of nanowaveguides provide unique insights into the mechanical properties and structural integrity of materials, which is great significance to the applications of the nanowaveguides. Here, we propose and implement a scheme to measure the nondegenerate intrinsic flexural mechanical modes of a suspended optical nanowaveguide, a tapered optical fiber (TOF). A TOF with an elliptical cross section can support two nondegenerate intrinsic flexural mechanical modes (IFMMs) because the two orthogonal modes vibrate along the principal axes (major or minor axis) of the elliptical TOF cross section with splitting vibration frequencies. The frequency ratio for the two IFMMs approaches a constant with increasing mode order, which is equal to the inverse of the TOF ellipticity. Thus, the TOF ellipticity can be determined on the basis of the splitting vibration frequencies of the nondegenerate modes with subnanometer-level accuracy, 0.16 nm for a TOF radius of 260 nm. The elliptical TOF's nondegenerate IFMMs offer a novel pathway for research on nanoscale structures and vector measurement in fields such as quantum optics, atom physics, sensing, optical communications, and micronanomechanics.</description>

      <title>Twin-Polaritons: Classical versus Quantum Features in Polaritonic Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding whether a polaritonic phenomenon is inherently quantum or classical is essential for developing accurate models and optimizing experimental designs. We investigate this question in the context of polaritonic rotational-vibrational spectra and report a new feature, the twin-polariton, an additional splitting beyond the usual primary resonant polariton splitting that arises from light-matter entanglement. Through ab-initio calculations of HCl molecules and a corresponding model system coupled to a cavity, we demonstrate that the twin-polariton persists in the many-molecule case and follows the same linear dependence on coupling strength as the primary resonant polariton splitting. This finding reveals a novel mechanism to tune a quantum feature using a classical one, offering new insights into the fundamental nature of polaritonic systems.</description>

      <title>TetrisLock: Quantum Circuit Split Compilation with Interlocking Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantum computing, quantum circuits are fundamental representations of quantum algorithms, which are compiled into executable functions for quantum solutions. Quantum compilers transform algorithmic quantum circuits into one compatible with target quantum computers, bridging quantum software and hardware. However, untrusted quantum compilers pose significant risks. They can lead to the theft of quantum circuit designs and compromise sensitive intellectual property (IP). In this paper, we propose TetrisLock, a split compilation method for quantum circuit obfuscation that uses an interlocking splitting pattern to effectively protect IP with minimal resource overhead. Our approach divides the quantum circuit into two interdependent segments, ensuring that reconstructing the original circuit functionality is possible only by combining both segments and eliminating redundancies. This method makes reverse engineering by an untrusted compiler unrealizable, as the original circuit is never fully shared with any single entity. Also, our approach eliminates the need for a trusted compiler to process the inserted random circuit, thereby relaxing the security requirements. Additionally, it defends against colluding attackers with mismatched numbers of qubits, while maintaining low overhead by preserving the original depth of the quantum circuit. We demonstrate our method by using established RevLib benchmarks, showing that it achieves a minimal impact on functional accuracy (less than 1%) while significantly reducing the likelihood of IP inference.</description>

      <title>Circuit Design based on Feature Similarity for Quantum Generative Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum generative models may achieve an advantage on quantum devices by their inherent probabilistic nature and efficient sampling strategies. However, current approaches mostly rely on general-purpose circuits, such as the hardware efficient ansatz paired with a random initialization strategy, which are known to suffer from trainability issues such as barren plateaus. To address these issues, a tensor network pretraining framework that initializes a quantum circuit ansatz with a classically computed high-quality solution for a linear entanglement structure has been proposed in literature. In order to improve the classical solution, the quantum circuit needs to be extended, while it is still an open question how the extension affects trainability. In this work, we propose the metric-based extension heuristic to design an extended circuit based on a similarity metric measured between the dataset features. We validate this method on the bars and stripes dataset and carry out experiments on financial data. Our results underline the importance of problem-informed circuit design and show that the metric-based extension heuristic offers the means to introduce inductive bias while designing a circuit under limited resources.</description>

      <title>Niobium Air Bridges as a Low-Loss Component for Superconducting Quantum Hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scaling up superconducting quantum processors requires a high routing density for readout and control lines, relying on low-loss interconnects to maintain design flexibility and device performance. We propose and demonstrate a universal subtractive fabrication process for air bridges based on an aluminum hard mask and niobium as the superconducting film. Using this technology, we fabricate superconducting CPW resonators incorporating multiple niobium air bridges in and across their center conductors. Through rigorous cleaning methods, we achieve mean internal quality factors in the single-photon limit exceeding $Q_{\mathrm{int}} = 8.2 \times 10^6$. Notably, the loss per air bridge remains below the detection threshold of the resonators. Due to the larger superconducting energy gap of niobium compared to conventional aluminum air bridges, our approach enables stable performance at elevated temperatures and magnetic fields, which we experimentally confirm in temperatures up to 3.9 K and in a magnetic field of up to 1.60 T. Additionally, we utilize air bridges to realize low-loss vacuum-gap capacitors and demonstrate their successful integration into transmon qubits by achieving median qubit lifetimes of $T_1 = 51.6 \,\mu\text{s}$.</description>

      <title>Automatic Characterization of Fluxonium Superconducting Qubits Parameters with Deep Transfer Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate determination of qubit parameters is critical for the successful implementation of quantum information and computation applications. In solid state systems, the parameters of individual qubits vary across the entire system, requiring time consuming measurements and manual fitting processes for characterization. Recent developed superconducting qubits, such as fluxonium or 0-pi qubits, offer improved fidelity operations but exhibit a more complex physical and spectral structure, complicating parameter extraction. In this work, we propose a machine learning (ML)based methodology for the automatic and accurate characterization of fluxonium qubit parameters. Our approach utilized the energy spectrum calculated by a model Hamiltonian with various magnetic fields, as training data for the ML model. The output consists of the essential fluxonium qubit energy parameters, EJ, EC, and EL in Hamiltonian. The ML model achieves remarkable accuracy (with an average accuracy 95.6%) as an initial guess, enabling the development of an automatic fitting procedure for direct application to realistic experimental data. Moreover, we demonstrate that similar accuracy can be retrieved even when the input experimental spectrum is noisy or incomplete, highlighting the model robustness. These results suggest that our automated characterization method, based on a transfer learning approach, provides a reliable framework for future extensions to other superconducting qubits or different solid-state systems. Ultimately, we believe this methodology paves the way for the construction of large-scale quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Irreversibility of Linear Maps in terms of Subjectivity &amp; Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In both classical and quantum physics, irreversible processes are described by maps that contract the space of states. The change in volume has often been taken as a natural quantifier of the amount of irreversibility. In Bayesian inference, loss of information results in the retrodiction for the initial state becoming increasingly influenced by the choice of reference prior. In this paper, we import this latter perspective into physics, by quantifying the irreversibility of any process with its Bayesian subjectivity; that is, the sensitivity of its retrodiction to one's prior. We show that this measure not only coheres with other figures of merit for irreversibility, but also has joint monotonicities with physically noteworthy information geometric measures.</description>

      <title>Indistinguishable Single Photons from Nanowire Quantum Dots in the Telecom O-Band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On-demand single-photon sources operating at telecom wavelengths are crucial for quantum communication and photonic quantum technologies. In this work, we demonstrate high-purity, indistinguishable single-photon generation in the telecom O-band from an InAsP/InP nanowire quantum dot. We measured a single-photon purity of $g^2(0)=0.006(3)$ under aboveband excitation. Furthermore, we characterize two-photon interference via Hong-Ou-Mandel measurements and achieve a photon indistinguishability of $94.6\,\%$ with a temporal postselection of 100 ps time window and $5.58\,\%$ without temporal postselection. We measure a first-lens source efficiency of $\sim28\,\%$. These results highlight the potential of nanowire quantum dots as a promising source of telecom single photons for photonic quantum applications, offering deterministic positioning, efficient photon extraction, and scalable production.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a periodic quantum clock based on cooperative resonance fluorescence at zero temperature.
  In the quantum case, this system has an exact steady state and the limit cycle appears in conditional quantum dynamics under homodyne detection. We show that the intrinsic quantum phase diffusion on the limit cycle leads to fluctuations in the period. By simulating the stochastic master equation for homodyne detection, we extract the statistical properties of the clock period. We show that the precision of the clock satisfies the quantum-thermodynamic kinetic uncertainty relations. As energy dissipation increases, the clock quality improves, fully validating, in a quantum stochastic system, the link between energy dissipation and clock precision.</description>

      <title>A Comparative Study of Quantum Optimization Techniques for Solving Combinatorial Optimization Benchmark Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum optimization holds promise for addressing classically intractable combinatorial problems, yet a standardized framework for benchmarking its performance, particularly in terms of solution quality, computational speed, and scalability is still lacking. In this work, we introduce a comprehensive benchmarking framework designed to systematically evaluate a range of quantum optimization techniques against well-established NP-hard combinatorial problems. Our framework focuses on key problem classes, including the Multi-Dimensional Knapsack Problem (MDKP), Maximum Independent Set (MIS), Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP), and Market Share Problem (MSP). Our study evaluates gate-based quantum approaches, including the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) and its CVaR-enhanced variant, alongside advanced quantum algorithms such as the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) and its extensions. To address resource constraints, we incorporate qubit compression techniques like Pauli Correlation Encoding (PCE) and Quantum Random Access Optimization (QRAO). Experimental results, obtained from simulated quantum environments and classical solvers, provide key insights into feasibility, optimality gaps, and scalability. Our findings highlight both the promise and current limitations of quantum optimization, offering a structured pathway for future research and practical applications in quantum-enhanced decision-making.</description>

      <title>Designing quantum error correction codes for practical spin qudit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The implementation of practical error correction protocols is essential for deployment of quantum information technologies. Ways of exploiting high-spin nuclei, which have multi-level quantum resources, have attracted interest in this context because they offer additional Hilbert space dimensions in a spatially compact and theoretically efficient structure. We present a quantitative analysis of the performance of a spin-qudit-based error-correctable quantum memory, with reference to the actual Hamiltonians of several potential candidate systems. First, the ideal code-word implemented on a spin-7/2 nucleus, which provides first order Pauli-$X$, $Y$ and $Z$ error correction, has intrinsic infidelity due to mixed eigenstates under realistic conditions. We confirm that expansion to a spin-9/2 system with tailored code-words can compensate this infidelity. Second, we claim that electric field fluctuations -- which are inevitable in real systems -- should also be considered as a noise source, and we illustrate an encoding/decoding scheme for a multi-spin-qudit-based error correction code that can simultaneously compensate for both electric and magnetic field perturbations. Such strategies are important as we move beyond the current noisy-intermediate quantum era, and fidelities above two or three nines becomes crucial for implementation of quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Tunable N-level EIT: Deterministic Generation of Optical States with Negative Wigner Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong optical nonlinearities are key to a range of technologies, particularly in the generation of photonic quantum states. The strongest nonlinearity in hot atomic vapors originates from electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT), which, while effective, often lacks tunability and suffers from significant losses due to atomic absorption. We propose and demonstrate an N-level EIT scheme, created by an optical frequency comb that excites a warm rubidium vapor. The massive number of comb lines simultaneously drive numerous transitions that interfere constructively to induce a giant and highly tunable cross-Kerr optical nonlinearity. The obtained third-order nonlinearity values range from $1.2 \times 10^{-7}$ to $7.7 \times 10^{-7}$ $m^2 V^{-2}$. Above and beyond that, the collective N-level interference can be optimized by phase shaping the comb lines using a spectral phase mask. Each nonlinearity value can then be tuned over a wide range, from 40\% to 250\% of the initial strength. We utilize the nonlinearity to demonstrate squeezing by self polarization rotation of CW signals that co-propagate with the pump and are tuned to one of the EIT transparent regions. Homodyne measurements reveal a quadrature squeezing level of 3.5 dB at a detuning of 640 MHz. When tuned closer to an atomic resonance, the nonlinearity is significantly enhanced while maintaining low losses, resulting in the generation of non-Gaussian cubic phase states. These states exhibit negative regions in their Wigner functions, a hallmark of quantum behavior. Consequently, N-level EIT enables the direct generation of photonic quantum states without requiring postselection.</description>

      <title>Floquet Engineering Clock Transitions in Magnetic Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically study Floquet engineering of magnetic molecules via a time-periodic magnetic field that couples to the emergent total spin of the metal center. By focusing on an $S = 1$ electronic spin Hamiltonian containing the zero-field and Zeeman terms, we demonstrate significant continuous tunability of the low-lying energy levels. Remarkably, under the action of linearly polarized Floquet controls, all three energy levels retain their stability against variations in an external static magnetic field so that any pair of renormalized energy levels forms a clock transition qubit. This property is closely linked to having a net-zero total Zeeman shift, which results from both static and effective dynamical contributions. Further physical insights are obtained from an effective Hamiltonian, derived analytically from second order van Vleck degenerate perturbation theory. Based on our theoretical predictions, experimentalists will be able to dynamically tune qubit energy gaps to values that are useful in their specific laboratory settings, while retaining the spin decoherence suppressing effect of maintaining a clock transition.</description>

      <title>Generalized Knill-Laflamme Theorem for Families of Isoclinic Subspaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Isoclinic subspaces have been studied for over a century. Quantum error correcting codes were recently shown to define a subclass of families of isoclinic subspaces. The Knill-Laflamme Theorem is a seminal result in the theory of quantum error correction, a central topic in quantum information. We show there is a generalized version of the Knill-Laflamme result and conditions that applies to all families of isoclinic subspaces. In the case of quantum stabilizer codes, the expanded conditions are shown to capture logical operators. We apply the general conditions to give a new perspective on a classical subclass of isoclinic subspaces defined by the graphs of anticommuting unitary operators. We show how the result applies to recently studied mutually unbiased quantum measurements (MUMs), and we give a new construction of such measurements motivated by the approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating the overlap between an approximate wavefunction and a target eigenstate of the system Hamiltonian is essential for the efficiency of quantum phase estimation. In this work, we derive upper and lower bounds on this overlap using expectation values of Hamiltonian powers and bounds on target eigenenergies. The accuracy of these bounds can be systematically improved by computing higher-order Hamiltonian moments and refining eigenenergy estimates. Our method offers a practical approach to assessing initial state quality and can be implemented on both classical and quantum computers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Physics-Informed Neural Networks (QPINNs) integrate quantum computing and machine learning to impose physical biases on the output of a quantum neural network, aiming to either solve or discover differential equations. The approach has recently been implemented on both the gate model and continuous variable quantum computing architecture, where it has been demonstrated capable of solving ordinary differential equations. Here, we aim to extend the method to effectively address a wider range of equations, such as the Poisson equation and the heat equation. To achieve this goal, we introduce an architecture specifically designed to compute second-order (and higher-order) derivatives without relying on nested automatic differentiation methods. This approach mitigates the unwanted side effects associated with nested gradients in simulations, paving the way for more efficient and accurate implementations. By leveraging such an approach, the quantum circuit addresses partial differential equations -- a challenge not yet tackled using this approach on continuous-variable quantum computers. As a proof-of-concept, we solve a one-dimensional instance of the heat equation, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling PDEs. Such a framework paves the way for further developments in continuous-variable quantum computing and underscores its potential contributions to advancing quantum machine learning.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing optimal strategies to calibrate quantum processors for high-fidelity operation is one of the outstanding challenges in quantum computing today. Here, we demonstrate multiple examples of high-fidelity operations achieved using a unified global optimization-driven automated calibration routine on a six dot semiconductor quantum processor. Within the same algorithmic framework we optimize readout, shuttling and single-qubit quantum gates by tailoring task-specific cost functions and tuning parameters based on the underlying physics of each operation. Our approach reaches systematically $99\%$ readout fidelity, $&gt;99\%$ shuttling fidelity over an effective distance of 10$\mu$m, and $&gt;99.5\%$ single-qubit gate fidelity on timescales similar or shorter compared to those of expert human operators. The flexibility of our gradient-free closed loop algorithmic procedure allows for seamless application across diverse qubit functionalities while providing a systematic framework to tune-up semiconductor quantum devices and enabling interpretability of the identified optimal operation points.</description>

      <title>Quantum-enhanced quickest change detection of transmission loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A sudden increase of loss in an optical communications channel can be caused by a malicious wiretapper, or for a benign reason such as inclement weather in a free-space channel or an unintentional bend in an optical fiber. We show that adding a small amount of squeezing to bright phase-modulated coherent-state pulses can dramatically increase the homodyne detection receiver's sensitivity to change detection in channel loss, without affecting the communications rate. We further show that augmenting blocks of $n$ pulses of a coherent-state codeword with weak continuous-variable entanglement generated by splitting squeezed vacuum pulses in a temporal $n$-mode equal splitter progressively enhances this change-detection sensitivity as $n$ increases; the aforesaid squeezed-light augmentation being the $n=1$ special case. For $n$ high enough, an arbitrarily small amount of quantum-augmented photons per pulse diminishes the change-detection latency by the inverse of the pre-detection channel loss. This superadditivity-like phenomenon in the entanglement-augmented relative entropy rate, which quantifies the latency of change-point detection, may find other uses. We discuss the quantum limit of quickest change detection and a receiver that achieves it, tradeoffs between continuous and discrete-variable quantum augmentation, and the broad problem of joint classical-and-quantum communications and channel-change-detection that our study opens up.</description>

      <title>Robust Lindbladian Tomography for Cyclic Quantum Gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise characterization of noisy quantum operations plays an important role for realizing further accurate operations. Quantum tomography is a popular class of characterization methods, and several advanced methods in the class use error amplification circuit (EAC), a repetition of a sequence of quantum gates, for increasing their estimation precision. Here, we develop new theoretical tools for analyzing effects of an EAC on Lindbladian error of cyclic gates in the EAC for arbitrary finite-dimensional system, which takes non-commutativity between different gates or between ideal and error parts of a gate, periodic properties of ideal gates, and repetition of gate sequence into consideration within a linear approximation. We also propose a tomographic protocol for the Lindbladian errors of cyclic gates based on the linear approximation, named Robust Lindbladian Tomography (RLT). The numerical optimization at data-processing of the proposed method reduces from nonlinear to linear (positive semi-definite) programming. Therefore, compared to the original optimization problem, the reduced one is solvable more efficiently and stably, although its numerical cost grows exponentially with respect to the number of qubits, which is the same as other tomographic methods.</description>

      <title>Numerical Investigations of Electron Dynamics in a Linear Paul Trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trapped electrons have emerged as an interesting platform for quantum information processing due to their light mass, two-level spin states, and potential for fully electronic manipulation. Previous experiments have demonstrated electron trapping in Penning traps, Paul traps, on solid neon, and superfluid films. In this work, we consider electrons confined in Paul traps, with their spin states as the qubits. For this approach, if the two electrons are trapped in the same potential well, they must form Wigner crystals and remain stable under a static magnetic field to enable two-qubit gates, achievable only within certain trapping parameters. To identify feasible operating conditions, we performed numerical simulations of electron dynamics in linear Paul traps, finding the threshold temperatures required to form two-electron Wigner crystals and studying how the thresholds scale with trap frequencies. In addition, we numerically verified the cooling methods required to reach the crystallization thresholds. Lastly, we examined the stability of electrons under various magnetic field strengths and identified stable regions of trap operation.</description>

      <title>Analytically Solvable Robust Single-Qubit Gates for Multi-Qubit Systems with Unwanted Couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Couplings between qubits, while essential for generating multi-qubit entanglement, can induce crosstalk errors that significantly degrade single-qubit gate fidelity. In this paper, we present a novel non-perturbative analytical framework for constructing high-fidelity single-qubit gates in the presence of unwanted couplings. By uncovering a geometric structure in SU(2) dynamics, we derive a crosstalk suppression condition: The dynamics must trace a closed loop on the surface of a 2-sphere with net-zero enclosed area, with the pulse waveform corresponding to the geodesic curvature of the loop. This method integrates seamlessly with noise-resilient optimization techniques. Numerical examples demonstrate its efficacy, achieving high-fidelity single-qubit gates in two- and three-qubit systems with strong couplings beyond the perturbative regime while remaining robust to fluctuating noise.</description>

      <title>Performance Stabilization of High-Coherence Superconducting Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting qubits have been used in the most advanced demonstrations of quantum information processing, and they can be manufactured at-scale using proven semiconductor techniques. This makes them one of the leading technologies in the race to demonstrate useful quantum computers. Since their initial demonstration, advances in design, fabrication, and materials have extended the timescales over which fragile quantum information can be stored and manipulated on superconducting qubits. Ubiquitous atomic-scale material defects have been identified as a primary cause of qubit energy-loss and decoherence. Here we study transmon qubits that exhibit energy relaxation times exceeding 2.5 ms. Even at these long timescales, our qubit energy loss is dominated by two level systems (TLS). We observe large variations in these energy-loss times that would make it extremely difficult to accurately evaluate and compare qubit fabrication processes and to perform studies that require precise measurements of energy loss. To address this issue, we present a technique for characterizing qubit quality factor. In this method, we apply a slowly varying electric field to TLS near the qubit to stabilize the measured energy relaxation time, enabling us to replace hundreds of hours of measurements with ones that span several minutes.</description>

      <title>Learning response functions of analog quantum computers: analysis of neutral-atom and superconducting platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analog quantum computation is an attractive paradigm for the simulation of time-dependent quantum systems. Programmable analog quantum computers have been realized in hardware using a variety of physical principles, including neutral-atom and superconducting technologies. The input parameters of the physical Hamiltonians that are used to program the quantum simulator generally differ from the parameters that characterize the output distribution of data produced under a specified quantum dynamics. The relationship between the input and output parameters is known as the response function of the analog device. Here, we introduce a streaming algorithm for learning the response function of analog quantum computers from arbitrary user inputs, thus not requiring special calibration runs. We use the method to learn and compare the response functions of several generations of analog quantum simulators based on superconducting and neutral-atom programmable arrays.</description>

      <title>The topological spectrum of high dimensional quantum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topology has emerged as a fundamental property of many systems, manifesting in cosmology, condensed matter, high-energy physics and waves. Despite the rich textures, the topology has largely been limited to low dimensional systems that can be characterised by a single topological number, e.g., a Chern number in matter or a Skyrme number in waves. Here, using photonic quantum states as an example, we harness the synthetic dimensions of orbital angular momentum (OAM) to discover a rich tapestry of topological maps in high dimensional spaces. Moving beyond spin textured fields, we demonstrate topologies using only one degree of freedom, the OAM of light. By interpreting the density matrix as a non-Abelian Higgs potential, we are able to predict topologies that exist as high dimensional manifolds which remarkably can be deconstructed into a multitude of simpler maps from disks to disks and spheres to spheres, giving rise to the notion of a topological spectrum rather than a topological number. We confirm this experimentally using quantum wave functions with an underlying topology of 48 dimensions and a topological spectrum spanning over 17000 maps, an encoding alphabet with enormous potential. We show that the topological spectrum allows the simultaneous ability to be robust to and probe for perturbation, the latter made possible by observing emergent signatures in the non-topological (trivial) spaces of the spectrum. Our experimental approach benefits from easy implementation, while our theoretical framework is cast in a manner that can be extrapolated to any particle type, dimension and degree of freedom. Our work opens exciting future possibilities for quantum sensing and communication with topology.</description>

      <title>qReduMIS: A Quantum-Informed Reduction Algorithm for the Maximum Independent Set Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and implement a quantum-informed reduction algorithm for the maximum independent set problem that integrates classical kernelization techniques with information extracted from quantum devices. Our larger framework consists of dedicated application, algorithm, and hardware layers, and easily generalizes to the maximum weight independent set problem. In this hybrid quantum-classical framework, which we call qReduMIS, the quantum computer is used as a co-processor to inform classical reduction logic about frozen vertices that are likely (or unlikely) to be in large independent sets, thereby opening up the reduction space after removal of targeted subgraphs. We systematically assess the performance of qReduMIS based on experiments with up to 231 qubits run on Rydberg quantum hardware available through Amazon Braket. Our experiments show that qReduMIS can help address fundamental performance limitations faced by a broad set of (quantum) solvers including Rydberg quantum devices. We outline implementations of qReduMIS with alternative platforms, such as superconducting qubits or trapped ions, and we discuss potential future extensions.</description>

      <title>Standardized test of many-body coherence in gate-based quantum platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum coherence is a crucial resource in achieving quantum advantage over classical information processing, and more generally developing new quantum technologies. While its effects are observable in current quantum platforms, there are no standardized tools for systematically measuring and quantifying multi-qubit coherence across different gate-based quantum hardware. In this work, we propose a method to define a many-body quantum coherence length scale using anyon interference effects in a spin-chain setup, which effectively mirrors the problem of a quantum particle on a ring, with or without flux through it. We propose using the maximum length of the ring for which the presence or absence of flux can be clearly discerned, as a simple measure of the many-body quantum coherence grade (Q-grade) in a given quantum hardware. We demonstrate how this approach can be implemented on gate-based quantum platforms to estimate and compare the quantum coherence of current devices, such as those from Google, IBM, IonQ, IQM, and Quantinuum that we considered here. This work aims to contribute to the creation of a live Web interface where the latest developments and advancements can be demonstrated, and progress in quantum coherence resources tracked over time. Establishing such a standardized quantum test would enable monitoring the growth of quantum coherence in gate-based quantum platforms, in a spirit similar to Moore's law.</description>

      <title>A Modular Quantum Network Architecture for Integrating Network Scheduling with Local Program Execution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an architecture for scheduling network operations enabling the end-to-end generation of entanglement according to user demand. The main challenge solved by this architecture is to allow for the integration of a network schedule with the execution of quantum programs running on processing end nodes in order to realise quantum network applications. A key element of this architecture is the definition of an entanglement packet to meet application requirements on near-term quantum networks where the lifetimes of the qubits stored at the end nodes are limited. Our architecture is fully modular and hardware agnostic, and defines a framework for further research on specific components that can now be developed independently of each other. In order to evaluate our architecture, we realise a proof of concept implementation on a simulated 6-node network in a star topology. We show our architecture facilitates the execution of quantum network applications, and that robust admission control is required to maintain quality of service. Finally, we comment on potential bottlenecks in our architecture and provide suggestions for future improvements.</description>

      <title>Performance Characterization of a Multi-Module Quantum Processor with Static Inter-Chip Couplers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three-dimensional integration technologies such as flip-chip bonding are a key prerequisite to realize large-scale superconducting quantum processors. Modular architectures, in which circuit elements are spread over multiple chips, can further improve scalability and performance by enabling the integration of elements with different substrates or fabrication processes, by increasing the fabrication yield of completed devices, and by physically separating the qubits onto distinct modules to avoid correlated errors mediated by a common substrate. We present a design for a multi-chip module comprising one carrier chip and four qubit modules. Measuring two of the qubits, we analyze the readout performance, finding a mean three-level state-assignment error of $9 \times 10^{-3}$ in 200 ns. We calibrate single-qubit gates and measure a mean simultaneous randomized benchmarking error of $6 \times 10^{-4}$, consistent with the coherence times of the qubits. Using a wiring-efficient static inter-module coupler featuring galvanic inter-chip transitions, we demonstrate a controlled-Z two-qubit gate in 100 ns with an error of $7 \times 10^{-3}$ extracted from interleaved randomized benchmarking. Three-dimensional integration, as presented here, will continue to contribute to improving the performance of gates and readout as well as increasing the qubit count in future superconducting quantum processors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An inhomogeneous continuity equation for the photon four-current operator, $\widehat{J}_{p}$, was derived in [M. Hawton, Phys. Rev. A, 109, 062221 (2024)]. If the electromagnetic potential operator, $\widehat{A}% =\left( \widehat{\phi}/c,\widehat{\mathbf{A}}\right) $, is covariant then $\widehat{J}_{p}$ is covariant and the continuity equation is invariant. Here we start with the standard Lagrangian in a Lorentz invariant gauge and quantize both transverse and longitudinal modes. The scalar potential $\widehat{\phi}=c\widehat{A}_{\Vert}$ is not independently second quantized, so all modes have positive definite norm. The continuity equation is generalized by separating the material source current into a nonabsorbing term describing propagation in a lossless transmission line and localized single photon emission and detection terms that do not require nonlocal separation of transverse and longitudinal modes.</description>

      <title>Virtual purification complements quantum error correction in quantum metrology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A practical realization of quantum metrology, enhancing the sensitivity of parameter estimation beyond the classical limit, is significantly hindered by the effect of noise. To tackle this challenge, quantum error correction (QEC) has been considered, however, indistinguishable noise from the signal and the bias induced by unknown noise prevents it from recovering the enhanced precision in practice. Meanwhile, virtual purification (VP), an error mitigation technique, has been recently shown to mitigate the bias induced by noise in quantum metrology. In this work, we comparatively analyze the performance of QEC and VP in a realistic quantum metrology scenario. We show that while an ideal QEC setup fails to correct indistinguishable noise from the signal and induces bias, VP can mitigate such indistinguishable noise and bias, resulting in more accurate estimations. We then demonstrate that VP with a stabilizer state probe in $5$-qubit GHZ state and $7$-qubit Steane code state can efficiently suppress the bias under local depolarizing noise. Our result highlights that VP along with encoded probe states can effectively suppress the effect of noise in realistic setups, where error distinguishability poses significant challenges.</description>

      <title>Boundary Conditions for the Entanglement Cut in 2D Conformal Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The entanglement spectra for a subsystem in a spin chain fine-tuned to a quantum-critical point contains signatures of the underlying quantum field theory that governs its low-energy properties. For an open chain with given boundary conditions described by a 2D conformal field theory~(CFT), the entanglement spectrum of the left/right half of the system coincides with a boundary CFT spectrum, where one of the boundary conditions arise due to the `entanglement cut'. The latter has been argued to be conformal and has been numerically found to be the `free' boundary condition for Ising, Potts and free boson theories. For these models, the `free' boundary condition for the lattice degree of freedom has a counterpart in the continuum theory. However, this is not true in general. Here, this question is analyzed for the unitary minimal models of 2D CFTs using the density matrix renormalization group technique. The entanglement spectra are computed for blocks of spins in open chains of A-type restricted solid-on-solid models with identical boundary conditions at the ends. The imposed boundary conditions are realized exactly for these lattice models due to their integrable nature. The obtained entanglement spectra are in good agreement with certain boundary CFT spectra. The boundary condition for the entanglement cut is found to be conformal and to coincide with the one with the highest boundary entropy. This identification enables determination of the exponents governing the unusual corrections to the entanglement entropy from the CFT partition functions. These are compared with numerical results.</description>

      <title>Noisy dynamics of Gaussian entanglement: a transient bound entangled phase before separability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discover a new class of Gaussian bound entangled states of four-mode continuous-variable systems. These states appear as a transient phase when certain NPT-entangled Gaussian states are evolved under a noisy environment. A thermal bath comprising of harmonic oscillators is allowed to interact with one or modes of the system and a wide variety of initial Gaussian entangled (NPT as well as PPT) states are studied. The robustness of entanglement is defined as the time duration for which the entanglement of the initial state is preserved under the noisy dynamics. We access the separability by utilizing standard semi-definite programming techniques. While most states lose their entanglement after a certain time across all bi-partitions, an exception is observed for a three-parameter family of states which we call the generalized four-mode squeezed vacuum (gFMSV) states, which transitions to a bound entangled state, and remains so for a finite window of time. This dynamical onset of bound entanglement in continuous-variable systems is the central observation of our work. We carry out the analysis for Haar-random four-mode states (both pure and mixed) to scan the state space for transient bound entangled phase</description>

      <title>Renormalization of Schr\"odinger equation for potentials with inverse-square singularities: Generalized Trigonometric P\"oschl-Teller model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a renormalization procedure necessary for the complete description of the energy spectra of a one-dimensional stationary Schr\"odinger equation with a potential that exhibits inverse-square singularities. We apply and extend the methods introduced in our recent paper on the hyperbolic P\"oschl-Teller potential (with a single singularity) to its trigonometric version. This potential, defined between two singularities, is analyzed across the entire bidimensional coupling space. The fact that the trigonometric P\"oschl-Teller potential is supersymmetric and shape-invariant simplifies the analysis and eliminates the need for self-adjoint extensions in certain coupling regions. However, if at least one coupling is strongly attractive, the renormalization is essential to construct a discrete energy spectrum family of one or two parameters. We also investigate the features of a singular symmetric double well obtained by extending the range of the trigonometric P\"oschl-Teller potential. It has a non-degenerate energy spectrum and eigenstates with well-defined parity.</description>

      <title>The probabilistic combinatorial attacks on atmospheric continuous-variable quantum secret sharing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The combination of quantum secret sharing (QSS) and continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) has demonstrated clear advantages and has undergone significant development in recent years. However, research on the practical security of CV-QSS remains limited, particularly in the context of free-space channels, which exhibit considerable flexibility. In this paper, we study the practical security of free-space CV-QSS, innovatively propose an attack strategy that probabilistically combines two-point distribution attack (TDA) and uniform distribution attack (UDA). We also establish channel parameter models, especially a channel noise model based on local local oscillators (LLO), to further evaluate the key rate. In principle, the analysis can be extended to any number of probabilistic combinations of channel manipulation attacks. The numerical results demonstrate that the probabilistic combination attacks reduce the real key rate of CV-QSS under moderate intensity turbulence, but still enable secure QSS at a distance of 8 km on a scale of hundreds. However, it should be noted that the probabilistic combination attacks will make the deviation between the estimated key rate and the real key rate, i.e., the key rate is overestimated, which may pose a security risk.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Circuit Trainability with Selective Gate Activation Strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid quantum-classical computing relies heavily on Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) to tackle challenges in diverse fields like quantum chemistry and machine learning. However, VQAs face a critical limitation: the balance between circuit trainability and expressibility. Trainability, the ease of optimizing circuit parameters for problem-solving, is often hampered by the Barren Plateau, where gradients vanish and hinder optimization. On the other hand, increasing expressibility, the ability to represent a wide range of quantum states, often necessitates deeper circuits with more parameters, which in turn exacerbates trainability issues. In this work, we investigate selective gate activation strategies as a potential solution to these challenges within the context of Variational Quantum Eigensolvers (VQEs). We evaluate three different approaches: activating gates randomly without considering their type or parameter magnitude, activating gates randomly but limited to a single gate type, and activating gates based on the magnitude of their parameter values. Experiment results reveal that the Magnitude-based strategy surpasses other methods, achieving improved convergence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce matrix quantum phase-space distributions. These extend the idea of a quantum phase-space representation via projections onto a density matrix of global symmetry variables. The method is applied to verification of low-loss Gaussian boson sampling (GBS) quantum computational advantage experiments with up to 10,000 modes, where classically generating photon-number counts is exponentially hard. We demonstrate improvements in sampling error by a factor of 1000 or more compared to unprojected methods, which are infeasible for such cases.</description>

      <title>Harnessing electron motion for global spin qubit control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silicon spin qubits are promising candidates for building scalable quantum computers due to their nanometre scale features. However, delivering microwave control signals locally to each qubit poses a challenge and instead methods that utilise global control fields have been proposed. These require tuning the frequency of selected qubits into resonance with a global field while detuning the rest to avoid frequency crowding. Common frequency tuning methods, such as electric-field-induced Stark shift, are insufficient to cover the frequency variability across large arrays of qubits. Here, we argue that electron motion, and especially the recently demonstrated high-fidelity shuttling, can be leveraged to enhance frequency tunability. Our conclusions are supported by numerical simulations proving its efficiency on concrete architectures such as a 2$\times$N array of qubits and the recently introduced looped pipeline architecture. Specifically, we show that the use of our schemes enables single-qubit fidelity improvements up to a factor of 100 compared to the state-of-the-art. Finally, we show that our scheme can naturally be extended to perform two-qubit gates globally.</description>

      <title>Lower bounding the MaxCut of high girth 3-regular graphs using the QAOA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study MaxCut on 3-regular graphs of minimum girth $g$ for various $g$'s. We obtain new lower bounds on the maximum cut achievable in such graphs by analyzing the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). For $g \geq 16$, at depth $p \geq 7$, the QAOA improves on previously known lower bounds. Our bounds are established through classical numerical analysis of the QAOA's expected performance. This analysis does not produce the actual cuts but establishes their existence. When implemented on a quantum computer, the QAOA provides an efficient algorithm for finding such cuts, using a constant-depth quantum circuit. To our knowledge, this gives an exponential speedup over the best known classical algorithm guaranteed to achieve cuts of this size on graphs of this girth. We also apply the QAOA to the Maximum Independent Set problem on the same class of graphs.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Enhanced LLM Efficient Fine Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) enables efficient fine-tuning of pre-trained language models via low-rank matrix approximation, which is effective in many scenarios. However, its low-rank representation capacity is constrained in complex tasks or high-rank dependency settings, potentially limiting model adaptability. Addressing the expressive bottleneck of classical low-rank approximation in fine-tuning large language models, this paper proposes a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method based on a Quantum Weighted Tensor Hybrid Network (QWTHN), which leverages Quantum Neural Network (QNN). The study investigates quantum-classical hybrid parameter-efficient fine-tuning in low-rank spaces. QWTHN decomposes pre-trained weights into quantum neural network and tensor network representations, utilizing quantum state superposition and other methods to break through classical rank limitations. Experiments show that the proposed quantum fine-tuning technique for large models approaches or even surpasses the parameter efficiency of LoRA. On the CPsyCounD and R1-Distill-SFT datasets, QWTHN, compared to classical LoRA, reduces training loss by up to 15% while using 76% fewer parameters, and achieves an 8.4% performance improvement on the CPsyCounD test set. This research not only realizes lightweight and efficient adaptation of quantum resources to billion-parameter models but also validates the practical path of quantum hardware driven by large model tasks, laying the first engineering-ready technical foundation for future quantum-enhanced AGI systems.</description>

      <title>Higher-form anomaly and long-range entanglement of mixed states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In open quantum systems, we directly relate anomalies of higher-form symmetries to the long-range entanglement of any mixed state with such symmetries. First, we define equivalence classes of long-range entanglement in mixed states via stochastic local channels (SLCs), which effectively ``mod out'' any classical correlations and thus distinguish phases by differences in long-range quantum correlations only. It is then shown that strong symmetries of a mixed state and their anomalies (non-trivial braiding and self-statistics) are intrinsic features of the entire phase of matter. For that, a general procedure of symmetry pullback for strong symmetries is introduced, whereby symmetries of the output state of an SLC are dressed into symmetries of the input state, with their anomaly relation preserved. This allows us to prove that states in (2+1)-D with anomalous strong 1-form symmetries exhibit long-range bipartite entanglement, and to establish a lower bound for their topological entanglement of formation, a mixed-state generalization of topological entanglement entropy. For concreteness, we apply this formalism to the toric code under Pauli-X and Z dephasing noise, as well as under ZX decoherence, which gives rise to the recently discovered intrinsically mixed-state topological order. Finally, we conjecture a connection between higher-form anomalies and long-range multipartite entanglement for mixed states in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Scalable Robust Quantum Control for Semiconductor Spin Qubits with Always-on Couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a robust quantum control framework that enables high-fidelity gate operations in semiconductor spin qubit systems with always-on couplings. Always-on interactions between qubits pose a fundamental challenge for quantum processors by inducing correlated errors that can trigger chaotic dynamics. Our approach suppresses both static coupling noise and time-dependent crosstalk without requiring high on/off ratio tunable couplers. Significantly, these pulses also prevent the emergence of chaotic entanglement growth in deep quantum circuits, preserving coherence in large multi-qubit systems. By relaxing hardware constraints on coupling control, our method provides a practical path toward scaling semiconductor quantum processors within existing fabrication capabilities, with particular relevance for silicon spin qubit architectures where high-contrast coupling modulation remains challenging.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated precision measurements in a two-level system coupled to a single-photon-added coherent state (SPACS) under postselection measurement. We analyzed strategies for improving measurement precision, including parameter estimation and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in postselected weak measurements using the photon statistics of SPACS as the meter. Our results demonstrate that SPACS-based postselected weak measurements can outperform conventional measurement schemes in terms of precision. Additionally, we explicitly introduced an alternative weak measurement method commonly applied in dispersive light-atom interactions. Our work offers a new way for addressing fundamental issues in quantum precision measurement based on photon statistics, and it provides a method for extracting the phase and phase shifts of radiation fields through the weak values of system observables.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving industrial quantum advantage is unlikely without the use of quantum error correction (QEC). Other QEC codes beyond surface code are being experimentally studied, such as color codes and quantum Low-Density Parity Check (qLDPC) codes, that could benefit from new quantum processing unit (QPU) architectures. Star-topology offers effective all-to-all connectivity in comparison to the square-grid topology and thus enables more hardware efficient implementation of some QEC codes. We encode two logical qubits in a star-topology superconducting QPU using the [[4,2,2]] code and characterize the logical states with the classical shadow framework. Logical life-time and logical error rate are measured over repeated quantum error detection cycles for various logical states including a logical Bell state. We measure logical state fidelities above 96 % for every cardinal logical state, find logical life-times above the best physical element, and logical error-per-cycle values ranging from from 0.25(2) % to 0.91(3) %. The presented QPU configuration can be used to enable qubit-count efficient QEC codes via the high connectivity in future devices.</description>

      <title>Efficient noise tailoring and detection of hypergraph states using Clifford circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hypergraph states are important magic resources for realizing universal quantum computation and diverse non-local physical phenomena. However, noise detection for such states is challenging due to their large dimension and entanglement. This work proposes an efficient Clifford circuit-based scheme for tailoring and detecting noise in third-ordered hypergraph states generated by CCZ, CZ, and Z gates. The core part of our scheme is converting the noisy input state into a diagonal form and obtaining the convolution equation of noise rate via Clifford circuits. The depth of the Clifford circuit can be reduced to a constant, depending on the structure of the hypergraph state. After that, we decode it using the fast Hadamard-Walsh transform or some approximation method. The approximation with respect to the $l_2$-norm can be done efficiently by the number of qubits while keeping sufficient precision. Furthermore, the sparse noise assumption, which frequently holds in current experimental setups, enables $ l_1$ approximation. Compared with state verification methods, our method allows us to attain richer information on noise rates and apply various noise-adapted error correction and mitigation methods. Moreover, it bridges the connection between the convolution equation's nonlinearity and the Clifford hierarchy of the hypergraph state inputs. Our results provide a deeper understanding of the nature of highly entangled systems and drive the interests of the research venues concerning magic state implementation.</description>

      <title>Reversing Hydrogen-Related Loss in $\alpha$-Ta Thin Films for Quantum Device Fabrication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $\alpha$-Tantalum ($\alpha$-Ta) is an emerging material for superconducting qubit fabrication due to the low microwave loss of its stable native oxide. However, hydrogen absorption during fabrication, particularly when removing the native oxide, can degrade performance by increasing microwave loss. In this work, we demonstrate that hydrogen can enter $\alpha$-Ta thin films when exposed to 10 vol% hydrofluoric acid for 3 minutes or longer, leading to an increase in power-independent ohmic loss in high-Q resonators at millikelvin temperatures. Reduced resonator performance is likely caused by the formation of non-superconducting tantalum hydride (TaH$_x$) precipitates. We further show that annealing at 500{\deg}C in ultra-high vacuum (10$^{-8}$ Torr) for one hour fully removes hydrogen and restores the resonators' intrinsic quality factors to ~4 million at the single-photon level. These findings identify a previously unreported loss mechanism in $\alpha$-Ta and offer a pathway to reverse hydrogen-induced degradation in quantum devices based on Ta and, by extension also Nb, enabling more robust fabrication processes for superconducting qubits.</description>

      <title>Efficient Detection of Statistical RF Fields at High Magnetic Field with a Quantum Sensor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is widely used in fields ranging from chemistry, material science to neuroscience. Nanoscale NMR spectroscopy using Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond has emerged as a promising platform due to an unprecedented sensitivity down to the single spin level. At the nanoscale, high nuclear spin polarization through spin fluctuations (statistical polarization) far outweighs thermal polarization. However, until now efficient NMR detection using coherent averaging techniques could not be applied to the detection of statistical polarization, leading to long measurement times. Here we present two protocols to enable coherent averaging of statistical oscillating signals through rectification. We demonstrate these protocols on an artificial radiofrequency signal detected with a single NV center at 2.7 T. Through this, the signal-to-noise scaling with number of measurements $N$ is improved from $N^{0.5}$ to $N^1$, improving the measurement time significantly. The relevance of rectification for the detection of statistical polarization using NV ensembles is outlined, paving the way for efficient nanoscale NMR spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>What makes you an observer?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Both empirical and theoretical objective science can only access relations, revealing nothing about the intrinsic nature of the entities "in relation". We typically refer to these entities as "matter", assuming their nature is irrelevant and that relational structures alone explain all phenomena, including consciousness. This would imply that consciousness arises not from matter itself but solely from its structural configurations. Consequently, if two worlds possess isomorphic structures and obey identical dynamical laws, isomorphic systems within these worlds should be equally sentient or insentient.
  I demonstrate that if this premise held true, the memories within an observer's brain would bear no correlation to the external world. Yet since we do acquire knowledge of the external world, structure alone must be insufficient: there exists something beyond relations, the intrinsic essence of the "stuff in relation". This essence imbues the observer's structure with sentience, metaphorically "breathing fire" into it. In turn, the observer confers physical meaning upon the world's structures.
  Remarkably, this conclusion emerges directly from physics and mathematics. Without acknowledging this intrinsic element, we would be incapable not only of subjective experience but also of acquiring any objective knowledge about the physical world.</description>

      <title>Locality and probability in relativistic quantum theories and hidden variables quantum theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define criteria for a hidden variables theory to be Lorentz invariant and prove that it implies no signaling. As a result, we show that a Lorentz invariant and contextual theory (e.g., quantum field theory) must be genuinely stochastic, i.e., it cannot have a deterministic (strong or weak) hidden variables model. This proof is an improved version of a theorem we proved previously, and it has a wider scope. Finally, we show that Bell's definition of locality is equivalent to non contextuality (or strong determinism). We propose an alternative definition of locality for contextual and relativistic theories according to which quantum field theory is local.</description>

      <title>Atom-Field-Medium Interactions II: Covariance Matrix Dynamics for $N$ Harmonic Atoms in a Dielectric-Altered Quantum Field and Effects of Dielectric on Atom-Field Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We continue our investigation of multi-partite open quantum systems comprising layers of structure using the atom-field-medium interactions as a familiarly important example. Same as in Paper I~\cite{HH24} we consider a system of $N$ harmonic oscillators, modeling the internal degrees of freedom (idf) of $N$ neutral atoms interacting with a scalar quantum field altered by the presence of a dielectric medium. Different from Paper I, which uses the graded influence action formalism, here, taking advantage of the Gaussian nature of our extended system's interactions, we use the quantum Langevin equation method to calculate the time evolution of the covariance matrix elements of the quantum correlation functions of the idfs of the $N$ system-atoms in a dielectric-altered quantum field. The covariance matrix is particularly useful for extracting quantum informational properties of a Gaussian system related to quantum correlations, such as quantum entanglement. As an illustration of the method we calculate the entanglement between one system atom and the ambient quantum field outside the dielectric half-space, measured by the purity function and the von Neumann entropy. We highlight one somewhat peculiar feature in our results and one important technical issue: The special feature refers to the non-monotonic behavior of the purity function when the atom is positioned very close to the dielectric surface. By deriving the Robertson-Schr\"odinger function and displaying a similar qualitative behavior under these conditions we attribute this novelty to a manifestation of the uncertainty relation. The technical issue refers to the order-reduction scheme to remove the third time derivative term in the Langevin equation for the idfs of the atom. We point out the inconsistencies in the traditional treatments and propose a new consistent scheme of order reduction for Gaussian open systems.</description>

      <title>Symmetric channel verification for purifying noisy quantum channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetry inherent in quantum states has been widely used to reduce the effect of noise in quantum error correction and a quantum error mitigation technique known as symmetry verification. However, these symmetry-based techniques exploit symmetry in quantum states rather than quantum channels, limiting their application to cases where the entire circuit shares the same symmetry. In this work, we propose symmetric channel verification (SCV), a channel purification protocol that leverages the symmetry inherent in quantum channels. By introducing different phases to each symmetric subspace and employing a quantum phase estimation-like circuit, SCV can detect and correct symmetry-breaking noise in quantum channels. We further propose a hardware-efficient implementation of SCV at the virtual level, which requires only a single-qubit ancilla and is robust against the noise in the ancilla qubit. Our protocol is applied to various Hamiltonian simulation circuits and phase estimation circuits, resulting in a significant reduction of errors. Furthermore, in setups where only Clifford unitaries can be used for noise purification, which is relevant in the early fault-tolerant regime, we show that SCV under Pauli symmetry represents the optimal purification method.</description>

      <title>Accelerating large-scale linear algebra using variational quantum imaginary time evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph partitioning techniques enhance the efficiency of solving large-scale linear systems in the context of Finite Element Analysis (FEA). Even for systems of linear equations that are highly sparse, their direct solution via factorization methods, such as LU or Cholesky decomposition, is computationally expensive due to the introduction of non-zero elements, or ``fill-in.'' We introduce a quantum approach to the graph partitioning problem based on the variational quantum imaginary time evolution algorithm (VarQITE), allowing to solve the combinatorial optimization problem of reordering of sparse matrices to minimize the fill-in. We develop a hybrid quantum/classical pipeline to accelerate Finite Element solvers by integrating the VarQITE algorithm into the production workflow of Ansys' industrial software LS-DYNA. This allows to study multiple different types of FEA problems, ranging from mechanical engineering to computational fluid dynamics.
  We prove out that VarQITE positively impacts LS-DYNA workflows by measuring the wall-clock time to solution of FEA problems when compared against the classical heuristic graph partitioning solver in LS-DYNA. The selected instances cover a range of FEA problems, including simulation of blood pumps, roof crushing of cars, and vibration analysis of cars. We report performance results for our hybrid quantum-accelerated workflow on FEA meshes of up to 5.9M vertices and 55 million edges. We find that the wall clock time of the heuristics solutions used in the industry-grade solver is improved by up to 12\%. We also execute the VarQITE algorithm on quantum hardware (IonQ Aria and IonQ Forte) and find that the results are comparable to noiseless and noisy simulations. Finally, we introduce a hybrid technique for post-processing the found solutions with classical refinement heuristics such as Fiduccia-Mattheyses.</description>

      <title>Photon information efficiency limits in deep-space optical communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep-space optical communication links operate under severely limited signal power, approaching the photon-starved regime which requires a receiver capable of measuring individual incoming photons. This makes the photon information efficiency (PIE), i.e. the number of bits that can be retrieved from a single received photon, a relevant figure of merit to characterize data rates achievable in deep-space scenarios. Here we review theoretical PIE limits assuming a scalable modulation format, such as pulse position modulation (PPM), combined with a photon counting direct detection receiver. For unrestricted signal bandwidth, the attainable PIE is effectively limited by the background noise acquired by the propagating optical signal. The actual PIE limit depends on the effectiveness of the noise rejection mechanism implemented at the receiver, which can be improved by the nonlinear optical technique of quantum pulse gating. Further enhancement is possible by resorting to photon number resolved detection, which improves discrimination of PPM pulses against weak background noise. The results are compared with the ultimate quantum mechanical PIE limit implied by the Gordon-Holevo capacity bound, which takes into account general modulation formats as well as any physically permitted measurement techniques.</description>

      <title>Cycle-Aware ZZ Crosstalk Mitigation on Quantum Hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ZZ crosstalk and decoherence hinder superconducting quantum computing. To enhance parallelism in mitigating ZZ crosstalk, we formulate the problem by integrating quantum cycles and two forms of qubit interference. We then propose CAZZO, a Cycle-Aware ZZ crosstalk Optimization algorithm, which uses a timing-based greedy strategy to schedule gates through cycles within quantum circuits. A novel data structure called Time and Distance Dependency Graph is designed to model gate data dependencies and physical distances from quantum topologies for precise scheduling. Additionally, dynamically punching barriers reduces idle time in quantum circuits, further enhancing parallelism. Simulations show a reduction of up to 37.44% in quantum program cycle (14.19% on average) on various NISQ devices with 53 to 127 qubits. Real-device experiments on IBMQ-Brisbane demonstrate significant acceleration in quantum computing while maintaining fidelity.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Quantum Signal Control and Sensing Under Multicolored Noise via Generalized Filter Function Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a generalized filter-function framework that treats noise coupling strength as a tunable control parameter, enabling target noise suppression across user-defined frequency bands. By optimizing this generalized filter function, we design band-selective control pulses that achieve $0.9999$ fidelity of single- and two-qubit gates under strong noise with diverse spectral profiles. We further extend the method to selectively enhance the signal-to-noise ratio for quantum sensing of AC signals with an enhanced precision of up to $10$ dB. The resulting control pulses are experimentally feasible, offering a practical pathway toward robust quantum operations and high-precision signal processing under spectrally complex noises.</description>

      <title>Non-asymptotic quantum communication on lossy transmission lines with memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-asymptotic quantum Shannon theory analyses how to transmit quantum information across a quantum channel as efficiently as possible within a specified error tolerance, given access to a finite, fixed, number of channel uses. In a recent work, we derived computable lower bounds on the non-asymptotic capacities of memoryless bosonic Gaussian channels. In this work, we extend these results to the non-Markovian bosonic Gaussian channel introduced in F. A. Mele, G. D. Palma, M. Fanizza, V. Giovannetti, and L. Lami IEEE Transactions on Information Theory 70(12), 8844-8869 (2024), which describes non-Markovian effects in optical fibres and is a non-Markovian generalisation of the pure loss channel. This allows us to determine how many uses of a non-Markovian optical fibre are sufficient in order to transmit $k$ qubits, distil $k$ ebits, or generate $k$ secret-key bits up to a given error tolerance $\varepsilon$. To perform our analysis, we prove novel properties of singular values of Toeplitz matrices, providing an error bound on the convergence rate of the celebrated Avram-Parter's theorem, which we regard as a new tool of independent interest for the field of quantum information theory and matrix analysis.</description>

      <title>Optimizing the frequency positioning of tunable couplers in a circuit QED processor to mitigate spectator effects on quantum operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally optimize the frequency of flux-tunable couplers in a superconducting quantum processor to minimize the impact of spectator transmons during quantum operations (single-qubit gates, two-qubit gates and readout) on other transmons. We adapt a popular transmon-like tunable-coupling element, achieving high-fidelity, low-leakage controlled-$Z$ gates with unipolar, fast-adiabatic pulsing only on the coupler. We demonstrate the ability of the tunable coupler to null residual $ZZ$ coupling as well as exchange couplings in the one- and two-excitation manifolds. However, the nulling of these coherent interactions is not simultaneous, prompting the exploration of tradeoffs. We present experiments pinpointing spectator effects on specific quantum operations. We also study the combined effect on the three types of operations using repeated quantum parity measurements.</description>

      <title>Quantum bounds and device-independent security with rank-one qubit measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Device-independent (DI) quantum protocols exploit Bell inequality violations to ensure security or certify quantum properties without making assumptions about the internal workings of the devices. In this work, we study the role of rank-one qubit positive operator-valued measures (POVMs) in DI scenarios. This class includes all qubit extremal POVMs, i.e., those measurements that cannot be realized by randomly choosing among others, as well as part of non-extremal POVMs, which have recently been shown to be useful for security applications in sequential quantum protocols. We demonstrate that any rank-one POVM can generate correlations in bipartite scenarios that saturate a Tsirelson inequality, i.e., a quantum bound on linear combinations of outcome statistics, when the two parties share an arbitrary entangled two-qubit state and some other self-tested measurements are performed. For extremal POVMs, such saturation allows for an explicit calculation of the guessing probability and the worst-case conditional von Neumann entropy. From the Tsirelson inequality, we establish a randomness certification method that facilitates numerical simulations and noise analysis. To test its feasibility, we performed a proof-of-concept experiment employing a three-outcome POVM on tilted entangled states under experimental non-idealities. We further explore the case of non-extremal POVMs, providing insights into their role in DI protocols.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic impurities are known to degrade superconductivity. For this reason, physical vapor deposition chambers that have previously been used for magnetic materials have generally been avoided for making high-quality superconducting resonator devices. In this article, we show by example that such chambers can be used: with Nb films sputtered in a chamber that continues to be used for magnetic materials, we demonstrate compact (3 {\mu}m gap) coplanar waveguide resonators with low-power internal quality factors near one million. We achieve this using a resist strip bath with no post-fabrication acid treatment, which results in performance comparable to previous strip baths with acid treatments. We also find evidence that this improved resist strip bath provides a better surface chemical template for post-fabrication hydrogen fluoride processing. These results are consistent across three Si substrate preparation methods, including a \SI{700}{\celsius} anneal.</description>

      <title>Realization of fermionic Laughlin state on a quantum processor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strongly correlated topological phases of matter are central to modern condensed matter physics and quantum information technology but often challenging to probe and control in material systems. The experimental difficulty of accessing these phases has motivated the use of engineered quantum platforms for simulation and manipulation of exotic topological states. Among these, the Laughlin state stands as a cornerstone for topological matter, embodying fractionalization, anyonic excitations, and incompressibility. Although its bosonic analogs have been realized on programmable quantum simulators, a genuine fermionic Laughlin state has yet to be demonstrated on a quantum processor. Here, we realize the {\nu} = 1/3 fermionic Laughlin state on IonQ's Aria-1 trapped-ion quantum computer using an efficient and scalable Hamiltonian variational ansatz with 369 two-qubit gates on a 16-qubit circuit. Employing symmetry-verification error mitigation, we extract key observables that characterize the Laughlin state, including correlation hole and chiral edge modes, with strong agreement to exact diagonalization benchmarks. This work establishes a scalable quantum framework to simulate material-intrinsic topological orders and provides a starting point to explore its dynamics and excitations on digital quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Study of Magnetic Field Resilient High Impedance High-Kinetic Inductance Superconducting Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting resonators with high-kinetic inductance play a central role in hybrid quantum circuits, enabling strong coupling with quantum systems with small electric dipole moment and improved parametric amplification. However, optimizing these resonators simultaneously for high internal quality factors ($Q_i$) and resilience to strong magnetic fields remains challenging. In this study, we systematically compare superconducting resonators fabricated from niobium nitride (NbN) and granular aluminum (grAl) thin films, each having similar kinetic inductance values ($L_k \sim 100$ pH/sq). At zero magnetic field, resonators made from grAl exhibit higher $Q_i$ compared to their NbN counterparts. However, under applied magnetic fields, NbN resonators demonstrate significantly better resilience. Moreover, NbN resonators exhibit an unexpected increase in $Q_i$ at intermediate in-plane magnetic fields ($B_{\parallel} \sim 1$ T), which we attribute to an enhanced frequency detuning that reduce coupling to two-level system defects. In contrast, grAl resonators show a distinct critical field above which $Q_i$ rapidly decreases, strongly depending on resonator cross-section respect to the applied field direction. Characterization of the nonlinear properties at zero magnetic field reveals that the self-Kerr coefficient in grAl resonators is more than an order of magnitude higher than in NbN resonators, making grAl particularly attractive for applications requiring pronounced nonlinear interactions. Our findings illustrate a clear trade-off between the two materials: NbN offers superior magnetic-field resilience beneficial for hybrid circuit quantum electrodynamics applications, while grAl is more advantageous in low-field regimes demanding high impedance and strong nonlinearity.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of a Tunable Non-Hermitian Nonlinear Microwave Dimer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving and controlling non-reciprocity in engineered photonic structures is of fundamental interest in science and engineering. Here, we introduce a tunable, non-Hermitian, nonlinear microwave dimer designed to precisely implement phase-non-reciprocal hopping dynamics between two spatially separated cavities at room temperature. Our system incorporates simple components such as three-dimensional microwave cavities, unidirectional amplifiers, digital attenuators, and a digital phase shifter. By dividing the energy transfer into forward and backward paths, our platform enables precise control over the amplitude and phase of the propagating signals in each direction. Through a combination of theoretical and numerical analysis, we model the dynamics of the system under different operating conditions, including a parameter regime where the gain not only compensates for but significantly exceeds the inherent loss. Our model quantitatively reproduces the observed weak-drive transmission spectra, the amplitude and frequency of self-sustained limit cycles, and the synchronization effect between the limit cycle and an external microwave tone. Our results may have implications in areas ranging from sensing and synthetic photonic materials to neuromorphic computing and quantum networks, while providing new insight into the interplay between non-Hermitian and nonlinear dynamics.</description>

      <title>Exploring new variational quantum circuit ansatzes for solving $SU(2)$ matrix models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we explored and experimented with new forms of parameterized quantum circuits to be used as variational ansatzes for solving the bosonic and supersymmetric $SU(2)$ matrix models at different couplings using the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm. Working with IBM Qiskit quantum computing platform, we show that two types of quantum circuits named \texttt{TwoLocal} and \texttt{EvolvedOperatorAnsatz} can outperform the popular \texttt{EfficientSU2} circuits which have been routinely used in the recent quantum physics literature to run VQE. With their more customizable constructions that allow for more flexibility beyond choosing the types of parameterized rotation gates, both types of new circuit ansatzes used in this work have led to performances that are either better than or at least comparable to \texttt{EfficientSU2} in the setting of $SU(2)$ matrix models. In particular, in the strong coupling regimes of the bosonic model, both \texttt{TwoLocal} and \texttt{EvolvedOperatorAnsatz} circuits provided a better approximation to the exact ground states, while in the supersymmetric model, shallow \texttt{EvolvedOperatorAnsatz} circuits with small a number of parameters, attained a comparable albeit not as good performance as the much deeper \texttt{EfficientSU2} circuits with around 8 to 9 times more parameters. The results of this work demonstrate conclusively the potential of \texttt{TwoLocal} and \texttt{EvolvedOperatorAnsatz} quantum circuits as efficient new types of variational ansatzes that should be considered more frequently in future VQE studies of quantum physics systems.</description>

      <title>Revival and instabilities of entanglement in monitoring maps with indefinite causal order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this proceeding, we revisit the discussion presented in Ref. [Commun Phys 7, 373 (2024)], which examines the behavior of a quantum switch involving two arbitrary quantum operations when the control is exposed to environmental effects. Our study extends this analysis by focusing on the evolution of entanglement in the target system within the quantum switch framework, taking into account the influence of environmental conditions and control post-selection. We find that entanglement evolution is highly sensitive to these factors. While entanglement sudden death occurs under definite causal order, indefinite causal order can reverse this loss. We observe entanglement revival in high-temperature regimes and a sudden reappearance of entanglement under weak monitoring conditions at low temperatures. These findings provide insights into the resilience of the quantum switch in the presence of environmental disturbances and highlight its potential for applications where preserving entanglement is essential.</description>

      <title>Error bounds for composite quantum hypothesis testing and a new characterization of the weighted Kubo-Ando geometric means</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optimal error exponents of binary composite i.i.d. state discrimination are trivially bounded by the worst-case pairwise exponents of discriminating individual elements of the sets representing the two hypotheses, and in the finite-dimensional classical case, these bounds in fact give exact single-copy expressions for the error exponents. In contrast, in the non-commutative case, the optimal exponents are only known to be expressible in terms of regularized divergences, resulting in formulas that, while conceptually relevant, practically not very useful. In this paper, we develop further an approach initiated in [Mosonyi, Szil\'agyi, Weiner, IEEE Trans. Inf. Th. 68(2):1032--1067, 2022] to give improved single-copy bounds on the error exponents by comparing not only individual states from the two hypotheses, but also various unnormalized positive semi-definite operators associated to them. Here, we show a number of equivalent characterizations of such operators giving valid bounds, and show that in the commutative case, considering weighted geometric means of the states, and in the case of two states per hypothesis, considering weighted Kubo-Ando geometric means, are optimal for this approach. As a result, we give a new characterization of the weighted Kubo-Ando geometric means as the only $2$-variable operator geometric means that are block additive, tensor multiplicative, and satisfy the arithmetic-geometric mean inequality. We also extend our results to composite quantum channel discrimination, and show an analogous optimality property of the weighted Kubo-Ando geometric means of two quantum channels, a notion that seems to be new. We extend this concept to defining the notion of superoperator perspective function and establish some of its basic properties, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>A mathematical model for a universal digital quantum computer with an application to the Grover-Rudolph algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a novel mathematical framework for universal digital quantum computation using algebraic probability theory. We rigorously define quantum circuits as finite sequences of elementary quantum gates and establish their role in implementing unitary transformations. A key result demonstrates that every unitary matrix in \(\mathrm{U}(N)\) can be expressed as a product of elementary quantum gates, leading to the concept of a universal dictionary for quantum computation. We apply this framework to the construction of quantum circuits that encode probability distributions, focusing on the Grover-Rudolph algorithm. By leveraging controlled quantum gates and rotation matrices, we design a quantum circuit that approximates a given probability density function. Numerical simulations, conducted using Qiskit, confirm the theoretical predictions and validate the effectiveness of our approach. These results provide a rigorous foundation for quantum circuit synthesis within an algebraic probability framework and offer new insights into the encoding of probability distributions in quantum algorithms. Potential applications include quantum machine learning, circuit optimization, and experimental implementations on real quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Realizing a Symmetry Protected Topological Phase in a Superconducting Circuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a superconducting quantum circuit whose low-energy degrees of freedom are described by the sine-Gordon (SG) quantum field theory. For suitably chosen parameters,
  the circuit hosts a symmetry protected topological (SPT) phase protected by a discrete $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. The ground state of the system is twofold degenerate and exhibits local spontaneous symmetry breaking of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry close to the edges of the circuit, leading to spontaneous localized edge supercurrents. The ground states host Majorana zero modes (MZM) at the edges of the circuit. On top of each of the two ground states, the system exhibits localized bound states at both edges, which are topologically protected against small disorder in the bulk. The spectrum of these boundary excitations should be observable in a circuit-QED experiment with feasible parameter choices.</description>

      <title>Mixed spin-boson coupling for qubit readout with suppressed residual shot-noise dephasing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct dipole coupling between a two-level system and a bosonic mode describes the interactions present in a wide range of physical platforms. In this work, we study a coupling that is mixed between two pairs of quadratures of a bosonic mode and a spin. In this setting, we can suppress the dispersive shift while retaining a nonzero Kerr shift, which remarkably results in a cubic relationship between shot noise dephasing and thermal photons in the oscillator. We demonstrate this configuration with a simple toy model, quantify the expected improvements to photon shot-noise dephasing of the spin, and describe an approach to fast qubit readout via the Kerr shift. Further, we show how such a regime is achievable in superconducting circuits because magnetic and electric couplings can be of comparable strength, using two examples: the Cooper pair transistor and the fluxonium molecule.</description>

      <title>Efficient Truncations of SU($N_c$) Lattice Gauge Theory for Quantum Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulations of lattice gauge theories offer the potential to directly study the non-perturbative dynamics of quantum chromodynamics, but naive analyses suggest that they require large computational resources. Large $N_c$ expansions are performed to order 1/$N_c$ to simplify the Hamiltonian of pure SU($N_c$) lattice gauge theories. A reformulation of the electric basis is introduced with a truncation strategy based on the construction of local Krylov subspaces with plaquette operators. Numerical simulations show that these truncated Hamiltonians are consistent with traditional lattice calculations at relatively small couplings. It is shown that the computational resources required for quantum simulation of time evolution generated by these Hamiltonians is 17-19 orders of magnitude smaller than previous approaches.</description>

      <title>Implementation of classical client universal blind quantum computation with 8-state RSP in current architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The future of quantum computing architecture is most likely the one in which a large number of clients are either fully classical or have a very limited quantum capability while a very small number of servers having the capability to perform quantum computations and most quantum computational tasks are delegated to these quantum servers. In this architecture, it becomes very crucial that a classical/semi-classical client is able to keep the delegated data/ computation secure against eavesdroppers as well as the server itself, known as the blindness feature. In 2009, A. Broadbent et. al proposed a universal blind quantum computation (UBQC) protocol based on measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC) that enables a semi-classical client to delegate universal quantum computation to a quantum server, interactively and fetch the results while the computation itself remains blind to the server. In this work, we propose an implementation (with examples) of UBQC in the current quantum computing architecture, a fully classical client, a quantum server (IBM Quantum) and the computation does not proceed interactively (projective measurement basis is not decided by previous measurement outcome). We combined UBQC with the 8-state remote state preparation (RSP) protocol, to blindly prepare the initial cluster state, which is an initial resource state in UBQC protocol, to allow a completely classical client to perform delegated blind quantum computation. Such an implementation has already been shown to be secure in a game-based security setting, which is the weakest security model.</description>

      <title>Exchange-Coupled Spins for Robust High-Temperature Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that Heisenberg exchange interactions between the neighboring spins comprising an ensemble spin qubit (E-qubit) can act as an intrinsic error mitigator, increasing gate fidelity even at high temperatures. As an example, the fidelity of a {\pi} gate applied to E-qubits above 1 K was studied by tuning the ferromagnetic exchange strength to show an exchange coupled E-qubit exhibits higher fidelity than a single-spin based qubit. We also investigate the coherence properties of E-qubits and find that the coherence time of an E-qubit extends linearly with the number of spins in the ensemble. This suggests that exchange interactions effectively suppress decoherence induced by thermal noise, achieving a coherence time greater than 1 ms at 1 K with an ensemble of only seven spins. Additionally, the ferromagnetic isotropic exchange prevents fidelity loss induced by spatial field gradients/inhomogeneity in Zeeman and/or control fields. Therefore, exchange-coupled spin qubits could enable fault-tolerant quantum operations and long-coherence times at elevated temperatures (&gt;1 K).</description>

      <title>Quantum Simulations of Chemical Reactions: Achieving Accuracy with NISQ Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing is viewed as a promising technology because of its potential for polynomial growth in complexity, in contrast to the exponential growth observed in its classical counterparts. In the current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), a hybrid variational algorithm, is utilized to simulate molecules using qubits and calculate molecular properties. However, simulating a chemical reaction to compute the reaction energy using VQE algorithm has not yet reached chemical accuracy relative to the benchmark computational chemistry methods due to limitations such as the number of qubits, circuit depth, and noise introduced within the model. To address this issue, we propose the definition of different active spaces for studying chemical reactions, incorporating irreducible representations of both the ground and excited states of the molecules. Our results demonstrate that this approach achieves chemical accuracy in predicting the reaction energy for various reactions. For all reactions studied, the difference in reaction energies between conventional computational chemistry methods and the quantum-classical hybrid VQE algorithm is less than 1 kcal/mol. Furthermore, our analysis simplifies the process of selecting active spaces and electrons for each reaction, reducing it to a single optimal combination that ensures the chemical accuracy for each reaction.</description>

      <title>Anomalous current-electric field characteristics in transport through a nanoelectromechanical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A deep understanding of the correlation between electronic and mechanical degrees of freedom is crucial to the development of quantum devices in a nanoelectromechanical system (NEMS). In this work, we first establish a fully quantum mechanical approach for transport through a NEMS device, which is valid for arbitrary bias voltages, temperatures, and electro-mechanical couplings. We find an anomalous current-electric field characteristics at a low bias, where the current decreases with a rising electric field, associated with the backward tunneling of electrons for a weak mechanical damping. We reveal that this intriguing behavior arises from a combined effect of mechanical motion and Coulomb blockade, where the rapid increase of backward tunneling events at a large oscillation amplitude suppresses the forward current due to prohibition of double occupation. In the opposite limit of strong damping, the oscillator dissipates its energy to the environment and relaxes to the ground state rapidly. Electrons then transport via the lowest vibrational state such that the net current and its corresponding noise have a vanishing dependence on the electric field.</description>

      <title>Single-step high-fidelity three-qubit gates by anisotropic chiral interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Direct multi-qubit gates are becoming critical to facilitate quantum computations in near-term devices by reducing the gate counts and circuit depth. Here, we demonstrate that fast and high fidelity three-qubit gates can be realized in a single step by leveraging small anisotropic and chiral three-qubit interactions. These ingredients naturally arise in state-of-the-art spin-based quantum hardware through a combination of spin-orbit interactions and orbital magnetic fields. These interactions resolve the key synchronization issues inherent in protocols relying solely on two-qubit couplings, which significantly limit gate fidelity. We confirm with numerical simulations that our single-step three-qubit gate can outperform existing protocols, potentially achieving infidelity $\leq 10^{-4}$ in 80-100 ns under current experimental conditions. To further benchmark its performance, we also propose an alternative composite three-qubit gate sequence based on anisotropic two-qubit interactions with built-in echo sequence and show that the single-step protocol can outperform it, making it highly suitable for near-term quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Spin orientation by electric current in altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is shown that the flow of electric current in an altermagnet results in the formation of a homogeneous electron spin orientation in the sample. The spin of the conduction electrons generated in altermagnets with $d$-wave spin-momentum couplings, is quadratic in the current magnitude, varies as the second angular harmonic under variation of the current direction and does not require broken inversion symmetry. The effect is thus distinct from conventional current induced spin polarization phenomena which are linear in the current, vary as a first angular harmonic under variation of current direction and require broken inversion symmetry. The current-induced spin orientation in altermagnets is obtained using the kinetic theory for distribution functions in the spin-splitted subbands. It is shown that an application of external magnetic field significantly enhances the electron spin.</description>

      <title>Strongly-anharmonic gateless gatemon qubits based on InAs/Al 2D heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The gatemon qubits, made of transparent super-semi Josephson junctions, typically have even weaker anharmonicity than the opaque AlOx-junction transmons. However, flux-frustrated gatemons can acquire a much stronger anharmonicity, originating from the interference of the higher-order harmonics of the supercurrent. Here we investigate this effect of enhanced anharmonicity in split-junction gatemon devices based on InAs/Al 2D heterostructure. We find that anharmonicity in excess of 100% can be routinely achieved at the half-integer flux sweet-spot without any need for electrical gating or excessive sensitivity to the offset charge noise. We verified that such "gateless gatemon" qubits can be driven with Rabi frequencies more than 100 MHz, enabling gate operations much faster than what is possible with traditional gatemons and transmons. Furthermore, by analyzing a relatively high-resolution spectroscopy of the device transitions as a function of flux, we were able to extract fine details of the current-phase relation, to which transport measurements would hardly be sensitive. The strong anharmonicity of our gateless gatemons, along with their bare-bones design, can prove to be a precious resource that transparent super-semi junctions bring to quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Probing the hollowing transition of a shell-shaped BEC with collective excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the hollowing transition of a shell-shaped Bose-Einstein condensate using collective excitations. The shell is created using an immiscible dual-species BEC mixture, with its hollowness controlled by tuning the repulsive interspecies interaction via a Feshbach resonance. Our results reveal two distinct monopole modes in which the two condensates oscillate either in-phase or out-of-phase. The spectrum of the out-of-phase mode exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on the interspecies interaction, providing a clear signature of the topology change from a filled to a hollow condensate. Furthermore, we find that the critical point of the hollowing transition depends strongly on the number ratio of the two species. Our findings provide a detailed understanding of the topology change in shell-shaped quantum gases and pave the way for future study of quantum many-body phenomena in curved spaces.</description>

      <title>Efficient optimization and conceptual barriers in variational finite Projected Entangled-Pair States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Projected entangled pair states (PEPS) on finite two-dimensional lattices are a natural ansatz for representing ground states of local many-body Hamiltonians, as they inherently satisfy the boundary law of entanglement entropy. In this paper, we propose the optimization of PEPS via an improved formulation of the time-dependent variational principle (TDVP), namely the minimum-step stochastic-reconfguration scheme recently introduced for neural quantum states. We further discuss possible numerical issues that might arise in such a sampling-based approach. In this context, investigate the entanglement properties of random PEPS and find an entanglement phase transition. We note that on one side of this transition, we can identify positive random tensors as product states. To demonstrate the power of the framework described in this paper, we apply the PEPS to study the notoriously challenging chiral spin liquids. Moreover, we exhibit our approach's capability to naturally handle long-range interactions by exploring the phase diagram of Rydberg atom arrays with long-range interactions. We further provide parallelized easy-to-use code, allowing the straightforward application of our method to general Hamiltonians composed of local interaction terms.</description>

      <title>Light-induced quantum friction of carbon nanotubes in water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum friction describes the transfer of energy and momentum from electronically excited states in a material to a surrounding solvent. Here, we show that near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) exhibit quantum friction in water. The diffusion constants of functionalized SWCNTs in aqueous solution decrease linearly by around 50 % with increasing excitation power. In contrast, SWCNTs with quantum defects that localize excitons show no power-dependent diffusion. Chemical manipulation of exciton concentration by molecules that increase or decrease SWCNT fluorescence also modulate the diffusion constant by a factor of up to 2. Additionally, excitons increase the macroscopic viscosity of SWCNT solutions. Optical pump Terahertz (THz) probe spectroscopy reveals transient absorption features of water (37 /cm and above 80 /cm), indicating energy dissipation into translational modes of its hydrogen bond network. Molecular dynamics simulations further support a mechanism in which exciton-induced dipoles enhance frictional forces. These findings establish that excitons in SWCNTs induce quantum friction in water.</description>

      <title>Stable homotopy theory of invertible gapped quantum spin systems I: Kitaev's $\Omega$-spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a mathematical realization of a proposal by Kitaev, on the basis of the operator-algebraic formulation of infinite quantum spin systems. Our main results are threefold. First, we construct an $\Omega$-spectrum $\mathit{IP}_*$ whose homotopy groups are isomorphic to the smooth homotopy group of invertible gapped quantum systems on Euclidean spaces. Second, we develop a model for the homology theory associated with the $\Omega$-spectrum $\mathit{IP}_*$, describing it in terms of the space of quantum systems placed on an arbitrary subspace of a Euclidean space. This involves introducing the concept of localization flow, a semi-infinite path of quantum systems with decaying interaction range, inspired by Yu's localization C*-algebra in coarse index theory. Third, we incorporate spatial symmetries given by a crystallographic group $\Gamma $ and define the $\Omega$-spectrum $\mathit{IP}_*^\Gamma$ of $\Gamma$-invariant invertible phases. We propose a strategy for computing the homotopy group $\pi_n(\mathit{IP}_d^\Gamma )$ that uses the Davis--L\"{u}ck assembly map and its description by invertible gapped localization flow. In particular, we show that the assembly map is split injective, and hence $\pi_n(\mathit{IP}_d^\Gamma)$ contains a computable direct summand.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Frustration-free Hamiltonians provide pivotal models for understanding quantum many-body systems. In this paper, we establish a general framework for frustration-free fermionic systems. First, we derive a necessary and sufficient condition for a free fermion model to be frustration-free. In the case of translation-invariant, noninteracting systems, we show that any band touching between the valence and conduction bands is at least quadratic. Furthermore, by extending the Gosset-Huang inequality to fermionic systems, we demonstrate that even in interacting and non-translation-invariant cases, the finite-size gap of gapless excitations scales as $O((\log L)^2/L^2)$, provided the ground-state correlation function exhibits a power-law decay. Our results provide a foundation for studying frustration-free fermionic systems, including flat-band ferromagnetism and $\eta$-pairing states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate neutrino decoherence within the framework of quantum spacetime, focusing on the $\kappa$-Minkowski model. We show that stochastic fluctuations in quantum spacetime induce an energy-dependent decoherence effect, where the decoherence rate scales as $E^{-4}$. This result aligns with recent IceCube observations, indicating that quantum gravity does not induce significant decoherence for high-energy neutrinos. Additionally, we establish conditions under which quantum spacetime effects could influence relic neutrinos, such as those in the cosmic neutrino background ($C\nu B$). Our results shed light on how quantum spacetime fluctuations impact neutrino oscillation physics.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Effects on Radio Spectral Lines of Atomic Hydrogen: Hyperfine Splitting and Broadening Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the effects of gravitational waves (GWs) on hydrogen's radio spectral lines, focusing on the ground-state hyperfine transition and radiative transitions in highly excited Rydberg states. To analyze GW impacts on hyperfine structure, we derive Maxwell's equations in a gravitational-wave background using linearized gravity and the $3+1$ formalism. Our findings reveal that GWs induce energy shifts in hyperfine magnetic substates, modifying the 21 cm line. However, these energy shifts fall well below the detection limits of current radio astronomical instruments. For transitions in highly excited states, which produce radio recombination lines (RRL), the influence of GW manifests itself as spectral broadening, with the fractional linewidth for $\mathrm{H}n\alpha$ scaling as $\Delta\nu/\nu_0 \sim n^7\omega^2_{\mathrm{gw}}h(t)$. This suggests that RRLs could serve as probes for ultra-high-frequency GWs, particularly given that Rydberg atoms in the interstellar medium can reach quantum numbers above $n=100$. As an example of possibly detectable high frequency GW source, We investigate GWs emitted during the inspiral of planetary-mass primordial black hole binaries, where GW-induced broadening in RRLs could exceed natural broadening effects. Additionally, we examine the influence of the recently detected stochastic gravitational-wave background on hydrogen spectral lines.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The time-dependent electric current in a Fabry-P\'erot cavity can turn negative even if the time-dependent voltage is always positive. Here we present an analytic theory of this surprising phenomenon, showing that it is a purely quantum mechanical effect. It only occurs at low temperatures, and it is caused by interferences between paths through the cavity with different numbers of round trips. We provide realistic parameters for observing the negative currents in an experiment and show that a similar phenomenon is expected for the heat current, which may also turn negative.</description>

      <title>From Light-Cone to Supersonic Propagation of Correlations by Competing Short- and Long-Range Couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamical spreading of correlations in many-body quantum systems with competing short- and global-range couplings. We monitor the non-equilibrium dynamics of the correlations following a quench, showing that for strong short-range couplings the propagation of correlations is dominated at short and intermediate distances by a causal, light-cone, dynamics, resembling the purely short-range quantum systems. However, the interplay of short- and global-range couplings leads to a crossover between space-time regions in which the light-cone persists to regions where a supersonic, distance-independent, spreading of the correlations occurs. We identify the important ingredients needed for capturing the supersonic spreading and demonstrate our findings in systems of interacting bosonic atoms, in which the global range coupling is realized by a coupling to a cavity light field, or atomic long-range interactions, respectively. We show that our results hold in both one and two dimensions and in the presence of dissipation. Furthermore, we characterize the short time power-law scaling of the distance-independent growth of the density-density correlations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2101.08939v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that Gottesman's (1998) semantics for Clifford circuits based on the Heisenberg representation gives rise to a lightweight Hoare-like logic for efficiently characterizing a common subset of quantum programs. Our applications include (i) certifying whether auxiliary qubits can be safely disposed of, (ii) determining if a system is separable across a given bipartition, (iii) checking the transversality of a gate with respect to a given stabilizer code, and (iv) computing post-measurement states for computational basis measurements. Further, this logic is extended to accommodate universal quantum computing by deriving Hoare triples for the $T$-gate, multiply-controlled unitaries such as the Toffoli gate, and some gate injection circuits that use associated magic states. A number of interesting results emerge from this logic, including a lower bound on the number of $T$ gates necessary to perform a multiply-controlled $Z$ gate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2111.09304v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A popular machine-learning model for regression tasks, including stock-market prediction, weather forecasting and real-estate pricing, is the classical support vector regression (SVR). However, a practically realisable quantum SVR remains to be formulated. We devise annealing-based algorithms, namely simulated and quantum-classical hybrid, for training two SVR models and compare their empirical performances against the SVR implementation of Python's scikit-learn package for facial-landmark detection (FLD), a particular use case for SVR. Our method is to derive a quadratic-unconstrained-binary formulation for the optimisation problem used for training a SVR model and solve this problem using annealing. Using D-Wave's hybrid solver, we construct a quantum-assisted SVR model, thereby demonstrating a slight advantage over classical models regarding FLD accuracy. Furthermore, we observe that annealing-based SVR models predict landmarks with lower variances compared to the SVR models trained by gradient-based methods. Our work is a proof-of-concept example for applying quantum-assisted SVR to a supervised-learning task with a small training dataset.</description>

      <title>Quantum Supermaps are Characterized by Locality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.09844v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a new characterisation of quantum supermaps in terms of an axiom that refers only to sequential and parallel composition. Consequently, we generalize quantum supermaps to arbitrary monoidal categories and operational probabilistic theories. We do so by providing a simple definition of locally-applicable transformation on a monoidal category. The definition can be rephrased in the language of category theory using the principle of naturality, and can be given an intuitive diagrammatic representation in terms of which all proofs are presented. In our main technical contribution, we use this diagrammatic representation to show that locally-applicable transformations on quantum channels are in one-to-one correspondence with deterministic quantum supermaps. This alternative characterization of quantum supermaps is proven to work for more general multiple-input supermaps such as the quantum switch and on arbitrary normal convex spaces of quantum channels such as those defined by satisfaction of signaling constraints.</description>

      <title>Trade-off relations between measurement dependence and hidden information for factorizable hidden variable models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.13634v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Bell theorem is explored in terms of a trade-off relation between underlying assumptions within the hidden variable model framework. In this paper, recognizing the incorporation of hidden variables as one of the fundamental assumptions, we propose a measure termed `hidden information' taking account of their distribution. This measure quantifies the number of hidden variables that essentially contribute to the empirical statistics. For factorizable models, hidden variable models that satisfy `locality' without adhering to the measurement independence criterion, we derive novel relaxed Bell-Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (Bell-CHSH) inequalities. These inequalities elucidate trade-off relations between measurement dependence and hidden information in the CHSH scenario. It is also revealed that the relation gives a necessary and sufficient condition for the measures to be realized by a factorizable model.</description>

Abstract: The Lie-Trotter formula has been a fundamental tool in quantum mechanics, quantum computing, and quantum simulations. The error estimations for the Lie-Trotter product formula play a crucial role in achieving scalability and computational efficiency. In this note, we present two error estimates of Lie-Trotter product formulas, utilizing Jordan product within Banach algebras. Additionally, we introduce two generalized Lie-Trotter formula and provide two explicit estimation formulas. Consequently, the renowned Suzuki symmetrized approximation for the exponentiated sums follows directly from our main Theorem.</description>

      <title>Lie-algebraic classical simulations for quantum computing</title>

Abstract: The classical simulation of quantum dynamics plays an important role in our understanding of quantum complexity, and in the development of quantum technologies. Efficient techniques such as those based on the Gottesman-Knill theorem for Clifford circuits, tensor networks for low entanglement-generating circuits, or Wick's theorem for fermionic Gaussian states, have become central tools in quantum computing. In this work, we contribute to this body of knowledge by presenting a framework for classical simulations, dubbed "$\mathfrak{g}$-sim", which is based on the underlying Lie algebraic structure of the dynamical process. When the dimension of the algebra grows at most polynomially in the system size, there exists observables for which the simulation is efficient. Indeed, we show that $\mathfrak{g}$-sim enables new regimes for classical simulations, is able to deal with certain forms of noise in the evolution, as well as can be used to tackle several paradigmatic variational and non-variational quantum computing tasks. For the former, we perform Lie-algebraic simulations to train and optimize parametrized quantum circuits (thus effectively showing that some variational models can be dequantized), design enhanced parameter initialization strategies, solve tasks of quantum circuit synthesis, and train a quantum-phase classifier. For the latter, we report large-scale noiseless and noisy simulations on benchmark problems. By comparing the limitations of $\mathfrak{g}$-sim and certain Wick's theorem-based simulations, we find that the two methods become inefficient for different types of states or observables, hinting at the existence of distinct, non-equivalent, resources for classical simulation.</description>

      <title>Solvable entanglement dynamics in quantum circuits with generalized space-time duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12239v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the non-equilibrium dynamics of kicked Ising models in $1+1$ dimensions which have interactions alternating between odd and even bonds in time. These models can be understood as quantum circuits tiling space-time with the generalized space-time dual properties of tri-unitarity (three "arrows of time") at the global level, and also second-level dual-unitarity at the local level, which constrains the behavior of pairs of local gates underlying the circuit under a space-time rotation. We identify a broad class of initial product states wherein the effect of the environment on a small subsystem can be exactly represented by influence matrices with simple Markovian structures, resulting in the subsystem's full dynamics being efficiently computable. We further find additional conditions under which the dynamics of entanglement can be solved for all times, yielding rich phenomenology ranging from linear growth at half the maximal speed allowed by locality, followed by saturation to maximum entropy (i.e., thermalization to infinite temperature); to entanglement growth with saturation to extensive but sub-maximal entropy. Intriguingly, for certain parameter regimes, we find a nonchaotic class of dynamics which is neither integrable nor Clifford, exemplified by nonzero operator entanglement growth but with a spectral form factor which exhibits large, apparently time-quasiperiodic revivals.</description>

      <title>Hilbert Space Fragmentation and Subspace Scar Time-Crystallinity in Driven Homogeneous Central-Spin Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18001v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the stroboscopic non-equilibrium quantum dynamics of periodically kicked Hamiltonians involving homogeneous central-spin interactions. The system exhibits a strong fragmentation of Hilbert space into four-dimensional Floquet-Krylov subspaces, which oscillate between two disjointed two-dimensional subspaces and thus break the discrete time-translation symmetry of the system. Our analytical and numerical analyses reveal that fully polarized states of the satellite spins exhibit fragmentations that are stable against perturbations and have high overlap with Floquet eigenstates of atypically low bipartite entanglement entropy (scar states). Motivated by the breaking of discrete time translation symmetry by Floquet-Krylov subspaces, we introduce a novel type of time crystal that we call a ``subspace time crystal''. We present evidence of robust time-crystalline behavior in the form of a period doubling of the total magnetization of fully polarized satellite spin states that persists over long time scales. We compute non-equilibrium phase diagrams with respect to a magnetic field, coupling terms, and pulse error for various interaction types, including Heisenberg, Ising, XXZ, and XX. We also discuss possible experimental realizations of scar time crystals in color center, quantum dot, and rare-earth ion platforms.</description>

      <title>Decomposition of a system in pseudo-Hermitian quantum mechanics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08095v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work outlines a consistent method of identifying subsystems in finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, independent of the underlying inner-product structure. Such Hilbert spaces arise in $\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$-symmetric quantum mechanics, where a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian is made self-adjoint by changing the inner product using the so-called ``metric operator". This is the framework of pseudo-Hermitian quantum mechanics. For composite quantum systems in this framework, defining subsystems is generally considered feasible only when the metric operator is chosen to have a tensor product form so that a partial trace operation can be well defined. In this work, we use arguments from algebraic quantum mechanics to show that the subsystems can be well-defined in every metric space - irrespective of whether or not the metric is of tensor product form. This is done by identifying subsystems with a decomposition of the underlying C*-algebra into commuting subalgebras. Although the choice of the metric is known to have no effect on the system's statistics, we show that different choices of the metric can lead to inequivalent subsystem decompositions. Each of the subsystems can be tomographically constructed and these subsystems satisfy the no-signalling principle. With these results, we put all the choices of the metric operator on an equal footing for composite systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16975v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) describes the properties of diagonal and off-diagonal matrix elements of local operators in the eigenenergy basis. In this work, we propose a relation between (i) the singular behaviour of the off-diagonal part of ETH at small energy differences, and (ii) the smooth profile of the diagonal part of ETH as a function of the energy density. We establish this connection from the decay of the autocorrelation functions of local operators, which is constrained by the presence of local conserved quantities whose evolution is described by hydrodynamics. We corroborate our predictions with numerical simulations of two non-integrable spin-1 Ising models, one diffusive and one super-diffusive, which we perform using dynamical quantum typicality up to 18 spins.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06625v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The emergence of quantum computing technology over the last decade indicates the potential for a transformational impact in the study of quantum mechanical systems. It is natural to presume that such computing technologies would be valuable to large scientific institutions, such as United States national laboratories. However, detailed descriptions of what these institutions would like to use these computers for are limited. To help provide some initial insights into this topic, this report develops detailed use cases of how quantum computing technology could be utilized to enhance a variety of quantum physics research activities at Los Alamos National Laboratory, including quantum magnetic materials, high-temperature superconductivity and nuclear astrophysics simulations. The report discusses how current high-performance computers are used for scientific discovery today and develops detailed descriptions of the types of quantum physics simulations that Los Alamos National Laboratory scientists would like to conduct, if a sufficient computing technology became available. While the report strives to highlight the breadth of potential application areas for quantum computation, this investigation has also indicated that many more use cases exist at Los Alamos National Laboratory, which could be documented in similar detail with sufficient time and effort.</description>

      <title>Entanglement entropy bounds for pure states of rapid decorrelation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10194v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For pure states of multi-dimensional quantum lattice systems, which in a convenient computational basis have amplitude and phase structure of sufficiently rapid decorrelation, we construct high fidelity approximations of relatively low complexity. These are used for a conditional proof of area-law bounds for the states' entanglement entropy. The condition is also shown to imply exponential decay of the state's mutual information between disjoint regions, and hence exponential clustering of local observables. The applicability of the general results is demonstrated on the quantum Ising model in transverse field. Combined with available model-specific information on spin-spin correlations, we establish an area-law type bound on the entanglement in the model's subcritical ground states, valid in all dimensions and up to the model's quantum phase transition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10360v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Uncertainty principle forbids one to determine which of the two paths a quantum system has travelled, unless interference between the alternatives had been destroyed by a measuring device, e.g., by a pointer. One can try to weaken the coupling between the device and the system, in order to avoid the veto. We demonstrate, however, that a weak pointer is at the same time an inaccurate one, and the information about the path taken by the system in each individual trial is inevitably lost. We show also that a similar problem occurs if a classical system is monitored by an inaccurate quantum meter. In both cases one can still determine some characteristic of the corresponding statistical ensemble, a relation between path probabilities in the classical case, and a relation between the probability amplitudes if a quantum system is involved.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simulation of physical systems is one of the most promising use cases of future digital quantum computers. In this work we systematically analyze the quantum circuit complexities of block encoding the discretized elliptic operators that arise extensively in numerical simulations for partial differential equations, including high-dimensional instances for many-body simulations. When restricted to rectangular domains with separable boundary conditions, we provide explicit circuits to block encode the many-body Laplacian with separable periodic, Dirichlet, Neumann, and Robin boundary conditions, using standard discretization techniques from low-order finite difference methods. To obtain high-precision, we introduce a scheme based on periodic extensions to solve Dirichlet and Neumann boundary value problems using a high-order finite difference method, with only a constant increase in total circuit depth and subnormalization factor. We then present a scheme to implement block encodings of differential operators acting on more arbitrary domains, inspired by Cartesian immersed boundary methods. We then block encode the many-body convective operator, which describes interacting particles experiencing a force generated by a pair-wise potential given as an inverse power law of the interparticle distance. This work provides concrete recipes that are readily translated into quantum circuits, with depth logarithmic in the total Hilbert space dimension, that block encode operators arising broadly in applications involving the quantum simulation of quantum and classical many-body mechanics.</description>

      <title>Radiative pumping vs vibrational relaxation of molecular polaritons: a bosonic mapping approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20594v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a formalism to study molecular polaritons based on the bosonization of molecular vibronic states. This formalism accommodates an arbitrary number of molecules $N$, excitations and internal vibronic structures, making it ideal for investigating molecular polariton processes accounting for finite $N$ effects. We employ this formalism to rigorously derive radiative pumping and vibrational relaxation rates. We show that radiative pumping is the emission from incoherent excitons and divide its rate into transmitted and re-absorbed components. On the other hand, the vibrational relaxation rate in the weak linear vibronic coupling regime is composed of a $\mathcal{O}(1/N)$ contribution already accounted for by radiative pumping, and a $\mathcal{O}(1/N^2)$ contribution from a second-order process in the \textit{single}-molecule light-matter coupling that we call polariton-assisted Raman scattering. This scattering is enhanced when the difference between fluorescence and lower polariton frequencies matches a Raman-active excitation.</description>

      <title>Exploring Non-Markovianity in Ergodic Channels: Measuring Memory Retention through Ergotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04993v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we introduce and characterize a broad class of quantum operations with a unique fixed point, termed quantum ergodic channels. We derive Lindblad-type master equations for these channels in arbitrary finite dimensions and analyze their non-Markovian dynamics using established measures. When the fixed point is a passive state, the channels exhibit ergotropy dynamics with notable thermodynamic implications. Specifically, under Markovian processes, ergotropy, a measure of the extractable work from a system under unitary evolution monotonically decreases. However, in non-Markovian dynamics, ergotropy fluctuates, leading to a backflow effect that highlights memory-induced resource recovery. Our findings suggest that this ergotropy backflow could serve as an operationally meaningful indicator of non-Markovianity, offering new perspectives on the interplay between memory effects and thermodynamic behavior in open quantum systems. This study enhances the theoretical framework for understanding energy dynamics under ergodic channels and highlights new avenues for exploring the implications of memory effects in quantum batteries.</description>

Abstract: The path-integral approach to topological quantum error correction provides a unified way to construct and analyze fault-tolerant circuits in spacetime. In this work, we demonstrate its utility and versatility at hand of a simple example: We construct a new fault-tolerant circuit for the toric-code phase by traversing its path integral on a $(x,y,z)$ cubic lattice in the $x+y$ direction. The circuit acts on qubits on a square lattice, and alternates between horizontal nearest-neighbor $CX$ gates and vertical nearest-neighbor $ZZ$ and $XX$ measurements. We show how to incorporate boundaries and corners into the fault-tolerant circuit and how to perform topologically protected logic gates. As a specific example, we consider performing a fault-tolerant logical $ZZ$ measurement via lattice surgery of two spatial rectangular blocks of our fault-tolerant circuit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01364v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Currently envisaged tests for probing the quantum nature of the gravitational interaction in the low-energy regime typically focus either on the quantized center-of-mass degrees of freedom of two spherically-symmetric test masses or on the rotational degrees of freedom of non-symmetric masses under a gravitational interaction in the Newtonian limit. In contrast, here we investigate the interaction between the angular momenta of spherically-symmetric test masses considering the general relativistic correction related to frame-dragging that leads to an effective dipolar interaction between the angular momenta. In this approach, the mass of the probes is not directly relevant; instead, their angular momentum plays the central role. We demonstrate that, while the optimal entangling rate is achieved with a maximally delocalized initial state, significant quantum correlations can still arise between two rotating systems even when each is initialized in an eigenstate of rotation. Additionally, we examine the robustness of the generated entanglement against typical sources of noise and observe that our combination of angular momentum and spherically-symmetric test-masses mitigates the impact of many common noise sources.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04427v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computing has the potential to reduce the computational cost required for quantum dynamics simulations. However, existing quantum algorithms for coupled electron-nuclear dynamics simulation either require fault-tolerant devices, or use the Born-Oppenheimer (BO) approximation and a truncation of the electronic basis. We present the first analog quantum simulation approach for molecular vibronic dynamics in a pre-BO framework, i.e. without the separation of electrons and nuclei, by mapping the molecular Hamiltonian to a device with coupled qubits and bosonic modes. We show that our approach has exponential savings in resource and computational costs compared to the equivalent classical algorithms. The computational cost of our approach is also exponentially lower than existing BO-based quantum algorithms. Furthermore, our approach has a much smaller resource scaling than the existing pre-BO quantum algorithms for chemical dynamics. The low cost of our approach will enable an exact treatment of electron-nuclear dynamics on near-term quantum devices.</description>

      <title>A probabilistic imaginary-time evolution quantum algorithm for advection-diffusion equation: Explicit gate-level implementation and comparisons to quantum linear system algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18559v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simulating differential equations on classical computers becomes an intractable problem if the grid size is extremely large. Quantum computers are believed to achieve a possibly exponential speedup in the matrix operation. In this paper, we propose a quantum algorithm for solving the advection-diffusion-reaction equation by employing a novel approximate probabilistic imaginary-time evolution (PITE) operator. First, the effectiveness of the proposed approximate PITE operator is justified by the theoretical evaluation of the error. Next, we construct the explicit quantum circuit to realize the imaginary-time evolution of the Hamiltonian coming from the advection-diffusion equation, whose gate complexity is logarithmic regarding the size of the discretized Hamiltonian matrix. Compared to the existing algorithms for the quantum linear system problem, our algorithm achieves an exponential speedup regarding the matrix size at the cost of a worse dependence on the error bound. Moreover, numerical simulations using gate-based quantum emulator for 1D/2D examples are also provided to verify our algorithm. Finally, we extend our algorithm to the coupled system of advection-diffusion equations to show the prospects for practical applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20378v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose simple quantitative criteria, based on counting statistics in resonant harmonic detectors, that probe the quantum mechanical character of radiation fields. They provide, in particular, practical means to test the null hypothesis that a given field is ``maximally classical'', i.e., accurately described by a coherent state. We suggest circumstances in which that hypothesis plausibly fails, notably including gravitational radiation involving non-linear or stochastic sourcing.</description>

      <title>Unclonable Functional Encryption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06029v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a functional encryption (FE) scheme, a user that holds a ciphertext and a function key can learn the result of applying the function to the plaintext message. Security requires that the user does not learn anything beyond the function evaluation. We extend this notion to the quantum setting by providing definitions and a construction for a quantum functional encryption (QFE) scheme which allows for the evaluation of polynomialy-sized circuits on arbitrary quantum messages. Our construction is built upon quantum garbled circuits [BY22]. We also investigate the relationship of QFE to the seemingly unrelated notion of unclonable encryption (UE) and find that any QFE scheme universally achieves the property of unclonable functional encryption (UFE). In particular we assume the existence of an unclonable encryption scheme with quantum decryption keys which was recently constructed by [AKY24]. Our UFE guarantees that two parties cannot simultaneously recover the correct function outputs using two independently sampled function secret keys. As an application we give the first construction for public-key UE with variable decryption keys. Lastly, we establish a connection between quantum indistinguishability obfuscation (qiO) and quantum functional encryption (QFE); Showing that any multi-input indistinguishability-secure quantum functional encryption scheme unconditionally implies the existence of qiO.</description>

      <title>Dynamical formulation of low-frequency scattering in two and three dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16906v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The transfer matrix of scattering theory in one dimension can be expressed in terms of the time-evolution operator for an effective non-unitary quantum system. In particular, it admits a Dyson series expansion which turns out to facilitate the construction of the low-frequency series expansion of the scattering data. In two and three dimensions, there is a similar formulation of stationary scattering where the scattering properties of the scatterer are extracted from the evolution operator for a corresponding effective quantum system. We explore the utility of this approach to scattering theory in the study of the scattering of low-frequency time-harmonic scalar waves, $e^{-i\omega t}\psi(\mathbf{r})$, with $\psi(\mathbf{r})$ satisfying the Helmholtz equation, $[\nabla^2+k^2\hat\varepsilon(\mathbf{r};k)]\psi(\mathbf{r})=0$, $\omega$ and $k$ being respectively the angular frequency and wavenumber of the incident wave, and $\hat\varepsilon(\mathbf{r};k)$ denoting the relative permittivity of the carrier medium which in general takes complex values. We obtain explicit formulas for low-frequency scattering amplitude, examine their effectiveness in the study of a class of exactly solvable scattering problems, and outline their application in devising a low-frequency cloaking scheme.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17069v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bosonic codes offer a hardware-efficient approach to encoding and protecting quantum information with a single continuous-variable bosonic system. In this paper, we introduce a new universal quantum gate set composed of only one type of gate element, which we call the quantum lattice gate, to engineer bosonic code states for fault-tolerant quantum computing. We develop a systematic framework for code state engineering based on the Floquet Hamiltonian engineering, where the target Hamiltonian is constructed directly from the given target state(s). We apply our method to three basic code state engineering processes, including single code state preparation, code space embedding and code space transformation. We explore the application of our method to automatic quantum error correction against single-photon loss with four-legged cat codes. Our proposal is particularly well-suited for superconducting circuit architectures with Josephson junctions, where the full nonlinearity of Josephson junction potential is harnessed as a quantum resource and the quantum lattice gate can be implemented on a sub-nanosecond timescale.</description>

      <title>Recent developments in the generation of non-classical and entangled light states using intense laser-matter interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17452v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-classical and entangled light states are of fundamental interest in quantum mechanics and they are a powerful tool for the emergence of new quantum technologies. The development of methods that can lead to the generation of such light states is therefore of high importance. Recently, it has been demonstrated that intense laser-matter interactions can serve towards this direction. Specifically, it has been shown how the use of fully quantized approaches in intense laser-matter interactions and the process of high harmonic generation, can lead to the generation of high photon-number non-classical and entangled states from the far-infrared (IR) to the extreme-ultraviolet (XUV). Here, after a brief introduction on the fundamentals, we summarize the operation principles of these approaches and discuss the recent developments and future directions of non-classical light engineering using strong light fields with the potential application in ultrafast and quantum information science. These findings represent an important step in the development of novel quantum nonlinear spectroscopy methods, based on the interplay between the quantum properties of light and those of quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Quantum permutation puzzles with indistinguishable particles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22287v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Permutation puzzles, such as the Rubik's Cube and the 15 puzzle, are enjoyed by the general public and mathematicians alike. Here we introduce quantum versions of permutation puzzles where the pieces of the puzzles are replaced with indistinguishable quantum particles. The moves in the puzzle are achieved by swapping or permuting the particles. We show that simply permuting the particles can be mapped to a classical permutation puzzle, even though the identical particles are entangled. However, we obtain a genuine quantum puzzle by adding a quantum move: the square root of SWAP. The resulting puzzle cannot be mapped to a classical permutation puzzle. We focus predominately on the quantization of the $2\times 2$ slide puzzle and briefly treat the $2\times 2 \times 1$ Rubik's Cube.</description>

      <title>Comparing the performance of practical two-qubit gates for individual $^{171}$Yb ions in yttrium orthovanadate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23613v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate three schemes for implementing Controlled-Z (CZ) gates between individual ytterbium (Yb) rare-earth ions doped into yttrium orthovanadate (YVO$_4$ or YVO). Specifically, we investigate the CZ gates based on magnetic dipolar interactions between Yb ions, photon scattering off a cavity, and a photon interference-based protocol, with and without an optical cavity. We introduce a theoretical framework for precise computations of state and gate infidelities, accounting for noise effects. We then compute the state fidelity for each scheme to evaluate the feasibility of their experimental implementation. Based on these results, we compare the performance of the two-qubit gate schemes and discuss their respective advantages and disadvantages. We conclude that the probabilistic photon interference-based scheme offers the best fidelity scaling with cooperativity and is superior with the current technology of Yb values, while photon scattering is nearly deterministic but slower with less favourable fidelity scaling as a function of cooperativity. The cavityless magnetic dipolar scheme provides a fast, deterministic gate with decent fidelities if close ion localization can be realized. While focusing on $^{171}\text{Yb}^{3+}: \text{YVO}$ system as a case study, the theoretical tools and approaches developed in this work are broadly applicable to other spin qubit systems.</description>

      <title>Optimality Condition for the Petz Map</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23622v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In quantum error correction, the Petz map serves as a perfect recovery map when the Knill-Laflamme conditions are satisfied. Notably, while perfect recovery is generally infeasible for most quantum channels of finite dimension, the Petz map remains a versatile tool with near-optimal performance in recovering quantum states. This work introduces and proves, for the first time, the necessary and sufficient conditions for the optimality of the Petz in terms of entanglement fidelity. In some special cases, the violation of this condition can be easily characterized by a simple commutator that can be efficiently computed. We provide multiple examples that substantiate our new findings.</description>

      <title>Scaling up to Problem Sizes: An Environmental Life Cycle Assessment of Quantum Computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00118v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the demonstrated ability to perform calculations in seconds that would take classical supercomputers thousands of years, quantum computers namely hold the promise of radically advancing sustainable IT. However, quantum computers face challenges due to the inherent noise in physical qubits, necessitating error correction for reliable operation in solving industrial-scale problems, which will require more computation time, energy, and electronic components than initial laboratory-scale experiments. Yet, while researchers have modeled and analyzed the environmental impacts of classical computers using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), the environmental performance of quantum computing remains unknown to date. This study contributes to filling this critical gap in two ways: (1) by establishing an environmental profile for quantum computers based on superconducting qubits; and (2) by comparing it to a functionally equivalent profile of a state-of-the-art supercomputer. With the comparison based on the problem size, the paper shows how the usage time can drive an environmental advantage for quantum computers under specific scaling conditions and quantum error correcting codes. The results emphasize that quantum error correction hardware has a substantial environmental impact due to the numerous electronic components needed to achieve 100 logical qubits. This paper can serve as a basis for designing more environmentally friendly quantum computers and for establishing their environmental profiles, as well as those of the human activities that will use them.</description>

      <title>On some states minimizing uncertainty relations: A new look at these relations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08131v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Analyzing Heisenberg--Robertson (HR) and Schr\"{o}dinger uncertainty relations we found, that there can exist a large set of states of the quantum system under considerations, for which the lower bound of the product of the standard deviations of a pair of non--commuting observables, $A$ and $B$, is zero. These states are not eigenstates of either the observable $A$ or $B$. The correlation function for these observables in such states is equal to zero. We have also shown that the so--called "sum uncertainty relations" also do not provide any information about lower bounds on the standard deviations calculated for these states. We additionally show that the uncertainty principle in its most general form has two faces: one is that it is a lower bound on the product of standard deviations, and the other is that the product of standard deviations is an upper bound on the modulus of the correlation function of a pair of the non--commuting observables in the state under consideration.</description>

      <title>Generation of Coherent Quantum Light from a Single Impurity-Bound Exciton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01677v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Impurity-bound excitons in II-VI direct-bandgap semiconductors are promising optically active solid-state spin qubits that combine exceptional optical quantum efficiency with an ultra-low spin noise environment. Previous studies on single impurities relied on incoherent optical excitation to generate photons. However, many quantum applications require resonant driving of quantum emitters to precisely control optical transitions and maintain coherence of the emission. Here, we demonstrate coherent optical emission of quantum light from a resonantly driven single impurity-bound exciton in ZnSe. The resonantly driven emitter exhibits bright quantum light emission that preserves the phase of the resonant drive, validated through polarization interferometry. Resonant excitation enables us to directly measure the Debye-Waller factor, determined to be 0.94, which indicates high efficiency emission to the zero-phonon line. Time-resolved resonance fluorescence measurements reveal a fast optically-driven ionization process that we attribute to Auger recombination, along with a slower spontaneous ionization process having a lifetime of 21 {\mu}s due to charge tunneling from the impurity. We show that incoherent, low-power laser pumping efficiently stabilizes the charge of the impurity-bound exciton on the timescale of 9.3 ns, recovering the resonance fluorescence emission from the bound exciton. These results pave the way for coherent optical and spin control of the single impurity states through resonant excitation of impurity-bound excitons in II-VI semiconductors.</description>

      <title>A unified framework of unitarily residual measures for quantifying dissipation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02231v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Open quantum systems are governed by both unitary and non-unitary dynamics, with dissipation arising from the latter. Traditional quantum divergence measures, such as quantum relative entropy, fail to account for the non-unitary oriented dissipation as the divergence is positive even between unitarily connected states. We introduce a framework for quantifying the dissipation by isolating the non-unitary components of quantum dynamics. We define equivalence relations among hermitian operators through unitary transformations and characterize the resulting quotient set. By establishing an isomorphism between this quotient set and a set of real vectors with ordered components, we induce divergence measures that are invariant under unitary evolution, which we refer to as the unitarily residual measures. These unitarily residual measures inherit properties such as monotonicity and convexity and, in certain cases, correspond to classical information divergences between sorted eigenvalue distributions. Our results provide a powerful tool for quantifying dissipation in open quantum systems, advancing the understanding of quantum thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Tunnel Diode Oscillator for Qubit Readout Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09811v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We developed a tunnel diode oscillator and characterized its performance, highlighting its potential applications in the quantum state readout of electrons in semiconductors and electrons on liquid helium. This cryogenic microwave source demonstrates significant scalability potential for large-scale qubit readout systems due to its compact design and low power consumption of only 1 uW, making it suitable for integration on the 10 mK stage of a dilution refrigerator. The tunnel diode oscillator exhibits superior amplitude stability compared to commercial microwave sources. The output frequency is centered around 140 MHz, commonly used for qubit readout of electrons in semiconductors, with a frequency tunability of 10 MHz achieved using a varactor diode. Furthermore, the phase noise was significantly improved by replacing the commercially available voltage source with a lead-acid battery, achieving a measured phase noise of -115 dBc/Hz at a 1 MHz offset.</description>

      <title>Hybrid quantum network for sensing in the acoustic frequency range</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11824v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultimate limits for sensing of fields and forces are set by the quantum noise of a sensor. Entanglement allows for suppression of such noise and for achieving sensitivity beyond standard quantum limits. Applicability of quantum optical sensing is often restricted by fixed wavelengths of available photonic quantum sources. Another ubiquitous limitation is associated with challenges of achieving quantum-noise-limited sensitivity in the acoustic noise frequency range relevant for a number of applications. Here we demonstrate a novel tool for broadband quantum sensing by performing quantum state processing that can be applied to a wide range of the optical spectrum, and by suppressing quantum noise over an octave in the acoustic frequency range. An atomic spin ensemble is strongly coupled to one of the frequency-tunable beams of an Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) source of light. The other EPR beam of light, entangled with the first one, is tuned to a disparate wavelength. Engineering the spin ensemble to act as a negative- or positive-mass oscillator we demonstrate frequency-dependent quantum noise reduction for measurements at the disparate wavelength. The tunability of the spin ensemble allows to target quantum noise in a variety of systems with dynamics ranging from kHz to MHz. As an example of the broadband quantum noise reduction in the acoustic frequency range, we analyse the applicability of our approach to gravitational wave detectors. Other possible applications include continuous-variable quantum repeaters and distributed quantum sensing.</description>

      <title>Capturing the Page Curve and Entanglement Dynamics of Black Holes in Quantum Computers</title>

Abstract: Understanding the Page curve and resolving the black hole information puzzle in terms of the entanglement dynamics of black holes has been a key question in fundamental physics. In principle, the current quantum computing can provide insights into the entanglement dynamics of black holes within some simplified models. In this regard, we utilize quantum computers to investigate the entropy of Hawking radiation using the qubit transport model, a toy qubit model of black hole evaporation. Specifically, we implement the quantum simulation of the scrambling dynamics in black holes using an efficient random unitary circuit. Furthermore, we employ the swap-based many-body interference protocol for the first time and the randomized measurement protocol to measure the entanglement entropy of Hawking radiation qubits in IBM's superconducting quantum computers. Our findings indicate that while both entanglement entropy measurement protocols accurately estimate the R\'enyi entropy in numerical simulation, the randomized measurement protocol has a particular advantage over the swap-based many-body interference protocol in IBM's superconducting quantum computers. Finally, by incorporating quantum error mitigation techniques, we establish that the current quantum computers are robust tools for measuring the entanglement entropy of complex quantum systems and can probe black hole dynamics within simplified toy qubit models.</description>

      <title>Efficient Compilation for Shuttling Trapped-Ion Machines via the Position Graph Architectural Abstraction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12470v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the growth of quantum platforms for gate-based quantum computation, compilation holds a crucial factor in deciding the success of the implementation. There has been rich research and development in compilation techniques for the superconducting-qubit regime. In contrast, the trapped-ion architectures, currently leading in robust quantum computations due to their reliable operations, do not have many competitive compilation strategies. This work presents a novel unifying abstraction, called the position graph, for different types of hardware architectures. Using this abstraction, we model trapped-ion Quantum Charge-Coupled Device (QCCD) architectures and enable high-quality, scalable superconducting compilation methods. In particular, we devise a scheduling algorithm called SHuttling-Aware PERmutative heuristic search algorithm (SHAPER) to tackle the complex constraints and dynamics of trapped-ion QCCD with the cooperation of state-of-the-art permutation-aware mapping. This approach generates native, executable circuits and ion instructions on the hardware that adheres to the physical constraints of shuttling-based quantum computers. Using the position graph abstraction, we evaluate our algorithm on theorized and actual architectures. Our algorithm can successfully compile programs for these architectures where other state-of-the-art algorithms fail. In the cases when other algorithms complete, our algorithm produces a schedule that is $14\%$ faster on average, up to $69\%$ in the best case.\\ {\bf Reproducibility:} source code and computational results are available at $[$will be added upon acceptance$]$</description>

      <title>Simulating methylamine using symmetry adapted qubit-excitation-based variational quantum eigensolver</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17035v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we propose and analyze optimization strategies for the VQE algorithm that combine various methods, including molecular point group symmetries (symmetry adaptation), compact excitation circuits (qubit-excitation-based), different types of excitation sets, and qubit tapering. These strategies allow for a significant reduction in computational requirements while ensuring convergence to the correct energies. First, we apply these combinations to small molecules, such as LiH and BeH2, to evaluate their compatibility, accuracy, and potential applicability to larger problems. We then simulate the methylamine molecule within its restricted active space using the best-performing optimization strategies. Finally, we complete our analysis by estimating the resources required for full active-space simulations of the methylamine and formic acid molecules. Our best-performing optimization strategy reduces the number of two-qubit operations for simulating the methylamine molecule from 600,000 (in the STO-3G basis with a naive Unitary Coupled Cluster ansatz) to approximately 12,000, using 26 qubits. Thus, the proposed combination of optimization methods can reduce the number of two-qubit operations by nearly two orders of magnitude. Although, we present alternative approaches that are of interest in the context of the further optimization in the number of two-qubit operation, we note that these approaches do not perform well enough in terms of the convergence to required energies. While these challenges persist, our resource analysis represents a valuable step towards the practical use of quantum computers and the development of better methods for optimizing computing resources.</description>

      <title>Decoherence-induced self-dual criticality in topological states of matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14034v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum measurements can be employed to induce decoherence in a restricted segment of a quantum many-body state, while simultaneously engineering long-range entanglement for its remaining constituents. Though this two-fold character of measurements in open quantum systems has been appreciated for entangled state preparation, a deeper conceptual understanding is called for regarding symmetry as an organizing principle. Here we discuss the role of self-dual symmetry -- a fundamental notion in theoretical physics -- in mixed states, showing that the decoherence of electric and magnetic vortices from the 2D bulk of the toric code, or a 2D cluster state with symmetry-protected topological order, can leave a (1+1)D quantum critical mixed state on the boundary protected by a weak Kramers-Wannier self-dual symmetry. The corresponding self-dual critical bulk is described by the $N\to1$ limit of the 2D Non-linear Sigma Model in symmetry class $D$ at $\Theta$-angle $\pi$, with target space $SO(2N)/U(N)$, established as a Born-measurement version of the Cho-Fisher model. An explicit breaking of the self-duality, by incoherent noise amounting to fermion interactions or non-interacting coherent deformation, is shown to induce an RG crossover from this self-dual critical state to Nishimori criticality or to it from a novel type of Ising+ criticality, respectively, both of which are related to the random-bond Ising model in different replica limits and are described by non-unitary conformal field theories of non-interacting fermions, as is the self-dual point. Using numerical approaches combining tensor network, Monte Carlo, and Gaussian fermion simulations, we chart out a global phase diagram by coherent information and entanglement entropy measures. Our results point a way towards a general understanding of mixed-state criticality in open quantum systems in terms of symmetry and topology.</description>

      <title>Critical dynamics and its interferometry in the one-dimensional p-wave-paired Aubry-Andr\'{e}-Harper model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03470v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we focus on the critical dynamics of the one-dimensional quasiperiodic p-wave-paired Aubry-Andr\'{e}-Harper model, which exhibits a transition point between the gapped critical and the gapless localized phases. First, we disclose that the dynamical exponent features two distinct plateaus in the gapless localized phase. Besides the plateau with dynamical exponent $z=1.388$ near the transition point, there is a second one with $z=1$ away from the transition point. Then we demonstrate that these two plateaus intrinsically affect the critical dynamics with moderate quench rate by employing both one-way and round-trip quench protocols. In the one-way quench protocol, we clarify that the Kibble-Zurek (KZ) regime consists of two sub-regimes with different KZ exponents, which is a direct consequence of the two-plateau structure of the dynamical exponent. We also diagnose the KZ, pre-saturated, and saturated regimes by varying the quench rate from slow to fast limits. While, in the round-trip quench protocol, we confirm the interference effect of two critical dynamics and show a narrow neck in the oscillatory density of defects. It turns out that the position of the neck depends on the ratio of to-and-fro quench rates and the p-wave superconductivity pairing amplitude. We show how the position of the neck can be used to quantitatively determine the turning point of the two KZ sub-regimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06292v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel hybrid quantum-classical approach has been developed to efficiently address the multireference quantum chemistry problem. The Handover Iterative Variational Quantum Eigensolver (HiVQE) is designed to accurately estimate ground-state wavefunctions by leveraging both quantum and classical computing resources. In this framework, noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardwares efficiently explore electron configurations, while classical computers compute the corresponding wavefunction without the effect of noise of NISQ computer, ensuring both accuracy and computational efficiency. By generating compact yet chemically accurate wavefunctions, HiVQE advances quantum chemistry simulations and facilitates the discovery of novel materials. This approach demonstrates significant potential for overcoming the limitations of classical methods in strongly correlated electronic systems.</description>

      <title>The Art of Avoiding Constraints: A Penalty-free Approach to Constrained Combinatorial Optimization with QAOA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10077v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is designed to determine optimum and near optimum solutions of quadratic (and higher order) unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO or HUBO) problems, which in turn accurately model unconstrained combinatorial optimization problems. While the solution space of an unconstrained combinatorial optimization problem consists of all possible combinations of the objective function's decision variables, for a constrained combinatorial optimization problem, the solution space consists only of solutions that satisfy the problem constraints. While solving such a QUBO problem optimally results in an optimal solution to the underlying constrained problem, setting the right penalty parameters is crucial. Moreover, finding suitable penalties that ensure near-optimal solutions is also challenging. In this article, we introduce our innovative profit-relaxation framework to solve constrained combinatorial optimization problems. Our effective hybrid approach transforms a selected constrained combinatorial optimization problem into an unconstrained profit problem, such that the solution spaces of the two problems are interrelated with respect to their solution qualities. This allows us to determine optimal and near-optimal solutions for the constrained problem.
  We use three NP-hard problems -- Minimum Vertex Cover, Maximum Independent Set, and Maximum Clique -- to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach. We conducted a detailed performance evaluation of our profit-relaxation framework on two different platforms: Xanadu PennyLane and Argonne QTensor Quantum Circuit Simulator.</description>

      <title>Sagnac interferometer-based noise-free superresolution using phase-controlled quantum erasers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10101v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interferometer-based precision measurements have been intensively studied for sensing and metrology over the past half century. In classical optics, the resolution and phase sensitivity of an optical signal are confined by diffraction limit and shot-noise limit (SNL), respectively. Highly entangled photon pairs, i.e., N00N states have been adapted to overcome SNL in quantum sensing over the last two decades. Recently, coherent light-excited quantum sensing has also been proposed and demonstrated for macroscopic quantum sensing to overcome the limited N scalability in N00N-based quantum sensing. Here, a Sagnac interferometer-based superresolution is proposed to solve environmental noises inevitable in an interferometer. Furthermore, a spatial light modulator takes over the role of phase-controlled quantum erasers to solve the linear optics-based complexity issue in the coherently-excited superresolution. Thus, the proposed Sagnac superresolution can beat the state-of-the-art ring laser gyroscope applied for inertial navigation and geodesy.</description>

      <title>Quantum algorithms for simulating systems coupled to bosonic modes using a hybrid resonator-qubit quantum computer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11507v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modeling composite systems of spins or electrons coupled to bosonic modes is of significant interest for many fields of applied quantum physics and chemistry. A quantum simulation can allow for the solution of quantum problems beyond classical numerical methods. However, implementing this on existing noisy quantum computers can be challenging due to the mapping between qubits and bosonic degrees of freedom, often requiring a large number of qubits or deep quantum circuits. In this work, we discuss quantum algorithms to solve composite systems by augmenting conventional superconducting qubits with microwave resonators used as computational elements. This enables direct representation of bosonic modes by resonators. We derive efficient algorithms for typical models and propose a device connectivity that allows for feasible scaling of simulations with linear overhead. We also show how the dissipation of resonators can be a useful parameter for modeling continuous bosonic baths. Experimental results demonstrating these methods were obtained on the IQM Resonance cloud platform, based on high-fidelity gates and tunable couplers. These results present the first digital quantum simulation including a computational resonator on a commercial quantum platform.</description>

      <title>A non-relativistic theory of quantum mechanics with local modulus symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2008.07749v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have constructed a non-relativistic theory of quantum mechanics based on local modulus symmetry. The resulting connection in the covariant derivative is identified as the escape velocity of the gravitational field. A new real and positive function called the quantum metric function is attached to the complex conjugate of the wave function to satisfy the local modulus symmetry requirement. In an expanding universe, these theoretical features produce new effects that deviate from predictions of conventional quantum mechanics and Newtonian gravity. The quantum metric function yields negligible change for microscopic objects but produces quantum pointer states for macroscopic objects, thus providing a solution to the quantum measurement problem. The time-reversal symmetry is broken in the new quantum kinematics, which has implications for the second law of thermodynamics. The modification of Newtonian gravity is negligible in smaller bound systems but can become significant at the galactic scales. Its potential association with the mass discrepancy problem in the galactic systems is discussed.</description>

Abstract: Periodically driven (Floquet) systems can exhibit possibilities beyond what can be obtained in equilibrium. Both in Floquet systems and in the related problems of discrete-time quantum walks and quantum cellular automata, a basic distinction arises among unitary time evolution operators: while all physical operators are local, not all are locally generated (i.e., generated by some local Hamiltonian). In this paper, we define the notion of equivalence up to a locally generated unitary in all Altland-Zirnbauer symmetry classes. We then classify noninteracting unitaries in all dimensions on this basis by showing that equivalence up to a locally generated unitary is identical to homotopy equivalence.</description>

Abstract: Markov categories have recently emerged as a powerful high-level framework for probability theory and theoretical statistics. Here we study a quantum version of this concept, called involutive Markov categories. These are equivalent to Parzygnat's quantum Markov categories, but we argue that they offer a simpler and more practical approach. Our main examples of involutive Markov categories have pre-C*-algebras, including infinite-dimensional ones, as objects, together with completely positive unital maps as morphisms in the picture of interest. In this context, we prove a quantum de Finetti theorem for both the minimal and the maximal C*-tensor norms, and we develop a categorical description of such quantum de Finetti theorems which amounts to a universal property of state spaces.</description>

      <title>Hong-Ou-Mandel Comb and Switch using parallel chains of non-identical Micro-Ring Resonators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14491v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Micro-Ring Resonators (MRRs) allow us to access the Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) effect at a variety of tunable parameter combinations along exact analytic solutions. This higher-dimensional space of parameters for which the HOM effect occurs constitutes what is known as a Hong-Ou-Mandel manifold (HOMM). Using a parallel series of non-identical MRRs and changing relative round-trip phase shifts between MRRs allows for the manipulation of the wavelength locations of the HOM effect. Through clever design and fabrication, we can mold the HOMM to place multiple HOM effects, or lack thereof, precisely at desired locations in wavelength. In this paper we discuss how to adjust non-identical MRR parameters to change the resulting HOMM. We also promote example designs that exhibit advantageous HOMM structures, and highlight some of the diverse possibilities that can be accessed with different circuit design. Our main examples are: 1) a wavelength division multiplexer example that matches the HOM effect locations with the already established channels to integrate with a classical communication network and 2) a HOM-based entanglement switch that allows for the rapid switching between 2-photon NOON state outputs and completely separable single photon outputs.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Strongly-Interacting Regime of Effective Multi-Body Interactions in a Trapped Ultracold Atom System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16254v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A two-body interaction or force between quantum particles is ubiquitous in nature, and the microscopic description in terms of the bare two-body interaction is the basis for quantitatively describing interacting few- and many-body systems. Alternatively, the effective description in terms of an effective two-body interaction successfully captures the essence of the systems. However, for several important observations, the explanation in terms of an effective two-body interaction is not satisfactory, and the effective three-body interaction has played an essential role in understanding the systems. In this study, we investigate a few-body system comprising of ultracold bosons tightly confined in a deep optical lattice site, which is effectively described as zero-dimensional bosons. By combining an occupancy-resolving high-resolution laser spectroscopy with an inter-orbital Feshbach resonance controlling the bare two-body interaction over a wide range, we experimentally reveal the behaviors of few-atom systems in a strongly interacting regime. Our results, for which perturbative calculations do not provide proper explanations, serve as a valuable and precise benchmark for theoretical approaches to strongly interacting few-body systems. As one important illustration, we obtain a clear signature of an effective four-body interaction evidenced by the binding energies of four and more atoms. This work is an important step for our deeper understanding of strongly interacting few-body systems.</description>

      <title>Navigating the Quantum Divide(s)</title>

Abstract: This article explores the potential divides from emerging quantum technologies (QT) on society, covering impacts on science, technology, geopolitics, and societal structures. We aim to challenge the concept of a single "quantum divide" by offering a comprehensive view. We propose four divides: in science, technologies, between countries, and within societies. The "Quantum Divide in Science" highlights gaps among scientists and access inequalities in research communities. The second divide, "Quantum Divide in Technologies through Path-dependency," looks at technology adoption processes. The "Quantum Divide between Countries" examines adoption reasons and outcomes across countries with varying development levels. Lastly, the "Quantum Divide within Societies" addresses societal implications, one of the most discussed in literature. We propose directions to navigate these divides, noting their interconnectedness and impact on innovation ecosystems. This study guides those interested in the quantum divide, navigation strategies, and QT's influence on scientific, technological, international, and societal institutions.</description>

      <title>Global anomalies of Green's function zeros</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08093v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Anomaly analysis has been an important and powerful tool in studying nonperturbative physics for decades. The anomaly inflow mechanism provides an intuitive interpretation of the bulk-boundary correspondence in topological systems. In this work, we study global anomalies of nonlocal effective theories that supposedly describe symmetry-preserving Luttinger surfaces, i.e. the manifolds of fermionic Green's function zeros in the momentum space at zero energy. We view the nonlocal effective theories including the simplest Lagrangian and its two-pole variant associated with a gapless Dirac zero as a result of integrating out some low energy states. Assuming that the states integrated out do not make extra contributions to the anomaly, we discuss the global anomaly, the bulk-boundary correspondence, and the constraint on possible phases, such as non-Fermi liquids and emergent gapless quasiparticles on Luttinger surfaces. We also provide some perspectives on why the nonlocal fermionic effective theory studied by Golterman and Shamir (arXiv: 2311.12790) is not a suitable starting point for a symmetrically gapped phase.</description>

      <title>Performance of wave function and Green's functions based methods for non equilibrium many-body dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08814v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Theoretical descriptions of non equilibrium dynamics of quantum many-body systems essentially employ either (i) explicit treatments, relying on truncation of the expansion of the many-body wave function, (ii) compressed representations of the many-body wave function, or (iii) evolution of an effective (downfolded) representation through Green's functions. In this work, we select representative cases of each of the methods and address how these complementary approaches capture the dynamics driven by intense field perturbations to non equilibrium states. Under strong driving, the systems are characterized by strong entanglement of the single particle density matrix and natural populations approaching those of a strongly interacting equilibrium system. We generate a representative set of results that are numerically exact and form a basis for critical comparison of the distinct families of methods. We demonstrate that the compressed formulation based on similarity transformed Hamiltonians (coupled cluster approach) is practically exact in weak fields and, hence, weakly or moderately correlated systems. Coupled cluster, however, struggles for strong driving fields, under which the system exhibits strongly correlated behavior, as measured by the von Neumann entropy of the single particle density matrix. The dynamics predicted by Green's functions in the (widely popular) GW approximation are less accurate by improve significantly upon the mean-field results in the strongly driven regime.</description>

      <title>Experimental Demonstration of a Quantum-Optimal Coronagraph Using Spatial Mode Sorters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12776v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep sub-diffraction exoplanet discovery currently lies beyond the reach of state-of-the-art direct imaging coronagraphs, which typically have an inner working angle larger than the diffraction scale. We present an experimental demonstration of a direct imaging coronagraph design capable of achieving the quantum limits of exoplanet detection and localization below the Rayleigh diffraction limit. Our benchtop implementation performs a forward and inverse pass through a free-space programmable spatial mode sorter configured to isolate photons in a point spread function (PSF)-adapted mode basis. During the forward pass, the fundamental mode is rejected, effectively eliminating light from an on-axis point-like star. On the inverse pass, the remaining modes are coherently recombined to form an image of a faint companion. Our experimental system is shown localizing an artificial exoplanet at sub-diffraction distances from its host star under a 1000:1 star-planet contrast.</description>

      <title>Phases and dynamics of quantum droplets in the crossover to two-dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16383v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the ground states and dynamics of ultracold atomic droplets in the crossover region from three to two dimensions by solving the two-dimensional and the quasi two-dimensional extended Gross-Pitaevskii equations numerically and with a variational approach. By systematically comparing the droplet properties, we determine the validity regions of the pure two-dimensional description, and therefore the dominance of the logarithmic nonlinear coupling, as a function of the sign of the averaged mean-field interactions and the size of the transverse confinement. One of our main findings is that droplets become substantially extended upon transitioning from negative-to-positive averaged mean-field interactions. This is accompanied by a significant reduction of their binding energies which are approximately inversely proportional to the square of their size. To explore fundamental dynamical properties in the crossover region, we study interaction quenches and show that the droplets perform a periodic breathing motion for modest quench strengths, while larger quench amplitudes lead to continuous expansion exhibiting density ring structures. We also showcase that it is possible to form complex bulk and surface density patterns in anisotropic geometries following the quench. Since we are working with realistic parameters, our results can directly facilitate future experimental realizations.</description>

      <title>Ramsey-Borde atom interferometry with a thermal strontium beam for a compact optical clock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05581v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Compact optical atomic clocks have become increasingly important in field applications and clock networks. Systems based on Ramsey-Borde interferometry (RBI) with a thermal atomic beam seem promising to fill a technology gap in optical atomic clocks, as they offer higher stability than optical vapour cell clocks while being less complex than cold atomic clocks. Here, we demonstrate RBI with strontium atoms, utilizing the narrow 1S0 -&gt; 3P1 intercombination line at 689 nm, yielding a 60 kHz broad spectral feature. The obtained Ramsey fringes for varying laser power are analyzed and compared with a numerical model. The 1S0 -&gt; 1P1 transition at 461 nm is used for fluorescence detection. Analyzing the slope of the RBI signal and the fluorescence detection noise yields an estimated short-term stability of 4x10-14 / sqrt{tau}. We present our experimental setup in detail, including the atomic beam source, frequency-modulation spectroscopy to lock the 461 nm laser, laser power stabilization and the high-finesse cavity pre-stabilization of the 689 nm laser. Our system serves as a ground testbed for future clock systems in mobile and space applications.</description>

      <title>Dissipative dynamics of an open quantum battery in the BTZ spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09259v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider how charging performances of a quantum battery, modeled as a two-level system, are influenced by the presence of vacuum fluctuations of a quantum field satisfying the Dirichlet, transparent, and Neumann boundary conditions in the BTZ spacetime. The quantum battery is subjected to an external static driving which works as a charger. Meanwhile, the quantum field is assumed to be coupled to both longitudinal and transverse spin components of the quantum battery including decoherence and pure dephasing mechanisms. Charging and discharging dynamics of the quantum battery are derived by extending the previous open quantum system approach in the relativistic framework to this more general scenario including both the driving and multiple coupling. Analytic expressions for the time evolution of the energy stored are presented. We find that when the driving amplitude is stronger/weaker than the energy-level spacing of the quantum battery the pure dephasing dissipative coupling results in better/worse charging performances than the decoherence dissipative coupling case. We also find that higher Hawking temperature helps to improve the charging performance under certain conditions compared with the closed quantum buttery case, implying the feasibility of energy extraction from vacuum fluctuations in curved spacetime via dissipation in charging protocol. Different boundary conditions for quantum field may lead to different charging performance. Furthermore, we also address the charging stability by monitoring the energy behaviour after the charging protocol has been switched off. Our study presents a general framework to investigate relaxation effects in curved spacetime, and reveals how spacetime properties and field boundary condition affect the charging process, which in turn may shed light on the exploration of the spacetime properties and thermodynamics via the charging protocol.</description>

      <title>Cryptographic tests of the python's lunch conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10527v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the AdS/CFT correspondence, a subregion of the CFT allows for the recovery of a corresponding subregion of the bulk known as its entanglement wedge. In some cases, an entanglement wedge contains a locally but not globally minimal surface homologous to the CFT subregion, in which case it is said to contain a python's lunch. It has been proposed that python's lunch geometries should be modelled by tensor networks that feature projective operations where the wedge narrows. This model leads to the python's lunch (PL) conjecture, which asserts that reconstructing information from past the locally minimal surface is computationally difficult. In this work, we use cryptographic tools related to a primitive known as the Conditional Disclosure of Secrets (CDS) to develop consequences of the projective tensor network model that can be checked directly in AdS/CFT. We argue from the tensor network picture that the mutual information between appropriate CFT subregions is lower bounded linearly by an area difference associated with the geometry of the lunch. Recalling that the mutual information is also computed by bulk extremal surfaces, this gives a checkable geometrical consequence of the tensor network model. We prove weakened versions of this geometrical statement in asymptotically AdS$_{2+1}$ spacetimes satisfying the null energy condition, and confirm it in some example geometries, supporting the tensor network model and by proxy the PL conjecture.</description>

The particles under considerations, obeying a parastatistics, are mutually exchanged via the permutation group and can exist in any space dimension (the anyons, which transform under the more general braid group, cannot exist in more than two space dimensions).</description>

      <title>QG from SymQRG: AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ Correspondence as Topological Symmetry-Preserving Quantum RG Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12045v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By analyzing the non-perturbative RG flows that explicitly preserve given symmetries, we demonstrate that they can be expressed as quantum path integrals of the $\textit{SymTFT}$ in one higher dimension. When the symmetries involved include Virasoro defect lines, such as in the case of $T\bar{T}$ deformations, the RG flow corresponds to the 3D quantum gravitational path integral. For each 2D CFT, we identify a corresponding ground state of the SymTFT, from which the Wheeler-DeWitt equation naturally emerges as a non-perturbative constraint. These observations are summarized in the slogan: $\textbf{SymQRG = QG}$. The recently proposed exact discrete formulation of Liouville theory in [1] allows us to identify a universal SymQRG kernel, constructed from quantum $6j$ symbols associated with $U_q(SL(2,\mathbb{R}))$. This kernel is directly related to the quantum path integral of the Virasoro TQFT, and manifests itself as an exact and analytical 3D background-independent MERA-type holographic tensor network. Many aspects of the AdS/CFT correspondence, including the factorization puzzle, admit a natural interpretation within this framework. This provides the first evidence suggesting that there is a universal holographic principle encompassing AdS/CFT and topological holography. We propose that the non-perturbative AdS/CFT correspondence is a $\textit{maximal}$ form of topological holography.</description>

      <title>A Constructive Approach to Zauner's Conjecture via the Stark Conjectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03970v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a construction of $d^2$ complex equiangular lines in $\mathbb{C}^d$, also known as SICPOVMs, conjectured by Zauner to exist for all d. The construction gives a putatively complete list of SICs with Weyl-Heisenberg symmetry in all dimensions d &gt; 3. Specifically, we give an explicit expression for an object we call a ghost SIC, which is constructed from the real multiplication values of a special function and which is Galois conjugate to a SIC. The special function, the Shintani-Faddeev modular cocycle, is more precisely a tuple of meromorphic functions indexed by a congruence subgroup of ${\rm SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$. We prove our construction gives a valid SIC in every case assuming two conjectures: the order 1 abelian Stark conjecture for real quadratic fields and a special value identity for the Shintani-Faddeev modular cocycle. The former allows us to prove that the ghost and the SIC are Galois conjugate over an extension of $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{\Delta})$ where $\Delta = (d+1)(d-3)$, while the latter allows us to prove idempotency of the presumptive fiducial projector. We provide computational tests of our SIC construction by cross-validating it with known solutions, particularly the extensive work of Scott and Grassl, and by constructing four numerical examples of nonequivalent SICs in d=100, three of which are new. We further consider rank-r generalizations called r-SICs given by maximal equichordal configurations of r-dimensional complex subspaces. We give similar conditional constructions for r-SICs for all r, d such that r(d-r) divides $(d^2-1)$. Finally, we study the structure of the field extensions conjecturally generated by the r-SICs. If K is any real quadratic field, then either every abelian Galois extension of K, or else every abelian extension for which 2 is unramified, is generated by our construction; the former holds for a positive density of field discriminants.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Topological Non-Fermi Liquid Phases in a Modified Su-Schrieffer-Heeger Chain with Long-Range Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19023v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the emergence of a topological non-Fermi liquid (NFL) phase in a modified Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain model subjected to long-range interactions characterized by the Hatsugai-Kohmoto (HK) model. While Fermi liquid theory has been instrumental in understanding low temperature properties of metals, it fails to account for the complex behaviors exhibited by strongly correlated systems, where interactions lead to emergent phenomena such as non-Fermi liquid behavior. Our analysis reveals that the SSH-HK model supports a rich ground state phase diagram, exhibiting distinct NFL phases marked by many body Zak phases of $2\pi$ and $0$, corresponding to topological and trivial NFL states, respectively. We demonstrate that the topological NFL state manifests unique electronic polarization characteristics akin to those in the non-interacting SSH model. Through exact diagonalization of the interacting SSH-HK Hamiltonian, we explore the spectral functions and density of states, revealing significant departures from traditional quasiparticle behavior in various particle number sectors. Our findings extend the understanding of topological non-Fermi liquids and their potential implications for high-temperature superconductivity and other correlated electron systems, highlighting the intricate interplay between topology and strong electron correlations.</description>

      <title>$\mathbb{Z}_2$-gauging and self-dualities of the $XX$ model and its cousins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01831v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the one-dimensional $XX$ lattice model and its cousins through the lens of momentum and winding $U(1)$ symmetries. We distinguish two closely related $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetries based on their relation to the $U(1)$ symmetries, and establish a web of $\mathbb{Z}_2$-gauging relations among these models, rooted in two fundamental seeds: the $ XY \pm YX$ models. These two seeds, each self-dual under gauging of the respective $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetries, possess manifestly symmetric conserved charges, making transparent the connection between the noninvertible symmetries and the Kramers-Wannier duality. By leveraging the self-dualities of these two seed models, we derive the self-dualities of their cousins, including the $XX$ model and the Levin-Gu model, through appropriate gauging procedures. Moreover, under these gauging schemes, the lattice T-duality matrices take the form of the identity matrix. Finally, we unify the mapping structures of local conserved charges across these models, providing a comprehensive framework for understanding their symmetries and dualities.</description>

Abstract: The interplay of topology and disorder in quantum dynamics has recently attracted significant attention across diverse platforms, including solid-state devices, ultracold atoms, and photonic systems. Here, we report on a topological Anderson transition caused by quasiperiodic intra-cell coupling disorder in photonic Su-Schrieffer-Heeger lattices. As the quasiperiodic strength is varied, the system exhibits a reentrant transition from a trivial phase to a topological phase and back to a trivial phase, accompanied by the closing and reopening of the band gap around zero energy. Unlike the traditional detection of photonic topological edge modes, we measure the mean chiral displacement from the transport of light in the bulk of the lattices. In our photonic lattices with a fixed length, the propagation dynamics is retrieved by varying the wavelength of light, which tunes the inter-waveguide couplings.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning based discovery of Integrable Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10469v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel machine learning based framework for discovering integrable models. Our approach first employs a synchronized ensemble of neural networks to find high-precision numerical solution to the Yang-Baxter equation within a specified class. Then, using an auxiliary system of algebraic equations, [Q_2, Q_3] = 0, and the numerical value of the Hamiltonian obtained via deep learning as a seed, we reconstruct the entire Hamiltonian family, forming an algebraic variety. We illustrate our presentation with three- and four-dimensional spin chains of difference form with local interactions. Remarkably, all discovered Hamiltonian families form rational varieties.</description>
