      <title>Subgroups of braid groups generated by Birman-Ko-Lee generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define a Young subgroup of the braid group as a subgroup generated by an arbitrary subset of the Birman-Ko-Lee generators. We give an intrinsic description of such subgroups which yields, in particular, an easy criterion to decide membership. We also give an algorithm to write an element of a Young subgroup as a product of the generators. Our methods are based on analyzing the Hurwitz action on tuples over free groups via a diagrammatic approach.</description>

      <title>W*-superrigidity for groups with infinite center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct discrete groups $G$ with infinite center that are nevertheless W*-superrigid, meaning that the group von Neumann algebra $L(G)$ fully remembers the group $G$. We obtain these rigidity results both up to isomorphisms and up to virtual isomorphisms of the groups and their von Neumann algebras. Our methods combine rigidity results for the quotient of these groups by their center with rigidity results for their 2-cohomology.</description>

      <title>Stable functions and F{\o}lner's Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that if $G$ is amenable and $A\subseteq G$ has positive upper Banach density, then there is an identity neighborhood $B$ in the Bohr topology on $G$ that is almost contained in $AA^{-1}$ in the sense that $B\backslash AA^{-1}$ has upper Banach density $0$. This generalizes the abelian case (due to F{\o}lner) and the countable case (due to Beiglb\"{o}ck, Bergelson, and Fish). The proof is indirectly based on local stable group theory in continuous logic. The main ingredients are Grothendieck's double-limit characterization of relatively weakly compact sets in spaces of continuous functions, along with results of Ellis and Nerurkar on the topological dynamics of weakly almost periodic flows.</description>

      <title>Solubilizers in profinite groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02034v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The solubilizer of an element $x$ of a profinite group $G$ is the set of the elements $y$ of $G$ such that the subgroup of $G$ generated by $x$ and $y$ is prosoluble. We propose the following conjecture: the solubilizer of $x$ in $G$ has positive Haar measure if and only if $g$ centralizes "almost all" the non-abelian chief factors of $G$. We reduce the proof of this conjecture to another conjecture concerning finite almost simple groups: there exists a positive $c$ such that, for every finite simple group $S$ and every $(a,b)\in (Aut(S)\setminus \{1\}) \times Aut(S)$, the number of $s$ is $S$ such that $\langle a, bs\rangle $ is insoluble is at least $c|S|$. Work in progress by Fulman, Garzoni and Guralnick is leading to prove the conjecture when $S$ is a simple group of Lie type. In this paper we prove the conjecture for alternating groups.</description>

      <title>Units of twisted group rings and their correlations to classical group rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.17220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.17220v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is centered around the classical problem of extracting properties of a finite group $G$ from the ring isomorphism class of its integral group ring $\mathbb{Z} G$. This problem is considered via describing the unit group $\mathcal{U}( \mathbb{Z} G)$ generically for a finite group. Since the $`90s$ several well known generic constructions of units are known to generate a subgroup of finite index in $\mathcal{U}(\mathbb{Z } G)$ if $\mathbb{Q} G$ does not have so-called exceptional simple epimorphic images, e.g. $M_2 (\mathbb{Q})$. However it remained a major open problem to find a {\it generic} construction under the presence of the latter type of simple images. In this article we obtain such generic construction of units. Moreover, this new construction also exhibits new properties, such as providing generically free subgroups of large rank. As an application we answer positively for several classes of groups recent conjectures on the rank and the periodic elements of the abelianisation $\mathcal{U}(\mathbb{Z} G)^{ab}$. To obtain all this, we investigate the group ring $R \Gamma$ of an extension $\Gamma$ of some normal subgroup $N$ by a group $G$, over a domain $R$. More precisely, we obtain a direct sum decomposition of the (twisted) group algebra of $\Gamma$ over the fraction field $F$ of $R$ in terms of various twisted group rings of $G$ over finite extensions of $F$. Furthermore, concrete information on the kernel and cokernel of the associated projections is obtained. Along the way we also launch the investigations of the unit group of twisted group rings and of $\mathcal{U}( R\Gamma)$ via twisted group rings.</description>
