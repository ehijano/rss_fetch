      <title>Higher moments under dependence uncertainty with applications in insurance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have highlighted the significance of higher-order moments - such as coskewness - in portfolio optimization within the financial domain. This paper extends that focus to the field of actuarial science by examining the impact of these moments on key actuarial applications. In the first part, we derive analytical lower and upper bounds for mixed moments of the form $\mathbb{E}(X_1X_2^d)$, where $X_i \sim F_i$ for $i=1,2$, assuming known marginal distributions but unspecified dependence structure. The results are general and applicable to arbitrary marginals and positive integer orders $d$, and we also identify the dependence structures that attain these bounds. These findings are then applied to bound centered mixed moments and explore their mathematical properties.
  The second part of the paper investigates the influence of higher-order centered mixed moments on key actuarial quantities, including expected shortfall (ES), marginal expected shortfall (MES), and life annuity valuation. Under a copula-based mixture model, we show that coskewness and other odd-order mixed moments exhibit a monotonic relationship with both ES and annuity premiums. However, the effect on MES is more nuanced and may remain invariant depending on the underlying dependence structure.</description>

      <title>Combining a Large Pool of Forecasts of Value-at-Risk and Expected Shortfall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Value-at-risk (VaR) and expected shortfall (ES) have become widely used measures of risk for daily portfolio returns. As a result, many methods now exist for forecasting the VaR and ES. These include GARCH-based modelling, approaches involving quantile-based autoregressive models, and methods incorporating measures of realised volatility. When multiple forecasting methods are available, an alternative to method selection is forecast combination. In this paper, we consider the combination of a large pool of VaR and ES forecasts. As there have been few studies in this area, we implement a variety of new combining methods. In terms of simplistic methods, in addition to the simple average, the large pool of forecasts leads us to use the median and mode. As a complement to the previously proposed performance-based weighted combinations, we use regularised estimation to limit the risk of overfitting due to the large number of weights. By viewing the forecasts of VaR and ES from each method as the bounds of an interval forecast, we are able to apply interval forecast combining methods from the decision analysis literature. These include different forms of trimmed mean, and a probability averaging method that involves a mixture of the probability distributions inferred from the VaR and ES forecasts. Among other methods, we consider smooth transition between two combining methods. Using six stock indices and a pool of 90 individual forecasting methods, we obtained particularly strong results for a trimmed mean approach, the probability averaging method, and performance-based weighting combining.</description>

      <title>Empirical Analysis of the Model-Free Valuation Approach: Hedging Gaps, Conservatism, and Trading Opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the quality of model-free valuation approaches for financial derivatives by systematically evaluating the difference between model-free super-hedging strategies and the realized payoff of financial derivatives using historical option prices from several constituents of the S&amp;P 500 between 2018 and 2022.
  Our study allows in particular to describe the realized gap between payoff and model-free hedging strategy empirically so that we can quantify to which degree model-free approaches are overly conservative. Our results imply that the model-free hedging approach is only marginally more conservative than industry-standard models such as the Heston-model while being model-free at the same time.
  This finding, its statistical description and the model-independence of the hedging approach enable us to construct an explicit trading strategy which, as we demonstrate, can be profitably applied in financial markets, and additionally possesses the desirable feature with an explicit control of its downside risk due to its model-free construction preventing losses pathwise.</description>

      <title>Modeling the impact of Climate transition on real estate prices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02339v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a model to quantify the impact of the climate transition on a property in housing market. We begin by noting that property is an asset in an economy. That economy is organized in sectors, driven by its productivity which is a multidimensional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, while the climate transition is declined thanks to the carbon price, a continuous deterministic process. We then extend the sales comparison approach and the income approach to valuate an energy inefficient real estate asset. We obtain its value as the difference between the price of an equivalent efficient building following an exponential Ornstein-Uhlenbeck as well as the actualized renovation costs and the actualized sum of the future additional energy costs (before and after the renovation date). These costs are due to the inefficiency of the building, before an optimal renovation date which depends on the carbon price process. Moreover, since the renovation increases the efficiency of the building, which is random, the future additional energy costs become smaller and even zero if the optimal energy efficiency is reached. Finally, we carry out simulations based on the French economy and the house price index of France. The findings support the conclusion that the order of magnitude of the depreciation obtained by our model is the same as the empirical observations.</description>

      <title>Modeling Excess Mortality and Interest Rates using Mixed Fractional Brownian Motions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19445v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies have identified long-range dependence as a key feature in the dynamics of both mortality and interest rates. Building on this insight, we develop a novel bi-variate stochastic framework based on mixed fractional Brownian motions to jointly model their long-memory behavior and instantaneous correlation. Analytical solutions are derived under the risk-neutral measure for explicitly pricing zero-coupon bonds and extreme mortality bonds, while capturing the impact of persistent and correlated risk dynamics. We then propose a calibration procedure that sequentially estimates the model and risk premium parameters, including the Hurst parameters and the correlation parameter, using the most recent data on mortality rates, interest rates, and market conditions. Lastly, an extensive numerical analysis is conducted to examine how long-range dependence and mortality-interest correlation influence fair coupon rates, bond payouts and risk measures, providing practical implications for the pricing and risk management of mortality-linked securities in the post-pandemic environment.</description>
