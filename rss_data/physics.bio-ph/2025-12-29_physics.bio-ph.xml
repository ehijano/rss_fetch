      <title>Why orb-weaving spiders use leg crouching behavior in vibration sensing of prey on a web: A physical mechanism from robophysical modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orb-weaving spiders primarily sense leg vibrations to detect and locate prey caught on their wheel-shaped webs. Biological experiments and computational modeling elucidated the physics of how these spiders use long-timescale web-building behaviors, which occur before prey capture, to modulate vibration sensing of prey by controlling web geometry, materials, and tension distribution. By contrast, the physics of how spiders use short-timescale leg behaviors to modulate vibration sensing on a web during prey capture is less known. This is in part due to challenges in biological experiments (e.g., having little control over spider behavior, difficulty measuring the whole spider-web-prey system vibrations) and theoretical/computation modeling (e.g., close-form equations intractable for a complex web, high computation cost for simulating vibrations with behaving animals). Here, we use robophysical modeling as a complementary approach to address these challenges and study how dynamic leg crouching behavior common in orb-weaving spiders contributes to vibration sensing of prey on a web. We created a robophysical model consisting of a spider robot that can dynamically crouch its legs and sense its leg vibrations and a prey robot that can shake both on a horizontal physical wheel-shaped web. We discovered a physical mechanism that can allow the spider to use leg crouching to detect prey presence and distance. Our work demonstrated that robophysical modeling is a useful approach for discovering physical mechanisms of how spiders use short-time scale leg behaviors to enhance vibration sensing of objects on a web and providing new biological hypotheses.</description>

      <title>Necking of epithelial tissues with cellular topological transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the cover of embryos and adult organisms, epithelial tissues are subjected to substantial mechanical forces in tissue morphogenesis. However, the finite deformation behaviors of epithelial tissues remain largely unexplored. This study combines discrete vertex simulations with a multiscale constitutive model to investigate the necking behavior of epithelial tissues. In the multiscale model, the shape changes and topological transitions of single cells are mapped to the elastic and inelastic tissue deformations via a mean-field formulation. Our results show that the necking bifurcation of a stretched tissue arises from cellular topological transitions. The bifurcation condition and the steady state of necking propagation are predicted from the constitutive model and validated by vertex simulations. Furthermore, we find that topological defects in disordered tissues facilitate necking bifurcation but impede its propagation. These defects also induce the necked region to collapse into a thin thread, as observed in real tissues. Together, our work provides valuable insights into the deformation behaviors of epithelial tissues.</description>

      <title>Nascent biofilms on soft surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soft surfaces, spanning vastly different environmental and biomedical settings, are frequently colonised by surface-associated bacteria. Yet, how soft surfaces govern bacterial dynamics and their self-organisation into colonies remains poorly understood. Using experiments and agent-based modelling, we report the self-organisation of bacterial cells into nascent biofilms on soft substrates. By tuning the elastic modulus over two orders of magnitude, we show that the colony morphology, spreading dynamics and collective behaviour depend on the substrate stiffness, wherein softer surfaces promote slowly expanding, geometrically anisotropic, multilayered colonies, while harder substrates drive rapid, isotropic expansion of bacterial monolayers before multilayer structures emerge. Supported a cell mechanical model and two-dimensional agent-based simulations, our results identify that anisotropic drag forces on soft substrates, emerging due to local deformations, underpin colony anisotropy and swift verticalisation. In contrast, reduced drag on hard surfaces allows rapid expansion of monolayers, thus delaying the transition to a multilayer structure. Surface compliance, a key but overlooked determinant of early-stage biofilm development, could be harnessed to engineer biofilm structures and dynamics for nature-inspired and biomedical applications.</description>

      <title>Structure, biomineralization and biodegradation of Ca-Mg oxyfluorosilicates synthesized by inorganic salt coprecipitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this research, a novel group of Ca-Mg oxyfluorosilicates containing different levels of fluoride substituting for oxide was synthesized by an inorganic salt coprecipitation process followed by calcination/sintering. The effects of the incorporation of fluoride on the resultant structural characteristics, apatite-forming ability and biodegradability were evaluated by X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy/energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy and pH measurements. According to the results, the samples containing up to 2 mol% F present a single-phase structure of diopside (MgCaSi2O6) doped with F. It was also found that to meet the most biomineralization characteristic, the optimal value of fluoride in the homogeneous samples is 1 mol%. In this regard, on the one hand, the partial incorporation of fluoride into apatite (via forming fluorohydroxyapatite) and, on the other hand, the absence of fluorite (CaF2) as a consumer of Ca in the deposits are responsible for achieving the most apatite-forming ability circumstance controlled by an ion-exchange reaction mechanism. In conclusion, this study reflects the merit of the optimization of fluoride-doping into Ca-Mg silicates for development in biomedicine.</description>

      <title>Deep learning-enhanced dual-mode multiplexed optical sensor for point-of-care diagnostics of cardiovascular diseases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rapid and accessible cardiac biomarker testing is essential for the timely diagnosis and risk assessment of myocardial infarction (MI) and heart failure (HF), two interrelated conditions that frequently coexist and drive recurrent hospitalizations with high mortality. However, current laboratory and point-of-care testing systems are limited by long turnaround times, narrow dynamic ranges for the tested biomarkers, and single-analyte formats that fail to capture the complexity of cardiovascular disease. Here, we present a deep learning-enhanced dual-mode multiplexed vertical flow assay (xVFA) with a portable optical reader and a neural network-based quantification pipeline. This optical sensor integrates colorimetric and chemiluminescent detection within a single paper-based cartridge to complementarily cover a large dynamic range (spanning ~6 orders of magnitude) for both low- and high-abundance biomarkers, while maintaining quantitative accuracy. Using 50 uL of serum, the optical sensor simultaneously quantifies cardiac troponin I (cTnI), creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB), and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) within 23 min. The xVFA achieves sub-pg/mL sensitivity for cTnI and sub-ng/mL sensitivity for CK-MB and NT-proBNP, spanning the clinically relevant ranges for these biomarkers. Neural network models trained and blindly tested on 92 patient serum samples yielded a robust quantification performance (Pearson's r &gt; 0.96 vs. reference assays). By combining high sensitivity, multiplexing, and automation in a compact and cost-effective optical sensor format, the dual-mode xVFA enables rapid and quantitative cardiovascular diagnostics at the point of care.</description>

      <title>Genesis of a horizontal electric field within the lipid bilayer core and its role in channel gating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15637v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For more than seven decades, the electric field of biological membranes has been regarded as a one-dimensional quantity, defined solely by the component normal to the bilayer (E_VERT). Here, we challenge this conventional view by developing a device that generates a horizontal electric field within the hydrophobic core of a lipid bilayer (E_HORZ). The device incorporates micrometre-scale electrodes embedded within the bilayer's torus, enabling the steady generation of E_HORZ. Applied E_HORZ selectively and reversibly accelerates the slow inactivation of a voltage-gated potassium channel, while leaving activation essentially unchanged. Physical considerations reveal that E_HORZ naturally arises wherever membrane potential varies spatially, such as at the wavefront of an action potential, implying that it is inherent to many physiological processes. This E_HORZ system provides experimental access to fully three-dimensional membrane electric fields, revealing a previously overlooked dimension of membrane bioelectricity.</description>

      <title>Eliminating the irregular surface layer of anodically-grown Ni-Ti-O nanopore arrays in a two-stage anodization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17397v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nanopores (NPs) grown by anodizing can be partially hidden beneath a relatively compact surface oxide layer, which limits the volumetric surface area of these nanostructures. In this work, nitinol (NiTi) alloy was anodized in an electrolyte containing ethylene glycol, water, and sodium chloride in static and stirred electrolyte stages with the aim of removing the irregular surface array while achieving a thick NP layer. Electron micrographs showed that anodization in the static electrolyte provides a controlled thickness of NP layers covered by an irregular surface layer. In contrast, anodizing in the stirred electrolyte reduced the thickness and the degree of irregularity, which were controlled by the different kinetics of dissolution at the tops, perimeters and bottoms of NPs. To benefit simultaneously from the thickness and regularity of the oxide layers, two-stage anodizing under static and then stirred electrolyte conditions was found to be effective. Following a 30 min anodization in the static electrolyte, anodizing for 30 min under the stirred conditions provided the highest regularity in the oxide array, resulting in NPs of almost 40 nm and 11 {\mu}m in diameter and layer thickness, respectively. Two-stage anodizing under static then stirred electrolyte conditions is proposed in order to promote NP structures for applications demanding higher surface areas.</description>
