      <title>Nonlinear treatment of a black hole mimicker ringdown</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform the first nonlinear and self-consistent study of the merger and ringdown of a black hole mimicking object with stable light rings. To that end, we numerically solve the full Einstein-Klein-Gordon equations governing the head-on collisions of a series of binary boson stars in the large-mass-ratio regime resulting in spinning horizonless remnants with stable light rings. We broadly confirm the appearance of features in the extracted gravitational waveforms expected based on perturbative methods: the signal from the prompt response of the remnants approaches that of a Kerr black hole in the large-compactness limit, and the subsequent emissions contain periodically appearing bursts akin to so-called gravitational wave echoes. However, these bursts occur at high frequencies and are sourced by perturbations of the remnant's internal degrees of freedom. Furthermore, the emitted waveforms also contain a large-amplitude and long-lived component comparable in frequency to black hole quasi-normal modes. We further characterize the emissions, obtain basic scaling relations of relevant timescales, and compute the energy emitted in gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Photon traps in nonlinear electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the existence of photon traps within the framework of nonlinear electrodynamics. The trapping mechanism is based on the fact that, for null background fields, the optical metric reduces to the Kerr-Schild form, which plays a prominent role in the context of black hole physics. We then construct explicit examples where photons are confined in a region of spacetime, such that a distant observer cannot interact with them. Finally, we argue that the trapping scheme is quite universal, being entirely compatible with causality, energy conditions, and hyperbolicity.</description>

      <title>LIGO operates with quantum noise below the Standard Quantum Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precision measurements of space and time, like those made by the detectors of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO), are often confronted with fundamental limitations imposed by quantum mechanics. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle dictates that the position and momentum of an object cannot both be precisely measured, giving rise to an apparent limitation called the Standard Quantum Limit (SQL). Reducing quantum noise below the SQL in gravitational-wave detectors, where photons are used to continuously measure the positions of freely falling mirrors, has been an active area of research for decades. Here we show how the LIGO A+ upgrade reduced the detectors' quantum noise below the SQL by up to 3 dB while achieving a broadband sensitivity improvement, more than two decades after this possibility was first presented.</description>

      <title>On geodesics in spherical Rindler space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The geodesics in various spherical Rindler frames are investigated. A display of some kinematical quantities of the spacetime is given. The constant acceleration from the metric acts as the surface gravity of the horizon $r = 0$. The radial geodesics are computed both for the Balasubramanian et al. form of the spherical Rindler space and for the non-diagonal metric of Huang and Sun.</description>

      <title>Bring the Heat: Tidal Heating Constraints for Black Holes and Exotic Compact Objects from the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first constraints on tidal heating for the binary systems detected in the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) gravitational wave data. Tidal heating, also known as tidal dissipation, characterizes the viscous nature of an astrophysical body and provides a channel for exchanging energy and angular momentum with the tidal environment. Using the worldline effective field theory formalism, we introduce a physically motivated and easily interpretable parametrization of tidal heating valid for an arbitrary compact astrophysical object. We then derive the imprints of the spin-independent and linear-in-spin tidal heating effects of generic binary components on the waveform phases and amplitudes of quasi-circular orbits. Notably, the mass-weighted spin-independent tidal heating coefficient derived in this work, $\mathcal{H}_0$, is the dissipative analog of the tidal Love number. We constrain the tidal heating coefficients using the public LVK O1-O3 data. Our parameter estimation study includes two separate analyses: the first treats the catalog of binary events as binary black holes (BBH), while the second makes no assumption about the nature of the binary constituents and can therefore be interpreted as constraints for exotic compact objects. In the former case, we combine the posterior distributions of the individual BBH events and obtain a joint constraint of $-13 &lt; \mathcal{H}_0 &lt; 20$ at the $90\%$ credible interval for the BBH population. This translates into a bound on the fraction of the emitted gravitational wave energy lost due to tidal heating (or gained due to radiation enhancement effects) at $|\Delta E_H/\Delta E_{\infty}|\lesssim 3\cdot 10^{-3}$. Our work provides the first robust framework for deriving and measuring tidal heating effects in merging binary systems, demonstrating its potential as a powerful probe of the nature of binary constituents and tests of new physics.</description>

      <title>Tests of gravitational wave propagation with LIGO-Virgo catalog</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the framework of general relativity (GR), gravitational waves (GWs) are theorized to travel at the speed of light across all frequencies. However, Lorentz invariance (LI) violation and weak equivalence principle (WEP) violation may lead to frequency-dependent variations in the propagation speed of GWs, which can be examined by comparing the theoretical and observed discrepancies in the arrival times of GW signals at various frequencies. This provides us with an opportunity to test these theories. In theories involving LI violations, we focus on the massive gravity with the graviton mass $m_g$. In the case of WEP violation, different massless particles exposed to the same gravitational source should exhibit varying gravitational time delays. The gravitational time delay induced by massive gravitational sources is proportional to $\gamma+1$, where the parameter $\gamma=1$ in GR. Therefore, we can quantify these two violations using the graviton mass $m_g$ and $|\Delta \gamma|$, respectively. In this study, we use selected GW data from binary black hole coalescences in the LIGO-Virgo catalogs GWTC-2.1 and GWTC-3 to place constraints on the parameters $m_g$ and $|\Delta \gamma|$. Our most stringent constraints suggest that $m_g \lesssim 1.40\times10^{-26}eV/c^2$ at the upper limit of the 90% credible interval and $|\Delta \gamma| \lesssim 7.05 \times 10^{-16}$ at the 90% credible interval. We also compute Bayes factors for models that assume LI and WEP violations compared to the standard GW model, respectively. The absolute value of the natural logarithm of the Bayes factor is generally less than 2. Our analysis reveals no statistically significant preference for either model. Additionally, the Bayes factors between these two models do not provide obvious evidence in favor of either one.</description>

      <title>Causal dynamics of null horizons under linear perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the causal dynamics of an embedded null horizon foliated by marginally outer trapped surfaces (MOTS) for a locally rotationally symmetric background spacetime subjected to linear perturbations. We introduce a simple procedure which characterizes the transition of the causal character of the null horizon. We apply our characterization scheme to non-dissipative perturbations of the Schwarzschild and spatially homogeneous backgrounds. For the latter, a linear equation of state was imposed. Assuming a harmonic decomposition of the linearized field equations, we clarify the variables of a formal solution to the linearized system that determine how the null horizon evolves. For both classes of backgrounds, the shear and vorticity 2-vectors are essential to the characterization, and their roles are made precise. Finally, we discuss aspects of the relationship between the characterizing conditions. Various properties related to the self-adjointness of the MOTS stability operator are extensively discussed.</description>

      <title>Deflection of light by a compact object with electric charge and magnetic dipole in Einstein-Born-Infeld gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the bending of light around a compact astrophysical object with both the electric field and the magnetic field in Einstein-Born-Infeld theory. From the null geodesic of a light ray passing a massive object with electric charge and magnetic dipole, the effective metric was obtained from the light cone condition reflecting the nonlinear electromagnetic effects. We found the asymptotic form of the effective metric up to the first order in gravitational constant $G$ and Born-Infeld parameter $1/\beta^2$ on the equatorial plane. Then we compute the bending angle of light from the geodesic equation. The result includes particular cases where only one type of field is present taking the appropriate limits.</description>

      <title>The unstable null circular geodesic features the spherically symmetrical asymptotically flat black hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse the massless particles orbiting a spherically symmetric, asymptotically flat black hole with a radius equal to the photon sphere and a circular geodesic. Asymptotic observers record the orbital period of the null circular geodesic as the lowest among all possible paths around the compact object. We proceed with the analytical study of massless particle motion to demonstrate the instability of an orbit with null circularity. Furthermore, our results apply to any asymptotically flat and spherically symmetric spacetime.</description>

      <title>Observational Constraints on Asymptotic Safety Inflation in Gravity Rainbow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using suitable Renormalization Group (RG) based re-summation of quantum corrections to $R^2$ term, a re-summed version of the effective Lagrangian can be obtained \cite{Demmel:2015oqa}. In the context of gravity as an Asymptotically Safe (AS) theory, authors of Refs.\cite{Liu:2018hno,Koshelev:2022olc} proposed a refined Starobinsky model, $L_{\rm AS} = M^{2}_{p} R/2+(\alpha/2)R^{2}/[1+\beta \ln(R/\mu^{2})]$, where $R$ is the Ricci scalar, $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are constants and $\mu$ is an energy scale. In the present work, we embed this underlying effective Lagrangian within the framework of gravity's rainbow. By implementing the COBE normalization and the Planck constraint on the scalar spectrum, we demonstrate that the power spectrum of curvature perturbation relies on $\alpha$ and $\beta$, as well as on a rainbow parameter. Similarly, the scalar spectral index $n_s$ is influenced by $\beta$ and the rainbow parameter, yet remains unaffected by $\alpha$. Additionally, the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ solely depends on the rainbow parameter. Remarkably, when requiring $n_s$ to be consistent with the Planck collaboration at $1\sigma$ confidence level, the upper limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r &lt; 0.036$ can be naturally satisfied. This value potentially holds promise for potential measurement by Stage IV CMB ground experiments and is certainly within reach of future dedicated space missions.</description>

      <title>Regular black holes as an alternative to black bounce</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The so-called black bounce mechanism of singularity suppression, proposed by Simpson and Visser, consists in replacing the spherical radius $r$ in the metric tensor with $\sqrt{r^2 + a^2}$, $a = \rm const &gt;0$. This removes a singularity at $r=0$ and its neighborhood from space-time, and there emerges a regular minimum of the spherical radius that can be a wormhole throat or a regular bounce (if located inside a black hole). Instead, it is proposed here to make $r=0$ a regular center by proper (Bardeen type) replacements in the metric, preserving its form at large $r$. Such replacements are applied to a class of metrics satisfying the condition $R^t_t = R^r_r$ for their Ricci tensor, in particular, to the Schwarzschild, Reissner-Nordstr\"om and Einstein-Born-Infeld solutions. A new version of nonlinear electrodynamics (NED) is proposed, for which a black hole solution is similar to the Einstein-Born-Infeld one but is simpler expressed analytically. All new regular metrics can be presented as solutions to NED-Einstein equations with radial magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Nonsingular, lump-like, scalar compact objects in $(2+1)$-dimensional Einstein gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the space-time geometry generated by coupling a free scalar field with a non-canonical kinetic term to General Relativity in $(2+1)$ dimensions. After identifying a family of scalar Lagrangians that yield exact analytical solutions in static and circularly symmetric scenarios, we classify the various types of solutions and focus on a branch that yields asymptotically flat geometries. We show that the solutions within such a branch can be divided in two types, namely, naked singularities and nonsingular objects without a center. In the latter, the energy density is localized around a maximum and vanishes only at infinity and at an inner boundary. This boundary has vanishing curvatures and cannot be reached by any time-like or null geodesic in finite affine time. This allows us to consistently interpret such solutions as nonsingular, lump-like, static compact scalar objects, whose eventual extension to the $(3+1)$-dimensional context could provide structures of astrophysical interest.</description>

      <title>Discontinuities in the Evolution of Properties of Kerr Black Holes in the Extremal Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ever since its discovery by Roy Kerr in 1963, the geometry around rotating, electrostatically-neutral black holes, otherwise known as Kerr black holes, has significantly contributed to theoretical developments in the fields of general relativity, thermodynamics and beyond. Extremal Kerr black holes, in which the spin parameter of the rotating black hole is at a maximum without breaching certain postulates, has especially been of interest to the research community due to its sensitivity to higher order corrections to Einstein's theory of relativity. In this paper, we review some unresolved open questions regarding the discontinuity of certain properties of the Kerr black hole as it approaches the extreme limit. These include the form of the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO), the nature of vanishing entropy, and the disappearance of the trapped surface as a Kerr black hole approaches extremality. We conclude that current theories are likely not suitable for studies of extremal black holes, and we posit that further development in theory may likely require a quantum approach to gravity. G=c=1 and Einstein summation convention are assumed throughout this paper.</description>

      <title>Simulations of gravitational collapse in null coordinates: I. Formulation and weak-field tests in generalised Bondi gauges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a code for numerical simulations of the collapse of regular initial data to a black hole in null coordinates. We restrict to twist-free axisymmetry with scalar field matter. Our coordinates are $(u,x,y,\varphi)$, where the retarded time $u$ labels outgoing null cones emerging from a regular central worldline, the angles $(\theta,\varphi)$ label the null generators of each null cone, and the radial coordinate $x$ labels points along these generators. We focus on a class of generalised Bondi radial coordinates $x$ with the twin properties that $x=0$ is the central world line and that the numerical domain $(u\ge0$, $0\le x\le x_\text{max})$ is a subset of the domain of dependence of the initial data on $(u=0$, $0\le x\le x_\text{max}$). In critical collapse, an appropriate choice of these coordinates can be made to zoom in on the accumulation point of scale echos of the critical solution, without the need for explicit mesh refinement. We introduce a novel numerical scheme that in effect reduces the angular resolution at small radius, such that the time step $\Delta u$ for an explicit numerical scheme is limited by the radial resolution $\Delta x$, rather than $\Delta x(\Delta\theta)^2$. We present convergence tests in the weak-field regime, where we have exact solutions to the linearised scalar and gravitational-wave equations.</description>

      <title>Maximal hypersurfaces and aspects of volume of the Kerr family of black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Schwarzschild spacetime, Reinhart (1973) has shown the hypersurface $r_R = 3M/2$ (the subscript stands for "Reinhart") to be a maximal hypersurface. This Reinhart radius $r_R$ plays a crucial role in evaluating the interior volume of a black hole. In this article, we find such a maximal hypersurface for the Kerr and Kerr-Newaman black holes. We obtain the analytical expression for the Reinhart radius as a function of the polar angle $\theta$ for a small $a/M$ limit for both the Kerr and Kerr-Newman black holes. We obtain the Reinhart radius using two independent methods: a) the vanishing trace of the extrinsic curvature and, b) the variational method. We further use the Reinhart radius to obtain an analytical expression for the interior volume of the Kerr and Kerr-Newman black hole in the small $a/M$ limit and a generic charge $Q$. We define $\mathcal{\dot{V}}$ as the rate of change of the interior volume with respect to the ingoing null coordinate $v$ and then study its behavior under various scenarios, viz., particle accretion, the Penrose process, superradiance, and Hawking radiation. We show that while under the Penrose process and superradiance, the parameter $\mathcal{\dot{V}}$ increases just like the area of a black hole but under particle accretion, $\mathcal{\dot{V}}$ can have variable signs depending on the kinematical properties of the particle. We further probe into the behavior of $\mathcal{\dot{V}}$ under Hawking radiation. These results provide important and very interesting clues toward the possible existence of laws governing the volume of black holes.</description>

      <title>Review on the matching conditions for the tidal problem: towards the application to more general contexts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The tidal problem is used to obtain the tidal deformability (or Love number) of stars. The semi-analytical study is usually treated in perturbation theory as a first order perturbation problem over a spherically symmetric background configuration consisting of a stellar interior region matched across a boundary to a vacuum exterior region that models the tidal field. The field equations for the metric and matter perturbations at the interior and exterior regions are complemented with corresponding boundary conditions. The data of the two problems at the common boundary are related by the so called matching conditions. These conditions for the tidal problem are known in the contexts of perfect fluid stars and superfluid stars modelled by a two-fluid. Here we review the obtaining of the matching conditions for the tidal problem starting from a purely geometrical setting, and present them so that they can be readily applied to more general contexts, such as other types of matter fields, different multiple layers or phase transitions. As a guide on how to use the matching conditions, we recover the known results for perfect fluid and superfluid neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Does anti-Unruh effect assist quantum entanglement and coherence?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we use the concepts of quantum entanglement and coherence to analyze the Unruh and anti-Unruh effects based on the model of Unruh-DeWitt detector. For the first time, we find that (i) the Unruh effect reduces quantum entanglement but enhances quantum coherence; (ii) the anti-Unruh effect enhances quantum entanglement but reduces quantum coherence. This surprising result refutes the notion that the Unruh effect can only destroy quantum entanglement and coherence simultaneously, and that the anti-Unruh can only protect quantum resources. Consequently, it opens up a new source for discovering experimental evidence supporting the existence of the Unruh and anti-Unruh effects.</description>

      <title>Impact of Ricci Inverse Gravity on Hybrid Star Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The objective of our current study is to explore novel aspects of a stationary anisotropic relativistic hybrid compact star that consists of quark matter (QM) in its core and ordinary baryonic matter (OBM) in its crust. This study has been done by adopting separate equations of states (EoSs) for quark matter and baryonic matter. The MIT bag model equation of state $p_{q}=\frac{1}{3}(\rho_{q}-4B)$ has been used to demonstrate a correlation between the density and pressure of weird quark matter in the interior of the star. In addition, we present a simple linear equation of state $p_{r}=\beta_{1}\rho-\beta$ that links radial pressure and matter density for OBM. The stellar model was formulated within the context of $f(\mathcal{R},\mathcal{A})$ gravity, utilizing a linear correlation between Ricci tensor $\mathcal{R}$ and anticurvature scaler $\mathcal{A}$.To solve the field equations of this novel alternative gravity, we employ the Krori and Barua approach to the metric potentials. The validity of our suggested model is assessed using the graphical approach, while ensuring that the conditions are physically feasible. Our focus is specifically on the tiny celestial object known as LMC X-4 [$\text{M} = (1.04^{+0.09}_{-0.09})M_{\odot};\text{R}=8.301^{+0.2}_{-0.2}\text{km}$], which we consider a viable candidate for a strange quark star. We want to clarify the model's physical validity by examining a variety of physical assessments, including dynamical equilibrium, energy conditions, compactness factor, mass function, and surface redshift. The resulting outcome confirms the authenticity of the hybrid star model under analysis.</description>

      <title>Disentangling modified gravity from a dark force with gravitational redshift</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The standard approach to test for deviations from General Relativity on cosmological scales is to combine measurements of the growth rate of structure with gravitational lensing. In this study, we show that this method suffers from an important limitation with regard to these two probes: models of dark matter with additional interactions can lead to the very same observational signatures found in modified gravity (and viceversa). Using synthetic data of redshift-space distortions, weak lensing, and cosmic microwave background, we demonstrate that this degeneracy is inevitable between modifications of gravity and a dark fifth force. We then show that the coming generation of surveys, in particular the Square Kilometer Array, will allow us to break the degeneracy between such models through measurements of gravitational redshift. Performing a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis of the synthetic data set, we quantify the extent to which gravitational redshift can distinguish between two representative classes of models, Generalized Brans-Dicke (modified gravity) and Coupled Quintessence (fifth force).</description>

      <title>Optimally scrambling chiral spin-chain with effective black hole geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is currently significant interest in emulating the essential characteristics of black holes, such as their Hawking radiation or their optimal scrambling behavior, using condensed matter models. In this article, we investigate a chiral spin-chain, whose mean field theory effectively captures the behavior of Dirac fermions in the curved spacetime geometry of a black hole. We find that within the region of the chain that describe the interior of the black hole, strong correlations prevail giving rise to many-body chaotic dynamics. Employing out-of-time-order correlations as a diagnostic tool, we numerically compute the associated Lyapunov exponent. Intriguingly, we observe a linear increase in the Lyapunov exponent with temperature within the black hole's interior at low temperatures, indicative of optimal scrambling behavior. This contrasts with the quadratic temperature dependence exhibited by the spin-chain on the region outside the black hole. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the interplay between black hole geometry and quantum chaos, offering insights into fundamental aspects of quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Imprints of Supermassive Black Hole Evolution on the Spectral and Spatial Anisotropy of Nano-Hertz Stochastic Gravitational-Wave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The formation and evolution of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) remains an open question in the field of modern cosmology. The detection of nanohertz (n-Hz) gravitational waves via pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) in the form of individual events and the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) offers a promising avenue for studying SMBH formation across cosmic time, with SGWB signal being the immediately detectable signal with the currently accessible telescope sensitivities. By connecting the galaxy properties in the large scale (Gpc scale) cosmological simulation such as \texttt{MICECAT} with the small scale ($\sim$ Mpc scale) galaxy simulations from \texttt{ROMULUS}, we show that different scenarios of galaxy--SMBHs evolution with redshift leads to a frequency-dependent spatial anisotropy in the SGWB signal. The presence of slow evolution of the SMBHs in the Universe leads to a pronounced blue anisotropic spectrum of the SGWB. In contrast, if SMBHs grow faster in the Universe in lighter galaxies, the frequency-dependent spatial anisotropy exhibits a more flattened anisotropic spectrum. This additional aspect of the SGWB signal on top of the monopole SGWB signal, can give insight on how the SMBHs form in the high redshift Universe and its interplay with the galaxy formation from future measurements.</description>

      <title>Magnetic amplification in pre-merger neutron stars through resonance-induced magnetorotational instabilities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tidal resonances in the final seconds of a binary neutron-star inspiral can excite oscillation modes in one or both of the constituents to large amplitudes. Under favorable circumstances, resonant pulsations can overstrain the stellar crust and unleash a torrent of magnetoelastic energy that manifests as a gamma-ray `precursor flare'. We show that for realistic, stratified stars rotating with a spin frequency of $\gtrsim 30\,$Hz, the fundamental $g$-mode or its first overtone can also execute a differential rotation in the crust such that a magnetic field of strength $\gtrsim 10^{13}\,$G is generated via magnetorotational instabilities. This may help to explain observed precursor rates and their luminosities. Pre-merger magnetic growth would also provide seed magnetic energy for the post-merger remnant.</description>

      <title>VLBI with SKA: Possible Arrays and Astrometric Science</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The next generation of very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) is stepping into the era of microarcsecond ($\mu$as) astronomy, and pushing astronomy, especially astrometry, to new heights. VLBI with the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), SKA-VLBI, will increase current sensitivity by an order of magnitude, and reach astrometric precision routinely below 10 $\mu$as, even challenging 1 $\mu$as. This advancement allows precise parallax and proper motion measurements of various celestial objects. Such improvements can be used to study objects (including isolated objects, and binary or multiple systems) in different stellar stages (such as star formation, main-sequence stars, asymptotic giant branch stars, pulsars, black holes, white dwarfs, etc.), unveil the structure and evolution of complex systems (such as the Milky Way), benchmark the international celestial reference frame, and reveal cosmic expansion. Furthermore, the theory of general relativity can also be tested with SKA-VLBI using precise measurements of light deflection under the gravitational fields of different solar system objects and the perihelion precession of solar system objects.</description>

Abstract: The gravitational wave signals of black hole-neutron star (BHNS) binary systems have now been detected, and future detections might be accompanied by electromagnetic counterparts. BHNS mergers involve much of the same physics as binary neutron star mergers: strong gravity, nuclear density matter, neutrino radiation, and magnetic turbulence. They also share with binary neutron star systems the potential for bright electromagnetic signals, especially gamma ray bursts and kilonovae, and the potential to be significant sources of r-process elements. However, BHNS binaries are more asymmetric, and their mergers produce different amounts and arrangements of the various post-merger material components (e.g. disk and dynamical ejecta), together with a more massive black hole; these differences can have interesting consequences. In this chapter, we review the modeling of BHNS mergers and post-merger evolution in numerical relativistic hydrodynamics and magnetohydrodynamics. We attempt to give readers a broad understanding of the answers to the following questions. What are the main considerations that determine the merger outcome? What input physics must (or should) go into a BHNS simulation? What have the most advanced simulations to date learned?</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of defining an invariant notion of tension in gravity. For spacetimes whose asymptotics are those of a Defect CFT we propose two independent definitions : Gravitational tension given by the one-point function of the dilatation current, and inertial tension, or stiffness, given by the norm of the displacement operator. We show that both reduce to the tension of the Nambu-Goto action in the limit of classical thin probe branes. Subtle normalisations of the relevant Witten diagrams are fixed by the Weyl and diffeomorphism Ward identities of the boundary DCFT. The gravitational tension is not defined for domain walls, whereas stiffness is not defined for point particles. When they both exist these two tensions are in general different, but the examples of line and surface BPS defects in $d=4$ show that superconformal invariance can identify them.</description>

      <title>Three dimensional end-to-end simulation for kilonova emission from a black-hole neutron-star merger</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study long-term evolution of the matter ejected in a black-hole neutron-star (BH-NS) merger employing the results of a long-term numerical-relativity simulation and nucleosynthesis calculation, in which both dynamical and post-merger ejecta formation are consistently followed. In particular, we employ the results for the merger of a $1.35\,M_\odot$ NS and a $5.4\,M_\odot$ BH with the dimensionless spin of 0.75. We confirm the finding in the previous studies that thermal pressure induced by radioactive heating in the ejecta significantly modifies the morphology of the ejecta. We then compute the kilonova (KN) light curves employing the ejecta profile obtained by the long-term evolution. We find that our present BH-NS model results in a KN light curve that is fainter yet more enduring than that observed in AT2017gfo. This is due to the fact that the emission is primarily powered by the lanthanide-rich dynamical ejecta, in which a long photon diffusion time scale is realized by the large mass and high opacity. While the peak brightness of the KN emission in both the optical and near-infrared bands is fainter than or comparable to those of binary NS models, the time-scale maintaining the peak brightness is much longer in the near-infrared band for the BH-NS KN model. Our result indicates that a BH-NS merger with massive ejecta can observationally be identified by the bright and long lasting ($&gt;$two weeks) near-infrared emission.</description>

Abstract: We show that the simplest, and currently favoured, theoretical realizations of cosmic inflation yield a sharp prediction for the running of the spectral index $\alpha_\mathrm{S}$. Using latest cosmological data, we compute its marginalized posterior probability distribution over the space of nearly 300 models of single-field slow-roll inflation. The most probable value is $\alpha_\mathrm{S}=-6.3 \times 10^{-4}$, lying within the $98\%$ credible interval $-1.8 \times 10^{-3}&lt; \alpha_\mathrm{S}&lt; -9.1 \times 10^{-5}$. Within the landscape of all the proposed slow-roll inflationary models, positive values for the running are therefore disfavoured at more than three-sigma.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study systems in $2+1$ dimensions consisting of defects that source an electric charge, or a magnetic flux, of a $U(1)$ field, and we use holography to compute their effects on quantum conformal fields. We can also hide the defects inside the horizon of a black hole, where they continue to affect the quantum fields outside. By extending the solutions to braneworld holography, we find the non-linear backreaction of the quantum fields on the defect and black hole backgrounds. This gives quantum charged point particles and black holes. The charged quantum black holes markedly differ from classically charged BTZ black holes, since the quantum-induced electromagnetic field in $2+1$ dimensions has a better asymptotic behavior than its classical counterpart. The construction also gives a new class of (near-)extremal charged quantum black holes with AdS$_2$ throats.</description>

Abstract: We find the spatial and dynamic embedding diagrams in some stationary spacetimes. The spatial embeddings include the NUT, pure NUT and Kerr spacetimes. In the case of pure NUT spacetime, the spatial embedding equations are solved in terms of the elliptic integrals. In other cases we obtain the spatial embedding diagrams by numerical integration of the corresponding embedding equations. These embedding diagrams are then compared by calculating their Gaussian and mean curvatures. We also find the dynamic embedding diagrams of NUT and pure NUT spacetimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.10072v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is commonly accepted that superluminal travel may be used to facilitate time travel. This is a purely special-relativistic argument, using the fact that for observers in two frames of reference, separated by a spacelike interval, the non-causal (spacelike) future of one observer includes part of the causal past of the other. In this paper we provide a concrete realization of this argument in a curved general-relativistic spacetime, using warp drives as the means of faster-than-light travel. By generalizing the usual warp drive metric to allow for a non-unit lapse function, we allow the warp drive to switch between reference frames in a purely geometric way. With an additional modification allowing the warp drive to have compact support, this permits us to glue two warp drives together to construct a closed timelike geodesic, such that a test particle following the geodesics of the two warp drives travels back to its own past. This provides a precise mathematical model for the connection between faster-than-light travel and time travel in general relativity, and the first such model to be explicitly formulated using two warp drives. We also give a detailed discussion of weak energy condition violations in the non-unit-lapse warp drive.</description>

Abstract: General relativity (GR) admits two alternative formulations with the same dynamics attributing the gravitational phenomena to torsion or nonmetricity of the manifold's connection. They lead, respectively, to the teleparallel equivalent of general relativity (TEGR) and the symmetric teleparallel equivalent of general relativity (STEGR). In this work, we focus on STEGR and present its differences with the conventional, curvature-based GR. We exhibit the 3+1 decomposition of the STEGR Lagrangian in the coincident gauge and present the Hamiltonian, and the Hamiltonian and momenta constraints. For a particular case of spherical symmetry, we explicitly show the differences in the Hamiltonian between GR and STEGR, one of the few genuinely different features of both formulations of gravity, and the repercussions it might encompass to numerical relativity.</description>

      <title>Conformal diagrams for stationary and dynamical strong-field hyperboloidal slices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04972v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conformal Carter-Penrose diagrams are used for the visualization of hyperboloidal slices, which are smooth spacelike slices reaching null infinity. The focus is on the Schwarzschild black hole geometry in spherical symmetry, whose Penrose diagrams are introduced in a pedagogical way. The stationary regime involves time-independent slices. In this case, different options are given for integrating the height function -- the main ingredient for constructing hyperboloidal foliations. The dynamical regime considers slices changing in time, which are evolved together with the spacetime using the eikonal equation. It includes the relaxation of hyperboloidal Schwarzschild trumpet slices and the collapse of a massless scalar field into a black hole, for which Penrose diagrams are presented.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave fluxes on generic orbits in near-extreme Kerr spacetime: higher spin and large eccentricity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15295v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To obtain the waveform template of gravitational waves (GWs), substantial computational resources and exceedingly high precision are often required. In the previous study [JCAP 11 (2023) 070], we efficiently and accurately calculate GW fluxes of a particle in circular orbits around a Schwarzschild black hole using the confluent Heun function. We extend the previous method to calculate the asymptotic GW fluxes from a particle in generic orbits around a near-extreme Kerr black hole. Especially when dealing with the computational difficulties in large eccentricity $e=0.9$, higher spin $a=0.999$, higher harmonic modes, and strong-field regions, our results are much better than the results of the numerical integration method based on the Mano-Suzuki-Takasugi method.</description>

      <title>The Hawking temperature of dynamical black holes via conformal transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03655v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this second part of our two-series on extracting the Hawking temperature of dynamical black holes, we focus into spacetimes that are conformal transformations of static spacetimes. Our previous investigation builds upon the Unruh-Hawking analogy, which relates the spacetime of a uniformly accelerating observer to the near-horizon region of a black hole, to obtain the Hawking temperature. However, in this work, we explicitly compute the Bogoliubov coefficients associated with incoming and outgoing modes, which not only yields the temperature but also thermal spectrum of particles emitted by a black hole. For illustration, we take the simplest nontrivial example of the linear Vaidya spacetime, which is conformal to the static metric and using this property, we analytically solve the massless scalar field in its background. This allows the explicit computations of the Bogoliubov coefficients to study the particle production in this spacetime. We also derive an expression for the total mass of such dynamical spacetimes using the conformal Killing vector. We then perform differential variations of the mass formula to determine whether the laws of dynamical black hole mechanics correspond to the laws of thermodynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12368v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show by matching two flat spaces one in Minkowski coordinates ( empty space) and the other in Minkowski coordinates after a special conformal transformation (also empty space) through a bubble with positive and constant surface tension, that the motion of the bubble is hyperbolic. If the surface tension is very big the initial size of the bubble is as small as we wish, so that we can indeed obtain an infinite universe out of empty spaces. The induced space in the bubble is de Sitter type.</description>

      <title>Dynamical system analysis of DBI scalar field cosmology in coincident $f(Q)$ gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11300v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we offer the dynamical system analysis of the DBI (Dirac-Born-Infeld) scalar field in a modified $f(Q)$ gravity context. We have taken a polynomial form of modified gravity and used two different kinds of scalar potential, i.e., polynomial and exponential, and found a closed autonomous dynamical system of equations. We have analyzed the fixed points of such a system and commented on the conditions under which deceleration to late-time acceleration happens in this model. We have noted the similarity of the two models and have also shown that our result is indeed consistent with the previous work done on Einstein's gravity. We have also investigated the phenomenological implications of our models by plotting the EoS ($\omega$), Energy density ($\Omega$), and deceleration parameter ($q$) w.r.t. to e-fold time and comparing with the present value. Finally, we conclude the paper by observing how the dynamical system analysis differs in modified $f(Q)$ gravity, and we also provide some of the future scope of our work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05592v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study semi-classical particle production in non-singular bouncing cosmologies by employing the Unruh-DeWitt model of a particle detector propagating in this class of spacetimes. The scale factor for the bouncing cosmology is derived analytically and is inspired by the modified Friedmann equation employed in the loop quantum cosmology literature. We examine how the detector response varies with the free parameters in this model such as the equation of state during the contraction phase and the critical energy density during the bounce phase. We also investigate whether such a signature in the particle detector survives at late times.</description>

      <title>General Relativity from Intersection Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11913v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper combines the post-Minkowskian expansion of general relativity with the language of intersection theory. Due to the nature of the soft limit inherent to the post-Minkowskian expansion, the intersection-based approach is of enhanced utility in that theory compared to a generic QFT. In the language of intersection theory, Feynman integrals are rephrased in terms of twisted cocycles. The intersection number is a pairing between two such cocycles and its existence allows for the direct projection onto a basis of master integrals. In this paper we use this approach to compute the 2PM contribution to the scattering of two compact astronomical objects, getting results in agreement with previous findings.</description>

      <title>Scalar probes on wormholes in Lovelock theories with unique vacuum</title>

      <description>arXiv:1812.02089v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we present a new family of wormhole geometries in Lovelock theories with a unique vacuum, and study their stability under scalar field perturbations. As the solutions already known in the literature for Chern-Simons gravity on AdS, the new wormholes are characterized by a single integration constant $\rho_{0}$, that parameterizes the contribution to the mass coming from each boundary, which cancel each other, leading to a new example of "mass without mass". The stability of these new configurations, as well as other previously constructed in the literature is explored under scalar field perturbations. The stability is ensured provided the mass of the scalar perturbation is above a deformed Breitenlohner-Freedman bound which is sensitive to the value of $\rho_{0}$.</description>

      <title>A Parameter-Free Tour of the Binary Black Hole Population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.07289v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The continued operation of the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo gravitational-wave detectors is enabling the first detailed measurements of the mass, spin, and redshift distributions of the merging binary black hole population. Our present knowledge of these distributions, however, is based largely on strongly parameteric models; such models typically assume the distributions of binary parameters to be superpositions of power laws, peaks, dips, and breaks, and then measure the parameters governing these "building block" features. Although this approach has yielded great progress in initial characterization of the compact binary population, the strong assumptions entailed leave it often unclear which physical conclusions are driven by observation and which by the specific choice of model. In this paper, we instead model the merger rate of binary black holes as an unknown \textit{autoregressive process} over the space of binary parameters, allowing us to measure the distributions of binary black hole masses, redshifts, component spins, and effective spins with near-complete agnosticism. We find the primary mass spectrum of binary black holes to be doubly-peaked, with a fairly flat continuum that steepens at high masses. We identify signs of unexpected structure in the redshift distribution of binary black holes: a uniform-in-comoving volume merger rate at low redshift followed by a rise in the merger rate beyond redshift $z\approx 0.5$. Finally, we find that the distribution of black hole spin magnitudes is unimodal and concentrated at small but non-zero values, and that spin orientations span a wide range of spin-orbit misalignment angles but are also moderately unlikely to be truly isotropic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.08248v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine a specific category of eigenfunctions of the lattice Laplacian on $\{p,q\}$-tessellations of the Poincar\'e disk that bear resemblance to plane waves in the continuum case. Our investigation reveals that the lattice eigenmodes deviate from the continuum solutions by a factor that depends solely on the local inclination of the vertex in relation to the wave's propagation direction. This allows us to compute certain eigenfunctions by numerical and analytical methods. For various special cases we find explicit exact eigenfunctions and their eigenvalues on the infinite lattice.</description>

      <title>4D Weyl Anomaly and Diversity of the Interior Structure of Quantum Black Hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.08569v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the interior metric of 4D spherically symmetric static black holes by using the semi-classical Einstein equation and find a consistent class of geometries with large curvatures. We approximate the matter fields by conformal fields and consider the contribution of the 4D Weyl anomaly, giving a state-independent constraint. Combining this with an equation of state yields an equation that determines the interior geometry completely. We explore the solution space of the equation in a non-perturbative manner for $\hbar$. First, we find four types of asymptotic behaviors and examine the general features of the solutions. Then, by imposing physical conditions, we obtain approximately a general class of interior geometries: various combinations of dilute and dense structures without a horizon or singularity. This represents the diversity of the interior structure. Finally, we show that the number of possible patterns of such interior geometries corresponds to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.12755v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The past 10 years have seen tremendous progress in our capability of testing General Relativity in the strong field regime with black hole observations. 10 years ago, the theory of General Relativity was almost completely unexplored in the strong field regime. Today, we have gravitational wave data of the coalescence of stellar-mass black holes, radio images of the supermassive black holes SgrA$^*$ and M87$^*$, and high-quality X-ray data of stellar-mass black holes in X-ray binaries and supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei. In this manuscript, we will review current efforts to test General Relativity with black hole X-ray data and we will provide a detailed description of the public codes available on ABHModels.</description>

      <title>Semi-Riemannian manifolds with linear differential conditions on the curvature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.15436v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semi-Riemannian manifolds that satisfy (homogeneous) linear differential conditions of arbitrary order on the curvature are analyzed. They include, in particular, the spaces with (higher-order) recurrent curvature, (higher-order) symmetric spaces, as well as entire new families of semi-Riemannian manifolds rarely, or never, considered before in the literature --such as the spaces whose derivative of the Riemann tensor field is recurrent, among many others. Definite proof that all types of such spaces do exist is provided by exhibiting explicit examples of all possibilities in all signatures, except in the Riemannian case with a positive definite metric. Several techniques of independent interest are collected and presented. Of special relevance is the case of Lorentzian manifolds, due to its connection to the physics of the gravitational field. This connection is discussed with particular emphasis on Gauss-Bonnet gravity and in relation with Penrose limits. Many new lines of research open up and a handful of conjectures, based on the results found hitherto, is put forward.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.13503v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a dually-weighted multi-matrix model that for a suitable choice of weights reproduce two-dimensional Causal Dynamical Triangulations (CDT) coupled to the Ising model. When Ising degrees of freedom are removed, this model corresponds to the CDT-matrix model introduced by Benedetti and Henson [Phys. Lett. B 678, 222 (2009)]. We present exact as well as approximate results for the Gaussian averages of characters of a Hermitian matrix $A$ and $A^2$ for a given representation and establish the present limitations that prevent us to solve the model analytically. This sets the stage for the formulation of more sophisticated matter models coupled to two-dimensional CDT as dually weighted multi-matrix models providing a complementary view to the standard simplicial formulation of CDT-matter models.</description>

      <title>Iyer-Wald ambiguities and gauge covariance of Entropy current in Higher derivative theories of gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04749v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In [arXiv:2105.06455, arXiv:2206.04538], the authors have been able to argue for an ultra-local version of the second law of black hole mechanics, for arbitrary diffeomorphism invariant theories of gravity non-minimally coupled to matter fields, by constructing an entropy current on the dynamical horizon with manifestly positive divergence. This has been achieved by working in the horizon-adapted coordinate system. In this work, we show that the local entropy production through the divergence of the entropy current is covariant under affine reparametrizations that leave the gauge of horizon-adapted coordinates invariant. We explicitly derive a formula for how the entropy current transforms under such coordinate transformations. This extends the analysis of [arXiv:2204.08447] for arbitrary diffeomorphism invariant theories of gravity non-minimally coupled to matter fields. We also study the Iyer-Wald ambiguities of the covariant phase formalism that generically plague the components of the entropy current.</description>

Abstract: We give a full classification of general affine connections on Galilei manifolds in terms of independently specifiable tensor fields. This generalises the well-known case of (torsional) Galilei connections, i.e. connections compatible with the metric structure of the Galilei manifold. Similarly to the well-known pseudo-Riemannian case, the additional freedom for connections that are not metric-compatible lies in the covariant derivatives of the two tensors defining the metric structure (the clock form and the space metric), which however are not fully independent of each other.</description>
