      <title>Non-Hermitian delocalization in 1D via emergent compactness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Potential disorder in 1D leads to Anderson localization of the entire spectrum. Upon sacrificing hermiticity by adding non-reciprocal hopping, the non-Hermitian skin effect competes with localization. We find another route for delocalization, which involves imaginary potential disorder. While an entirely random potential generally still leads to localization, imposing minimal spatial structure to the disorder can protect delocalization: it endows the concomitant transfer matrix with an SU(2) structure, whose compactness in turn translates into an infinite localization length. The fraction of delocalized states can be tuned by the choice of boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Discover Physical Concepts and Equations with Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning can uncover physical concepts or physical equations when prior knowledge from another one is available. However, in many cases, these two aspects are coupled and cannot be discovered independently. We extend SciNet, which is a neural network architecture that simulates the human physical reasoning process for physics discovery, by proposing a model that combines Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) with Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs). This allows us to simultaneously discover physical concepts and governing equations from simulated experimental data across diverse physical systems. We apply the model to several key examples inspired by the history of physics, including Copernicus' heliocentric solar system, Newton's law of universal gravitation, the wave function together with the Schr\"odinger equation, and spin-1/2 along with the Pauli equation. The results demonstrate that the neural network successfully reconstructs the corresponding theories.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed Transformers for Electronic Quantum States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural-network-based variational quantum states in general, and more recently autoregressive models in particular, have proven to be powerful tools to describe complex many-body wave functions. However, their performance crucially depends on the computational basis chosen and they often lack physical interpretability. To mitigate these issues, we here propose a modified variational Monte-Carlo framework which leverages prior physical information to construct a computational second-quantized basis containing a reference state that serves as a rough approximation to the true ground state. In this basis, a Transformer is used to parametrize and autoregressively sample the corrections to the reference state, giving rise to a more interpretable and computationally efficient representation of the ground state. We demonstrate this approach using a non-sparse fermionic model featuring a metal-insulator transition and employing Hartree-Fock and a strong-coupling limit to define physics-informed bases. We also show that the Transformer's hidden representation captures the natural energetic order of the different basis states. This work paves the way for more efficient and interpretable neural quantum-state representations.</description>

      <title>Coherent information as a mixed-state topological order parameter of fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum error correction protects quantum information against decoherence provided the noise strength remains below a critical threshold. This threshold marks the critical point for the decoding phase transition. Here we connect this transition in the toric code to a topological phase transition in disordered Majorana fermions at high temperatures. A quantum memory in the error correctable phase is captured by the presence of a Majorana zero mode, trapped in vortex defects associated with twisted boundary conditions. These results are established by expressing the coherent information, which measures the amount of recoverable quantum information in a given noisy code, in terms of a mixed-state topological order parameter of fermions. Our work hints at a broader connection of the robustness of quantum information in stabilizer codes and mixed-state topological phase transitions in symmetry protected fermion matter.</description>

      <title>Universal mesoscale heterogeneity and its spatial correlations in equilibrium amorphous solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Candidates for random network media include, e.g., systems consisting of long, flexible macromolecules cross-linked (i.e., permanently bonded) together at random to form the network. Owing to the random architecture, the characteristics of the thermal motion of the elements of these media vary randomly from point to point, provided the medium has been cross-linked sufficiently to exhibit the equilibrium amorphous solid state. A particular replica field theory has long been known to capture the essential physics of amorphous solids and the transition to them. Encoded in the mean value of the field associated with this theory--i.e., the transition's order parameter--is statistical information about the thermal motions of the constituents: (i) the fraction of localized constituents, and (ii) the heterogeneity of the strength of this localization. Encoded in the field's correlations is more refined information about the motions, e.g.: (i) how the localization characteristics of pairs of localized constituents are correlated, (ii) how the correlations between the position fluctuations of the pair are distributed, and (iii) how these descriptors vary with pair separation. This information about amorphous solids is referred to as mesoscale heterogeneity. Increasingly accurate approximations to the order parameter and field correlations are examined, beginning with mean-field theory, moving up to the incorporation of gapless (i.e., elastic-displacement) fluctuations, and finally via the qualitative examination of how the gapped branches of fluctuations would further improve accuracy. Hence, an increasingly accurate set of distributions is obtained, which characterize the mesoscale heterogeneity of amorphous solids. Along the way, attention is paid to the induced measure arising from the transformation from the fluctuating order-parameter field to the fluctuating elastic displacement fields.</description>

      <title>Strong and weak symmetries and their spontaneous symmetry breaking in mixed states emerging from the quantum Ising model under multiple decoherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discovering and categorizing quantum orders in mixed many-body systems are currently one of the most important problems. Specific types of decoherence applied to typical quantum many-body states can induce a novel kind of mixed state accompanying characteristic symmetry orders, which has no counterparts in pure many-body states. We study phenomena generated by interplay between two types of decoherence applied to the one-dimensional transverse field Ising model (TFIM). We show that in the doubled Hilbert space formalism, the decoherence can be described by filtering operation applied to matrix product states (MPS) defined in the doubled Hilbert system. The filtering operation induces specific deformation of the MPS, which approximates the ground state of a certain parent Hamiltonian in the doubled Hilbert space. In the present case, such a parent Hamiltonian is the quantum Ashkin-Teller model, having a rich phase diagram with a critical lines and quantum phase transitions. By investigating the deformed MPS, we find various types of mixed states emergent from the ground states of the TFIM, and clarify phase transitions between them. In that study, strong and weak $Z_2$ symmetries play an important role, for which we introduce efficient order parameters, such as R\'{e}nyi-2 correlators, entanglement entropy, etc., in the doubled Hilbert space.</description>

      <title>Quantum community detection via deterministic elimination</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a quantum algorithm for calculating the structural properties of complex networks and graphs. The corresponding protocol -- deteQt -- is designed to perform large-scale community and botnet detection, where a specific subgraph of a larger graph is identified based on its properties. We construct a workflow relying on ground state preparation of the network modularity matrix or graph Laplacian. The corresponding maximum modularity vector is encoded into a $\log(N)$-qubit register that contains community information. We develop a strategy for ``signing'' this vector via quantum signal processing, such that it closely resembles a hypergraph state, and project it onto a suitable linear combination of such states to detect botnets. As part of the workflow, and of potential independent interest, we present a readout technique that allows filtering out the incorrect solutions deterministically. This can reduce the scaling for the number of samples from exponential to polynomial. The approach serves as a building block for graph analysis with quantum speed up and enables the cybersecurity of large-scale networks.</description>

Abstract: We numerically study quantum avalanches in one-dimensional disordered spin systems by attaching two XXZ spin chains. One chain has low disorder representing a rare Griffith's region, or thermal inclusion, and the second has larger disorder, i.e., disorder larger than the observed finite-size crossover. Comparing dynamics of this system to identical systems with uniformly large disorder, we find evidence for exponentially slow thermalization (in disorder) within the many-body localized regime when the rare region is present. We observe a decay of the spin imbalance in the bulk of the large disorder region that persists to long times ($\sim10^{4}$) and find a universal behavior of the spectral function.</description>

      <title>Fine-tuning Neural Network Quantum States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07795v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent progress in the design and optimization of neural-network quantum states (NQSs) has made them an effective method to investigate ground-state properties of quantum many-body systems. In contrast to the standard approach of training a separate NQS from scratch at every point of the phase diagram, we demonstrate that the optimization of a NQS at a highly expressive point of the phase diagram (i.e., close to a phase transition) yields features that can be reused to accurately describe a wide region across the transition. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach on different systems in one and two dimensions by initially pretraining a NQS at a given point of the phase diagram, followed by fine-tuning only the output layer for all other points. Notably, the computational cost of the fine-tuning step is very low compared to the pretraining stage. We argue that the reduced cost of this paradigm has significant potential to advance the exploration of strongly-correlated systems using NQS, mirroring the success of fine-tuning in machine learning and natural language processing.</description>

      <title>Local and energy-resolved topological invariants for Floquet systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08548v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Periodically driven systems offer a perfect breeding ground for out-of-equilibrium engineering of topological boundary states at zero energy ($0$-mode), as well as finite energy ($\pi$-mode), with the latter having no static analog. The Floquet operator and the effective Floquet Hamiltonian, which encapsulate the stroboscopic features of the driven system, capture both spectral and localization properties of the $0$- and $\pi$-modes but sometimes fail to provide complete topological characterization, especially when $0$- and $\pi$-modes coexist. In this work, we utilize the spectral localizer, a powerful local probe that can provide numerically efficient, spatially local, and energy-resolved topological characterization. In particular, we apply the spectral localizer to the effective Floquet Hamiltonian for driven one- and two-dimensional topological systems with no or limited symmetries and are able to assign topological invariants, or local markers, that characterize the $0$- and the $\pi$-boundary modes individually and unambiguously. Due to the spatial resolution, we also demonstrate that the extracted topological invariants are suitable for studying driven disordered systems and can even capture disorder-induced phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Full distribution of the ground-state energy of potentials with weak disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06431v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the full distribution $P(E)$ of the ground-state energy of a single quantum particle in a potential $V(\boldsymbol{x}) = V_0(\boldsymbol{x}) + \sqrt{\epsilon} \, v_1(\boldsymbol{x})$, where $V_0(\boldsymbol{x})$ is a deterministic ``background'' trapping potential and $v_1(\boldsymbol{x})$ is the disorder. We consider arbitrary trapping potentials $V_0(\boldsymbol{x})$ and white-noise disorder $v_1(\boldsymbol{x})$, in arbitrary spatial dimension $d$. In the weak-disorder limit $\epsilon \to 0$, we find that $P(E)$ scales as $P(E) \sim e^{-s(E)/\epsilon}$. The large-deviation function $s(E)$ is obtained by calculating the most likely configuration of $V(\boldsymbol{x})$ conditioned on a given ground-state energy $E$. For infinite systems, we obtain $s(E)$ analytically in the limits $E \to \pm \infty$ and $E \simeq E_0$ where $E_0$ is the ground-state energy in the absence of disorder. We perform explicit calculations for the case of a harmonic trap $V_0(\boldsymbol{x}) \propto x^2$ in dimensions $d\in\left\{ 1,2,3\right\}$. Next, we calculate $s(E)$ exactly for a finite, periodic one-dimensional system with a homogeneous background $V_0(x)=0$. We find that, remarkably, the system exhibits a sudden change of behavior as $E$ crosses a critical value $E_c &lt; 0$: At $E&gt;E_c$, the most likely configuration of $V(x)$ is homogeneous, whereas at $E &lt; E_c$ it is inhomogeneous, thus spontaneously breaking the translational symmetry of the problem. As a result, $s(E)$ is nonanalytic: Its second derivative jumps at $E=E_c$. We interpret this singularity as a second-order dynamical phase transition.</description>
