      <title>Asymptotic perpendicular transport in low-beta collisionless plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kinetic physics, including finite Larmor radius (FLR) effects, are known to affect the physics of magnetized plasma phenomena such as the Kelvin-Helmholtz and Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities. Accurately incorporating FLR effects into fluid simulations requires moment closures for the heat flux and stress tensor, including the gyroviscous stress in collisionless magnetized plasmas. However, the most commonly used gyroviscous stress tensor closure (Braginskii Rev. Plasma Phys., 1965) is based on a strongly collisional assumption for the asymptotic expansion of the kinetic equation in the so-called fast-dynamics ordering. This collisional assumption becomes less valid for some high-temperature plasmas. To explore perpendicular transport in collisionless and weakly collisional plasmas, an asymptotic analysis of the weakly collisional Vlasov equation in the slow-dynamics or drift ordering is performed in a new "semi-fluid" formalism, which integrates in perpendicular velocity to obtain a five-moment system. The associated heat flux and stress tensor closures are determined via a Hilbert expansion of the kinetic equation. A numerically affordable approximation to the stress tensor is proposed which adjusts the Braginskii closure to account for temperature gradient-driven stress. Continuum kinetic simulations of a family of sheared-flow configurations with variable magnetization and temperature gradients are performed to validate the drift ordering semi-fluid expansion. The expected convergence with magnetization is observed, and residuals are examined and discussed in terms of their relationship to higher-order terms in the expansion. The adjusted Braginskii closure is found to accurately correct for the error committed by the Braginskii gyroviscous stress tensor closure in the presence of temperature gradients.</description>

      <title>A Neural-Network-Based Mapping and Optimization Framework for High-Precision Coarse-Grained Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accuracy and efficiency of a coarse-grained (CG) force field are pivotal for high-precision molecular simulations of large systems with complex molecules. We present an automated mapping and optimization framework for molecular simulation (AMOFMS), which is designed to streamline and improve the force field optimization process. It features a neural-network-based mapping function, DSGPM-TP (Deep Supervised Graph Partitioning Model with Type Prediction). This model can accurately and efficiently convert atomistic structures to CG mappings, reducing the need for manual intervention. By integrating bottom-up and top-down methodologies, AMOFMS allows users to freely combine these approaches or use them independently as optimization targets. Moreover, users can select and combine different optimizers to meet their specific mission. With its parallel optimizer, AMOFMS significantly accelerates the optimization process, reducing the time required to achieve optimal results. Successful applications of AMOFMS include parameter optimizations for systems such as POPC and PEO, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness. Overall, AMOFMS provides a general and flexible framework for the automated development of high-precision CG force fields.</description>

      <title>Advancing Nonadiabatic Molecular Dynamics Simulations for Solids: Achieving Supreme Accuracy and Efficiency with Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-adiabatic molecular dynamics (NAMD) simulations have become an indispensable tool for investigating excited-state dynamics in solids. In this work, we propose a general framework, N$^2$AMD which employs an E(3)-equivariant deep neural Hamiltonian to boost the accuracy and efficiency of NAMD simulations. The preservation of Euclidean symmetry of Hamiltonian enables N$^2$AMD to achieve state-of-the-art performance. Distinct from conventional machine learning methods that predict key quantities in NAMD, N$^2$AMD computes these quantities directly with a deep neural Hamiltonian, ensuring supreme accuracy, efficiency, and consistency. Furthermore, N$^2$AMD demonstrates excellent generalizability and enables seamless integration with advanced NAMD techniques and infrastructures. Taking several extensively investigated semiconductors as the prototypical system, we successfully simulate carrier recombination in both pristine and defective systems at large scales where conventional NAMD often significantly underestimates or even qualitatively incorrectly predicts lifetimes. This framework not only boosts the efficiency and precision of NAMD simulations but also opens new avenues to advance materials research.</description>

      <title>Multi-soliton solutions and data-driven discovery of higher-order Burgers' hierarchy equations with physics informed neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Burgers hierarchy consists of nonlinear evolutionary PDEs with increasingly higher-order dispersive and nonlinear terms, resulting in a rich variety of soliton solutions. Notable members include the Burgers equation and the Sharma-Tasso-Olver equation, which are applied in plasma physics, fluid mechanics, optics, and biophysics to describe nonlinear waves in inhomogeneous media. Various soliton and multi-soliton solutions have been identified, and the fission and fusion of solitons have been explored through analytical and numerical techniques. Recently, deep learning methods, particularly Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), have emerged as powerful tools for solving PDEs. These methods use deep neural networks to minimize PDE residuals and satisfy boundary and initial conditions while fitting relevant data. Although PINNs have been applied to equations like Burgers' and Korteweg-de Vries, higher-order members of the Burgers hierarchy remain unexplored. In this study, we employ a PINN algorithm to approximate multi-soliton solutions of linear combinations of equations within the Burgers hierarchy. This semi-supervised approach encodes the PDE and relevant data, determining PDE parameters and resolving the linear combination to discover the PDE that best describes the data. Additionally, we employ gradient-enhanced PINNs (gPINNs) and a conservation law specific to the generic Burgers' hierarchy to improve training accuracy. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of PINNs in describing multi-soliton solutions within the generic Burgers' hierarchy. They also verify the potential for training refinement and accuracy improvement using enhanced approaches in certain cases, while enabling the inference of the PDE model that best describes the observed solitary structures.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the Non-variational Quantum Walk-based Optimisation Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces in detail a non-variational quantum algorithm designed to solve a wide range of combinatorial optimisation problems, including constrained problems and problems with non-binary variables. The algorithm returns optimal and near-optimal solutions from repeated preparation and measurement of an amplified state. The amplified state is prepared via repeated application of two unitaries; one which phase-shifts solution states dependent on objective function values, and the other which mixes phase-shifted probability amplitudes via a continuous-time quantum walk (CTQW) on a problem-specific mixing graph. The general interference process responsible for amplifying optimal solutions is derived in part from statistical analysis of objective function values as distributed over the mixing graph. The algorithm's versatility is demonstrated through its application to various problems: weighted maxcut, k-means clustering, quadratic assignment, maximum independent set and capacitated facility location. In all cases, efficient circuit implementations of the CTQWs are discussed. A penalty function approach for constrained problems is also introduced, including a method for optimising the penalty function. For each of the considered problems, the algorithm's performance is simulated for a randomly generated problem instance, and in each case, the amplified state produces a globally optimal solution within a small number of iterations.</description>

      <title>Photo-induced charge, spin, and orbital order in the two-orbital extended Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonequilibrium control of electronically ordered hidden phases may lead to the development of ultrafast switches and memory devices. In this study, we demonstrate tunable hidden orders in the photo-doped two-orbital extended Hubbard model. Using steady-state nonequilibrium dynamical mean field theory, we clarify the coexistence and interplay of nonthermal charge, spin, and orbital order. The hidden state at low effective temperature and sufficiently high photo-doping is reminiscent of Kugel-Khomskii order in the two-orbital Hubbard model at $\frac{1}{4}$ and $\frac{3}{4}$ filling, but it emerges out of a nonequilibrium charge ordered state and exhibits a different magnetic structure. A low-energy effective Hamiltonian is used to analyze the exchange processes which stabilize the nonthermal order.</description>

      <title>Density-gradient-driven drift waves in the solar corona</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been suggested that under solar coronal conditions, drift waves may contribute to coronal heating. Specific properties of the drift waves to be expected in the solar corona have, however, not yet been determined using more advanced numerical models. We investigate the linear properties of density-gradient-driven drift waves in the solar coronal plasma using gyrokinetic ion-electron simulations with the gyrokinetic code GENE, solving the Vlasov-Maxwell equations in five dimensions assuming a simple slab geometry. We determine the frequencies and growth rates of the coronal density gradient-driven drift waves with changing plasma parameters, such as the electron \b{eta} , the density gradient, the magnetic shear and additional temperature gradients. To investigate the influence of the finite Larmor radius effect on the growth and structure of the modes, we also compare the gyrokinetic simulation results to those obtained from drift-kinetics. In most of the investigated conditions, the drift wave has positive growth rates that increase with increasing density gradient and decreasing \b{eta} . In the case of increasing magnetic shear, we find that from a certain point, the growth rate reaches a plateau. Depending on the considered reference environment, the frequencies and growth rates of these waves lie on the order of 0.1 mHz to 1 Hz. These values correspond to the observed solar wind density fluctuations near the Sun detected by WISPR, currently of unexplained origin. As a next step, nonlinear simulations are required to determine the expected fluctuation amplitudes and the plasma heating resulting from this mechanism.</description>

      <title>Efficient numerical frameworks for modelling ultrasonic beams propagating across interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two different frameworks are developed to model the wave field generated by a transducer and propagating through one or more interfaces, and a Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) integration scheme is used to numerically evaluate their results. The first method is based on the Rayleigh-Sommerfeld Integral (RSI), further developing a formulation in the literature and improving its capabilities, while the second relies on a high-frequency approximation, using a ray tracing principle. The advantages and limitations of each model are then compared via in-depth investigations on several use cases, culminating in an efficiency and scope assessment. It was found that the RSI-based model performs well if a large number of field points is needed, such as when modelling a full image of the field. Conversely, for a large number of interfaces, such as when modelling the field through a thin-layered material, the most efficient model was the ray tracing formulation, since it was unnecessary to propagate the field between all the interfaces first. This was especially noticeable for applications requiring only the evaluation of the field at a few points on the other side of multiple interfaces.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the checkerboard problem to reduce numerical dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work provides a comprehensive exploration of various methods in solving incompressible flows using a projection method, and their relation to the occurrence and management of checkerboard oscillations. It employs an algebraic symmetry-preserving framework, clarifying the derivation and implementation of discrete operators while also addressing the associated numerical errors. The lack of a proper definition for the checkerboard problem is addressed by proposing a physics-based coefficient. This coefficient, rooted in the disparity between the compact- and wide-stencil Laplacian operators, is able to quantify oscillatory solution fields with a physics-based, global, normalised, non-dimensional value. The influence of mesh and time-step refinement on the occurrence of checkerboarding is highlighted. Therefore, single measurements using this coefficient should be considered with caution, as the value presents little use without any context and can either suggest mesh refinement or use of a different solver. In addition, an example is given on how to employ this coefficient, by establishing a negative feedback between the level of checkerboarding and the inclusion of a pressure predictor, to dynamically balance the checkerboarding and numerical dissipation. This method is tested for laminar and turbulent flows, demonstrating its capabilities in obtaining this dynamical balance, without requiring user input. The method is able to achieve low numerical dissipation in absence of oscillations or diminish oscillation on skew meshes, while it shows minimal loss in accuracy for a turbulent test case. Despite its advantages, the method exhibits a slight decrease in the second-order relation between time-step size and pressure error, suggesting that other feedback mechanisms could be of interest.</description>

      <title>Optical line shapes of color centers in solids from classical autocorrelation functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Color centers play key roles in applications, including, e.g., solid state lighting and quantum information technology, for which the coupling between their optical and vibrational properties is crucial. Established methodologies for predicting the optical lineshapes of such emitters rely on the generating function (GF) approach and impose tight constraints on the shape of and relationship between the ground and excited state landscapes, which limits their application range. Here, we describe an approach based on direct sampling of the underlying auto-correlation functions through molecular dynamics simulations (MD-ACF) that overcomes these restrictions. The energy landscapes are represented by a machine-learned potential, which provides an accurate yet efficient description of both the ground and excited state landscapes through a single model, guaranteeing size-consistent predictions. We apply this methodology to the (VSiVC)kk(0) divacancy defect in 4H-SiC, a prototypical color center, which has been studied both experimentally and theoretically. We demonstrate that at low temperatures the present MD-ACF approach yields predictions in agreement with earlier GF calculations. Unlike the latter it is, however, also applicable at high temperatures as it is not subject to the same limitations, especially with respect to handling of anharmonicity, and can be applied to study non-crystalline materials. While we discuss remaining challenges and possible extensions, the methodology presented here already holds the potential to substantially widen the range of computational predictions of the optical properties of color centers and related defects, especially for cases with pronounced anharmonicity and/or large differences between the initial and final states.</description>

      <title>DarkMatters: A powerful tool for WIMPy analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new software package, DarkMatters, which has been designed to facilitate the calculation of all aspects of indirect dark matter detection of WIMPs in astrophysical settings. Two primary features of this code are the improvement in performance compared to existing tools, and higher levels of accuracy when determining radio synchrotron emission associated with WIMP annihilations, both of which are enabled by the employment of a set of modern and novel numerical techniques. The code also includes functionality for a multi-wavelength set of output products including gamma-ray, radio and neutrino fluxes which can be saved in common formats used by the astronomical community, such as the FITS data file format. The calculations may be tailored to work with a wide range of astrophysical target structures, from dwarf galaxies to galaxy clusters, and the configuration of the underlying calculations is managed by a set of key-value dictionary entries that are easy to understand and use. The code base is publicly accessible through an online repository with a permissive MIT source code licence.</description>

Abstract: Deep-learning density functional theory (DFT) shows great promise to significantly accelerate material discovery and potentially revolutionize materials research. However, current research in this field primarily relies on data-driven supervised learning, making the developments of neural networks and DFT isolated from each other. In this work, we present a theoretical framework of neural-network DFT, which unifies the optimization of neural networks with the variational computation of DFT, enabling physics-informed unsupervised learning. Moreover, we develop a differential DFT code incorporated with deep-learning DFT Hamiltonian, and introduce algorithms of automatic differentiation and backpropagation into DFT, demonstrating the capability of neural-network DFT. The physics-informed neural-network architecture not only surpasses conventional approaches in accuracy and efficiency, but also offers a new paradigm for developing deep-learning DFT methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15970v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A benchmark test was conducted for a new symplectic integration method originally developed by Molei Tao. The method raises interest due to its explicit evolution equation, with applicability to both separable and non-separable Hamiltonian systems, and an easy-to-implement, easily generalizable algorithm. In order to compare the method with other, more well-known methods, namely St\"{o}rmer-Verlet and Runge-Kutta, we conducted a series of benchmark tests comparing their performance in terms of CPU time, system invariants functions conservation, and numerical symplectic area conservation. Overall, it was found that despite being slower than the more optimized Runge-Kutta-Cash-Karp, Tao's method presents a similar performance to St\"{o}rmer-Verlet, with the extra perk of being more generic and not requiring the use of implicit equations for the evolution of the equations of motion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06131v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Point Group (PG) symmetries play a fundamental role in many aspects of theoretical chemistry and computational materials science. With the objective to automatize the search of PG symmetry operations of generic atomic clusters, we present a new algorithm called Symmetry Operation FInder (SOFI). SOFI addresses the problem of identifying PG symmetry by framing it as a degenerate shape-matching problem, where the multiple solutions correspond to distinct symmetry operations. The developed algorithm is compared against three other algorithms dedicated to PG identification, on a large set of atomic clusters. The results, along with some illustrative use cases, showcase the effectiveness of SOFI. The SOFI algorithm is released as part of the IRA library, accessible at https://github.com/mammasmias/IterativeRotationsAssignments.</description>

SOLFI is benchmarked in a simple straight mirror geometry, showing that the code conserves particle energy and magnetic moment, obtains the correct passing boundary for particles moving in the magnetic mirror field with an imposed electrostatic field, and correctly observes equal ion and electron current at the ambipolar potential predicted from analytical theory. This result has consequences for collisionless scrape-off-layers in spherical tokamaks. We then utilize SOLFI for fundamental physics studies in novel tokamak geometries, exploring the effect of shaping on the trapped particle fraction and bounce locations in tokamaks and demonstrating that negative triangularity can be used to maximize the fraction of particles bouncing in the good-curvature region, potentially leading to enhanced confinement.</description>

      <title>Implicit-explicit Runge-Kutta for radiation hydrodynamics I: gray diffusion</title>

Abstract: Radiation hydrodynamics are a challenging multiscale and multiphysics set of equations. To capture the relevant physics of interest, one typically must time step on the hydrodynamics timescale, making explicit integration the obvious choice. On the other hand, the coupled radiation equations have a scaling such that implicit integration is effectively necessary in non-relativistic regimes. A first-order Lie-Trotter-like operator split is the most common time integration scheme used in practice, alternating between an explicit hydrodynamics step and an implicit radiation solve and energy deposition step. However, such a scheme is limited to first-order accuracy, and nonlinear coupling between the radiation and hydrodynamics equations makes a more general additive partitioning of the equations non-trivial. Here, we develop a new formulation and partitioning of radiation hydrodynamics with gray diffusion that allows us to apply (linearly) implicit-explicit Runge-Kutta time integration schemes. We prove conservation of total energy in the new framework, and demonstrate 2nd-order convergence in time on multiple radiative shock problems, achieving error 3--5 orders of magnitude smaller than the first-order Lie-Trotter operator split at the hydrodynamic CFL, even when Lie-Trotter applies a 3rd-order TVD Runge-Kutta scheme to the hydrodynamics equations.</description>

      <title>Foundational Competencies and Responsibilities of a Research Software Engineer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11457</link>

Abstract: The term Research Software Engineer, or RSE, emerged a little over 10 years ago as a way to represent individuals working in the research community but focusing on software development. The term has been widely adopted and there are a number of high-level definitions of what an RSE is. However, the roles of RSEs vary depending on the institutional context they work in. At one end of the spectrum, RSE roles may look similar to a traditional research role. At the other extreme, they resemble that of a software engineer in industry. Most RSE roles inhabit the space between these two extremes. Therefore, providing a straightforward, comprehensive definition of what an RSE does and what experience, skills and competencies are required to become one is challenging. In this community paper we define the broad notion of what an RSE is, explore the different types of work they undertake, and define a list of fundamental competencies as well as values that define the general profile of an RSE. On this basis, we elaborate on the progression of these skills along different dimensions, looking at specific types of RSE roles, proposing recommendations for organisations, and giving examples of future specialisations. An appendix details how existing curricula fit into this framework.</description>

      <title>Two-scale Neural Networks for Partial Differential Equations with Small Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17232v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a two-scale neural network method for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) with small parameters using physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). We directly incorporate the small parameters into the architecture of neural networks. The proposed method enables solving PDEs with small parameters in a simple fashion, without adding Fourier features or other computationally taxing searches of truncation parameters. Various numerical examples demonstrate reasonable accuracy in capturing features of large derivatives in the solutions caused by small parameters.</description>

      <title>The case for adopting the sequential Jacobi's diagonalization algorithm in neutrino oscillation physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17188</link>

Abstract: Neutrino flavor oscillations and conversion in an interacting background (MSW effects) may reveal the charge-parity violation in the next generation of neutrino experiments. The usual approach for studying these effects is to numerically integrate the Schrodinger equation, recovering the neutrino mixing matrix and its parameters from the solution. This work suggests using the classical Jacobi's diagonalization in combination with a reordering procedure to produce a new algorithm, the Sequential Jacobi Diagonalization. This strategy separates linear algebra operations from numerical integration, allowing physicists to study how the oscillation parameters are affected by adiabatic MSW effects in a more efficient way. The mixing matrices at every point of a given parameter space can be stored for speeding up other calculations, such as model fitting and Monte Carlo productions. This approach has two major computation advantages, namely: being trivially parallelizable, making it a suitable choice for concurrent computation, and allowing for quasi-model-independent solutions that simplify Beyond Standard Model searches.</description>
