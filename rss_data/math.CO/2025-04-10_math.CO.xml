      <title>Disjunctive domination in maximal outerplanar graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A disjunctive dominating set of a graph $G$ is a set $D \subseteq V(G)$ such that every vertex in $V(G)\setminus D$ has a neighbor in $D$ or has at least two vertices in $D$ at distance $2$ from it. The disjunctive domination number of $G$, denoted by $\gamma_2^d(G)$, is the minimum cardinality of a disjunctive dominating set of $G$. In this paper, we show that if $G$ is a maximal outerplanar graph of order $n \ge 7$ with $k$ vertices of degree $2$, then $\gamma_2^d(G)\le \lfloor\frac{2}{9}(n+k)\rfloor$, and this bound is sharp.</description>

      <title>Canonical forms of polytopes from adjoints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Projectivizations of pointed polyhedral cones $C$ are positive geometries in the sense of Arkani-Hamed, Bai, and Lam. Their canonical forms look like $$ \Omega_C(x)=\frac{A(x)}{B(x)} dx, $$ with $A,B$ polynomials. The denominator $B(x)$ is just the product of the linear equations defining the facets of $C$. We will see that the numerator $A(x)$ is given by the adjoint polynomial of the dual cone $C^{\vee}$. The adjoint was originally defined by Warren, who used it to construct barycentric coordinates in general polytopes. Confirming the intuition that the job of the numerator is to cancel unwanted poles outside the polytope, we will see that the adjoint is the unique polynomial of minimal degree whose hypersurface contains the residual arrangement of non-face intersections of supporting hyperplanes of $C$.</description>

      <title>Tiling randomly perturbed multipartite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A perfect $K_r$-tiling in a graph $G$ is a collection of vertex-disjoint copies of the graph $K_r$ in $G$ that covers all vertices of $G$. In this paper, we prove that the threshold for the existence of a perfect $K_{r}$-tiling of a randomly perturbed balanced $r$-partite graph on $rn$ vertices is $n^{-2/r}$. This result is a multipartite analog of a theorem of Balogh, Treglown, and Wagner and extends our previous result, which was limited to the bipartite setting.</description>

      <title>Shellability of the quotient order on lattice path matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of a matroid quotient has connections to fundamental questions in the geometry of flag varieties. In previous work, Benedetti and Knauer characterized quotients in the class of lattice path matroids (LPMs) in terms of a simple combinatorial condition. As a consequence, they showed that the quotient order on LPMs yields a graded poset whose rank polynomial relates to a refinement of the Catalan numbers. In this work we show that this poset admits an EL-labeling, implying that the order complex is shellable and hence enjoys several combinatorial and topological properties. We use this to establish bounds on the M\"obius function of the poset, interpreting falling chains in the EL-labeling in terms of properties of underlying permutations. Furthermore, we show that this EL-labeling is in fact a Whitney labeling, in the sense of the recent notion introduced by Gonz\'alez D'Le\'on and Hallam.</description>

      <title>A poset game in submonoids of additively indecomposable ordinals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by arXiv:1705.11034, we consider the Chomp game in a natural poset structure defined in submonoids $\mathcal{S}^\sigma\subseteq\omega^\sigma$ of additively indecomposable ordinals. A fundamental observation is that there exists an ordinal $\xi$ such that, for every class $\langle (\mathcal{S}^\sigma;\leq_{\mathcal{S}^\sigma}) \ | \ \sigma\in\text{Ord}\rangle$ of posets generated by a set of natural numbers, the second player has a winning strategy in all those posets or only in $\langle (\mathcal{S}^\sigma;\leq_{\mathcal{S}^\sigma}) \ | \ \sigma\in\alpha\rangle$ for some successor ordinal $\alpha\leq\xi$ (and the first player will have a winning strategy in the rest of the posets). This Hanf number-style property could be valuable in proving the existence of winning strategies. We conjecture that $ \xi = 1 $ and, using results from arXiv:1908.09664, we prove that $\xi&lt;\omega_1$. We also explicitly describe a winning strategy for a specific family of classes.</description>

      <title>Distance signless Laplacian spectral radius and tough graphs involving minimun degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G=(V(G),E(G))$ be a simple graph, where $V(G)$ and $E(G)$ are the vertex set and the edge set of $G$, respectively. The number of components of $G$ is denoted by $c(G)$. Let $t$ be a positive real number, and a connected graph $G$ is $t$-tough if $t c(G-S)\leq|S|$ for every vertex cut $S$ of $V(G)$. The toughness of graph $G$, denoted by $\tau(G)$, is the largest value of $t$ for which $G$ is $t$-tough. Recently, Fan, Lin and Lu [European J. Combin. 110(2023), 103701] presented sufficient conditions based on the spectral radius for graphs to be 1-tough with minimum degree $\delta(G)$ and graphs to be $t$-tough with $t\geq 1$ being an integer, respectively. In this paper, we establish sufficient conditions in terms of the distance signless Laplacian spectral radius for graphs to be 1-tough with minimum degree $\delta(G)$ and graphs to be $t$-tough, where $\frac{1}{t}$ is a positive integer. Moreover, we consider the relationship between the distance signless Laplacian spectral radius and $t$-tough graphs in terms of the order $n$.</description>

      <title>$c$-Birkhoff polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a 2018 paper, Davis and Sagan studied several pattern-avoiding polytopes. They found that a particular pattern-avoiding Birkhoff polytope had the same normalized volume as the order polytope of a certain poset, leading them to ask if the two polytopes were unimodularly equivalent. Motivated by Davis and Sagan's question, in this paper we define a pattern-avoiding Birkhoff polytope called a $c$-Birkhoff polytope for each Coxeter element $c$ of the symmetric group. We then show that the $c$-Birkhoff polytope is unimodularly equivalent to the order polytope of the heap poset of the $c$-sorting word of the longest permutation. When $c=s_1s_2\dots s_{n}$, this result recovers an affirmative answer to Davis and Sagan's question. Another consequence of this result is that the normalized volume of the $c$-Birkhoff polytope is the number of the longest chains in the (type A) $c$-Cambrian lattice.</description>

      <title>Linear relations between face numbers of levels in arrangements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study linear relations between face numbers of levels in arrangements. Let $V = \{ v_1, \ldots, v_n \} \subset \mathbf{R}^{r}$ be a vector configuration in general position, and let $\mathcal{A}(V)$ be polar dual arrangement of hemispheres in the $d$-dimensional unit sphere $S^d$, where $d=r-1$. For $0\leq s \leq d$ and $0 \leq t \leq n$, let $f_{s,t}(V)$ denote the number of faces of \emph{level} $t$ and dimension $d-s$ in the arrangement $\mathcal{A}(V)$ (these correspond to partitions $V=V_-\sqcup V_0 \sqcup V_+$ by linear hyperplanes with $|V_0|=s$ and $|V_-|=t$). We call the matrix $f(V):=[f_{s,t}(V)]$ the \emph{$f$-matrix} of $V$.
  Completing a long line of research on linear relations between face numbers of levels in arrangements, we determine, for every $n\geq r \geq 1$, the affine space $\mathfrak{F}_{n,r}$ spanned by the $f$-matrices of configurations of $n$ vectors in general position in $\mathbf{R}^r$; moreover, we determine the subspace $\mathfrak{F}^0_{n,r} \subset \mathfrak{F}_{n,r}$ spanned by all \emph{pointed} vector configurations (i.e., such that $V$ is contained in some open linear halfspace), which correspond to point sets in $\mathbf{R}^d$. This generalizes the classical fact that the Dehn--Sommerville relations generate all linear relations between the face numbers of simple polytopes (the faces at level $0$) and answers a question posed by Andrzejak and Welzl in 2003.
  The key notion for the statements and the proofs of our results is the $g$-matrix of a vector configuration, which determines the $f$-matrix and generalizes the classical $g$-vector of a polytope.
  By Gale duality, we also obtain analogous results for partitions of vector configurations by sign patterns of nontrivial linear dependencies, and for \emph{Radon partitions} of point sets in $\mathbf{R}^d$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: DeVos and Seymour (2003) proved that for every set $C$ of 3-colorings of a set $X$ of vertices, there exists a plane graph $G$ with vertices of $X$ incident with the outer face such that a 3-coloring of $X$ extends to a 3-coloring of $G$ if and only if it belongs to $C$. We prove a generalization of this claim for $k$-colorings of $X$-rooted-$K_{k+1}$-minor-free $K_{k+2}$-minor-free graphs.</description>

      <title>Sublevels in arrangements and the spherical arc crossing number of complete graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Levels and sublevels in arrangements -- and, dually, $k$-sets and $(\leq k)$-sets -- are fundamental notions in discrete and computational geometry and natural generalizations of convex polytopes, which correspond to the $0$-level. A long-standing conjecture of Eckhoff, Linhart, and Welzl, which would generalize McMullen's Upper Bound Theorem for polytopes and provide an exact refinement of asymptotic bounds by Clarkson, asserts that for all $k\leq \lfloor \frac{n-d-2}{2}\rfloor$, the number of $(\leq k)$-sets of a set $S$ of $n$ points in $\mathbf{R}^d$ is maximized if $S$ is the vertex set of a neighborly polytope.
  As a new tool for studying this conjecture and related problems, we introduce the $g$-matrix, which generalizes both the $g$-vector of a simple polytope and a Gale dual version of the $g$-vector studied by Lee and Welzl. Our main result is that the $g$-matrix of every vector configuration in $\mathbf{R}^3$ is non-negative, which implies the Eckhoff--Linhart--Welzl conjecture in the case where $d=n-4$.
  As a corollary, we obtain the following result about crossing numbers: Consider a configuration $V\subset S^2 \subset \mathbf{R}^3$ of $n$ unit vectors, and connect every pair of vectors by the unique shortest geodesic arc between them in the unit sphere $S^2$. This yields a drawing of the complete graph $K_n$ in $S^2$, which we call a spherical arc drawing. Complementing previous results for rectilinear drawings, we show that the number of crossings in any spherical arc drawing of $K_n$ is at least $\frac{1}{4}\lfloor \frac{n}{2}\rfloor \lfloor \frac{n-1}{2}\rfloor \lfloor \frac{n-2}{2}\rfloor \lfloor \frac{n-3}{2}\rfloor$, which equals the conjectured value of the crossing number of $K_n$. Moreover, the lower bound is attained if $V$ is coneighborly, i.e., if every open linear halfspace contains at least $\lfloor (n-2)/2 \rfloor$ of the vectors in $V$.</description>

      <title>The row left rank of quaternion unit gain graphs in terms of pendant vertices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\widetilde{G}=(G,U(\mathbb{Q}),\varphi)$ be a quaternion unit gain graph (or $U(\mathbb{Q})$-gain graph), where $G$ is the underlying graph of $\widetilde{G}$, $U(\mathbb{Q})=\{q\in \mathbb{Q}: |q|=1\}$ and $\varphi:\overrightarrow{E}\rightarrow U(\mathbb{Q})$ is the gain function such that $\varphi(e_{ij})=\varphi(e_{ji})^{-1}=\overline{\varphi(e_{ji})}$ for any adjacent vertices $v_{i}$ and $v_{j}$. Let $A(\widetilde{G})$ be the adjacency matrix of $\widetilde{G}$ and let $r(\widetilde{G})$ be the row left rank of $\widetilde{G}$. In this paper, we prove some lower bounds on the row left rank of $U(\mathbb{Q})$-gain graphs in terms of pendant vertices. All corresponding extremal graphs are characterized.</description>

      <title>The signless Laplacian spectral Tur\'{a}n problems for color-critical graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The well-known Tur\'{a}n theorem states that if $G$ is an $n$-vertex $K_{r+1}$-free graph, then $e(G)\le e(T_{n,r})$, with equality if and only if $G$ is the $r$-partite Tur\'{a}n graph $T_{n,r}$. A graph $F$ is called color-critical if it contains an edge whose deletion reduces its chromatic number. Extending the Tur\'{a}n theorem, Simonovits (1968) proved that for any color-critical graph $F$ with $\chi (F)=r+1$ and sufficiently large $n$, the Tur\'{a}n graph $T_{n,r}$ is the unique graph with maximum number of edges among all $n$-vertex $F$-free graphs. Subsequently, Nikiforov [Electron. J. Combin., 16 (1) (2009)] proved a spectral version of the Simonovits theorem in terms of the adjacency spectral radius. In this paper, we show an extension of the Simonovits theorem for the signless Laplacian spectral radius. We prove that for any color-critical graph $F$ with $\chi (F)=r+1\ge 4$ and sufficiently large $n$, if $G$ is an $F$-free graph on $n$ vertices, then $q(G)\le q(T_{n,r})$, with equality if and only if $G=T_{n,r}$. Our approach is to establish a signless Laplacian spectral version of the criterion of Keevash, Lenz and Mubayi [SIAM J. Discrete Math., 28 (4) (2014)]. Consequently, we can determine the signless Laplacian spectral extremal graphs for generalized books and even wheels. As an application, our result gives an upper bound on the degree power of an $F$-free graph. We show that if $n$ is sufficiently large and $G$ is an $F$-free graph on $n$ vertices with $m$ edges, then $\sum_{v\in V(G)} d^2(v) \le 2(1- \frac{1}{r})mn$, with equality if and only if $G$ is a regular Tur\'{a}n graph $T_{n,r}$. This extends a result of Nikiforov and Rousseau [J. Combin. Theory Ser B 92 (2004)].</description>

      <title>Shuffling via Transpositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a family of card shuffles of $n$ cards, where the allowed moves involve transpositions corresponding to the Jucys--Murphy elements of $\{S_m\}_{m \leq n}$. We diagonalize the transition matrix of these shuffles. As a special case, we consider the $k$-star transpositions shuffle, a natural interpolation between random transpositions and star transpositions. We proved that the $k$-star transpositions shuffle exhibits total variation cutoff at time $\frac{2n-(k+1)}{2(n-1)}n\log n$ with a window of $\frac{2n-(k+1)}{2(n-1)}n$. Furthermore, we prove that for the case where $k/n \rightarrow 0$ or $1$, this shuffle has the same limit profile as random transpositions, which has been fully determined by Teyssier.</description>

Abstract: There are many areas of scientific endeavour where large, complex datasets are needed for benchmarking. Evolutionary computing provides a means towards creating such sets. As a case study, we consider Conway's Surreal numbers. They have largely been treated as a theoretical construct, with little effort towards empirical study, at least in part because of the difficulty of working with all but the smallest numbers. To advance this status, we need efficient algorithms, and in order to develop such we need benchmark data sets of surreal numbers. In this paper, we present a method for generating ensembles of random surreal numbers to benchmark algorithms. The approach uses an evolutionary algorithm to create the benchmark datasets where we can analyse and control features of the resulting test sets. Ultimately, the process is designed to generate networks with defined properties, and we expect this to be useful for other types of network data.</description>

      <title>On the minimal length of addition chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We denote by $\ell(n)$ the minimal length of an addition chain leading to $n$ and we define the counting function $$ F(m,r):=\#\left\{n\in[2^m, 2^{m+1}):\ell(n)\le m+r\right\}, $$ where $m$ is a positive integer and $r\ge 0$ is a real number. We show that for $0&lt; c&lt;\log 2$ and for any $\varepsilon&gt;0$, we have as $m\to \infty$, $$ F\left(m,\frac{cm}{\log m}\right)&lt;\exp\left(cm+\frac{\varepsilon m\log\log m}{\log m}\right) $$ and $$ F\left(m,\frac{cm}{\log m}\right)&gt;\exp\left(cm-\frac{(1+\varepsilon)cm\log\log m}{\log m}\right). $$ This extends a result of Erd\H{o}s which says that for almost all $n$, as $n\to\infty$, $$ \ell(n)=\frac{\log n}{\log 2}+\left(1+o(1)\right)\frac{\log n}{\log \log n}. $$</description>

      <title>Toda-type presentations for the quantum K theory of partial flag varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a determinantal, Toda-type, presentation for the equivariant K theory of a partial flag variety $\mathrm{Fl}(r_1, \ldots, r_k;n)$. The proof relies on pushing forward the Toda presentation obtained by Maeno, Naito and Sagaki for the complete flag variety $\mathrm{Fl}(n)$, via Kato's $\mathrm{K}_T(\mathrm{pt})$-algebra homomorphism from the quantum K ring of $\mathrm{Fl}(n)$ to that of $\mathrm{Fl}(r_1, \ldots, r_k;n)$. Starting instead from the Whitney presentation for $\mathrm{Fl}(n)$, we show that the same push-forward technique gives a recursive formula for polynomial representatives of quantum K Schubert classes in any partial flag variety which do not depend on quantum parameters. In an appendix, we include another proof of the Toda presentation for the equivariant quantum K ring of $\mathrm{Fl}(n)$, following Anderson, Chen, and Tseng, which is based on the fact that the $\mathrm{K}$ theoretic $J$-function is an eigenfunction of the finite difference Toda Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Hardness of 4-Colourings G-Colourable Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the complexity of a class of promise graph homomorphism problems. For a fixed graph H, the H-colouring problem is to decide whether a given graph has a homomorphism to H. By a result of Hell and Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il, this problem is NP-hard for any non-bipartite loop-less graph H. Brakensiek and Guruswami [SODA 2018] conjectured the hardness extends to promise graph homomorphism problems as follows: fix a pair of non-bipartite loop-less graphs G, H such that there is a homomorphism from G to H, it is NP-hard to distinguish between graphs that are G-colourable and those that are not H-colourable. We confirm this conjecture in the cases when both G and H are 4-colourable. This is a common generalisation of previous results of Khanna, Linial, and Safra [Comb. 20(3): 393-415 (2000)] and of Krokhin and Opr\v{s}al [FOCS 2019]. The result is obtained by combining the algebraic approach to promise constraint satisfaction with methods of topological combinatorics and equivariant obstruction theory.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new class of mock Eisenstein series, describe their modular properties, and write the partition rank generating function in terms of so-called partition traces of these. Moreover, we show the Fourier coefficients of the mock Eisenstein series are integral and we obtain a holomorphic anomaly equation for their completions.</description>

Abstract: The aim of this paper is to establish a Ratner-type equidistribution theorem for orbits on homogeneous spaces associated with \(2\)-nilpotent locally compact Polish groups under the action of a countable discrete abelian group. We apply this result to establish the existence of triple restricted sumsets in subsets of positive density in arbitrary countable discrete abelian groups, subject to a necessary finiteness condition.</description>

Abstract: We present a formula for a generalisation of the Eulerian polynomial, namely the generating polynomial of the joint distribution of major index and descent statistic over the set of signed multiset permutations. It has a description in terms of the $h^*$-polynomial of a certain polytope. Moreover, we associate a family of polytopes to (generalised) Eulerian polynomials of types $\mathsf{A}$ and $\mathsf{B}$. Using this connection, properties of the generalised Eulerian numbers of types $\mathsf{A}$ and $\mathsf{B}$, such as palindromicity and unimodality, are reflected in certain properties of the associated polytope. We also present results on generalising the connection between descent polynomials and polytopes to coloured (multiset) permutations.</description>

      <title>Random Embeddings of Graphs: The Expected Number of Faces in Most Graphs is Logarithmic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.01032v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A random 2-cell embedding of a connected graph $G$ in some orientable surface is obtained by choosing a random local rotation around each vertex. Under this setup, the number of faces or the genus of the corresponding 2-cell embedding becomes a random variable. Random embeddings of two particular graph classes, those of a bouquet of $n$ loops and those of $n$ parallel edges connecting two vertices, have been extensively studied and are well-understood. However, little is known about more general graphs. The results of this paper explain why Monte Carlo methods cannot work for approximating the minimum genus of graphs.
  In his breakthrough work [Permutation-partition pairs, JCTB 1991], Stahl developed the foundation of "random topological graph theory". Most of his results have been unsurpassed until today. In our work, we analyze the expected number of faces of random embeddings (equivalently, the average genus) of a graph $G$. It was very recently shown that for any graph $G$, the expected number of faces is at most linear. We show that the actual expected number of faces $F(G)$ is almost always much smaller. In particular, we prove:
  1) $\frac{1}{2}\ln n - 2 &lt; \mathbb{E}[F(K_n)] \le 3.65 \ln n +o(1)$.
  2) For random graphs $G(n,p)$ ($p=p(n)$), we have $\mathbb{E}[F(G(n,p))] \le \ln^2 n+\frac{1}{p}$.
  3) For random models $B(n,\Delta)$ containing only graphs, whose maximum degree is at most $\Delta$, we obtain stronger bounds by showing that the expected number of faces is $\Theta(\log n)$.</description>

      <title>Macdonald Identities, Weyl-Kac Denominator Formulas and Affine Grassmannian Elements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10532v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Nekrasov-Okounkov formula gives an expression for the Fourier coefficients of the Euler functions as a sum of hook length products. This formula can be deduced from a specialization in a renormalization of the affine type $A$ Weyl denominator formula and the use of a polynomial argument. In this paper, we rephrase the renormalized Weyl-Kac denominator formula as a sum parametrized by affine Grassmannian elements. This naturally gives rise to the (dual) atomic length of the root system considered introduced by Chapelier-Laget and Gerber. We then provide an interpretation of this atomic length as the cardinality of some subsets of $n$-core partitions by using foldings of affine Dynkin diagrams. This interpretation does not permit the direct use of a polynomial argument for all affine root systems. We show that this obstruction can be overcome by computing the atomic length of certain families of integer partitions. Then we show how hook-length statistics on these partitions are connected with the Coxeter length on affine Grassmannian elements and Nekrasov-Okounkov type formulas.</description>

Abstract: We confirm the speculation that the distribution of $t$-hooks among unrestricted integer partitions essentially descends to self-conjugate partitions. Namely, we prove that the number of hooks of length $t$ among the size $n$ self-conjugate partitions is asymptotically normally distributed with mean
  $\mu_t(n) \sim \frac{\sqrt{6n}}{\pi} + \frac{3}{\pi^2} - \frac{t}{2}+\frac{\delta_t}{4}$ and variance $\sigma_t^2(n) \sim \frac{(\pi^2 - 6) \sqrt{6n}}{\pi^3},$ where $\delta_t:=1$ if $t$ is odd, and is 0 otherwise.</description>

      <title>Planar graphs in blowups of fans</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05936v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that every $n$-vertex planar graph is contained in the graph obtained from a fan by blowing up each vertex by a complete graph of order $O(\sqrt{n}\log^2 n)$. Equivalently, every $n$-vertex planar graph $G$ has a set $X$ of $O(\sqrt{n}\log^2 n)$ vertices such that $G-X$ has bandwidth $O(\sqrt{n}\log^2 n)$. We in fact prove the same result for any proper minor-closed class, and we prove more general results that explore the trade-off between $X$ and the bandwidth of $G-X$. The proofs use three key ingredients. The first is a new local sparsification lemma, which shows that every $n$-vertex planar graph $G$ has a set of $O((n\log n)/\delta)$ vertices whose removal results in a graph with local density at most $\delta$. The second is a generalization of a method of Feige and Rao that relates bandwidth and local density using volume-preserving Euclidean embeddings. The third ingredient is graph products, which are a key tool in the extension to any proper minor-closed class.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01697v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $E$ be a subset of the affine plane over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$. We bound the size of the subgroup of $SL_2(\mathbb{F}_q)$ that preserves $E$. As a consequence, we show that if $E$ has size $\ll q^\alpha$ and is preserved by $\gg q^\beta$ elements of $SL_2(\mathbb{F}_q)$ with $\beta\geq 3\alpha/2$, then $E$ is contained in a line. This result is sharp in general, and will be proved by using combinatorial arguments and applying a point-line incidence bound in $\mathbb{F}_q^3$ due to Mockenhaupt and Tao (2004).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14664v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new algorithm to explore or count the numerical semigroups of a given genus which uses the unleaved version of the tree of numerical semigroups. In the unleaved tree there are no leaves rather than the ones at depth equal to the genus in consideration. For exloring the unleaved tree we present a new encoding system of a numerical semigroup given by the gcd of its left elements and its shrinking, that is, the semigroup generated by its left elements divided by their gcd. We show a method to determine the right generators and strong generators of a semigroup by means of the gcd and the shrinking encoding, as well as a method to encode a semigroup from the encoding of its parent or of its predecessor sibling. With the new algorithm we obtained $n_{76}=29028294421710227$ and $n_{77}=47008818196495180$.</description>

      <title>A Spectral Lower Bound on the Chromatic Number using $p$-Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01295v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $ A(G) $ be the adjacency matrix of a simple graph $ G $, and let $ \chi(G) $ and $ \chi_q(G) $ denote its chromatic number and quantum chromatic number, respectively. For $ p &gt; 0 $, we define the positive and negative $ p $-energies of $ G $ as $$ \mathcal{E}_p^+(G) = \sum_{\lambda_i &gt; 0} \lambda_i^p(A(G)), \quad \mathcal{E}_p^-(G) = \sum_{\lambda_i &lt; 0} |\lambda_i(A(G))|^p, $$ where $ \lambda_1(A(G)) \geq \cdots \geq \lambda_n(A(G)) $ are the eigenvalues of $ A(G) $. We first prove that $$ \chi(G) \geq \chi_q(G) \geq 1 + \max \left\{ \frac{\mathcal{E}_p^+(G)}{\mathcal{E}_p^-(G)}, \frac{\mathcal{E}_p^-(G)}{\mathcal{E}_p^+(G)} \right\} $$ holds for all $ 0 &lt; p &lt; 1 $. This result has already been established for $ p = 0 $ and $ p = 2 $, and it holds trivially for $ p = 1 $. Furthermore, we demonstrate that for certain graphs, non-integer values of $p$ yield sharper lower bounds on $\chi(G)$ than existing spectral bounds. Finally, we conjecture that the same inequality continues to hold for all $ 1 &lt; p &lt; 2 $.</description>

Abstract: We study the Busemann process and competition interfaces of the planar directed polymer model with i.i.d.\ weights on the vertices of the planar square lattice, in both the general case and the solvable inverse-gamma case. We prove new regularity properties of the Busemann process without reliance on unproved assumptions on the shape function. For example, each nearest-neighbor Busemann function is strictly monotone and has the same random set of discontinuities in the direction variable. When all Busemann functions on a horizontal line are viewed together, the Busemann process intertwines with an evolution that obeys a version of the geometric Robinson-Schensted-Knuth correspondence. When specialized to the inverse-gamma case, this relationship enables an explicit distributional description: the Busemann function on a nearest-neighbor edge has independent increments in the direction variable, and its distribution comes from an inhomogeneous planar Poisson process. The distribution of the asymptotic competition interface direction of the inverse-gamma polymer is discrete and supported on the Busemann discontinuities which -- unlike in zero-temperature last-passage percolation -- are dense. Further implications follow for the eternal solutions and the failure of the one force -- one solution principle of the discrete stochastic heat equation solved by the polymer partition function.</description>

      <title>On exterior powers of reflection representations, II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08215v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $W$ be a group endowed with a finite set $S$ of generators. A representation $(V,\rho)$ of $W$ is called a reflection representation of $(W,S)$ if $\rho(s)$ is a (generalized) reflection on $V$ for each generator $s \in S$. In this paper, we prove that for any irreducible reflection representation $V$, all the exterior powers $\bigwedge ^d V$, $d = 0, 1, \dots, \dim V$, are irreducible $W$-modules, and they are non-isomorphic to each other. This extends a theorem of R. Steinberg which is stated for Euclidean reflection groups. Moreover, we prove that the exterior powers (except for the 0th and the highest power) of two non-isomorphic reflection representations always give non-isomorphic $W$-modules. This allows us to construct numerous pairwise non-isomorphic irreducible representations for such groups, especially for Coxeter groups.</description>

      <title>On the Cop Number of String Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11002v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cops and Robber is a well-studied two-player pursuit-evasion game played on a graph, where a group of cops tries to capture the robber. The \emph{cop number} of a graph is the minimum number of cops required to capture the robber. Gaven\v{c}iak et al.~[Eur. J. of Comb. 72, 45--69 (2018)] studied the game on intersection graphs and established that the cop number for the class of string graphs is at most 15, and asked as an open question to improve this bound for string graphs and subclasses of string graphs. We address this question and establish that the cop number of a string graph is at most 13. To this end, we develop a novel \textit{guarding} technique. We further establish that this technique can be useful for other Cops and Robber games on graphs admitting a representation. In particular, we show that four cops have a winning strategy for a variant of Cops and Robber, named Fully Active Cops and Robber, on planar graphs, addressing an open question of Gromovikov et al.~[Austr. J. Comb. 76(2), 248--265 (2020)]. In passing, we also improve the known bounds on the cop number of boxicity 2 graphs. Finally, as a corollary of our result on the cop number of string graphs, we establish that the chromatic number of string graphs with girth at least $5$ is at most $14$.</description>

      <title>Euler characteristics of higher rank double ramification loci in genus one</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12281v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Double ramification loci parametrise marked curves where a weighted sum of the markings is linearly trivial; higher rank loci are obtained by imposing several such conditions simultaneously. We obtain closed formulae for the orbifold Euler characteristics of double ramification loci, and their higher rank generalisations, in genus one. The rank one formula is a polynomial, while the higher rank formula involves greatest common divisors of matrix minors. The proof is based on a recurrence relation, which allows for induction on the rank and number of markings.</description>

      <title>New centrality measure: ksi-centrality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02488v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce new centrality measures, called ksi-centrality and normalized ksi-centrality measure the importance of a node up to the importance of its neighbors. First, we show that normalized ksi-centrality can be rewritten in terms of the Laplacian matrix such that its expression is similar to the local clustering coefficient. After that we introduce average normalized ksi-coefficient and show that for a random Erdos-Renyi graph it is almost the same as average clustering coefficient. It also shows behavior similar to the clustering coefficient for the Windmill and Wheel graphs. Finally, we show that the distributions of ksi centrality and normalized ksi centrality distinguish networks based on real data from artificial networks, including the Watts-Strogatz, Barabasi-Albert and Boccaletti-Hwang-Latora small-world networks. Furthermore, we show the relationship between normalized ksi centrality and the average normalized ksi coefficient and the algebraic connectivity of the graph and the Chegeer number.</description>
