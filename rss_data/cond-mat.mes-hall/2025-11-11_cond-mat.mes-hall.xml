      <title>Soluciones exactas para la interacci\'on de materiales de Dirac anis\'otropos con campos el\'ectricos y magn\'eticos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work analyzes anisotropic Dirac materials, such as graphene and borophene, under inhomogeneous electric and magnetic fields with position-dependent profiles. Exact solutions of the Dirac--Weyl equation are obtained for singular and exponentially decaying interactions, showing how anisotropy and field shape influence the energy spectrum, Landau levels, and state localization. The analysis is further extended using the Asymptotic Iteration Method (AIM) in its perturbative form, applied to systems with bounded domains $( -\infty, x_0 ]$ or $( 0, x_0 ]$. In particular, we consider the case $( -\infty, x_0 ]$, where the field vanishes asymptotically. The first-order corrections reveal how the finite range $x_0$ modifies localization and transport, and how a critical electric field emerges at which Landau levels collapse, providing insight into the design of field-defined regions in two-dimensional nanoelectronic and quantum devices.</description>

      <title>An Unusual Dresselhaus Spin-Orbit Contribution of Even Order in Momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spin-orbit (SO) coupling is conventionally known to manifest as \emph{odd} functions of momentum. Here, through both model calculations and symmetry analysis along with the method of invariants, we reveal that, in ordinary semiconductor heterostructures, a \emph{quadratic} Dresselhaus SO term -- inheriting from its bulk crystal form -- emerges via the interband effect, while complying with time-reversal and spatial symmetries. Furthermore, we observe that this unusual SO term gives rise to a range of striking quantum phenomena, including hybridized swirling texture, anisotropic energy dispersion, avoided band crossing, longitudinal \emph{Zitterbewegung}, and opposite spin evolution between different bands in quantum dynamics. These stand in stark contrast to those associated with the usual \emph{linear} SO terms. Our findings uncover a previously overlooked route for exploiting interband effects and open new avenues for spintronic functionalities that leverage unusual SO terms of \emph{even} orders in momentum.</description>

      <title>Crossover from quantum correlation to hot-carrier transport in scattering-tolerant 2D transistors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum correlation and hot-carrier transport represent two fundamentally distinct regimes of electronic conduction, rarely accessible within the same device. Here, we report a state-of-the-art monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides transistor architecture on a ferroelectric substrate that enables this crossover by leveraging the strong dielectric screening and in-plane gate control. At cryogenic temperatures, the devices exhibit reproducible quasi-periodic current fluctuations, consistent with an emergent potential landscape driven by electron-electron interactions at low carrier densities. As the temperature increases, this correlated potential profile thermally dissolves and transport is dominated by the lateral gate-field that drives the carriers with high kinetic energy. These hot-carriers can efficiently surmount the scattering events, exhibiting a record-high room-temperature electron mobility of ~4,800 cm^2/Vs and a maximum on-current ~0.5 mA/{\mu}m, surpassing traditional FETs in key performance metrics. These findings establish a unified approach for probing intermediate mesoscopic orders, while advancing the transistor performance limits in scalable 2D transistors.</description>

      <title>Antiferromagnetic skyrmion as a magnonic lens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A lens, a device transforming propagation directions in an organized fashion, is one of the fundamental tools for wave manipulation. Spin wave, the collective excitation of ordered magnetizations, stands out as a promising candidate for future energy-saving information technologies. Here we propose theoretically and verify by micromagnetic simulations, that an antiferromagnetic skyrmion naturally serves as a lens for spin wave, when the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya strength exceeds a threshold. The underlying mechanism is the spin wave deflection caused by Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, a mechanism that is ordinarily overshadowed by the magnetic topology.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Negative Capacitance for Unconventional Coulomb Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that the many-body ground state of a two-dimensional electron system can be tuned through Coulomb engineering by controlling the permittivity of the surrounding media. However, permittivities are traditionally restricted to positive values. In this paper we argue that the negative capacitance effect demonstrated in appropriately engineered structures can open new vistas in Coulomb engineering. Negative permittivities transform the natural repulsive interaction of electrons into an attractive one raising the intriguing possibility of a superconducting ground state. Using models of two-dimensional electron systems with linear and parabolic dispersion relations coupled to environments with negative capacitance, we estimate the strength and sign of the engineered Coulomb interaction and outline parameter regimes that could stabilize correlated electronic phases.</description>

      <title>Properties of multiterminal superconducting nanostructure with double quantum dot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the charge transport and thermoelectric properties of the junction, comprising double quantum dot embedded in T-shaped geometry on the interface between two normal/ferromagnetic electrodes and superconducting lead. We show that the interdot coupling plays major role in controlling the local and nonlocal transport properties of this setup. For the weak interdot coupling limit, we obtain the interferometric (Fano-type) lineshapes imprinted in the quasiparticle spectra, conductances and Seebeck coefficients. In contrast, for the strong interdot coupling, we predict that the local and nonlocal transport coefficients are primarily dependent on the molecular Andreev bound states induced by superconducting proximity effect, simultaneously in both quantum dots.</description>

      <title>Active Noise Reduction in Si/SiGe Gated Quantum Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solid-state quantum technologies such as quantum dot qubits and quantum electrical metrology circuits rely on quantum phenomena at ultra-low energies, making them highly sensitive to various forms of environmental noise. Conventional passive filtering schemes can reduce high-frequency noise but are often ineffective against low-frequency interference, like powerline or instrument-induced. Extending such filters to lower frequencies causes practical issues such as longer stabilization times, slower system response, and increased Johnson noise, which impede low-frequency transport measurements. To address these limitations, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a generalized active noise cancellation scheme for quantum devices operating at sub-Kelvin temperatures. Our approach compensates periodic environmental interference by dynamically injecting a phase-coherent anti-noise signal directly into the device. We employ an automated feedback protocol featuring beat-frequency reduction and adaptive phase-amplitude tuning, enabling real-time compensation without any manual intervention. Unlike post-processing or passive filtering, this method suppresses noise at the device level without introducing additional time constants. We implement the scheme on a gate-defined Si/SiGe quantum dot subject to strong 50 Hz powerline interference and validate its effectiveness through acquiring Coulomb Blockade Oscillations and Coulomb diamond plots. The technique achieves substantial suppression of both the targeted interference and the overall noise floor, thereby stabilizing transport characteristics and enhancing device fidelity. While demonstrated on a quantum dot, the proposed framework is broadly applicable to a wide class of solid-state quantum devices where deterministic noise presents a critical bottleneck.</description>

      <title>Spin-valley 0.7 anomaly in bilayer graphene/WSe$_2$ quantum point contacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a well-resolved 0.7 conductance anomaly at $G = 0.7\times(2e^2/h)$ in bilayer graphene/WSe$_2$ quantum point contacts. Proximity-enhanced spin-orbit coupling splits the four-fold ground state of bilayer graphene into well-separated spin-valley locked Kramers doublets. The anomaly emerges between these opposite spin-valley states. Despite fundamentally different band structure and wavefunction characteristics, the temperature and bias phenomenology closely mirror GaAs systems. In contrast, the parallel magnetic field response differs significantly, confirming the central role of valley degrees of freedom. This opens new pathways to study valley-exchange correlation physics in regimes inaccessible to conventional semiconductors.</description>

      <title>Facile Salt-Assisted Hydrothermal Synthesis of Nanodiamonds from CHO Precursors: Atomic-Scale Mechanistic Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrothermal synthesis offers an economical and scalable way to produce nanodiamonds under relatively mild, low-pressure and low-temperature conditions. However,its sustainability and the detailed mechanisms behind diamond formation in such environments are still not fully understood. In this work, we designed ten hydrothermal synthesis protocols using different CHO-based molecular precursors containing COOH and OH groups, such as organic acids, polyols, sugars, and polysaccharides.The reactions were carried out at 190 degrees Centigrade in chlorinated, strongly alkaline aqueous solutions with alkali and alkaline-earth metal ions. Using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, we confirmed the presence of diamond-specific lattice planes and sp3-hybridized carbon structures. Our results show that the type of precursor, its molecular size, and the ionic composition of the solution play key roles in determining the defect patterns and polymorph distribution in the resulting nanodiamonds. Atomic-scale imaging showed both coherent and incoherent transitions from graphite to diamond, along with gradual lattice compression and complex twinning patterns. These observations provide direct insight into how interfacial crystallography and defect dynamics drive diamond formation in aqueous systems. Overall, the study positions hydrothermal synthesis as a sustainable, chemistry-driven, and tunable approach for creating nanodiamonds tailored for applications in quantum technologies, biomedicine, catalysis, and advanced materials.</description>

      <title>Interface Roughness Scattering Processes in Quantum wells in a Tilted Quantizing Magnetic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scattering processes by the interface roughness in a quantum well in a quantizing magnetic field are considered. An expression for the scattering rate is derived for a magnetic field tilted relative to the quantum well layers. By analyzing this expression, trends in the behavior of the scattering rate are established with variation in the magnetic field strength and orientation, the potential profile of the quantum well, and the interface roughness parameters.</description>

      <title>Universal two-stage dynamics and phase control in skyrmion formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We uncover a universal two-stage dynamics during skyrmion formation and establish its connection to equilibrium phases through the introduction of a chiral correlation $\chi$. Stage I involves stripe coarsening governed by the exchange-to-DMI ratio $J'$, while stage II entails stripe contraction driven by the synergy between $J'$ and the anisotropy-to-DMI ratio $K'$. The magnetic field-to-DMI ratio $B'$ influences both stages. By combining symbolic regression with neural networks, we model the competition and cooperation among these parameters and derive a skyrmion formation criterion, $0.58 K'J' + \mu B'J' &gt; 1$. Our model disentangles their distinct roles: $J'$ sets the stripe width, $K'$ primarily controls the skyrmion size, and $B'$ strongly affects the topological charge. This approach provides a general framework for predicting and controlling magnetic phases in chiral magnets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the thermal transport properties of a mesoscopic device comprising two metallic islands embedded in a two-dimensional electron gas in the integer quantum Hall regime. It is shown that the $2M$ ballistic edge channels connecting the islands to the external reservoirs and the $N$ inter-island channels play a central role in the phenomenon of heat Coulomb blockade. Unlike the single-island case, where the heat flux is reduced by exactly one quantum of thermal conductance, we predict an additional suppression proportional to the factor $M^2/(2N+M)^2$. We further examine a configuration in which the islands are placed between electrodes at different temperatures and identify the conditions under which the Wiedemann-Franz law is violated.</description>

      <title>Ultra-long-range spin coupling in graphene revealed by atomically resolved spin excitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic interactions between localized spins-1/2 play a central role in quantum magnetism, spin-based quantum computing, and quantum simulation. The range and strength of these interactions are key figures of merit. Here, we probe exchange interactions in pairs and trimers of spins-1/2 introduced by chemisorption of individual hydrogen atoms on graphene. Using scanning tunneling microscopy and inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy, supported by large-scale mean-field Hubbard calculations, we demonstrate 3 meV exchange couplings at separations beyond 10 nm, surpassing all prior systems. The couplings can be ferro- or antiferromagnetic depending on the relative sublattice arrangement. Real-space mapping of spin excitation amplitudes enables characterization with atomic-resolution. Through atomic manipulation we extend this control to spin trimers, revealing collective spin excitations when pairwise exchange couplings are comparable.</description>

      <title>Plasmon resonance in a sub-THz graphene-based detector: theory and experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a combined experimental and theoretical study of photovoltage generation in a bilayer graphene (BLG) transistor structure exposed to subterahertz radiation. The device features a global bottom and split top gate, enabling independent control of the band gap and Fermi level, thereby enabling the formation of a tunable p-n junction in graphene. Measurements show that the photovoltage arises primarily through a thermoelectric mechanism driven by heating of the p-n junction in the middle of the channel. We also provide a theoretical justification for the excitation of two-dimensional plasmons at a record-low frequency of 0.13 THz, which manifests itself as characteristic oscillations in the measured photovoltage. These plasmonic resonances, activated by a decrease in charge carrier concentration due to opening of the band gap, lead to a local enhancement of the electromagnetic field and an increase in the carrier temperature in the junction region. The record-low frequency of plasmon resonance is enabled by the low carrier density achievable in the bilayer graphene upon electrical induction of the band gap.</description>

      <title>Controlling the Size of Nanoparticles Using a Magnetic Field: A Sphere Packing Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analytical framework that predicts and controls nanoparticle size through external magnetic fields, uniting first-principles thermodynamics with a sphere packing approach. Calibrated to diamagnetic silver nanoparticles (20 nm at zero field and 5 nm at 250 mT), the model yields a closed-form relation between radius and field that reproduces the observed shift in most-probable size. Within the limits of classical capillarity and spherical demagnetization, the field lowers the nucleation barrier and drives the distribution toward smaller particles. Our results are robust for radii above 3 nm (5740 atoms). Below this scale non-extensive effects likely dominate, as discussed in detail in Supplementary Information. The approach generalizes to both diamagnetic and paramagnetic systems and the limitations expected for very small or ferromagnetically ordered nanoparticles are discussed.</description>

      <title>Non-local synchronization of continuous time crystals in a semiconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synchronization resulting in unified collective behavior of the individual elements of a system that are weakly coupled to each other has long fascinated scientists. Examples range from the periodic oscillation of coupled pendulum clocks to the rhythmic behavior in biological systems. Here we demonstrate this effect in a solid-state platform: spatially remote, auto-oscillating electron-nuclear spin systems in a semiconductor. When two such oscillators separated by up to 40 ${\mu}$m are optically pumped, their individually different frequencies lock to a common value, revealing long-range coherent coupling. For larger separations, the synchronization breaks. The interaction distance matches the electron spin diffusion length, identifying spin transport as the coupling-mediating mechanism and establishing phase coherence over mesoscopic distances. As a consequence, a wide-area optical pump drives all oscillators within the illuminated spot into a single synchronized state, despite their inhomogeneity. This synchronization accounts for the exceptional stability of the resulting auto-oscillations, enabling collective motion in distributed spin systems and paving the way toward coherent spin networks in spintronics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.07140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-sustained oscillators play a central role in the stabilization and synchronization of complex dynamical systems. A number of different physical systems are currently being investigated to clarify the importance of such active components in the quantum realm. Here we explore the properties of a driven dissipative electron-photon hybrid system based on superconducting microwave resonators coupled resonantly to a voltage-biased double quantum dot (DQD). First, we establish a Hopf bifurcation at a critical value of the electron-photon coupling, beyond which an effective negative friction sustains steady limit-cycle oscillations of individual resonators. Second, we show that two such limit-cycle resonators coupled via the same voltage-biased DQD synchronize for small enough frequency detuning. A nonlinear photon Keldysh action is derived by perturbation theory in the effective circuit fine-structure constant, and the limit-cycle dynamics is analyzed in terms of resulting saddle-point, and Fokker-Planck equations. In the Markovian limit of infinite bias voltage, these results are shown to agree well with the solution of a corresponding Lindblad master equation for the DQD resonator system.</description>

      <title>Complementary and Asymmetric Tapered Bent Mid-Infrared Waveguide Arrays for Subwavelength-Pitch Integration and Crosstalk Minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper delivers the first report of a mid-infrared (MIR) waveguide array design that employs complementary and asymmetric tapered Euler-shaped bends. These provide greater fabrication flexibility to achieve subwavelength-pitch integration while reducing crosstalk to below 30 dB across the 3.1 to 3.6 micron wavelength range. Unlike previous designs, which maintained constant waveguide widths, the Euler waveguide bends are characterized by asymmetric and complementary tapered waveguide widths. This approach significantly reduces crosstalk to below 30 dB for both the first and second neighboring waveguides across a 500 nm wavelength range, enhancing the efficiency of optical phased arrays (OPA) with a large field of view, optimizing light propagation and minimizing crosstalk. The waveguide array is fabricated on a silicon-on-insulator platform, with a 2-micron buried oxide layer and a 500 nm-thick silicon layer. The design is highly tolerant to fabrication variations, maintaining consistent performance even with width variations. The spectral responses, simulated using the 3D finite-difference time-domain method, demonstrate negligible coupling and low insertion loss across the wavelength range. This work offers a robust and CMOS-compatible solution for MIR integrated photonic circuits.</description>

      <title>Direct imaging of magnetotransport at graphene-metal interfaces with a single-spin quantum sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetotransport underlines many important phenomena in condensed matter physics, such as the Hall effect and magnetoresistance (MR) effect. Thus far, most magnetotransport studies are based on bulk resistance measurements without direct access to microscopic details of the spatial transport pattern. Here, we report nanoscale imaging of magnetotransport using a scanning single-spin quantum magnetometer, which is demonstrated in a graphene-metal hybrid device at room temperature. By visualizing the current flow at elevated magnetic fields (~0.5 T), we directly observe the Lorentz deflection of current near the graphene-metal interface, which is a hallmark of magnetotransport. Combining the local current distribution with global resistance measurements, we reveal that transport properties of the hybrid are governed by a complex interplay of intrinsic MR around the Dirac cone, carrier hydrodynamics, interface resistance, and the nanoscale device geometry. Furthermore, accessing the local transport pattern across the interface enables quantitative mapping of spatial variations in contact resistance, which is commonly present in electronic devices made from two-dimensional materials yet non-trivial to characterize. Our work demonstrates the potential of nanoscale current imaging techniques for studying complex electronic transport phenomena that are difficult to probe by resistance-based measurements.</description>

      <title>Controlling Quantum Transport in a Superconducting Device via Dissipative Baths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the quantum field-theoretical approach describing the evolution of a quadratic Liouvillian in the basis of Keldysh contour coherent states, we investigate the spectral and transport properties of a dissipative superconducting system coupled to normal Fermi reservoirs. We derive a generalization of the Meir-Wingreen formula and Onsager matrix for a superconducting system subject to an arbitrary number of fermionic baths. Following Kirchhoff's rule, we obtain an expression describing the dissipation induced loss current and formulate modified quantum kinetic equations. For wide-band contacts locally coupled to individual sites, we find that each contact reduces the degeneracy multiplicity of the non-equilibrium steady state by one. These results are numerically verified through several cases of the extended Kitaev model at symmetric points with a single contact. Furthermore, in the linear response regime at low temperatures, we demonstrate that (non-)degenerate non-equilibrium steady states correspond to (non-)quantized conductance peaks. Revisiting a paradigmatic problem of resonant transport in the Majorana mode of the Kitaev model we demonstrate that the dissipation accounts for the zero-bias peak suppression and its asymmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.07320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Faraday waves, typically observed in driven fluids, result from the confluence of nonlinearity and parametric amplification. Here we show that optical pulses can generate analogous phenomena that persist much longer than the pump time-scales in ordered quantum solids. We present a theory of ultrafast light-matter interactions within a symmetry-broken state; dynamical nonlinear coupling between the Higgs (amplitude) and the Goldstone (phase) modes drives an emergent phason texture that oscillates in space and in time: Faraday-Goldstone waves. Calculated signatures of this spatiotemporal order compare well with measurements on K$_{0.3}$MnO$_{3}$; Higgs-Goldstone beating, associated with coherent energy exchange between these two modes, is also predicted. We show this light-generated crystalline state is robust to thermal noise, even when the original Goldstone mode is not. Our results offer a new pathway for the design of periodic structures in quantum materials with ultrafast light pulses.</description>

      <title>Weak localization and universal conductance fluctuations in large area twisted bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study diffusive magnetotransport in highly p-doped large area twisted bilayer graphene samples as a function of twist angle, crossing from 1{\deg} (below), to 20{\deg} (above) the van Hove singularity with 7{\deg} and 9{\deg} samples near the van Hove singularity. We report weak localization in twisted bilayer graphene for the first time. All samples exhibit weak localization, from which we extract the phase coherence length and intervalley scattering lengths, and from that determine that dephasing is caused by electron-electron scattering and intervalley scattering is caused by point defects. We observe signatures of universal conductance fluctuations in the 9{\deg} sample, which has high mobility and is near the van Hove singularity. Further improvements in sample quality and applications to large area moire materials will open new avenues to observe quantum interference effects.</description>

      <title>The ideal limit of rhombohedral graphene: Interaction-induced layer-skyrmion lattices and their collective excitations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.07402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an ideal limit of rhombohedral graphene multilayers. In this limit, we show analytically how short-range repulsion stabilizes a layer-pseudospin skyrmion lattice, which generates an effective magnetic field and gives rise to a Chern band. This establishes the real-space origin of interaction-driven topology in moir\'e rhombohedral graphene. The resulting interaction-induced skyrmion lattice is physically analogous to magnetic skyrmion crystals and hosts a hierarchy of collective excitations naturally described within the framework of skyrmion-lattice dynamics.</description>

      <title>Flat electronic bands from cooperative moir\'e and charge order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The formation of flat electronic bands from long-wavelength superperiodic moir\'e potentials in van der Waals heterostructures underpins the creation and control of a host of highly-tuneable correlated and topological phases. The underlying moir\'e periodicity is, however, typically considered a fixed property of the heterostructure. Here, we show how the development of a charge-density wave (CDW) in one of the constituent materials can create an emergent moir\'e periodicity, realising a superperiodic potential in TiSe$_2$/graphite epitaxial heterostructures with an order-of-magnitude longer wavelength than that expected from the normal-state lattice mismatch. We demonstrate how this drives the formation of a remarkably strong band flattening, which can be readily deactivated by carrier doping across the CDW phase transition, opening new prospects for engineering moir\'e matter by exploiting the rich many-body states of the parent compounds of 2D heterostructures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the properties of two-dimensional materials interfaces with the substrate is necessary for device applications. Surface acoustic wave propagation through the layered material flake on a substrate could provide unique information on the transverse rigidity of the flake-to-substrate interaction. We generate ultrasonic waves by a focused femtosecond laser pulse at the surface of the model system -- fused silica with h-BN flake transferred above. Using an all-optical spatially resolved pump-probe interferometric technique, we measure the spatial dependencies of the surface vertical velocity profiles. Our measurements reveal the appearance of the surface acoustic wave dispersion in the hBN flake region compared to fused silica surface. Multilayer modeling allows us to gain access to longitudinal and shear elastic coupling constants $c^*_{33}$ and $c^*_{44}$ between hexagonal BN and substrate.</description>

      <title>Chiral Cavity Control of the Interlayer Exciton Energy Spectrum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05751v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heterostructures of two-dimensional materials offer a versatile platform to study light-matter interactions of electron and hole gases. By separating electron and hole layers with an insulator long-lived electron-hole bound states known as interlayer excitons can form. We predict that by placing an interlayer exciton in a time-reversal-symmetry-breaking chiral cavity the energy spectrum of an interlayer exciton can be reordered. As a consequence of this reordering the ground state of the interlayer exciton can be driven from an s-orbital to a p-orbital, effectively changing the symmetry of the electron-hole pair. We present a phase diagram showing the couplings and separations required for a p-orbital excitonic ground state where we predict that larger interlayer separations require higher cavity couplings. We expect these results to be relevant for angular-momentum-tunable, single photon emission physics.</description>

Abstract: Heat engines convert thermal energy into mechanical work. We here report the experimental realization of a fully quantum engine that converts quantum coherence into work. A single solid-state spin in diamond is fueled by a coherent bath and cyclically stores energy in a spin quantum battery. We establish quantum-enhanced performance by showing that almost 200$\%$ more work is produced after a few cycle compared to the corresponding classical engine. We obtain concrete criteria for successful coherence-to-work conversion, and highlight the importance of a coherent motor-battery interaction. This device harnesses nonclassical features during all stages of its cycle, and demonstrates the functionality of a nanomachine whose parts are all quantum coherent.</description>

      <title>Do Discrete Fine-Scale Mechanical Models with Rotational Degrees of Freedom Homogenize Into a Cosserat or a Cauchy Continuum?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article answers the question of whether homogenization of discrete fine-scale mechanical models, such as particle or lattice models, gives rise to an equivalent continuum that is of Cauchy-type or Cosserat-type. The study employs the machinery of asymptotic expansion homogenization to analyze discrete mechanical models with rotational degrees of freedom commonly used to simulate the mechanical behavior of heterogeneous solids. The proposed derivation has general validity in both stationary (steady-state) and transient conditions (assuming wavelength much larger that particle size) and for arbitrary nonlinear, inelastic fine-scale constitutive equations. The results show that the unit cell problem is always stationary, and the only inertia term appears in the linear momentum balance equation at the coarse scale. Depending on the magnitude of the local bending stiffness, mathematical homogenization rigorously identifies two limiting conditions that correspond to the Cauchy continuum and the Cosserat continuum. A heuristic combination of these two limiting conditions provides very accurate results also in the transition from one limiting case to the other. Finally, the study demonstrates that cases for which the Cosserat character of the homogenized response is significant are associated with non-physically high fine-scale bending stiffness and, as such, are of no interest in practice.</description>

Abstract: We study the dynamical and spectral characteristics of a quantum three-level ladder system, interacting with a continuous electromagnetic field in one-dimensional open waveguide. Common realization of such systems is a waveguide QED setup ~ -- a superconducting artificial atom (transmon), coupled to an open microwave transmission line. We derive an analytical solution for spontaneous emission of initially excited atom, and use it to study the probability of state detection and spectral density of output photon states. We find that for strong coupling of transmon to a waveguide emitted photons show correlation in frequency and can have the same energies, even if the three-level system is anharmonic.</description>

      <title>Flux-modulated tunable interaction regimes in two strongly nonlinear oscillators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to efficiently simulate a variety of interacting quantum systems on a single device is an overarching goal for digital and analog quantum simulators. In circuit quantum electrodynamical systems, strongly nonlinear superconducting oscillators are typically realized using transmon qubits, featuring a wide range of tunable couplings that are mainly achieved via flux-dependent inductive elements. Such controllability is highly desirable both for digital quantum information processing and for analog quantum simulations of various physical phenomena, such as arbitrary spin-spin interactions. Furthermore, broad tunability facilitates the study of driven-dissipative oscillator dynamics in previously unexplored parameter regimes. In this work, we demonstrate the ability to selectively activate different dynamical regimes between two strongly nonlinear oscillators using parametric modulation. In particular, our scheme enables access to regimes that are dominated by photon-hopping, two-mode squeezing, or cross-Kerr interactions. Finally, we observe level repulsion and attraction between Kerr-nonlinear oscillators in regimes where the nonlinearities exceed the coupling strengths and decay rates of the system. Our results could be used for realizing purely analog quantum simulators to study arbitrary spin systems as well as for exploring strongly nonlinear oscillator dynamics in previously unexplored interaction regimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In an isotopically disordered harmonic chain, phonon transmission attenuates exponentially with distance because of multiple scattering by the isotopic defects. We propose a simple method, which is based on the static structure factor, for arranging the isotopic defects to suppress or enhance phonon scattering within a targeted frequency window, resulting in maximization or minimization of phonon transmission. The phononic transparency and opacity effects are demonstrated numerically from the frequency dependence of the transmission coefficient. We briefly discuss how the underlying concept can be extended to the design of aperiodic superlattices to improve or block phononic transmission.</description>

      <title>Biphoton state generation and engineering with bright hybrid III-V/Silicon photonic devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hybrid photonic circuits, harnessing the complementary strengths of multiple materials, represent a key resource to enable compact, scalable platforms for quantum technologies. In particular, the availability of bright sources of tunable biphoton states is eagerly awaited to meet the variety of applications currently under development. In this work we demonstrate a heterogeneously integrated device that merges biphoton generation and on-chip quantum state engineering, combining an AlGaAs photon-pair source with a CMOS-compatible silicon-on-insulator (SOI) circuit. Photon pairs are generated in the C telecom band via spontaneous parametric down-conversion and transferred to the SOI chip through a multimode evanescent coupling scheme. This design achieves a pair generation rate above 10$^{6}$ s$^{-1}$mW$^{-1}$ and a coincidence-to-accidental ratio up to 600. Crucially, the coupling design induces strong and predictable transformations of the biphoton joint spectral amplitude, enabling complex quantum state engineering entirely on-chip in a compact device compliant with electrical pumping.</description>

      <title>Full Counting Statistics of Yu-Shiba-Rusinov Bound States</title>

Abstract: With the help of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) it has become possible to address single magnetic impurities on superconducting surfaces and to investigate the peculiar properties of the in-gap states known as Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) states. However, until very recently YSR states were only investigated with conventional tunneling spectroscopy, missing the crucial information contained in other transport properties such as shot noise. Here, we adapt the concept of full counting statistics (FCS) to provide a very deep insight into the spin-dependent transport in these hybrid systems. We illustrate the power of FCS by analyzing different situations in which YSR states show up including single-impurity junctions, as well as double-impurity systems where one can probe the tunneling between individual YSR states. The FCS concept allows us to unambiguously identify every tunneling process that plays a role in these situations. Moreover, FCS provides all the relevant transport properties, including current, shot noise and all the cumulants of the current distribution. Our approach can reproduce the experimental results recently reported on the shot noise of a single-impurity junction with a normal STM tip. We also predict the signatures of resonant (and non-resonant) multiple Andreev reflections in the shot noise of single-impurity junctions with two superconducting electrodes. In the case of double-impurity junctions we show that the direct tunneling between YSR states is characterized by a strong reduction of the Fano factor that reaches a minimum value of 7/32, a new fundamental result in quantum transport. The FCS approach presented here can be naturally extended to investigate the spin-dependent superconducting transport in a variety of situations, and it is also suitable to analyze multi-terminal superconducting junctions, irradiated contacts, and many other basic situations.</description>

      <title>Free energy barrier and thermal-quantum behavior of sliding bilayer graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04532v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In multilayer graphene, the stacking order of the layers plays a crucial role in the electronic properties and the manifestation of superconductivity. By applying shear stress, it is possible to induce sliding between different layers, altering the stacking order. Here, focusing on bilayer graphene, we analyze how ionic fluctuations alter the free energy barrier between different stacking equilibria. We calculate the free energy barrier through the state-of-the-art self-consistent harmonic approximation, which can be evaluated at unstable configurations. We find that above 100 K there is a large reduction of the barrier of more than 30% due to thermal vibrations, which significantly improves the agreement between previous first-principles theoretical work and experiments in a single graphite crystal. As the temperature increases, the barrier remains nearly constant up to around 500 K, with a more pronounced decrease only at higher temperatures. Our approach is general and paves the way for systematically accounting for thermal effects in free energy barriers of other macroscopic systems.</description>

      <title>Topological Antenna: A Non-Classical Beam-Steering Micro-Antenna Based on Spin Injection from a Topological Insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16854v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Antennas are the quintessential means to communicate information wirelessly over long distances via electromagnetic waves. Traditional antennas have two shortcomings that have prevented miniaturization: (1) their radiation efficiencies plummet and (2) they radiate isotropically when miniaturized to small fractions of the radiated wavelength. Here, we report a new genre of non-classical antennas that overcome these limitations by employing non-traditional principles and harnessing topological insulators. An alternating charge current of frequency 1-10 GHz injected into a thin film of a three-dimensional topological insulator (3D-TI) injects a spin current of alternating spin polarization into a periodic array of cobalt nanomagnets deposited on the surface of the 3D-TI. This generates spin waves in the nanomagnets, which radiate electromagnetic waves in space, thereby implementing an antenna. The frequency of the electromagnetic wave is the same as that of the current. The antenna dimension is only 0.6-1.8% of the free space wavelength and yet it radiates with an efficiency several orders of magnitude larger than the theoretical limit for conventional antennas. Furthermore, it radiates anisotropically (despite being a "point source") and one can change the anisotropic radiation pattern by changing the direction of the injected alternating charge current, which changes the spin wave patterns within the nanomagnets because of spin-momentum locking in the 3D-TI. This enables beam steering without the use of a phased array. We have overcome several limitations of classical antennas by harnessing the quantum mechanical attributes of a quantum material, namely a 3D-TI.</description>

Abstract: Point-gap topological phases of non-Hermitian systems exhibit exotic boundary states that have no counterparts in Hermitian systems. Here, we develop classification of second-order point-gap topological phases protected by reflection symmetry. Based on this classification, we propose exceptional second-order topological insulators, exhibiting second-order boundary states stabilized by point-gap topology. As an illustrative example, we uncover a two-dimensional exceptional second-order topological insulator with point-gapless corner states. Furthermore, we identify a three-dimensional exceptional second-order topological insulator that features hinge states with isolated exceptional points, representing second-order topological phases intrinsic to non-Hermitian systems. Our work enlarges the family of point-gap topological phases in non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10874v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multiterminal Josephson junctions are a promising platform to study non-trivial topology in engineered quantum systems. Yet, experimentally meaningful insight into what exactly makes these systems topologically non-trivial remains elusive. In this work, we show that zero energy reflectionless scattering modes (RSMs) of the normal scattering matrix result in topological phase boundaries. By analyzing two different setups, we explain the origin of each topological phase boundary and furthermore provide generalizable insight into these systems. The considerations here can be of help for experimentalists as it connects the properties of the normal scattering region to the Andreev bound state spectrum of superconducting junctions in a multiterminal setup.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14518v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-Abelian topological insulators are characterized by matrix-valued, non-commuting topological charges with regard to more than one energy gap. Their descriptions go beyond the conventional topological band theory, in which an additive integer is endowed separately with each (degenerate group of) energy band(s). In this work, we reveal that Floquet (time-periodic) driving could not only enrich the topology and phase transitions of non-Abelian topological matter, but also induce bulk-edge correspondence unique to nonequilibrium setups. Using a one-dimensional (1D), three-band model as an illustrative example, we demonstrate that Floquet driving could reshuffle the phase diagram of the non-driven system, yielding both gapped and gapless Floquet band structures with non-Abelian topological charges. Moreover, by dynamically tuning the anomalous Floquet $\pi$-quasienergy gap, non-Abelian topological transitions inaccessible to static systems could arise, leading to much more complicated relations between non-Abelian topological charges and Floquet edge states. These discoveries put forth the periodic driving as a powerful scheme of engineering non-Abelian topological phases (NATPs) and incubating unique non-Abelian band topology beyond equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Scalable Machine Learning Models for Predicting Quantum Transport in Disordered 2D Hexagonal Materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07983v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce scalable machine learning models to accurately predict two key quantum transport properties, the transmission coefficient T(E) and average local density of states (Average-LDOS) in two-dimensional (2D) hexagonal materials with magnetic disorder. Using a tight binding Hamiltonian combined with the Non-Equilibrium Green's Function (NEGF) formalism, we generate a large dataset of over 400,000 unique configurations across graphene, germanene, silicene, and stanene nanoribbons with varying geometries, impurity concentrations, and energy levels. A central contribution of this work is the development of a geometrydriven, physically interpretable feature space that enables the models to generalize across material types and device sizes. Random Forest regression and classification models are evaluated in terms of accuracy, stability, and extrapolation ability. Regression consistently outperforms classification in capturing continuous transport behavior on in-domain data. However, extrapolation performance degrades significantly, revealing the limitations of tree-based models in unseen regimes. This study highlights both the potential and constraints of scalable ML models for quantum transport prediction and motivates future research into physics-informed or graph-based learning architectures for improved generalization in spintronic and nanoelectronic device design.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20491v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the robustness of Hall conductivity quantization in several insulating systems, exhibiting one scenario where the quantization is not preserved. Specifically, we apply the Kubo formula to topological models with the Hatsugai-Kohmoto interaction. Starting from the many-body degeneracy induced by this interaction in the topological Kane-Mele model, we consider Zeeman fields to select specific states within the ground-state manifold that reveal a non-quantized Hall response, precisely for the case with a Zeeman field diagonal in the bands of the Kane-Mele model. From a physical point of view, this term may mimic a ferromagnetic order that arises naturally when couplings beyond the Hatsugai-Kohmoto interaction are taken into account.</description>

      <title>YSGAG: The Ideal Substrate for YIG in Quantum Magnonics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19044v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum magnonics leverages the quantum properties of magnons to advance nanoscale quantum information technologies. Ferrimagnetic yttrium iron garnet (YIG), known for exceptionally long magnon lifetimes, is a cornerstone material typically grown as thin films on gadolinium gallium garnet (GGG) for lattice matching. However, paramagnetic GGG introduces detrimental damping at low temperatures due to substrate magnetization, undermining quantum applications. Here, we study magnetic damping in a 150$\,$nm-thick YIG film on a yttrium scandium gallium aluminum garnet (YSGAG) substrate, a newly developed diamagnetic alternative to GGG. Using ferromagnetic resonance spectroscopy down to 30$\,$mK, we compare YIG/YSGAG with a conventional YIG/GGG reference system. We demonstrate that the YIG/YSGAG system maintains low damping from 300$\,$K to 30$\,$mK, with $\alpha = 4.29\times10^{-5}$ at room temperature, comparable to the best YIG/GGG films and bulk YIG, with no low-temperature upturn. The diamagnetic substrate eliminates the dissipation mechanisms that dominate on magnetized GGG, preserving low magnetic damping across the full temperature range. Consequently, YSGAG serves as an ideal substrate for YIG films in quantum magnonics and is paving the way for the development of spin-wave-based quantum technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01174v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Critical edge states appear at the bulk gap closing points of topological transitions. Their emergence signify the existence of topologically nontrivial critical points, whose descriptions fall outside the scope of gapped topological matter. In this work, we reveal and characterize topological critical points and critical edge states in non-Hermitian systems. By applying the Cauchy's argument principle to two characteristic functions of a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, we obtain a pair of winding numbers, whose combination yields a complete description of gapped and gapless topological phases in one-dimensional, two-band non-Hermitian systems with sublattice symmetry. Focusing on a broad class of non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chains, we demonstrate the applicability of our theory for characterizing gapless symmetry-protected topological phases, topologically distinct critical points, phase transitions along non-Hermitian phase boundaries and their associated topological edge modes. Our findings not only generalize the concepts of topologically nontrivial critical points and critical edge modes to non-Hermitian setups, but also yield additional insights for analyzing topological transitions and bulk-edge correspondence in open systems.</description>

Abstract: High-fidelity detection of charge transitions in quantum dots (QDs) is a key ingredient in solid state quantum computation. We demonstrate high-bandwidth radio-frequency charge detection in bilayer graphene quantum dots (QDs) using a capacitively coupled quantum point contact (QPC). The device design suppresses screening effects and enables sensitive QPC-based charge readout. The QPC is arranged to maximize the readout contrast between two neighboring, coupled electron and hole QDs. We apply the readout scheme to a single-particle electron-hole double QD and demonstrate time-resolved detection of charge states as well as magnetic field dependent tunneling rates. This promises a high-fidelity readout scheme for individual spin and valley states, which is important for the operation of spin, valley or spin-valley qubits in bilayer graphene.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04562v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The atomistic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation is challenged when modeling spintronic devices where Joule heating is significant, due to its core assumption of a constant magnetization magnitude. Based on a statistical framework that treats the magnetization magnitude as a dynamic variable coupled to a thermal bath, we derive a dynamic Landau-Lifshitz-Bloch-Slonczewski set of equations for torques, that captures the transient, heating-induced demagnetization that occurs during high-current operation. Integrating these dynamic equations and comparing them to their stochastic equivalents reveals that both the energy landscape and switching dynamics in high-anisotropy systems are similarly modified. This approach yields accurate and accelerated predictions of critical currents and switching times.</description>

      <title>Inverse Purcell Suppression of Decoherence in Majorana Qubits via Environmental Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00561v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel approach for optimizing topological quantum devices: instead of merely isolating qubits from environmental noise, we engineer the environment to actively suppress decoherence. For a Majorana qubit in a topological superconducting wire, the exponentially small energy splitting $\epsilon \sim e^{-L/\xi}$ provides protection against local perturbations but renders it highly susceptible to pure dephasing from low-frequency environmental noise. We show that coupling via a parity-conserving operator ($i\gamma_L\gamma_R$) to a bosonic environment yields a dephasing rate $\Gamma_\phi \propto S(\epsilon)$, where $S(\epsilon)$ is the environmental noise power at the qubit splitting frequency. In the experimentally relevant regime where $k_B T \gtrsim \hbar\epsilon$ (with $T \sim 10-100$ mK), the noise power scales as $S(\epsilon) \propto \rho(\epsilon) k_B T/\hbar\epsilon$, leading to a dephasing rate $\Gamma_\phi \propto \rho(\epsilon) T/\epsilon$. This exposes a fundamental challenge: the dephasing rate diverges as $1/\epsilon$ for a standard environment, e.g., a 1D system with linear dispersion where $\rho(\epsilon)$ is constant. We overcome this by designing environments with a suppressed density of states following $\rho_{\text{engineered}}(\epsilon) = \rho_{\text{free}}(\epsilon) (\epsilon/\omega_c)^\alpha$. This creates an ``inverse Purcell effect'' that yields a temperature-independent suppression factor $F_P = (\epsilon/\omega_c)^\alpha$. For $\alpha &gt; 1$, the engineered dephasing rate decreases exponentially with wire length, $\Gamma_{\phi,\text{engineered}} \propto e^{-(\alpha-1)L/\xi}$, meaning longer wires provide better coherence protection. This provides a quantitative design principle where environmental engineering transforms detrimental noise into a tool for coherence stabilization, while respecting fermion parity superselection rules.</description>

      <title>Geometric expansion of fluctuations and average shadows</title>

Abstract: Fluctuations of observables provide unique insights into the nature of physical systems, and their study stands as a cornerstone of both theoretical and experimental science. Generalized fluctuations, or cumulants, provide information beyond the mean and variance of an observable. In this paper, we develop a systematic method to determine the asymptotic behavior of cumulants of local observables as the region becomes large. Our analysis reveals that the expansion is closely tied to the geometric characteristics of the region and its boundary, with coefficients given by convex moments of the connected correlation function: the latter is integrated against intrinsic volumes of convex polytopes built from the coordinates, which can be interpreted as average shadows. A particular application of our method shows that, in two dimensions, the leading behavior of odd cumulants of conserved quantities is topological, specifically depending on the Euler characteristic of the region. We illustrate these results with the paradigmatic strongly-interacting system of two-dimensional quantum Hall state at filling fraction $1/2$, by performing Monte-Carlo calculations of the skewness (third cumulant) of particle number in the Laughlin state.</description>

      <title>Co-Designing Spectral Transformation Oracles with Hybrid Oscillator-Qubit Quantum Processors: From Algorithms to Compilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16029v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We co-design a family of quantum eigenvalue transformation oracles that can be efficiently implemented on hybrid discrete/continuous-variable (qubit/qumode) hardware. To illustrate the oracle's representation-theoretic power and near-term experimental accessibility, we encode a Gaussian imaginary time evolution spectral filter. As a result, we define a continuous linear combination of unitaries block-encoding. Due to the ancillary qumode's infinite-dimensional nature, continuous variable qumodes constitute a powerful compilation tool for encoding continuous spectral functions without discretization errors while minimizing resource requirements. We then focus on the ubiquitous task of preparing eigenstates in quantum spin models. For completeness, we provide an end-to-end compilation which expresses high-level oracles in terms of an experimentally realizable instruction set architecture in both 1D and 2D. Finally, we examine the leading-order effects of physical errors and highlight open research directions. Our algorithms scale linearly with the spatial extent of the target system and are applicable to both near-term and large-scale quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent tensor network method for correlated super-moir\'e matter beyond one billion sites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04373v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Moir\'e and super-moir\'e materials provide exceptional platforms to engineer exotic correlated quantum matter. The vast number of sites required to model moir\'e systems in real space remains a formidable challenge due to the immense computational resources required. Super-moir\'e materials push this requirement to the limit, where millions or even billions of sites need to be considered, a requirement beyond the capabilities of conventional methods for interacting systems. Here, we establish a methodology that allows solving correlated states in systems reaching a billion sites, that exploits tensor-network representations of real-space Hamiltonians and self-consistent real-space mean-field equations. Our method combines a tensor-network kernel polynomial method with quantics tensor cross interpolation algorithm, enabling us to solve exponentially large models, including those whose single particle Hamiltonian is too large to be stored explicitly. We demonstrate our methodology with super-moir\'e systems featuring spatially modulated hoppings, many-body interactions and domain walls, showing that it allows access to self-consistent symmetry broken states and spectral functions of real-space models reaching a billion sites. Our methodology provides a strategy to solve exceptionally large interacting problems, providing a widely applicable strategy to compute correlated super-moir\'e quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Generic deformation channels for critical Fermi surfaces including the impact of collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06945v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper constitutes a sequel to our theoretical efforts to determine the nature of generic low-energy deformations of the Fermi surface of a quantum-critical metal, which arises at the stable non-Fermi liquid (NFL) fixed point of a quantum phase transition. The emergent critical Fermi surface, arising right at the Ising-nematic quantum critical point (QCP), is a paradigmatic example where an NFL behaviour is induced by the strong interactions of the fermionic degrees of freedom with those of the bosonic order parameter. It is an artifact of the bosonic modes becoming massless at the QCP, thus undergoing Landau-damping at the level of one-loop self-energy. We resort to the well-tested formalism of the quantum Boltzmann equations (QBEs) for identifying the excitations. While in our earlier works, we have focused on the collisionless regime by neglecting the collision integral and assuming the bosons to be in equilibrium, here we embark on a full analysis. In particular, we take into account the bosonic part of the QBEs as well, which, however, turn out to have no effect on the solutions. Decomposing the master equation into angular-momentum ($\ell$) channels, the emergent modes are of two types: Fermi-surface deformations with discrete spectra and particle-hole excitations forming a continuous band. The long-lived zero-sound mode, which corresponds to $\ell = 0$, is found to be robust against damping effects. Intriguingly, we have an infinite family of discrete modes corresponding to higher-order harmonics of the net deformation.</description>

      <title>Engineering the Kondo impurity problem with alkaline-earth atom arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14630v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose quantum simulation experiments of the Kondo impurity problem using cold alkaline-earth(-like) atoms (AEAs) in a combination of optical lattice and optical tweezer potentials. Within an ab initio model for atomic interactions in the optical potentials, we analyze hallmark signatures of the Kondo effect in a variety of observables accessible in cold-atom quantum simulators. We identify additional terms not part of the textbook Kondo problem, mostly ignored in previous works and giving rise to a direct competition between spin and charge correlations - strongly suppressing Kondo physics. We show that the Kondo effect can be restored by locally adjusting the chemical potential on the impurity site, and we identify realistic parameter regimes and preparation protocols suited to current experiments with AEA arrays. Our work paves the way for novel quantum simulations of the Kondo problem and offers new insights into Kondo physics in unconventional regimes.</description>

      <title>-Continuum limit of bipartite lattices -- The SSH model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11900v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a continuous non-local model that faithfully replicates the rich topological and spectral features of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model. Remarkably, our model shares the SSH models bulk energy spectrum, eigenstates, and Zak phase, hallmarks of its topological character, while introducing a tunable length-scale a quantifying non-locality. This parameter allows for a controlled interpolation between non-local and local regimes. Furthermore, for a specific value of a the exact spectral equivalence to the discrete SSH model is established. Distinct from previous continuous analogues based on Schr\"odinger or Dirac-type Hamiltonians, our approach maintains chiral symmetry, does not require an external potential and features periodic energy bands. On finite domains, the model supports a flat band with zero energy formed by a countable infinite set of exponentially localized zero-energy edge states of topological origin. Beyond SSH, our method lays the foundation for constructing non-local, continuous analogues of a wide class of bipartite and multipartite lattices, opening new paths for theoretical exploration and new challenges for experimental realization in topological quantum matter.</description>
