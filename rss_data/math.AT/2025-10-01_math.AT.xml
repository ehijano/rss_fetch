      <description>arXiv:2509.26392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This essay explains an approach to the study of smooth manifolds which compares them to presheaves on a category of discs, also known as embedding calculus. We highlight recent work that shows this approach has many desirable properties, as well as recent applications demonstrating its strength.</description>

      <title>Persistence Spheres: Bi-continuous Representations of Persistence Diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce persistence spheres, a novel functional representation of persistence diagrams. Unlike existing embeddings (such as persistence images, landscapes, or kernel methods), persistence spheres provide a bi-continuous mapping: they are Lipschitz continuous with respect to the 1-Wasserstein distance and admit a continuous inverse on their image. This ensures, in a theoretically optimal way, both stability and geometric fidelity, making persistence spheres the representation that most closely mirrors the Wasserstein geometry of PDs in linear space. We derive explicit formulas for persistence spheres, showing that they can be computed efficiently and parallelized with minimal overhead. Empirically, we evaluate them on diverse regression and classification tasks involving functional data, time series, graphs, meshes, and point clouds. Across these benchmarks, persistence spheres consistently deliver state-of-the-art or competitive performance compared to persistence images, persistence landscapes, and the sliced Wasserstein kernel.</description>

      <title>On the Foundations of Approximate Algebra: Axioms, Extensions, and Geometric Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building on the recent works of Inan [4] and Almahareeq-Peters-Vergili [1], we develop a rigorous axiomatic foundation for approximate algebra via an algebra-compatible closure operator $\Phi^{\!*}$ satisfying (C1)-(C4a) together with the balanced multiplicativity axiom (C4b) (and absorption required only for ideals). Our framework encompasses a theory of approximate modules with their isomorphism theorems, the construction of an approximate Zariski topology on the prime spectrum, and a compatible theory of localization. Key results include a $\mathrm{T}_0$ property and a $\mathrm{T}_1$-criterion for the spectrum, an extension-contraction bijection for approximate prime ideals in localizations, and the equality of the approximate prime radical and the nilradical. The theory's utility is illustrated by computing $\mathrm{Spec}_{\!\Phi}(\mathbb{Z})$ for the modular closure $\Phi^{\!*}(A)=\langle A\rangle+m\mathbb{Z}$, which yields a finite discrete space -- in stark contrast to the classical $\mathrm{Spec}(\mathbb{Z})$, which is infinite and not even $\mathrm{T}_1$. We also outline a pathway toward an Approximate Nullstellensatz and record model classes of closures that ensure its evaluation-separation hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Renormalization of Chern-Simons Wilson Loops via Flux Quantization in Cohomotopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the practice of physics model building, the process of renormalization, resummation, and anomaly cancellation is to incrementally repair initially ill-defined Lagrangian quantum field theories. Impressive as this is, one would rather have concisely defined complete theories to begin with, and understand these choices as emergent from fundamental principles. As an instructive example, we recall renormalization choices for Wilson loop observables in abelian Chern-Simons theory. Then we show that these emerge in a novel non-Lagrangian topological completion of 5D Maxwell-Chern-Simons QFT, by means of proper flux quantization in 2-Cohomotopy. This result is a modest cousin, with applications to topologically ordered quantum materials, of the more ambitious flux quantization of 11D supergravity in 4-Cohomotopy ("Hypothesis H").</description>

      <title>Hochschild (co)homology for odd Khovanov arc algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend Hochschild homology and cohomology to quasi-associative algebras, which were defined initially by Albuquerque and Majid and generalized by Naisse and Putyra via grading categories. As an application, we use our construction to give an alternative proof of up-to-sign functoriality for odd Khovanov homology, which was recently proven by Migdail and Wehrli. Our proof generalizes an argument of Khovanov: in doing so, we also give the first proof that the tangle theory of Naisse and Putyra is functorial with respect to tangle cobordisms, up to unit.</description>

      <title>Involutive Brauer groups and Poincar\'e rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use the formalism of Poincar\'e $ \infty $-categories, as developed by Calm\`es-Dotto-Harpaz-Hebestreit-Land-Moi-Nardin-Nikolaus-Steimle, to define and study moduli stacks of line bundles with $ \lambda $-hermitian pairings and of Morita equivalence classes of Azumaya algebras equipped with an involution. Our moduli spaces give rise to enhancements of the ordinary Picard and Brauer groups which incorporate the data of an involution on the base; we will refer to these new invariants as the Poincar\'e Picard group and the Poincar\'e Brauer group. We show that we can recover the involutive Brauer group of Parimala-Srinivas from the Poincar\'e Brauer group when the former is defined; however, they no longer agree even for closed points due to the existence of shifted perfect pairings. A natural context for Poincar\'e Picard and Poincar\'e Brauer groups is a category of highly structured ring spectra which we refer to as Poincar\'e rings. We also compute these invariants for the sphere spectrum and other examples. As a consequence, we deduce a derived enhancement of a classical theorem of Saltman.</description>

      <title>Homotopy theory of stricter $n$-categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We make strict $n$-categories even stricter by requiring they satisfy higher exchange laws governed by Hadzihasanovic's theory of regular directed complexes. We study the first properties of stricter $n$-categories, in particular, we define the Gray product, and prove stability under suspension, which is non-trivial. After reviewing and briefly expanding the theory diagrammatic sets and their associated model structures for $(\infty, n)$-categories, we construct a folk model structure on stricter $n$-categories, show that the walking equivalence coincides with the stricter polygraph generated by the walking equivalence in diagrammatic sets, and finally, that the folk model structure on stricter $n$-categories is right transferred from the diagrammatic model structure along a nerve construction.</description>

      <title>Semisimple Field Theories Detect Stable Diffeomorphism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.10031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.10031v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extending the work of the first author, we introduce a notion of semisimple topological field theory in arbitrary even dimension and show that such field theories necessarily lead to stable diffeomorphism invariants. The main result of this paper is a proof that this 'upper bound' is optimal: To this end, we introduce and study a class of `finite path integral' topological field theories which are semisimple and which generalize well known theories constructed by Dijkgraaf-Witten, Freed and Quinn. We show that manifolds satisfying a certain finiteness condition -- including 4-manifolds with finite fundamental group -- are indistinguishable to these field theories if and only if they are stably diffeomorphic. Subject to these finiteness conditions, such finite path integral theories therefore provide the strongest semisimple TFT invariants possible. These results hold for a large class of ambient tangential structures.
  We discuss a number of applications, including the constructions of unoriented 4-dimensional semisimple field theories which can distinguish unoriented smooth structure and oriented higher-dimensional semisimple field theories which can distinguish certain exotic spheres.
  Along the way, we show that dimensional reductions of finite path integral theories are again finite path integral theories, we utilize ambidexterity in the rational setting, and we develop techniques related to the $\infty$-categorical M\"obius inversion principle of G\'alvez-Carrillo--Kock--Tonks.</description>

      <title>An algebraic model for the constant loops map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18726v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For any simplicial complex $X$ with a total ordering of its vertices, one can construct a chain complex $\mathbb{L}_\bullet(X)$ generated by necklaces of simplices in $X$, which computes the homology of the free loop space of the geometric realization of $X$. Motivated by string topology, we describe two explicit chain maps $C_\bullet(X) \to \mathbb{L}_\bullet(X)$, where $C_\bullet(X)$ denotes the simplicial chains in $X$, lifting the homology map induced by embedding points in $|X|$ into constant loops in the free loop space of $|X|$. One of the maps has a convenient combinatorial description, while the other is described in terms of higher structure on $C_\bullet(X)$.</description>

      <title>Computing the Topological Degree of Maps Between 2-Spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20167v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe an effective method for computing the topological degree of continuous functions $R:S^2 \to S^2$, where $S^2$ is the Riemann sphere. Our approach generalizes the degree formula for rational functions of complex polynomials, $\frac{f}{g}$, without common zeros. To apply our method, it is necessary to represent the function $R$ as the ratio of two continuous complex-valued functions $f$ and $g$ without common zeros. By using the Hopf fibration, this method reduces the problem to computing the winding number of a loop. This enables us to compute the degree of $\frac{f}{g}$ even when $f$ and $g$ are arbitrary continuous complex functions without common zeros, and the fraction has a limit at infinity (which can be finite or infinite). Specifically, if $f$ and $g$ are complex polynomials in $z$ and $\bar{z}$, and the highest-degree homogeneous component of the polynomial with the greater algebraic degree has a finite or infinite limit as $|z|\to\infty$, then the problem reduces to counting the roots of a complex polynomial inside the unit circle, obtained from this component.</description>
