      <title>SATMO: a Multi-Planet Thermal Analysis Tool for CubeSat Missions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The expansion of commercial launch capabilities has significantly increased opportunities for interplanetary small satellite (SmallSat) missions. As researchers plan for more missions beyond Earth, there is a demand for accessible tools that help better predict and understand the thermal effects on their spacecraft in orbital environments around Earth and other bodies. While commercial thermal analysis tools offer high-fidelity modeling capabilities and results, they are often expensive and require extensive training to be used effectively. This paper details a framework for a user-friendly Satellite Thermal Model (SATMO) to support the early stages of space mission planning for CubeSats orbiting Earth and other Solar System bodies. SATMO is an open-source, MATLAB-based, six-node thermal analysis program designed for satellites in low-altitude circular orbits. Although SATMO requires a MATLAB license -- typically inexpensive or institutionally provided in academic settings -- it remains substantially more accessible than professional thermal analysis software. SATMO requires an internet connection for some features but does not rely on additional MATLAB toolboxes. The SATMO modeling approach is validated with the space industry standard Thermal Desktop software, with temperatures comparable to within 1.17$^\circ$C for a 10 cm $\times$ 10 cm $\times$ 10 cm CubeSat in various configurations, orbiting around primary bodies including Earth, Venus, and Mars. An example use case of SATMO is presented with a Mars-orbiting CubeSat to demonstrate its functionalities and the outputs available to users. SATMO offers increased accessibility to satellite thermal modeling for the research community, enabling quick thermal trade studies and interplanetary mission plans.</description>

      <title>The interstellar signature: A computational framework for open source interstellar tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interstellar objects such as 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov offer a unique window into the formation and evolution of other star systems, yet the tracking and analysis of their trajectories remain limited to specialized research institutions. Existing interstellar and solar system datasets are large, complex, and difficult to navigate, reducing accessibility for developers, researchers, and enthusiasts. To address this, we present The Interstellar Signature: a computational framework for open-source interstellar tracking, implemented through a web-based platform.
  Interstellar Signature bridges raw astronomical data and an intuitive, developer-friendly interface. The framework integrates live data streams from public repositories and APIs with physics-based simulation methods to model and visualize the motion of interstellar and solar system objects in real time. The platform supports interactive visualizations, comparative orbital analysis, and modular tools that allow users to explore and extend the system for research, experimentation, or development.
  As an open-source project, the framework encourages collaboration and hands-on engagement with complex datasets. It exists within NexusCosmos, an ecosystem envisioned as a "Linux for the space race," aimed at democratizing access to space science tools and data. By transforming large datasets into visual, interactive, and customizable simulations, Interstellar Signature expands participation in interstellar research and observation.
  Future extensions will add AI-driven trajectory prediction, anomaly detection, and advanced visualization. By combining open-source accessibility with computational rigor, this framework lowers the barrier to interstellar analysis and serves as a step toward bridging professional astronomy and public scientific engagement.</description>

      <title>Microlensing Signatures of Dyson Sphere-like Structures around Primordial Black Holes as Technosignatures of Extraterrestrial Advanced Civilizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the microlensing detectability of extraterrestrial technosignatures originating from Dyson sphere \textendash like structures, such as Dyson Swarms surrounding primordial black holes (PBHs). These hypothetical swarms consist of stochastically varying, partially opaque structures that could modulate standard microlensing light curves through time-dependent transmission effects. We introduce a probabilistic framework that includes a stochastic transmission model governed by variable optical depth and random gap distributions. We perform a parameter scan and generate heatmaps of the optical transit duration. We study the infrared excess radiation and peak emission wavelength as complementary observational signatures. Additionally, we define and analyze the effective optical depth and the anomalous microlensing event rate for these stochastic structures. Our findings provide a new avenue for searching for extraterrestrial advanced civilizations by extending microlensing studies to include artificial, dynamic modulation signatures.</description>

      <title>The HIP 54515 b Superjovian Planet as an Early, Critical Look at the Roman Coronagraph's Performance in the Faint Target Star, Small IWA Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Roman Coronagraph's capabilities in the faint star, small IWA limit has enormous scientific (programmatic) impacts. Testing its performance in this limit provides a first look at challenges that may be encountered with the Habitable Worlds Observatory in imaging rocky planets around the nearest K and M stars. We propose such a rigorous test with the HLC/575nm targeting a newly-discovered superjovian planet HIP 54515 b, whose predicted contrast is $\sim$4.7 $\times$10$^{-8}$--2.5 $\times$10$^{-7}$. The companion lies close to the coronagraph IWA (well interior to the TTR5 performance region) and orbits a V = 6.8 star, near the limit for which the coronagraph may yield deep contrasts. Multiple reference stars are available that will further test CGI's performance as a function of $\Delta$ pitch angle to assess how the telescope's thermal environment impacts contrasts.</description>

      <title>Stellar Multiplicity via Speckle Interferometry with the 3.6 m Devasthal Optical Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional ground-based optical telescopes, even those with large apertures, primarily observe stars, close binaries, and multiple systems as unresolved point sources through photometric measurements. Spectroscopy can identify multiple stellar components within a system, but both techniques are fundamentally limited in resolving stellar surfaces and providing direct angular separations. Although photometric and spectroscopic observations yield critical information on magnitudes/flux, metallicities, and orbital properties, complementary high-angular-resolution methods are required to constrain additional system characteristics, including angular orbital parameters, model-independent distances, radii, and stellar masses. The limitations of these two methods arise due to the Diffraction Limit of the telescopes and atmospheric turbulence. Speckle Interferometry (SI) is a clever and affordable method for ground-based telescopes to work around atmospheric turbulence. In this work, we utilize the speckle images obtained by the 3.6 m DOT and demonstrate the capability of SI to resolve binary systems, measure their orbital separations, and determine their position angles. For systems with faint companions where conventional analysis fails, we employ Bayesian inference to model speckle patterns and estimate orbital parameters with high precision. These results establish the effective methodology for using a medium-sized, 4-m class telescope like the DOT as a high-resolution stellar interferometer and demonstrate the potential of speckle interferometry as a powerful technique to advance optical interferometric studies within Indian astronomy.</description>

      <title>PolySwyft: sequential simulation-based nested sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present PolySwyft, a novel, non-amortised simulation-based inference framework that unites the strengths of nested sampling (NS) and neural ratio estimation (NRE) to tackle challenging posterior distributions when the likelihood is intractable but a forward simulator is available. By nesting rounds of NRE within the exploration of NS, and employing a principled KL-divergence criterion to adaptively terminate sampling, PolySwyft achieves faster convergence on complex, multimodal targets while rigorously preserving Bayesian validity. On a suite of toy problems with analytically known posteriors of a dim(theta,D)=(5,100) multivariate Gaussian and multivariate correlated Gaussian mixture model, we demonstrate that PolySwyft recovers all modes and credible regions with fewer simulator calls than swyft's TNRE. As a real-world application, we infer cosmological parameters dim(theta,D)=(6,111) from CMB power spectra using CosmoPower. PolySwyft is released as open-source software, offering a flexible toolkit for efficient, accurate inference across the astrophysical sciences and beyond.</description>

      <title>Thermal design of focal plane assembly of wavefront camera for exoplanet imaging corona module</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The focal plane assembly of wavefront camera is the key imaging device of wavefront detection camera and the key load of the exoplanet imaging coronagraph module. In order to ensure the imaging quality and reduce the dark current and thermal noise, it is necessary to effectively dissipate the heat of the focal plane CCD and other high-power electronic devices to ensure the working performance and reliability of the focal plane assembly. Based on the limited space and cooling resources, this paper adopts the flexible graphene heat conducting cable and grooved heat pipes, and carries out detailed thermal design and thermal analysis of its cooling path. The finite element model is established by thermal analysis software and thermal simulation is carried out. in that steady state, the work temperature range of the CCD chip is -12.8 to -10.9 celsius, which meets the temperature control index, and the work temperatures of other components are also within the design requirements, which indicate that the thermal design scheme is reasonable and feasible, and meets the task requirements.</description>

      <title>The impact of lunar topography on the 21-cm power spectrum for grid-based arrays : Insights for the Dark-ages EXplorer (DEX)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Dark Ages (DA) provides a crucial window into the physics of the infant Universe, with the 21-cm signal offering the only direct probe for mapping out the three-dimensional distribution of matter at this epoch. To measure this cosmological signal, the Dark-ages EXplorer (DEX) has been proposed as a compact, grid-based radio array on the lunar farside. The minimal design consists of a 32 $\times$ 32 array of 3-m dipole antennas, operating in the $7 - 50$ MHz band. A practical challenge on the lunar surface is that the antennas may get displaced from their intended positions due to deployment imprecisions and non-coplanarity arising from local surface undulations. We present, for the first time, an end-to-end simulation pipeline, called SPADE-21cm, that integrates a sky model with a DA 21-cm signal model simulated in the lunar frame and incorporating lunar topography data. We study the effects of both lateral (xy) and vertical (z) offsets on the two-dimensional power spectra across the $7 - 12$ MHz and $30 - 35$ MHz spectral windows, with tolerance thresholds derived only for the latter. Our results show that positional offsets bias the power spectrum by $10 - 30$ per cent relative to the expected 21-cm power spectrum during DA. Lateral offsets within $\sigma_{xy}/\lambda \lesssim 0.027$ (at 32.5 MHz) keep the fraction of Fourier modes with strong contamination (&gt; 50 per cent of the signal) to less than 1 per cent, whereas vertical height offsets affect a larger fraction. This conclusion holds for the 21-cm window with $k_\parallel &gt; 0.5$ $h$ cMpc$^{-1}$ over the range of $k_\perp = 0.003 - 0.009$ $h$ cMpc$^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Improvements to the NSO Farside Mapping Pipeline: Noise Reduction Updates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The National Solar Observatory (NSO)'s Farside Pipeline is a critical tool of the space weather industry. It enables the detection and tracking of solar active regions that have rotated to the farside (invisible surface) of the Sun without relying on direct observational platforms such as satellites. By applying the technique of helioseismic holography to continuous Doppler images of the front side (visible surface), the pipeline infers the size and location of these regions through the acoustic signatures. These farside maps, produced using data from the NSO's GONG Network, allow scientists and solar observers to monitor the behavior of solar active regions. They support efforts to protect vital telecommunications and national interest infrastructure. While the data from this pipeline are widely used to many scientific, industrial, and national security applications, global helioseismic monitoring remains a developing field, with ongoing refinements in methodology and reliability. In this report, we will outline the updates made to the NSO's Farside Pipeline which have resulted in more accurate and consistent helioseismic maps, strengthening its value for both operational forecasting and scientific research.</description>

      <title>Estimation of the Hubble parameter from unedited compact object merger catalogues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, constraints on the Hubble parameter using multiple dark sirens have been made,relying on a galaxy catalogue, correlations between the mass and redshift distributions, or both. Those studies have typically used only significant gravitational wave candidates. In this work, we present a framework for cosmological inference that bypasses per-candidate parameter estimation, uses only detection-level information. This allows the population inference from a candidate list produced directly by a search pipeline, without additional selection cuts. Our method is particularly suited to extracting information from marginal candidates, which are essential for probing the distant universe.</description>

      <title>Magnetic activity of ultracool dwarfs in the LAMOST DR11</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultracool dwarfs consist of lowest-mass stars and brown dwarfs. Their interior is fully convective, different from that of the partly-convective Sun-like stars. Magnetic field generation process beneath the surface of ultracool dwarfs is still poorly understood and controversial. To increase samples of active ultracool dwarfs significantly, we have identified 962 ultracool dwarfs in the latest LAMOST data release, DR11. We also simulate the Chinese Space Station Survey Telescope (CSST) low-resolution slitless spectra by degrading the LAMOST spectra. A semi-supervised machine learning approach with an autoencoder model is built to identify ultracool dwarfs with the simulated CSST spectra, which demonstrates the capability of the CSST all-sky slitless spectroscopic survey on the detection of ultracool dwarfs. Magnetic activity of the ultracool dwarfs is investigated by using the H$\alpha$ line emission as a proxy. The rotational periods of 82 ultracool dwarfs are derived based on the Kepler/K2 light curves. We also derive the activity-rotation relation of the ultracool dwarfs, which is saturated around a Rossby number of 0.12.</description>

      <title>Machine learning classification of baseband data of CHIME FRBs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are bright millisecond radio pulses. Their origin is still unknown in the field of astronomy. A notable distinction among FRBs is that some sources repeat, while others appear to be non-repeating events. Interestingly, repeating FRBs tend to exhibit broader temporal widths and narrower spectral bandwidths compared to non-repeat events, suggesting they may arise from different physical mechanisms. However, current radio telescopes have limited coverage and sensitivity, which hinders a complete survey with continuous long-term monitoring. This issue makes it difficult to confirm repeat activity and potentially leads to misclassification of repeaters as non-repeaters; these are referred to as repeater candidates. To address this, machine learning techniques have emerged as a useful tool for classifying distinct FRB types in previous studies. In this study, we utilize the CHIME/FRB baseband catalog with three orders of magnitude better time resolution than the intensity catalog. Measured fluences are available in the baseband catalog, while only upper limits are reported in the intensity catalog. We apply machine learning to the baseband catalog to evaluate classification outcomes. We identify 15 repeater candidates among 122 non-repeating FRBs in the baseband catalog. Additionally, our classification identifies 31 sources previously categorized as repeater candidates as non-repeaters, highlighting a significant difference from the prior work. Of these repeater candidates, 14 overlap with previous findings, while 1 is newly identified in this work. Notably, one of our candidates was confirmed as a repeater by CHIME/FRB. Follow-up observations for the 14 candidates are highly encouraged.</description>

      <title>Time-Averaged Template for Stochastic Gravitational-Wave Background Detection in Space-Based Interferometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) poses significant challenges for data analysis and parameter inference in future space-based gravitational-wave missions, such as LISA and Taiji, as it appears as an additional stochastic component along with instrumental noise. Previous studies have developed various approaches to distinguish the SGWB from instrumental noise, often under simplified assumptions such as static or equal-arm configurations. However, in realistic scenarios, time-varying arm-lengths introduce additional complexities that require careful modeling. In this work, we investigate the impact of template construction on SGWB parameter estimation under realistic orbital configurations. Using the simulated SGWB signals and dominant instrumental noise sources, we compare three template strategies: time-averaged template constructed from segmented data, equal-arm template, and a template treating the arm-lengths as a free parameter. Our results show that the time-averaged template yield improves parameter estimation accuracy under time-varying arm-lengths, whereas introducing the effective arm-length as a free parameter increases estimation uncertainty. These findings highlight the importance of realistic template construction for high-precision SGWB analysis in future space-based missions.</description>

      <title>Astrometric Reconnaissance of Exoplanetary Systems (ARES). I. Methodology validation with HST point-source images of Proxima Centauri</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first results of the Astrometric Reconnaissance of Exoplanetary Systems (ARES) project, aimed at validating and characterizing candidate exoplanets around the nearest systems using multi-epoch Hubble Space Telescope (HST) data. In this first paper, we focus on Proxima Centauri, leveraging archival and recent HST observations in point-source imaging mode. We refine the geometric-distortion calibration of the HST detector used, and develop a robust methodology to derive high-precision astrometric parameters by combining HST measurements with the Gaia DR3 catalog. We determine Proxima's position, proper motion, and parallax with uncertainties at the $\sim$0.4-mas, 50-$\mu$as yr$^{-1}$, and 0.2-mas level, respectively, achieving consistent results with what measured by Gaia within $\sim$1$\sigma$. We further investigate the presence of the candidate exoplanet Proxima c by analyzing the proper-motion anomaly derived from combining long-term HST-based and short-term Gaia astrometry. Under the assumption of a circular, face-on orbit, we obtain an estimated mass of $m_c = 3.4^{+5.2}_{-3.4}$ $M_\odot$, broadly consistent with radial-velocity constraints but limited by our current uncertainties. These results establish the foundation for the next phase of ARES, which will exploit HST spatial-scanning observations to achieve astrometric precisions of a few tens of $\mu$as and enable a direct search for astrometric signatures of low-mass companions.</description>

      <title>Euclid Quick Data Release (Q1): Euclid spectroscopy of QSOs. 1. Identification and redshift determination of 3500 bright QSOs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08803</link>

Abstract: The slitless spectroscopy mode of the NISP onboard Euclid has enabled efficient spectroscopy of objects within a large FoV. We present a large and homogeneous sample of bright quasars identified from the Euclid Quick Data Release (Q1) by combining high-purity candidate selections from Gaia and WISE with the NISP spectra. Through visual inspection of the Euclid spectra of these quasar candidates, we identify approximately 3500 quasars with reliable redshifts at $0&lt;z\lesssim 4.8$. We generate the first Euclid composite spectrum of quasars covering rest-frame NUV to NIR wavelengths without telluric lines, which will be pivotal to NIR quasar spectral analysis. We obtain an empirical spectroscopic depth of $J_{\rm E}\lesssim 21.5$ and $H_{\rm E}\lesssim 21.3$ at the sensitivity of the Wide Field Survey, beyond which the number of securely identified quasars declines sharply. We analyse VIS morphologies using Sersic and CAS metrics, and a deep-learning PSF fraction to track nuclear dominance. At low redshift ($z&lt;0.5$), obvious host structures are common and a single Sersic model fits about half of the sources; at intermediate redshift ($0.5&lt;z&lt;2$), the nuclear component dominates, with 90% of the Sersic fits saturating at the upper index limit. In this intermediate redshift regime, $f_{\rm PSF}$ is available, and we use it as a more reliable compactness measure than the single-Sersic and CAS parameters to quantify nuclear versus host emission. We also explore the novel Euclid NIR colour space and discuss the role of these quasars in refining AGN selection techniques for future Euclid data releases. Our results highlight the potential of Euclid spectroscopy to advance quasar surveys and enable the construction of more complete AGN catalogues. The spectroscopic bright quasar catalogue of this work, and the composite quasar spectrum, will be available at https://cdsarc.cds.unistra.fr/. (abridged)</description>

      <title>Robust Extraction of Global 21 cm Spectrum from Experiments with a Chromatic Beam Based on Physics-Motivated Error Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13102v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The extraction of the sky-averaged 21 cm signal from Cosmic Dawn and the Epoch of Reionization faces significant challenges. The bright and anisotropic Galactic foreground, which is 4 - 5 orders of magnitude brighter than the 21 cm signal, when convolved with the inevitably chromatic beam, introduces additional spectral structures that can easily mimic the real 21 cm signal. In this paper, we investigate the signal extraction for a lunar-orbit experiment, where the antenna moves fast in orbit and data from multiple orbits have to be used. We propose a physics-motivated and correlated modeling of both the foreground and the measurement errors. By dividing the sky into multiple regions according to the spectral index distribution and accounting for the full covariance of modeling errors, we jointly fit both the foreground and the 21 cm signal using simulated data for the Discovering the Sky at the Longest wavelength lunar orbit experiment. This method successfully extracts the 21 cm signals of various amplitudes from the simulated data even for a testing antenna with a relatively high level of chromaticity. This approach, which is robust against moderate beam chromaticity, significantly relaxes the stringent design and manufacturing requirements for the antenna, offering a practical solution for future 21 cm global signal experiments either on the ground or in space.</description>

      <title>Photo-$z$ Estimation with Normalizing Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10032v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate photometric redshift (photo-$z$) estimation is a key challenge in cosmology, as uncertainties in photo-$z$ directly limit the scientific return of large-scale structure and weak lensing studies, especially in upcoming Stage IV surveys. The problem is particularly severe for faint galaxies with sparse spectroscopic training data. In this work, we introduce nflow-$z$, a novel photo-$z$ estimation method using the powerful machine learning technique of normalizing flow. nflow-$z$ explicitly models the redshift probability distribution conditioned on the observables such as fluxes and colors. We build two nflow-$z$ implementations, dubbed cINN and cNSF, and compare their performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of nflow-$z$ on several datasets, including a CSST mock, the COSMOS2020 catalog, and samples from DES Y1, SDSS, and DESCaLS. Our evaluation against state-of-the-art algorithms shows that nflow-$z$ performs favorably. For instance, cNSF surpasses Random Forest, Multi-Layer Perceptron, and Convolutional Neutral Network on the CSST mock test. We also achieve a ~30% improvement over official results for the faint DESCaLS sample and outperform conditional Generative Adversarial Network and Mixture Density Network methods on the DES Y1 dataset test. Furthermore, nflow-$z$ is computationally efficient, requiring only a fraction of the computing time of some of the competing algorithms. Our algorithm is particularly effective for the faint sample with sparse training data, making it highly suitable for upcoming Stage IV surveys.</description>

      <title>Euclid: Quick Data Release (Q1) -- A photometric search for ultracool dwarfs in the Euclid Deep Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22497v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a catalogue of 5306 new ultracool dwarf (UCD) candidates in the three Euclid Deep Fields in the Q1 data release. They range from late M to late T dwarfs, and include 1200 L and T dwarfs. A total of 546 objects have been spectroscopically confirmed, including 329 L dwarfs and 26 T dwarfs. We also provide empirical Euclid colours as a function of spectral type. Our UCD selection criteria are based only on colour ($I_\mathrm{E}-Y_\mathrm{E}&gt;2.5$). The combined requirement for optical detection and stringent signal-to-noise ratio threshold ensure a high purity of the sample, but at the expense of completeness, especially for T dwarfs. The detections range from magnitudes 19 and 24 in the near-infrared bands, and extend down to 26 in the optical band. We discuss Euclid's capability to identify UCD candidates based on its photometric passbands. The average surface density of detected UCDs on the sky is approximately 100 objects per $\mathrm{deg}^2$, including 20 L and T dwarfs per $\mathrm{deg}^2$. This leads to an expectation of at least 1.4 million ultracool dwarfs in the final data release of the Euclid Wide Survey, including at least $300\,000$ L dwarfs, and more than 2600 T dwarfs, using the strict selection criteria from this work.</description>

      <title>From Flash to Crater: Morphological and Spectral Analysis of the Brightest Lunar Impact on 11 September 2013 using LRO Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14442v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive morphological and spectrophotometric analysis of the lunar impact that occurred on September 11, 2013, based on pre- and post-event observations by the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO). The crater formed exhibits a rim-to-rim diameter of $35 \pm 0.7$ m, a depth of $4.9 \pm 0.4$ m, and an ejecta blanket extending over 2 km with an area of approximately $7 \times 10^{5}\,$m$^{2}$. The ejecta shows a pronounced asymmetry and, assuming uniform distribution, an average thickness limit of $\sim 2$ mm. Spectral analysis using WAC images reveals a consistent reddening of the central ejecta region, with an average 16.54 % increase in spectral slope between 321 nm and 643 nm, marking the first reported detection of color changes resulting from a lunar impact. We evaluated several scaling laws and found that the Gault et al. (1974) formulation most accurately reproduces the observed crater size. Furthermore, luminous efficiency values below $\eta = 2 \times 10^{-3}$ and higher projectile densities are most consistent with the morphology of the ejecta. The impact direction inferred from this pattern is not compatible with the radiant of the September $\varepsilon$-Perseids stream. Moreover, an independent probability analysis yields a greater than 96 % likelihood that the event was caused by a sporadic meteoroid. Our results also demonstrate the potential of WAC imagery for the automated detection of new lunar craters, which can improve statistical estimates of the current impact flux. This methodology offers a powerful complement to high-resolution imaging, with important implications for both lunar safety and planetary defense.</description>
