      <title>Bayesian Parametric Portfolio Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parametric Portfolio Policies (PPP) estimate optimal portfolio weights directly as functions of observable signals by maximizing expected utility, bypassing the need to model asset returns and covariances. However, PPP ignores policy risk. We show that this is consequential, leading to an overstatement of expected utility and an understatement of portfolio risk. We develop Bayesian Parametric Portfolio Policies (BPPP), which place a prior on policy coefficients thereby correcting the decision rule. We derive a general result showing that the utility gap between PPP and BPPP is strictly positive and proportional to posterior parameter uncertainty and signal magnitude. Under a mean--variance approximation, this correction appears as an additional estimation-risk term in portfolio variance, implying that PPP overexposes when signals are strongest and when risk aversion is high. Empirically, in a high-dimensional setting with 242 signals and six factors over 1973--2023, BPPP delivers higher Sharpe ratios, substantially lower turnover, larger investor welfare, and lower tail risk, with advantages that increase monotonically in risk aversion and are strongest during crisis episodes.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Discount Factors with Cross-Asset Spillovers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a unified framework that links firm-level predictive signals, cross-asset spillovers, and the stochastic discount factor (SDF). Signals and spillovers are jointly estimated by maximizing the Sharpe ratio, yielding an interpretable SDF that both ranks characteristic relevance and uncovers the direction of predictive influence across assets. Out-of-sample, the SDF consistently outperforms self-predictive and expected-return benchmarks across investment universes and market states. The inferred information network highlights large, low-turnover firms as net transmitters. The framework offers a clear, economically grounded view of the informational architecture underlying cross-sectional return dynamics.</description>
