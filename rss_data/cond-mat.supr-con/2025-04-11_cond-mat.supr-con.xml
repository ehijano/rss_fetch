      <title>Coexistence of topologically trivial and non-trivial Yu-Shiba-Rusinov bands in magnetic atomic chains on a superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Majorana zero modes (MZMs) have been proposed as a promising basis for Majorana qubits offering great potential for topological quantum computation. Such modes may form at the ends of a magnetic atomic chain on a superconductor. Typically only a single MZM may be present at one end of the chain, but symmetry may protect multiple MZMs at the same end. Here, we study the topological properties of Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) bands of excitations in Mn chains constructed on a Nb(110) and on a Ta(110) substrate using first-principles calculations and scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy experiments. We demonstrate that even and odd YSR states with respect to mirroring on the symmetry plane containing the chain have different dispersions, and both of them may give rise to MZMs separately. Although the spin-orbit coupling leads to a hybridization between the bands, multiple MZMs may still exist due to the mirror symmetry. These findings highlight the influence of symmetries on interpreting the spectroscopic signatures of candidates for MZMs.</description>

      <title>Magnetic excitations in Nd$_{n+1}$Ni$_{n}$O$_{3n+1}$ Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates observed via resonant inelastic x-ray scattering</title>

Abstract: Magnetic interactions are thought to play a key role in the properties of many unconventional superconductors, including cuprates, iron pnictides, and square-planar nickelates. Superconductivity was also recently observed in the bilayer and trilayer Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates, whose electronic structure is expected to differ from that of cuprates and square-planar nickelates. Here we study how electronic structure and magnetic interactions evolve with the number of layers, $n$, in thin film Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates Nd$_{n+1}$Ni$_{n}$O$_{3n+1}$ with $n=1,\:3$, and 5 using resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS). The RIXS spectra are consistent with a high-spin $|3d^8 \underline{L} \rangle$ electronic configuration, resembling that of La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$NiO$_4$ and the parent perovskite, NdNiO$_3$. The magnetic excitations soften to lower energy in the structurally self-doped, higher-$n$ films. Our observations confirm that structural tuning is an effective route for altering electronic properties, such as magnetic superexchange, in this prominent family of materials.</description>

      <title>Phonon fluctuation diagnostics: Origin of charge order in AV$_3$Sb$_5$ kagome metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The microsopic origin of the charge-density wave (CDW) in AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A = K, Rb, Cs) kagome metals remains a longstanding question, often revolving around electron-phonon coupling and purely electronic mechanisms involving Van Hove scenarios, nesting, and sublattice interference. To reveal the processes driving the CDW transition, we combine ab-initio calculations analysis of the phonon self-energy and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). Our momentum-resolved study, supported by ARPES data, reveals that lattice instabilities in the V-135 family of kagome metals appear to also be driven by electronic states far from high-symmetry points, where these states exhibit the strongest coupling with the phonon modes responsible for the CDW distortion. Footing on an interpretation scheme based on phonon fluctuation diagnostics, our work challenges and revises theories that so far have exclusively attributed CDW formation to nesting effects close to the Fermi level.</description>

      <title>Localized quasiparticles in a fluxonium with quasi-two-dimensional amorphous kinetic inductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Disordered superconducting materials with high kinetic inductance are an important resource to generate nonlinearity in quantum circuits and create high-impedance environments. In thin films fabricated from these materials, the combination of disorder and the low effective dimensionality leads to increased order parameter fluctuations and enhanced kinetic inductance values. Among the challenges of harnessing these compounds in coherent devices are their proximity to the superconductor-insulator phase transition, the presence of broken Cooper pairs, and the two-level systems located in the disordered structure. In this work, we fabricate tungsten silicide wires from quasi-two-dimensional films with one spatial dimension smaller than the superconducting coherence length and embed them into microwave resonators and fluxonium qubits, where the kinetic inductance provides the inductive part of the circuits. We study the dependence of loss on the frequency, disorder, and geometry of the device, and find that the loss increases with the level of disorder and is dominated by the localized quasiparticles trapped in the spatial variations of the superconducting gap.</description>

      <title>Multi-orbital two-particle self-consistent approach -- strengths and limitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00962v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extending many-body numerical techniques which are powerful in the context of simple model calculations to the realm of realistic material simulations can be a challenging task. Realistic systems often involve multiple active orbitals, which increases the complexity and numerical cost because of the large local Hilbert space and the large number of interaction terms or sign-changing off-diagonal Green's functions. The two-particle self-consistent approach (TPSC) is one such many-body numerical technique, for which multi-orbital extensions have proven to be involved due to the substantially more complex structure of the local interaction tensor. In this paper we extend earlier multi-orbital generalizations of TPSC by setting up two different variants of a fully self-consistent theory for TPSC in multi-orbital systems. We first investigate the strengths and limitations of the approach analytically and then benchmark both variants against dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) and D-TRILEX results. We find that the exact behavior of the system can be faithfully reproduced in the weak-coupling regime, while at stronger couplings the performance of the two TPSC variants strongly depends on details of the system.</description>

      <title>Crossed Andreev reflection in collinear $p$-wave magnet/triplet superconductor junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13783v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Crossed Andreev reflection (CAR) is a fundamental quantum transport phenomenon that holds significant implications for spintronics and superconducting devices. However, its experimental detection and enhancement remain challenging. Recently, magnetic materials exhibiting $p$-wave magnetic ordering, distinct from conventional spin-orbit coupling, referred to as $p$-wave magnets, have attracted considerable interest. In this work, we propose a junction consisting of $p$-wave magnets and a triplet superconductor as a promising platform to enhance CAR. The setup features a triplet superconductor sandwiched between two collinear $p$-wave magnets rotated by $180^\circ$ relative to each other, allowing for precise control over transport processes. We demonstrate that CAR can dominate over electron tunneling (ET) within specific parameter regimes, such as the orientation angle of the $p$-wave magnets and their chemical potential. Enhanced CAR occurs when the constant energy contours of the two spins in the $p$-wave magnets are well-separated. Furthermore, the conductivities display Fabry-P\'erot-type oscillations due to interference effects, with CAR diminishing as the length of the superconductor exceeds the decay length of the wavefunctions. These findings underscore the potential of collinear $p$-wave magnet-superconductor junctions as a robust platform for the experimental investigation and enhancement of CAR.</description>
