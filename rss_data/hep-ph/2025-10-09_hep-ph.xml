      <title>Energy-Energy Flow Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jet substructure provides one of the most exciting new approaches for searching for physics in and beyond the Standard Model at the Large Hadron Collider. Modern jet substructure searches are often performed with Neural Network (NN) taggers which study the jets' radiation distributions in great detail, far beyond what is theoretically described by parton shower generators. While this represents a great opportunity, as NNs look deeper into the structure of jets they become increasingly sensitive both to perturbative and non-perturbative theoretical uncertainties. It is therefore important to be able to control which aspects of both regimes the networks focus on, and to develop techniques for quantifying these uncertainties. In this paper we take two steps in this direction: First, we introduce EnFNs, a generalization of the Energy Flow Networks (EFNs) which directly probes higher point correlations in jets, as motivated by recent advances in the study of energy correlators. Second, we introduce a number of techniques to quantify and visualize their robustness to non-perturbative corrections. We highlight the importance of such considerations in a toy study incorporating systematics into a search, and maximizing for the network's discovery significance, as opposed to absolute tagging performance. We hope this study continues the interest in understanding the role QCD systematics play in Machine Learning applications and opens the door to a better interplay between theory and experiment in HEP.</description>

      <title>Perspectives and Questions: Toward an Expansive Agenda for Particle Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Global celebration greeted the 2012 discovery at CERN's Large Hadron Collider of a particle that matches the textbook description of the Higgs boson. That achievement validated a remarkable chain of theoretical reasoning that combined the prescriptive notion of electroweak gauge symmetry with a simple, but \emph{ad hoc}, embodiment of spontaneous symmetry breaking. It was made possible by generational triumphs of accelerator art and experimental technique, and by human resourcefulness and collaboration on a global scale, all sustained by the enlightened support of many governments and institutions.
  Some imagine that, once the keystone of the standard model of particle physics has been set, our subject is over. Others worry that we may be at an impasse because no comparable wonders have appeared, leaving us without well-defined clues to a more complete paradigm. I am neither so readily satisfied nor so {easily} discouraged: we have so much more to learn! This essay surveys many questions that, taken together, constitute an inspiring array of opportunities to enhance our understanding of the physical world.</description>

      <title>Lepton flavor from a horizontal symmetry in a slice of AdS$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We build a model of lepton flavor in a slice of AdS$_5$. We add to the 5D SM fields a set of neutrino fields, as well as a horizontal U(1) symmetry and a flavon field, all propagating in the bulk. The electroweak and U(1) symmetries are spontaneously broken by a potential localized on the infrared boundary. We show that in a flavor anarchic scenario, by suitable choice of the 5D masses and the U(1) charges, the masses of the SM leptons and the PMNS matrix can be naturally generated. The neutrino masses are Dirac like, with a normal ordered hierarchical spectrum, $\Delta m_{32}^2\approx m_3^2$, $\Delta m_{21}^2\approx m_2^2\gg m_1^2$, and a suppressed $\theta_{13}$ mixing angle. We find configurations where the charged lepton mixing angles are suppressed by powers of the Cabibbo angle ($\lambda_C$) relative to vanilla anarchic partial compositeness, consequently reducing CP and lepton flavor violation. Specifically, the Wilson coefficient for the electron electromagnetic dipole moment exhibits $\lambda_C^2$ suppression, while those governing $\mu\to e\gamma$ and $\mu-e$ vector operators are suppressed by $\lambda_C^{3/2}$ compared to the anarchic scenario without U(1) horizontal symmetry.</description>

      <title>On the role of cosmological constant in modeling hadrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Einsteins gravity with a cosmological constant $\Lambda$ in four dimensions can be reformulated as a $\lambda \phi^4$ theory characterized solely by the dimensionless coupling $\lambda \propto G_N \Lambda$ ($G_N$ being Newton's constant). The quantum triviality of this theory drives $\lambda \to 0$, and a deviation from this behavior could be generated by matter couplings. Here, we study the significance of this conformal symmetry and its breaking in modeling non-perturbative QCD. The hadron spectra and correlation functions are studied holographically in an $AdS_5$ geometry with induced cosmological constants on four-dimensional hypersurface. Our analysis shows that the experimentally measured spectra of the $\rho$ and $a_1$ mesons, including their excitations and decay constants, favour a non-vanishing induced cosmological constant in both hard-wall and soft-wall models. Although this behavior is not as sharp in the soft-wall model as in the hard-wall model, it remains consistent. Furthermore, we show that the correction to the Gell-Mann-Oakes-Renner relation has an inverse dependence on the induced cosmological constant, underscoring its significance in holographic descriptions of low-energy QCD.</description>

      <title>Impact of relativistic corrections to high-pT prompt-psi(2S) production at hadron colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study relativistic corrections to prompt psi(2S) at high pT in hadron colliders. Our calculation employs leading-power factorization with Fragmentation Functions (FFs) computed in nonrelativistic QCD and evolved to next-to-leading-logarithmic accuracy. Relativistic corrections increase the cross section significantly for the gluon channel, but moderately for charm. We perform a full analysis of uncertainties. We observe a good agreement with both ATLAS and CMS cross sections without the need of higher-order color-octet contributions. The polar anisotropy is found to be close to CMS data.</description>

      <title>Classification of $g$-modes for neutron stars with a strong transition: Novel universal relation including slow stable twin stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the behavior of the non-radial gravity-pulsation discontinuity mode ($g$-mode) in hybrid compact stars with a strong first-order phase transition, which can give rise to twin-star configurations in some cases. These modes are of utmost relevance since they can be potentially excited in isolated as well as binary neutron star systems in the inspiral phase, thus allowing us to indirectly detect the presence of a deconfinement transition. In order to do this, we consider four categories of twin stars that present distinctive features in their equations of state. We employ the constant speed of sound parametrization, which accounts for a sharp phase transition between confined hadronic matter and deconfined quark matter. Then, working within the relativistic Cowling approximation to obtain the frequencies of non-radial oscillations, we find that, depending on the twin star category, the relations between $g$-mode frequencies and masses as well as tidal deformabilities display a highly distinct behavior across the diverse twin star categories that appear in the slow hadron-quark conversion regime. This distinct phenomenology provides smoking-gun evidence to clearly distinguish and further classify hybrid stars with a strong transition from purely hadronic stars using upcoming gravitational-wave data. In addition, we present for each of the categories studied the relation between the $g$-mode frequency and the normalized energy density jump. Finally, we present a novel universal relationship for the discontinuity $g$-mode able to encompass the four categories including long branches of slow stable twin stars and address its asteroseismological capability.</description>

      <title>A geometrical approach to neutrino oscillation parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a geometric hypothesis for neutrino mixing: twice the sum of the three mixing angles equals $180^\circ$, forming a Euclidean triangle. This condition leads to a predictive relation among the mixing angles and, through trigonometric constraints, enables reconstruction of the mass-squared splittings. The hypothesis offers a phenomenological resolution to the $\theta_{23}$ octant ambiguity, reproduces the known mass hierarchy patterns, and suggests a normalized geometric structure underlying the PMNS mixing. We show that while an order-of-magnitude scale mismatch remains (the absolute splittings are underestimated by $\sim 10\times$), the triangle reproduces mixing ratios with notable accuracy, hinting at deeper structural or symmetry-based origins. We emphasize that the triangle relation is advanced as an empirical, phenomenological organizing principle rather than a result derived from a specific underlying symmetry or dynamics. It is testable and falsifiable: current global-fit values already lie close to satisfying the condition, and improved precision will confirm or refute it. We also outline and implement a simple $\chi^2$ consistency check against global-fit inputs to quantify agreement within present uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Nuclear and electron scattering by neutrinos and dark matter in condensed systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-threshold dark matter detectors, in particular cryogenic detectors based on dielectric materials, are among the best tools for probing sub-GeV dark matter masses. In the coming years detectors of this type will become sensitive to solar neutrino scattering. Previous work has shown that, for dark matter scattering at very low recoil energies, one must include collective excitations of the electrons in the solid. In this work, we have computed the collective excitations due to neutrino scattering on electrons and nuclei. We find the full electron-scattering response at leading order is captured by 5 structure factors and identify the leading component with the electron energy-loss function. Then, using silicon and germanium detectors as an example, we perform a dark matter sensitivity study and compute their respective neutrino floors. Lastly, we show that these detectors are sensitive to unexplored scenarios of beyond-Standard Model neutrino physics, within the exposure required to reach the neutrino floor.</description>

      <title>Thermal photon emission from quark-gluon plasma: 1+1D magnetohydrodynamics results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate thermal photon production in the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) under strong magnetic fields using a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) framework. Adopting the Bjorken flow model with power-law decaying magnetic fields $\mathbf{B}(\tau) = \mathbf{B}_0 (\tau_0/\tau)^a$ (where $a$ controls the decay rate, $B_0 = \sqrt{\sigma} T_0^2$, and $\sigma$ characterizes the initial field strength), we employ relativistic ideal fluid dynamics under the non-resistive approximation. The resulting QGP temperature evolution exhibits distinct $a$- and $\sigma$-dependent behaviors. Thermal photon production rates are calculated for three dominant processes: Compton scattering with $q\bar{q}$ annihilation (C+A), bremsstrahlung (Brems), and $q\bar{q}$ annihilation with additional scattering (A+S). These rates are integrated over the space-time volume to obtain the photon transverse momentum $(p_T)$ spectrum. Our results demonstrate that increasing $a$ enhances photon yields across all $p_T$, with $a \to \infty$ (super-fast decay) providing an upper bound. For $a = 2/3$, larger $\sigma$ suppresses yields through accelerated cooling, whereas for $a \to \infty$, larger $\sigma$ enhances yields via prolonged thermal emission. Low-$p_T$ photons receive significant contributions from all QGP evolution stages, while high-$p_T$ photons originate predominantly from early times. The central rapidity region $(y=0)$ dominates the total yield. This work extends photon yield studies to the MHD regime under strong magnetic fields, elucidating magnetic field effects on QGP electromagnetic signatures and establishing foundations for future investigations of magnetization and dissipative phenomena.</description>

      <title>Latent Representation Learning in Heavy-Ion Collisions with MaskPoint Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A central challenge in high-energy nuclear physics is to extract informative features from the high-dimensional final-state data of heavy-ion collisions (HIC) in order to enable reliable downstream analyses. Traditional approaches often rely on selected observables, which may miss subtle but physically relevant structures in the data. To address this, we introduce a Transformer-based autoencoder trained with a two-stage paradigm: self-supervised pre-training followed by supervised fine-tuning. The pretrained encoder learns latent representations directly from unlabeled HIC data, providing a compact and information-rich feature space that can be adapted to diverse physics tasks. As a case study, we apply the method to distinguish between large and small collision systems, where it achieves significantly higher classification accuracy than PointNet. Principal component analysis and SHAP interpretation further demonstrate that the autoencoder captures complex nonlinear correlations beyond individual observables, yielding features with strong discriminative and explanatory power. These results establish our two-stage framework as a general and robust foundation for feature learning in HIC, opening the door to more powerful analyses of quark--gluon plasma properties and other emergent phenomena. The implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/Giovanni-Sforza/MaskPoint-AMPT.</description>

      <title>Dissecting the moat regime at low energies I: Renormalization and the phase structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dense QCD matter can feature a moat regime, where the static energy of mesons is minimal at nonzero momentum. Valuable insights into this regime can be gained using low-energy models. This, however, requires a careful assessment of model artifacts. We therefore study the effects of renormalization and in-medium modifications of quark-meson interaction on the moat regime. To capture the main effects, we use a two-flavor quark-meson model at finite temperature and baryon density in the random phase approximation. We put forward a convenient renormalization scheme to account for the nontrivial momentum dependence of meson self-energies and discuss the role of renormalization conditions for renormalization group consistent results on the moat regime. In addition, we demonstrate and that its extent in the phase diagram critically depends on the interaction of quarks and mesons.</description>

      <title>A two scalar triplets model as common origin for dark matter, neutrino masses, baryon asymmetry and inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an extension of the standard model (SM) by two SU(2) triplet scalars and an inert SU(2) doublet. We demonstrate that this setup can simultaneously produce an inflaton and baryon asymmetry in the early universe, provide a dark matter candidate and explain the smallness of neutrino masses. The two triplets are particularly important as they become mediators for the production of dark matter and the generation of lepton asymmetry, as well as contribute an inflaton. The inert doublet results in a dark matter candidate. The required CP-violation for lepton asymmetry is obtained by interference between the triplet mediators that communicate the dark sector to the SM sector. More precisely, the complex Breit-Wigner propagators of the triplets and their mixing, result in an asymmetric production of leptons and antileptons that is boosted before dark matter freeze-out. In this case, simultaneously achieving enough dark matter relic abundance and proper matter-antimatter asymmetry limits the available parameter space of the model. Moreover, the scalar triplets are coupled non-minimally to gravity and give rise to the inflaton. We calculate the inflationary parameters and check that we can obtain predictions consistent with Planck constraints from 2018. We also perform an analysis of the reheating for the inflaton decays/annihilations to relativistic SM particles.</description>

      <title>FIRE 7: Automatic Reduction with Modular Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: FIRE7 is a major update to the FIRE program for integration-by-parts (IBP) reduction of Feynman integrals. A large part of improvements is related to the automatic reduction and reconstruction with the modular arithmetic approach, while the performance of the classical rational polynomial approach is also significantly increased. An improved presolve algorithm performs Gaussian elimination to simplify IBP identities before substituting numerical indices as in the Laporta algorithm. Various new command line tools are included to facilitate tasks such as applying an IBP reduction table to reduce a loop integrand as a linear combination of individual integrals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $Z_2$ gauging of $Z_N$ symmetry can enforce certain elements of the fermion Yukawa couplings to vanish. We have performed a systematical study of texture zero patterns of lepton mass matrices in the minimal seesaw model, and we present all the possible patterns of the charged lepton Yukawa coupling $Y_E$, neutrino Yukawa coupling $Y_{\nu}$, right-handed neutrino mass matrix $M_R$ and the light neutrino mass matrix $M_{\nu}$ which can be derived from the $Z_2$ gauging of $Z_N$ symmetry. The realization of the textures with the maximum number of zeros and the second maximum number of zeros from non-invertible symmetry is studied, and the phenomenological implications in neutrino oscillation are discussed.</description>

      <title>Rolling with modular symmetry: quintessence and de Sitter in heterotic orbifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22781v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modular invariance is a fundamental symmetry in string compactifications, constraining both the structure of the effective theory and the dynamics of moduli and matter fields. It has also gained renewed importance in the context of swampland conjectures and, independently, flavour physics. We investigate a modular-invariant scalar potential arising from heterotic orbifolds, where the flavour structure and moduli dynamics are jointly shaped by the underlying geometry. Focusing on a string-inspired, two-moduli truncation, we uncover a rich vacuum structure featuring anti-de Sitter minima and unstable de Sitter saddle points. We identify large regions in moduli space supporting multifield hilltop quintessence consistent with observations. All solutions satisfy refined swampland de Sitter bounds. Our results illustrate how modular symmetry can guide the construction of controlled, string-motivated quintessence scenarios within consistent effective theories.</description>

      <title>New ultralight scalar particles and the mass-radius relation of white dwarfs -- the important role of Sirius B</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the equation of state for two classes of new ultralight particles, a scalar field coupling to electrons and a light $\mathbb{Z}_\mathcal{N}$ QCD axion field coupling to nucleons. Both are potential candidates for dark matter. Using the scalar modified equations of state, we calculate models for white dwarf stars and compare their radii and masses with observed mass-radius data. The comparison results in stringent constraints on the masses of the particles and the coupling parameters. For a wide range of particle masses and coupling parameters, constraints from the white dwarf equation of state surpass existing limits, outperforming also dedicated laboratory searches. The remarkable accuracy of modern white-dwarf mass-radius relation data, exemplified by Sirius B, now allows stringent tests of dense-matter physics and constraints on new particle scenarios.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Cosmic Superstrings and the Overshoot Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We exploit the techniques of dynamical systems to study the cosmological evolution of cosmic fundamental strings and effective strings arising from branes wrapped on internal cycles. We also include the whole potential of the volume modulus characterised by an early time run-away towards a late time minimum. We analyse the overshoot problem with and without radiation, and find that the presence of an initial population of strings arising from NS5-branes wrapped around 4-cycles is enough to ensure that the modulus stabilises in its late time minimum, even in the absence of radiation. The reason is the transfer of energy between the modulus and the effective strings caused by the fact that their tension depends on the volume modulus. Interestingly, we find that the energy density of cosmic superstrings is generically very large when the modulus is oscillating around its minimum, opening up the possibility of a detectable gravitational wave signal. We also find no evidence of an efficient resonant enhancement of cosmic superstrings due to an oscillating tension in the late time minimum.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes and their Mass Spectra: The Effects of Mergers and Accretion within Stasis Cosmologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A variety of processes in the very early universe can give rise to a population of primordial black holes (PBHs) with an extended mass spectrum. For certain mass spectra of this sort, it has been shown that the evaporation of these PBHs into radiation can drive the universe toward an epoch of cosmological stasis which can persist for a significant number of $e$-folds of cosmological expansion. However, in general, the initial mass spectrum which characterizes a population of PBHs at the time of production can subsequently be distorted by processes such as mergers and accretion. In this paper, we examine the effects that these processes have on the spectra that lead to a PBH-induced stasis. Within such stasis models, we find that mergers have only a negligible effect on these spectra within the regime of interest for stasis. We likewise find that the effect of accretion is negligible in many cases of interest. However, we find that the effect of accretion on the PBH mass spectrum is non-negligible in situations in which this spectrum is particularly broad. In such situations, the stasis epoch is abridged or, in extreme cases, does not occur at all. Thus accretion plays a non-trivial role in constraining the emergence of stasis within scenarios which lead to extended PBH mass spectra.</description>

      <title>Diagnosing the Properties and Evolutionary Fates of Black Hole and Wolf-Rayet X-ray Binaries as Potential Gravitational Wave Sources for the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: IC 10 X-1, NGC 300 X-1, and Cyg X-3 represent a unique class of X-ray binaries consisting of a stellar-mass black hole (BH) accreting material from a Wolf-Rayet (WR) star companion. These systems are particularly intriguing due to their short orbital periods (less than 1.5 d), making them promising progenitors of gravitational wave (GW) sources detectable by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) network. With a newly implemented prescription for accretion efficiency in the standard Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) framework and a corrected treatment of dynamical tides, we present for the \textit{first} time detailed binary evolution models to diagnose their properties at different evolutionary states and evaluate their fates as potential GW sources detectable by the LVK network. With additional constraints on the observed properties of IC 10 X-1 and NGC 300 X-1, we determine that the upper limit of the BH mass in these systems (IC 10 X-1: $M_{\rm BH} \lesssim 25\, M_\odot$, NGC 300 X-1: $M_{\rm BH} \lesssim 15\, M_\odot$) is much lower than previously estimated. Both systems are expected to form binary black holes (BBHs) that will merge within a Hubble time, unless the BH in NGC 300 X-1 has a mass of $9\,M_\odot$, the lower limit estimated in a previous study based on the continuum-fitting method employing a relativistic slim-disc model. For Cyg X-3, we find that the upper limit on the BH spin magnitude cannot exceed 0.6. Interestingly, the WR star in Cyg X-3 is likely to form a lower-mass gap BH, and the resulting binary BH system will merge within the Hubble time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ the SMASH transport model to provide event-by-event initial conditions for the energy-momentum tensor and conserved charge currents in hydrodynamic simulations of relativistic heavy-ion collisions. We study the fluctuations and dynamical evolution of three conserved charge currents (net baryon, net electric charges, and net strangeness) with a 4D lattice-QCD-based equation of state, NEOS-4D, in the hydrodynamic phase. Out-of-equilibrium corrections at the particlization are generalized to finite densities to ensure the conservation of energy, momentum, and the three types of charges. These theoretical developments are integrated within X-SCAPE as a unified framework for studying the nuclear matter properties in the Beam Energy Scan program.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1910.08561v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A number of proposed extensions of the Standard Model include new strongly interacting dynamics, in the form of SU(N) gauge fields coupled to various numbers of fermions. Often, these extensions allow N = 3 as a plausible choice, or even require N = 3, such as in twin Higgs models, where the new dynamics is a "copy" of QCD. However, the fermion masses in such a sector are typically different from (often heavier than) the ones of real-world QCD, relative to the confinement scale. Many of the strong interaction masses and matrix elements for SU(3) at heavy fermion masses have already been computed on the lattice, typically as a byproduct of the approach to the physical point of real QCD. We provide a summary of these relevant results for the phenomenological community.</description>

      <title>Radiative neutrino masses from dim-7 SMEFT: a simplified multi-scale approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14268v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lepton-number-violating interactions occur in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) at odd dimensions starting from the dimension-5 Weinberg operator. Although the operators at dimension-7 and higher are more suppressed by the heavy new scale, they can be crucial when traditional seesaw mechanisms leading to tree-level dimension-5 contributions are absent. We identify all minimal tree-level UV-completions for dimension-7 $\Delta L=2$ SMEFT operators without covariant derivatives and propose a new simplified approach for estimating the radiative neutrino masses arising from such operators. This dimensional-regularisation-based approach provides a more accurate estimate for the loop neutrino masses when the new physics fields are hierarchical in mass, as compared to the cut-off-regularisation-based approach often employed in the literature. This allows us to identify viable regions of parameter space in the full list of relevant simplified models close to the current limits set by neutrinoless double beta decay and the LHC that would previously have been thought to be excluded by neutrino-mass constraints.</description>

      <title>A coupled-channel perspective analysis on bottom-strange molecular pentaquarks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01077v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: At present work, we systematically study various bottom-strange molecular pentaquarks to search for possible bound states and resonances by adopting one-boson-exchange model within complex scaling method. According to our calculations, we predict several bound and resonant states for bottom baryon $Y_{b}(\Lambda_b,\Sigma_b) \bar K^{(*)}$ and $Y_{b} K^{(*)}$ systems. In particular, a bound state in the $I(J^P)=1/2(1/2^-)$ $\Sigma_{b}\bar{K}/\Lambda_{b}\bar{K}^*/\Sigma_{b}\bar{K}^*$ system may correspond to the particle $\Xi_{b}(6227)$. Meanwhile, the predicted bound state with $6303\sim6269~\rm{MeV}$ in the $I(J^P)=1/2(1/2^-)\Sigma_bK/\Lambda_bK^*/\Sigma_bK^*$ system is flavor exotic and does not appear in the spectroscopy of conventional baryons, which provides a practical way to clarify the nature of particle $\Xi_b(6227)$. We highly hope that our proposals can offer helpful information for the future experimental searches.</description>

      <title>Energy Correlators Beyond Angles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17218v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Energy correlators are theoretically simple and physically intuitive observables that bridge experimental and theoretical particle physics. They have for example enabled the most precise jet substructure determination of the strong coupling constant to date, and recent proposals suggest that they may be used to precisely determine of the top quark mass with calculable, small theoretical uncertainties. However, existing energy correlators all measure correlations in angles between particles, from which other observables such as mass must be inferred through potentially complicated procedures. In this work, we generalize energy correlators to enable straightforward measurements of non-angular correlations, which we call Energy Weighted Observable Correlations (EWOCs). To enforce collinear safety, EWOCs quantify correlations between subjets rather than particles. The subjet radius can be tuned to control both the physical scales probed by EWOCs and their sensitivity to non-perturbative physics. We focus on the phenomenologically relevant example of the mass EWOC, which measures mass correlations between pairs of subjets, in the task of extracting mass scales from jets. In jet substructure determinations of the mass of a hadronically-decaying W boson, we show that the mass EWOC outperforms the angle-based energy correlator, and performs comparably to the soft-drop groomed jet mass. As a first exploration of the theoretical properties of EWOCs, we also calculate the mass EWOC on light-quark jets and compare to results obtained with Pythia.</description>

      <title>Prospects of future MeV telescopes in probing weak-scale Dark Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04907v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Galactic weak-scale Dark Matter (DM) particles annihilating into lepton-rich channels not only produce gamma-rays via prompt radiation but also generate abundant energetic electrons and positrons, which subsequently emit through bremsstrahlung or inverse Compton scattering (collectively called `secondary-radiation photons'). While the prompt gamma-rays concentrate at high-energy, the secondary emission falls in the MeV range, which a number of upcoming experiments (AMEGO, E-ASTROGAM, MAST...) will probe. We investigate the sensitivity of these future telescopes for weak-scale DM, focusing for definiteness on observations of the galactic center. We find that they have the potential of probing a wide region of the DM parameter space which is currently unconstrained. Namely, in rather optimistic configurations, future MeV telescopes could probe thermally-produced DM with a mass up to the TeV range, or GeV DM with an annihilation cross section 2 to 3 orders of magnitude smaller than the current bounds, precisely thanks to the significant leverage provided by their sensitivity to secondary emissions. We comment on astrophysical and methodological uncertainties, and compare with the reach of high-energy gamma ray experiments.</description>

      <title>Improved Constraints on Pion Fragmentation Functions from Simulated Electron-Ion Collider Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16053v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a quantitative assessment of the anticipated impact of future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) measurements on the extraction of parton-to-pion fragmentation functions (FFs). Our analysis combines simulated semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering (SIDIS) pseudo-data at EIC energies of 45 GeV and 140 GeV with existing single-inclusive electron-positron annihilation (SIA) and SIDIS experimental data. The pion fragmentation functions are determined at next-to-leading-order (NLO) accuracy using a perturbative QCD framework and a neural network parametrization. Uncertainties are rigorously estimated through Monte Carlo sampling, accounting for both experimental errors and variations in input parton distribution functions. Our results demonstrate that incorporating EIC pseudo-data reduces their uncertainties, especially at medium to large momentum fractions ($z$). This improvement is particularly pronounced for the gluon and selected quark FFs, highlighting the substantial role that EIC measurements will play in achieving high-precision extractions of FFs and informing future experimental and theoretical developments in collider physics.</description>

      <title>Feasibility of measuring the speed of sound of the quark-gluon plasma from the multiplicity and mean $p_T$ of ultracentral heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20765v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mean transverse momentum $\langle p_T \rangle$ of hadrons has been observed experimentally and in numerical simulations to have a power-law dependence on the hadronic multiplicity $N$ in ultracentral relativistic heavy-ion collisions: $\langle p_{T} \rangle \propto N^{b_{\rm UC}}$. It has been put forward that this exponent $b_{\rm UC}$ is the speed of sound of quark-gluon plasma measured at a temperature determined from $\langle p_T \rangle$. We study step by step the connection between (i) the energy and entropy of hydrodynamic simulations and (ii) experimentally measurable observables. We show that an argument based on energy and entropy should yield an exponent equal to the pressure over energy density $P/\varepsilon$, rather than the speed of sound $c_s^2$; however, we also observe that $\langle p_T \rangle$ and $N$ are not sufficiently accurate proxies for the energy and entropy to make this possible in practice. From simulations, we find that the exponent $b_{\rm UC}$ is significantly different whether the ''effective volume'' is strictly constant or not, a condition that cannot be enforced experimentally. Additional tests using a modified equation of state find that the exponent $b_{\rm UC}$ exhibits a variable degree of correlations with the speed of sound and with $P/\varepsilon$, but is not an accurate measurement of either quantity in general.</description>

      <title>Quantum Information meets High-Energy Physics: Input to the update of the European Strategy for Particle Physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00086v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Some of the most astonishing and prominent properties of Quantum Mechanics, such as entanglement and Bell nonlocality, have only been studied extensively in dedicated low-energy laboratory setups. The feasibility of these studies in the high-energy regime explored by particle colliders was only recently shown and has gathered the attention of the scientific community. For the range of particles and fundamental interactions involved, particle colliders provide a novel environment where quantum information theory can be probed, with energies exceeding by about 12 orders of magnitude those employed in dedicated laboratory setups. Furthermore, collider detectors have inherent advantages in performing certain quantum information measurements, and allow for the reconstruction of the state of the system under consideration via quantum state tomography. Here, we elaborate on the potential, challenges, and goals of this innovative and rapidly evolving line of research and discuss its expected impact on both quantum information theory and high-energy physics.</description>

      <title>Inflection Point Inflation in Supergravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07769v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the inflection point inflation generated by a polynomial superpotential and a canonical K\"ahler potential under the supergravity framework, where only one chiral superfield is needed. We find that the special form of the scalar potential limits the inflationary Hubble parameter to values $\lesssim 10^{10}\, \textrm{GeV}$ and the inflaton mass to $\lesssim 10^{11} \, \textrm{GeV}$. We obtain analytic results for small field cases and present numerical results for large field ones. We find the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r&lt;10^{-8}$ is always suppressed in these models, while the running of spectral index $\alpha\approx \mathcal{O}(-10^{-3})$ may be testable in next-generation CMB experiments. We also discuss the possible effects of SUSY breaking Polonyi term presented in the superpotential where we find a general upper bound for the SUSY breaking scale for a given value of the Hubble parameter.</description>

      <title>Semileptonic decays of doubly charmed or bottom baryons to single heavy baryons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17030v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the semileptonic decays of baryons containing double charm or double bottom quarks, focusing on their transitions to single heavy baryons through three-point QCD sum rule framework. In our calculations, we take into account nonperturbative operators with mass dimensions up to five. We calculate the form factors associated with these decays, emphasizing the vector and axial-vector transition currents in the corresponding amplitude. By applying fitting functions for the form factors based on the squared momentum transfer, we derive predictions for decay widths and branching ratios in their possible lepton channels. These findings offer valuable insights for experimentalists exploring semileptonic decays of doubly charm or bottom baryons. Perhaps they can be validated in upcoming experiments like LHCb. These investigations contribute to a deeper understanding of the decay mechanisms in these baryonic channels.</description>

      <title>Fast numerical evaluation of dark matter direct detection event rates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19714v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mathematical expression for the dark matter nuclear recoil event rate in a detector consists of a six dimensional integral over the velocity distribution of dark matter in the detector frame, and over the recoil momentum of the nucleus. While a significant part of this integral can be solved in closed form under traditional assumptions of the standard halo model and/or isotropic detector response, analysis of alternate assumptions is conventionally impeded by the inefficiency of multidimensional numerical integration methods. In this work we introduce a novel, fast and efficient algorithm for direct detection event rate computations. This algorithm takes advantage of a closed form expression for the Radon transform of three dimensional Zernike functions, which are used as basis functions for the velocity distribution. We demonstrate an implementation of this algorithm ZebraDM (https://github.com/sebsassi/zebradm), which is typically faster than an optimized numerical integration approach by a factor between $10^2$ and $10^4$.</description>

      <title>The Dark Matter Diffused Supernova Neutrino Background</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03882v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider neutrinos scattering off Milky Way dark matter and the impact of this scattering on supernovae neutrinos. This can take the form of attenuation on the initial flux of neutrinos and a time-delayed flux of scattered neutrinos. Considering dark matter masses above 100 MeV and past Milky Way supernovae, we find this time-delayed flux is nearly constant in time. We call this flux the Dark Matter Diffused Supernova Neutrino Background (DMDSNB), and use Super-K limits on the Diffuse Supernova Neutrino Background (DSNB) flux to set limits on the dark matter-neutrino scattering cross section. We find $\sigma_{\rm DM-\nu}/m_{\rm DM} \lesssim 2.4 \times 10^{-24} \mathrm{cm^2}$/GeV for $m_{\rm DM} \gtrsim 1$ GeV, which is the strongest bound to date on dark matter-neutrino scatterings at MeV energies, and stronger than bounds set from SN1987A neutrino attenuation by an order of magnitude. We end by discussing how the DMDSNB could be distinguished from the DSNB.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07946v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Models of Dark Matter must contend with the fact that the presence of electroweak symmetry breaking along the thermal evolution of the Universe modifies the masses, interactions and, thus, the thermally averaged cross sections. We study in detail the impact of taking (not taking) the presence of the electroweak symmetry breaking into account in the calculations of the Dark Matter relic density, providing a model-independent measure of such differences. By focusing on a particular model, we show that ignoring this effect can lead to the inclusion (exclusion) of wrong (viable) regions of parameter space.</description>

      <title>$\lambda$ and $\rho$ Regge trajectories for the pentaquark $P_{cc\bar{c}bb}$ in the diquark-triquark picture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01005v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose the Regge trajectory relations for the fully heavy pentaquark $P_{cc\bar{c}bb}$ utilizing both diquark and triquark Regge trajectory relations. Using these new relations, we discuss four series of Regge trajectories: the $\rho_1$-, $\rho_2$-, $\lambda_1$-, and $\lambda_2$-trajectories. We provide rough estimates for the masses of the $\rho_1$-, $\rho_2$-, $\lambda_1$-, and $\lambda_2$-excited states. Except for the $\lambda_1$-trajectories, the complete forms of the other three series of Regge trajectories for the pentaquark $P_{cc\bar{c}bb}$ are lengthy and cumbersome. We show that the $\rho_1$-, $\rho_2$-, and $\lambda_2$-trajectories can not be obtained by simply imitating the meson Regge trajectories because mesons have no substructures. To derive these trajectories, pentaquark's structure and substructure should be taken into consideration. Otherwise, the $\rho_1$-, $\rho_2$-, and $\lambda_2$-trajectories must rely solely on fitting existing theoretical or future experimental data. Consequently, the fundamental relationship between the slopes of the obtained trajectories and constituents' masses and string tension will become unobvious, and the predictive power of the Regge trajectories would be compromised. Moreover, we show that the lengthy complete forms of the $\rho_1$-, $\rho_2$-, and $\lambda_2$-trajectories can be well approximated by the simple fitted formulas. Four series of Regge trajectories for the pentaquark $P_{cc\bar{c}bb}$ all exhibit a behavior of $M{\sim}x^{2/3}$, where $x=n_{r_1},n_{r_2},l_1,l_2,N_{r_1},N_{r_2},L_1,L_2$. All four series of trajectories exhibit concave downward behavior in the $(M^2,\,x)$ plane.</description>

      <title>Z and Higgs Factory Implications of Two Higgs Doublets with First-Order Phase Transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18555v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the potential of future electron-positron colliders, such as FCC-ee and CEPC, to probe 2-Higgs-doublet models (2HDMs) that facilitate a strong first-order electroweak phase transition (SFOEWPT), a necessary condition for electroweak baryogenesis. Focusing on a 2HDM in the CP-conserving limit, we identify parameter regions consistent with an SFOEWPT and evaluate their compatibility with projected precision electroweak and Higgs measurements, as well as searches for exotic Higgs bosons. We show that radiative corrections to $e^+e^-\to hZ$ production introduce deviations in the cross section that are resolvable with the anticipated sub-percent precision at lepton colliders even when experimental outcomes of the LHC and $Z$ pole measurements are in agreement with the SM. This underscores the opportunities of a precision lepton collider to explore BSM quantum corrections to the Higgs sector more broadly.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10243v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of triply heavy baryons ($\Omega_{ccc}$, $\Omega_{bbb}$, $\Omega_{bcc}$, and $\Omega_{bbc}$) within the nonrelativistic quark model, employing the Gaussian expansion method to calculate mass spectra up to $D$-wave states. Our analysis represents the most complete treatment to date for this model, incorporating full angular momentum mixing effects. While our predictions for low-lying states agree well with lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) results, we find systematically lower masses for excited states compared to lattice calculations. Using the obtained wave functions, we estimate radiative decay widths up to $1D$ states, revealing significant differences from previous theoretical work. Additionally, we identify and resolve several misconceptions in prior treatments of triply heavy baryon spectroscopy, particularly symmetry constraint and wave function construction in three-quark systems. These results provide crucial information for future experimental searches and theoretical investigations of triply heavy baryon systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10791v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider generation from the vacuum of a scalar charged field in a rigidly rotating frame. Adding an external magnetic field opens the way to Bose condensation of the field. This phenomenon has been studied for external uniform magnetic field occupying the whole volume of the uniformly rotating cylindrical system of finite radius $R$ with a Dirichlet boundary condition imposed on it. Besides continuing this study, we consider the field formed by a flux tube of small radius. We find numerical solutions of the Ginzburg-Pitaevskii equation for the charged scalar field, the critical rotation frequencies, the mean radii and the condensate energies, and compare them with those found in a linearization scheme and with approximate analytical solutions. We show that for the same input parameters the energy of the condensate in the case of the flux tube is lower than in the case of uniform magnetic field in the whole cylinder.</description>

Abstract: We present a systematic comparison of charmonium light-front wave functions obtained through two complementary non-perturbative approaches: Basis Light-Front Quantization (BLFQ) and Dyson-Schwinger Equations (DSE). Key observables include the charge form factor, gravitational form factors, light-cone distribution amplitudes, decay constants, and two-photon transition form factors. Despite their distinct theoretical foundations and model parameters, the predictions from BLFQ and DSE exhibit remarkable agreement across all observables. This convergence validates both frameworks for studying charmonium structure and highlights the complementary strengths of Hamiltonian-based -- BLFQ -- and Lagrangian-based -- DSE -- methods in addressing non-perturbative QCD.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20869v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore a generative model framework to infer the masses of heavy particles from detector-level data over a broad parameter space. Our model combines a transformer-based detector encoder and a diffusion neural network. We first apply our model to a new physics scenario involving the pair production of wino-like chargino-neutralino, $pp \to \tilde\chi_1^{\pm} \tilde\chi_2^0$, in the $1\ell + 2\gamma + jets$ channel at the high luminosity LHC~(HL-LHC). We find that our framework can achieve mass reconstruction efficiency of $\gtrsim 70\%$ for the lightest neutralino $\tilde\chi_1^0$ and $\gtrsim 40\%$ for the second lightest neutralino $\tilde\chi_2^0$, for a mass tolerance of $\Delta m = 30~$GeV, across the entire parameter space accessible at the HL-LHC. We further extend our analysis to a different scenario with $pp\to\tilde\chi_1^{\pm}\tilde\chi_1^{\mp}+\tilde\chi_1^{\pm}\tilde\chi_2^0$ pair production at the HL-LHC in the $4\ell+\rm E{\!\!\!/}_T$ channel, and for a fixed value of $m_{\tilde\chi_2^0}$, we obtain reconstruction efficiencies $\gtrsim80\%$ over a wide range of $m_{\tilde\chi_1^0}$ for $\Delta m = 30~$GeV.</description>

      <title>On pseudo-gauge ambiguity in the distributions of energy density, pressure, and shear force inside the nucleon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10223v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the spatial distributions of pressure, energy density, and shear forces inside the nucleon within the two-flavor Skyrme model including vector mesons. This framework has the advantage that nucleon configurations can be stabilized without the Skyrme term. In contrast to the model without vector mesons, however, we realize that the energy-momentum tensor (EMT) becomes pseudo-gauge dependent. We explicitly demonstrate that all these distributions differ between the canonical and Belinfante forms of the EMTs. We identify the pseudo-gauge ambiguity as originating from nonvanishing surface terms associated with spin currents generated by the vector-meson field strength tensors. Furthermore, we show that the pressure and shear-force distributions in the canonical EMT develop singularities at the nucleon center, whereas the corresponding Belinfante distributions remain finite. Finally, we discuss the implications of pseudo-gauge dependence for extracting the confining force and for constructing the equation of state inside the nucleon.</description>

      <title>High-Quality Axion Dark Matter at Gravitational Wave Interferometers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14323v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational effects are known to violate global symmetries, threatening the Peccei-Quinn (PQ) solution to the strong CP problem. Ultraviolet completions featuring a gauged $U(1)$ symmetry, where $U(1)_{\rm PQ}$ arises as an accidental global symmetry, can suppress Planck-suppressed operators, enabling high-quality axions in a mass window where it can also account for the observed dark matter (DM) in the Universe. We show that in such models, the spontaneous breaking of the $U(1)$ gauge symmetry generates a strong stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) from gauge cosmic string loops. For breaking scales $\gtrsim 10^{14}$ GeV, the SGWB signal strength exceeds astrophysical foregrounds across a broad frequency range. Contrary to conventional gauge cosmic string scenarios, such quality axion models have a characteristic IR break frequency originating from the collapse of string-wall network around axion oscillation temperature. We propose this characteristic SGWB frequency-amplitude region, identified as \textit{Signature-Window-Axion-Gravitational waves} (SWAG), to be a novel probe of high-quality axion DM at future space and ground-based interferometers.</description>

      <title>Ultra high energetic neutrinos in their rest frame: can their time of arrival be determined?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24516v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the light of the recent observation by the KM3NeT collaboration of an ultrahigh energetic neutrino, we analyse it in its rest frame, where shortly after creation of the neutrino a muon arrives and interacts. Since the neutrino is at rest we use (in this first analysis) a non relativistic Gaussian wave function, and consider its spread. Due to the finite size of the packet, the time of the interaction of the muon will have an uncertainty. This uncertainty is small in the neutrino rest frame, but boosted to our frame, increases 18 orders of magnitude, making it extremely large. This effectively prevents the possibility of the observation of bursts, or the correlation with other events. A similar analysis for less energetic neutrinos show that the uncertainty is smaller than the duration of the observed bursts.</description>

      <title>Extra Radiation Cosmologies: Implications of the Hubble Tension for eV-scale Neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25478v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new analysis on sterile neutrino cosmologies using the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) second data release (DR2) baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements in combination with cosmic microwave background (CMB), CMB lensing, and supernova data. We show that BAO observables are intrinsically less sensitive to the combined effects of relativistic energy density, $N_{\rm eff}$, and the sum of neutrino masses, $\Sigma m_\nu$, which are both augmented in sterile neutrino cosmologies. With SH0ES local expansion rate, $H_0$, data, we find $N_{\rm eff} = 3.43 \pm 0.13$, reducing the Hubble tension to $2.4\sigma$. For a 0.1 eV sterile neutrino, we find $N_{\rm eff}=3.50$ as the best fit. For this representative $N_{\rm eff}$, we find an upper limit of $m_s &lt; 0.17$ eV (95% CL), greater than a factor of four weaker than standard constraints on $\Sigma m_\nu$. When SH0ES is included, light sterile neutrinos with masses $m_s\simeq0.1$-$0.2$ eV are favored at $\gtrsim 3\sigma$, whereas eV-scale sterile masses remain strongly excluded by the data in the cosmologies we study. Our findings confirm our previous results that partially thermalized sub-eV sterile neutrinos are preferred by the SH0ES $H_0$ data. The preferred $m_s$ mass scale overlaps with, but is not identical to, that favored in neutrino oscillation solutions to short-baseline anomalies.</description>

      <title>On Inflation and Reheating Features in the Higgs-$R^2$ Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.04924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.04924v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigated inflation in the Higgs-$R^2$ model and assumed the trajectory to follow a single-field approximation called minimal two-field mode. Using this approximation, we tried to constrain the Higgs' non-minimal coupling $\xi$. During inflation, we investigated the effect of $\xi$ on the non-gaussianity. We found that $\xi$ could not provide the large non-gaussianity. In this paper, we divided the preheating stage to be quadratic regime and quartic regime. During the quadratic regime, the gauge bosons' production is the most dominant. However, it could not drain the whole inflaton's energy. Thus, we introduced a dark matter candidate with a large coupling that could drain the whole inflaton's energy. We also found that if $\xi&lt;4.2$, the oscillation on the quadratic regime continued to the quartic regime. The reheating temperature obtained by this mode can be reached to be $\sim 10^{10}$ GeV and strongly depends on the remaining inflaton's energy density. On contrary, if $\xi&gt;4.2$, the oscillation only happens at the quadratic regime. As we assumed the Pauli exclusion principle does exist during the quadratic regime, the instant decay of gauge bosons to fermions is restricted. Hence we expected, the reheating temperature to be low for about $\sim 10^9$ GeV.</description>

      <title>Sharpening the dark matter signature in gravitational waveforms I: Accretion and eccentricity evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13053v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dark matter overdensities around black holes can alter the dynamical evolution of a companion object orbiting around it, and cause a dephasing of the gravitational waveform. Here, we present a refined calculation of the co-evolution of the binary and the dark matter distribution, taking into account the accretion of dark matter particles on the companion black hole, and generalizing previous quasi-circular calculations to the general case of eccentric orbits. These calculations are validated by dedicated N-body simulations. We show that accretion can lead to a large dephasing, and therefore cannot be neglected in general. We also demonstrate that dark matter spikes tend to circularize eccentric orbits faster than previously thought.</description>

      <title>Quantum Rationale-Aware Graph Contrastive Learning for Jet Discrimination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01642v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In high-energy physics, particle jet tagging plays a pivotal role in distinguishing quark from gluon jets using data from collider experiments. While graph-based deep learning methods have advanced this task beyond traditional feature-engineered approaches, the complex data structure and limited labeled samples present ongoing challenges. However, existing contrastive learning (CL) frameworks struggle to leverage rationale-aware augmentations effectively, often lacking supervision signals that guide the extraction of salient features and facing computational efficiency issues such as high parameter counts. In this study, we demonstrate that integrating a quantum rationale generator (QRG) within our proposed Quantum Rationale-aware Graph Contrastive Learning (QRGCL) framework significantly enhances jet discrimination performance, reducing reliance on labeled data and capturing discriminative features. Evaluated on the quark-gluon jet dataset, QRGCL achieves an AUC score of $77.53\%$ while maintaining a compact architecture of only 45 QRG parameters, outperforming classical, quantum, and hybrid GCL and GNN benchmarks. These results highlight QRGCL's potential to advance jet tagging and other complex classification tasks in high-energy physics, where computational efficiency and feature extraction limitations persist.</description>

      <title>Transverse-momentum-dependent pion structures from lattice QCD: Collins-Soper kernel, soft factor, TMDWF, and TMDPDF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04625v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) calculation of the pion valence-quark transverse-momentum-dependent parton distribution function (TMDPDF) within the framework of large-momentum effective theory (LaMET). Using correlators fixed in the Coulomb gauge (CG), we computed the quasi-TMD beam function for a pion with a mass of 300 MeV, a fine lattice spacing of $a = 0.06$ fm and multiple large momenta up to 3 GeV. The intrinsic soft functions in the CG approach are extracted from form factors with large momentum transfer, and as a byproduct, we also obtain the corresponding Collins-Soper (CS) kernel. Our determinations of both the soft function and the CS kernel agree with perturbation theory at small transverse separations ($b_\perp$) between the quarks. At larger $b_\perp$, the CS kernel remains consistent with recent results obtained using both CG and gauge-invariant TMD correlators in the literature. By combining next-to-leading logarithmic (NLL) factorization of the quasi-TMD beam function and the soft function, we obtain $x$-dependent pion valence-quark TMDPDF for transverse separations $b_\perp \gtrsim 1$ fm. Interestingly, we find that the $b_\perp$ dependence of the phenomenological parameterizations of TMDPDF for moderate values of $x$ are in reasonable agreement with our QCD determinations. In addition, we present results for the transverse-momentum-dependent wave function (TMDWF) for a heavier pion with 670 MeV mass.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Memory of Primordial Black Hole Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01356v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The gravitational wave signal of binary compact objects has two main contributions at frequencies below the characteristic merger frequency: the gravitational wave signal associated with the early inspiral stage of the binary and the non-linear gravitational wave memory. We compare the sensitivity of upcoming gravitational wave detectors to these two contributions, with a particular interest in events with a merger phase at frequencies higher than the detector's peak sensitivity. We demonstrate that for light primordial black holes, current and upcoming detectors are more sensitive to the inspiral signal. Our analysis incorporates the evolution history of primordial black hole binaries, key to accurately estimating the relevant event rates. We also discuss the waveform templates of the memory signal at ground- and space-based interferometers, and the implications for a matched filtering search. This allows us to compare the sensitivity of high-frequency gravitational wave detectors, sensitive to the merger phase, with the sensitivity of existing interferometers.</description>

      <title>Properties of Non-topological Solitons in Two-dimensional Model With Resurrected Conformal Symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23772v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study properties of non-topological solitons in two-dimensional conformal field theory. The spectrum of linear perturbations on these solutions is found to be trivial, containing only symmetry-related zero modes. The interpretation of this feature is given by considering the relativistic generalization of our theory in which the conformal symmetry is violated. It is explicitly seen that the restoration of this symmetry leads to the absence of decay/vibrational modes.</description>

      <title>The QED photon-fermion vertex from its Dyson-Schwinger equation in 4D: the full vertex, the transverse form factors and the perturbative solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06880v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the Dyson-Schwinger equation for the photon-fermion one-particle irreducible vertex in QED in linear covariant gauges. The longitudinal component of this vertex is described using the Ball-Chiu basis, while its transverse part is expressed with the K{\i}z{\i}lersu-Reenders-Pennington basis. Combining the vertex Ward-Takahashi identity with the vertex equation, we derive a set of exact, non-linear integral equations governing the transverse vertex. These equations hold for any linear covariant gauge and must be solved self-consistently. We discuss several approximations to the exact equations, generalizing results previously obtained at the perturbative one-loop level. Various kinematical configurations are also examined. Furthermore, we compute the perturbative solution of the transverse vertex Dyson-Schwinger equations for all transverse form factors and derive their perturbative asymptotic expressions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10152v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the importance of relativistic corrections for the study of the stability of $(2+1)$-dimensional non-topological solitons with quartic self-interaction in the low-energy limit. This result is explained by the restoration of conformal symmetry in the non-relativistic limit. Particularly, the corresponding cubic Gross-Pitaevskii equation supports scale-free non-topological solitons. An unbroken conformal symmetry provides the additional degeneration that allows for the exact result for the energy and angular momentum of the stationary classical solutions. We study the violation of conformal symmetry by relativistic corrections. The emergence of exponentially growing modes on the classical background is demonstrated using analytical approximations and numerical calculations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05561v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive the phase acquired by a neutral scalar particle propagating along Reissner-Nordstrom geodesics. Considering two flavours propagating on different trajectories which intersect, we plot the interference pattern induced by gravitational lensing from the charged compact object. Although the effect of the charge is subdominant in the metric, it proves to be significant in the phase, and shifts the interference pattern, compared to the Schwarzschild case. This pattern is characterised by two oscillation lengths which, if known, would allow the determination of both eigen masses independently.</description>

      <title>Realistic shell model for ordinary muon capture of sd-shell nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06221v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report about a study of the ordinary muon capture in nuclei belonging to the sd shell, an electroweak process that occurs with exchange momenta far larger than ordinary beta decays (approximately 100 MeV). Such a characteristic places this transition in an energy range that is consistent with the neutrinoless double-beta decay, and represents an interesting test for nuclear models to support their predictions of the nuclear matrix elements for such an unobserved process. For the first time, the calculations are carried out within the realistic shell model (RSM), namely employing effective shell-model Hamiltonians and decay operators derived from realistic nuclear forces, without resorting to any empirical adjustment of the coupling constants. This is a chapter of a research program that is aimed to assess the realistic shell model in reproducing the observables related to electroweak processes in nuclei, and then to evaluate the reliability of nuclear matrix elements for the neutrinoless double-beta decay that are calculated within this approach. We calculate the partial capture rates for many nuclear systems in the sd-shell region, as well as their spectroscopic properties, and compare the results with the available experimental counterparts. Such a comparison tests the relevance of a microscopic approach to the renormalization of transition operators to reproduce data and provide solid predictions of unknown observables.</description>
