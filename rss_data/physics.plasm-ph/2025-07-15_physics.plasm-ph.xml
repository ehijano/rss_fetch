      <title>Anisotropic anomalous diffusion and nonequilibrium in microgravity dusty plasma. Part Two: Spectral Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anisotropic anomalous dust diffusion in microgravity dusty plasma is investigated using experimental data from the Plasmakristall-4 (PK-4) facility on board the International Space Station. The PK-4 experiment uses video cameras to track individual dust particles, which allows for the collection of large amounts of statistical information on the dust particle positions and velocities. In Part One of this paper, these statistics were used to quantify anomalous dust diffusion caused by anisotropies in the plasma-mediated dust-dust interactions in PK-4. Here we use scaling relations to convert statistical parameters extracted from data into input parameters for a Hamiltonian spectral model. The kinetic energy term of the Hamiltonian (modeling anomalous diffusion) is informed from the dust displacement distribution functions, while the potential energy term (modeling stochasticity) is informed from fluctuations in the dust positions. The spectrum of energy states for each Hamiltonian is studied to assess probability for extended states (i.e., a continuous portion of the spectrum). The spectral model shows that the combination of nonlocality and stochasticity leads to high probability for transport at certain scales in Hilbert space, which coincide with the characteristic spatial scales of dust particle jumps observed in the experiments. Lastly, we discuss how this spectral approach is generalizable to many complex systems, such as electron transport in 2D materials where statistical models are not feasible.</description>

      <title>Excitation of high frequency electrostatic drift waves in inhomogeneous magnetized plasma investigated with detailed analysis of dispersion relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A second order nonlinear equation with variable coefficients has been derived to govern the dynamics of high frequency electrostatic drift waves in an inhomogeneous magnetized plasma in a moving frame of (2 + 1) spatio-temporal dimensions. A cubic dispersion relation having complex coefficients has been derived using the fluid model equations which explains the excitation of the high frequency electrostatic drift waves in addition to coupled ion cyclotron and drift waves. This has been studied in detail using the three exact roots of the cubic dispersion relation in the parameter space implying that the coupled high frequency electrostatic drift and ion cyclotron wave becomes unstable solely due to density gradient whereas the uncoupled high frequency electrostatic drift waves are stable in absence of collisional effects. The possibilities of excitation of the uncoupled high frequency electrostatic drift waves have been explored in context of certain laboratory and astrophysical plasma systems including tokamaks and solar corona where existence of steeper density gradients is more probable.</description>

      <title>Optimizing External Sources for Controlled Burning Plasma in Tokamaks with Neural Ordinary Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving controlled burning plasma in tokamaks requires precise regulation of external particle and energy sources to reach and maintain target core densities and temperatures. This work presents an inverse modeling approach using a multinodal plasma dynamics model based on neural ordinary differential equations (Neural ODEs). Given a desired time evolution of nodal quantities such as deuteron density or electron temperature, we compute the external source profiles, such as neutral beam injection (NBI) power, that drive the plasma toward the specified behavior. The approach is implemented within the NeuralPlasmaODE framework, which models multi-region, multi-timescale transport and incorporates physical mechanisms including radiation, auxiliary heating, and internodal energy exchange. By formulating the control task as an optimization problem, we use automatic differentiation through the Neural ODE solver to minimize the discrepancy between simulated and target trajectories. This framework transforms the forward simulation tool into a control-oriented model and provides a practical method for computing external source profiles in both current and future fusion devices.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity Analysis of Transport and Radiation in NeuralPlasmaODE for ITER Burning Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how key physical parameters influence burning plasma behavior is critical for the reliable operation of ITER. In this work, we extend NeuralPlasmaODE, a multi-region, multi-timescale model based on neural ordinary differential equations, to perform a sensitivity analysis of transport and radiation mechanisms in ITER plasmas. Normalized sensitivities of core and edge temperatures and densities are computed with respect to transport diffusivities, electron cyclotron radiation (ECR) parameters, impurity fractions, and ion orbit loss (IOL) timescales. The analysis focuses on perturbations around a trained nominal model for the ITER inductive scenario. Results highlight the dominant influence of magnetic field strength, safety factor, and impurity content on energy confinement, while also revealing how temperature-dependent transport contributes to self-regulating behavior. These findings demonstrate the utility of NeuralPlasmaODE for predictive modeling and scenario optimization in burning plasma environments.</description>

      <title>The role of nonlinear absorption of an ECR beam for fusion plasma pre-ionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the nonlinear interactions between electrons and electron-cyclotron resonance (ECR) heating beams in magnetized, low-temperature fusion plasmas, focusing on enhancing pre-ionization efficiency. We analyse key parameters affecting ECR absorption, including phase angle, temperature inhomogeneity, magnetic field gradients, and beam characteristics like width and frequency. Using 2D simulations for these low temperature plasmas, we demonstrate electrons gain energy through nonlinear trapping in velocity space near the resonance layer, achieving energy levels up to 1 keV under optimal conditions. Notably, narrow beam widths allow electrons to reach higher energy levels more efficiently than broader beams, highlighting the spatial localization of the nonlinear interactions to regions where the field is strong and frequency mismatch is small. Our findings show that in devices with lower-frequency ECR systems, such as TCV (82.7 GHz), electrons can gain up to 800 eV, while higher-frequency devices, like ASDEX-Upgrade (140 GHz) and ITER (170 GHz), achieve lower energy gains (480 eV and 420 eV, respectively) under similar conditions. These insights are directly applicable to improving ECR heating strategies, informing design choices in future fusion devices to optimize energy transfer during plasma breakdown and startup.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Energy Extraction from Kerr Black Holes: Ab-Initio Calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The possibility of extracting energy from a rotating black hole via the Blandford-Znajek mechanism represents a cornerstone of relativistic astrophysics. We present general-relativistic collisionless kinetic simulations of Kerr black-hole magnetospheres covering a wide range in the black-hole spin. Considering a classical split-monopole magnetic field, we can reproduce with these ab-initio calculations the force-free electrodynamics of rotating black holes and measure the power of the jet launched as a function of the spin. The Blandford-Znajek luminosity we find is in very good agreement with analytic calculations and compatible with general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulations via a simple rescaling. These results provide strong evidence of the robustness of the Blandford-Znajek mechanism and accurate estimates of the electromagnetic luminosity to be expected in those scenarios involving rotating black holes across the mass scale.</description>

      <title>Simulating plasma wave propagation on a superconducting quantum chip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computers may one day enable the efficient simulation of strongly-coupled plasmas that lie beyond the reach of classical computation in regimes where quantum effects are important and the scale separation is large. In this letter, we take the first step towards efficient simulation of quantum plasmas by demonstrating linear plasma wave propagation on a superconducting quantum chip. Using high-fidelity and highly expressive device-native gates, combined with a novel error mitigation technique, we simulate the scattering of laser pulses from inhomogeneous plasmas. Our approach is made feasible by the identification of a suitable local spin model whose excitations mimic plasma waves, whose circuit implementation requires a lower gate count than other proposed approaches that would require a future fault-tolerant quantum computer. This work opens avenues to study more complicated phenomena that cannot be simulated efficiently on classical computers, such as nonlinear quantum dynamics when strongly-coupled plasmas are driven out of equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Compression and Reconnection Investigations of the MagnetoPause (CRIMP): A Mission Concept to Uncover the Impact of Mesoscale Reconnection and Plasma Outflow Processes at the Dayside Magnetopause</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Compression and Reconnection Investigations of the Magnetopause (CRIMP) mission is a Heliophysics Medium-Class Explorer (MIDEX) Announcement of Opportunity (AO) mission concept designed to study mesoscale structures and particle outflow along Earth's magnetopause using two identical spacecraft. CRIMP would uncover the impact of magnetosheath mesoscale drivers, dayside magnetopause mesoscale phenomenological processes and structures, and localized plasma outflows on magnetic reconnection and the energy transfer process in the dayside magnetosphere. CRIMP accomplishes this through uniquely phased spacecraft configurations that allow multipoint, contemporaneous measurements at the magnetopause. This enables an unparalleled look at mesoscale spatial differences along the dayside magnetopause on the scale of 1-3 Earth Radii (Re). Through these measurements, CRMIP will uncover how local mass density enhancements affect global reconnection, how mesoscale structures drive magnetopause dynamics, and if the magnetopause acts as a perfectly absorbing boundary for radiation belt electrons. This allows CRIMP to determine the spatial scale, extent, and temporal evolution of energy and mass transfer processes at the magnetopause - crucial measurements to determine how the solar wind energy input in the magnetosphere is transmitted between regions and across scales. This concept was conceived as a part of the 2024 NASA Heliophysics Mission Design School.</description>

      <title>Generation of Surface Sausage Oscillations of a Current Sheet and Propagating Magnetoacoustic Waves by Impulsive Reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection and Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves may well be both playing a role in coronal heating. In this paper, we simulate reconnection in the corona as a response to the convergence of opposite-polarity magnetic sources at the base of the corona. A current sheet forms at a magnetic null and undergoes impulsive bursty reconnection which drives natural modes of oscillation of the current sheet by a process of symbiosis. These are leaky surface sausage modes which cause the length of the current sheet to oscillate. Interaction of the oscillations and reconnection outflows with the magnetic Y-points at the ends of the sheet acts as sources for magnetoacoustic waves. Fast-mode waves propagate outwards into the coronal environment, while slow-mode waves propagate along the separatrices extending from the ends of the current sheet. The periodicities for sausage oscillations of the current sheet, for the current sheet length, and for the propagating large-scale magnetoacoustic waves are all estimated to be approximately 91 s for the parameters of our experiment.</description>

      <title>The Pedersen and Hall Conductances in the Jovian Polar Regions: New Maps based on a Broadband Electron Energy Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ionospheric Pedersen and Hall conductances play an important role in understanding the exchanges of angular momentum, energy and matter between the magnetosphere and the ionosphere/thermosphere at Jupiter, modifying the composition and temperature of the planet. In the high latitude regions, these conductances are enhanced by the auroral electron precipitation. The effect of a broadband precipitating electron energy distribution, similar to the observed electron distributions through particle measurements, on the conductance values is investigated. The new values are compared to the ones obtained from previous studies, notably when considering a mono-energetic distribution. The broadband precipitating electron energy distribution is modeled by a kappa distribution, which is used as an input in an electron transport model that computes the density vertical profiles of ionospheric ions. The vertical profiles of the Pedersen and Hall conductivities are then evaluated assuming that the conductivities are mostly governed by the densities of H3+ and CH5+. Finally, the Pedersen and Hall conductances are computed by integrating the corresponding conductivities over altitude. The Pedersen and Hall conductances are globally higher when considering a broadband electron energy distribution rather than a mono-energetic distribution. In addition, the use of the direct outputs of an electron transport model rather than the analytical expression presented in Hiraki and Tao (2008) as well as a change in the electron collision cross-sections also have significant impacts on the conductance values. Comparison between our results and the ones deduced from the corotation enforcement theory suggests that either a physical mechanism limits the field-aligned currents or the auroral electrons precipitating in the atmosphere are also accelerated by processes not associated with the field-aligned currents.</description>

      <title>Excitation of Giant Surface Waves During Laser Wake Field Acceleration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21503v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have detected the presence of very high intensity surface waves that are excited during plasma waveguided laser wakefield acceleration. Wakefield acceleration can be enchanced by the introduction of an ``all optical" plasma waveguide that confines and guides a laser pulse at the optimal intensity over long distances, producing quasimonoenergetic multi-GeV electron bunches. However strong pulses of radio frequency radiation (RF) are also produced, and particle in cell simulations show why: a continuous stream of multi-MeV electrons are also ejected radially from the plasma due to nonlinear wave breaking, and these excite and copropagate coherently with a giant cylindrical Sommerfeld surface wave. Laboratory measurements, simulations, and analytic approximations all converge on a 20 J laser pulse exciting a 1 Joule, 400 GW broadband THz surface wave, with a peak electric field strength of 35 GV/m.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics and collisionality in firehose-susceptible high-$\beta$ plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13663v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the evolution of collisionless plasmas that, due to their macroscopic evolution, are susceptible to the firehose instability, using both analytic theory and hybrid-kinetic particle-in-cell simulations. We establish that, depending on the relative magnitude of the plasma $\beta$, the characteristic timescale of macroscopic evolution, and the ion-Larmor frequency, the saturation of the firehose instability in high-$\beta$ plasmas can result in three qualitatively distinct thermodynamic (and electromagnetic) states. By contrast with the previously identified `ultra-high-beta' and `Alfv\'en-inhibiting' states, the newly identified `Alfv\'en-enabling' state, which is realised when the macroscopic evolution time $\tau$ exceeds the ion-Larmor frequency by a $\beta$-dependent parameter, can support linear Alfv\'en waves and Alfv\'enic turbulence because the magnetic tension associated with the plasma's macroscopic magnetic field is never completely negated by anisotropic pressure forces. We characterise these states in detail, including their saturated magnetic-energy spectra. The effective collision operator associated with the firehose fluctuations is also described; we find it to be well approximated in the Alfv\'en-enabling state by a simple quasilinear pitch-angle scattering operator. The box-averaged collision frequency is $\nu_{\rm eff} \sim \beta/\tau$, in agreement with previous results, but certain sub-populations of particles scatter at a much larger (or smaller) rate depending on their velocity in the direction parallel to the magnetic field. Our findings are essential for understanding low-collisionality astrophysical plasmas including the solar wind, the intracluster medium of galaxy clusters and black-hole accretion flows. We show that all three of these plasmas are in the Alfv\'en-enabling regime of firehose saturation and discuss the implications of this result.</description>
