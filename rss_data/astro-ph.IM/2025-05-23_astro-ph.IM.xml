      <title>The Application of Quantum Fourier Transform in Cosmic Microwave Background Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data analysis and the map-making process rely heavily on the use of spherical harmonics. For suitable pixelizations of the sphere, the (forward and inverse) Fourier transform plays a crucial role in computing all-sky map from spherical harmonic expansion coefficients -- or from angular power spectrum -- and vice versa. While the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is traditionally employed in these computations, the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) offers a theoretical advantage in terms of computational efficiency and potential speedup. In this work, we study the potential advantage of using the QFT in this context by exploring the substitution of the FFT with the QFT within the \textit{healpy} package. Performance evaluations are conducted using the Aer simulator. Our results indicate that QFT exhibits potential advantages over FFT that are particularly relevant at high-resolution. However, classical-to-quantum data encoding overhead represents a limitation to current efficiency. In this work, we adopted amplitude encoding, due to its efficiency on encoding maximum data to minimum number of qubits. We identify data encoding as a potential significant bottleneck and discuss its impact on quantum speedup. Future improvements in quantum encoding strategies and algorithmic optimizations could further enhance the feasibility of QFT in CMB data analysis.</description>

      <title>Learning novel representations of variable sources from multi-modal $\textit{Gaia}$ data via autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3) published for the first time epoch photometry, BP/RP (XP) low-resolution mean spectra, and supervised classification results for millions of variable sources. This extensive dataset offers a unique opportunity to study their variability by combining multiple Gaia data products. In preparation for DR4, we propose and evaluate a machine learning methodology capable of ingesting multiple Gaia data products to achieve an unsupervised classification of stellar and quasar variability. A dataset of 4 million Gaia DR3 sources is used to train three variational autoencoders (VAE), which are artificial neural networks (ANNs) designed for data compression and generation. One VAE is trained on Gaia XP low-resolution spectra, another on a novel approach based on the distribution of magnitude differences in the Gaia G band, and the third on folded Gaia G band light curves. Each Gaia source is compressed into 15 numbers, representing the coordinates in a 15-dimensional latent space generated by combining the outputs of these three models. The learned latent representation produced by the ANN effectively distinguishes between the main variability classes present in Gaia DR3, as demonstrated through both supervised and unsupervised classification analysis of the latent space. The results highlight a strong synergy between light curves and low-resolution spectral data, emphasising the benefits of combining the different Gaia data products. A two-dimensional projection of the latent variables reveals numerous overdensities, most of which strongly correlate with astrophysical properties, showing the potential of this latent space for astrophysical discovery. We show that the properties of our novel latent representation make it highly valuable for variability analysis tasks, including classification, clustering and outlier detection.</description>

      <title>An automated algorithmic method to mitigate long-term variations in the efficiency of the GRAPES-3 muon telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The GRAPES-3 large area muon telescope with its sixteen independent modules records the high energy (&gt;1 GeV) muons continuously over 2.3 sr of the sky. However, the recorded muon rates are contaminated by instrumental effects and instabilities spanning both short- and long-timescales, such as variations in the efficiency of the detector. We present an automated, algorithmic method, which employs Bayesian blocks to discretize the data stream into periods and exploits the correlations among the sixteen independent modules of the muon telescope to separate the impact of these instrumental problems from those originating in physical effects of interest, allowing the Savitzky-Golay filter to be employed to mitigate the former. Compared to legacy methods, this method is less dependent on subjective input from experimental operators and provides a data stream free of all known instrumental effects over calendar years. The muon rate obtained with the new method shows a fairly better correlation with neutron monitor data, than that obtained with the legacy method.</description>

      <title>Computing magnitudes, colours, distances, and absolute magnitudes at any signal-to-noise level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The computation of magnitudes and distances from low signal-to-noise observations is known to be problematic, in the sense that the magnitudes and distances tend to assume extreme values, or are even undefined or unphysical in the case of negative observed fluxes or parallaxes. In this work we show that magnitudes can be computed consistently at all signal-to-noise levels, and even for negative fluxes, if the prior information that the true flux or distance is non-negative is properly included. Furthermore, we derive an all-purpose estimator for distances from a prior implementing only the non-negativity of the true parallax. We apply our results to the case of combining magnitudes to colours, and magnitudes and distances to obtain absolute magnitudes. The resulting expressions are easy to compute and we show that the resulting distribution functions for magnitudes, colours, distances, and absolute magnitudes are not only consistent for all signal-to-noise levels and applicable to both, positive and negative observed fluxes and parallaxes, but also show no strong tails. While biases at very low signal-to-noise levels are unavoidable, the estimator for distances derived in this work is less biased than previously used estimators. We find that the magnitude, colour, distance, and absolute magnitude distributions for vanishing signals converge to limiting distributions, whose median values are important for assessing biases when working with data at low signal-to-noise levels.</description>

      <title>DarkNESS: A skipper-CCD NanoSatellite for Dark Matter Searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Dark matter Nanosatellite Equipped with Skipper Sensors (DarkNESS) deploys a recently developed skipper-CCD architecture with sub-electron readout noise in low Earth orbit (LEO) to investigate potential signatures of dark matter (DM). The mission addresses two interaction channels: electron recoils from strongly interacting sub-GeV DM and X-rays produced through decaying DM. Orbital observations avoid attenuation that limits ground-based measurements, extending sensitivity reach for both channels. The mission proceeds toward launch following laboratory validation of the instrument. A launch opportunity has been secured through Firefly Aerospace's DREAM 2.0 program, awarded to the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). This will constitute the first use of skipper-CCDs in space and evaluate their suitability for low-noise X-ray and single-photon detection in future space observatories.</description>

      <title>BHaHAHA: A Fast, Robust Apparent Horizon Finder Library for Numerical Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Apparent horizon (AH) finders are essential for characterizing black holes and excising their interiors in numerical relativity (NR) simulations. However, open-source AH finders to date are tightly coupled to individual NR codes. We introduce BHaHAHA, the BlackHoles@Home Apparent Horizon Algorithm, the first open-source, infrastructure-agnostic library for AH finding in NR. BHaHAHA implements the first-ever hyperbolic flow-based approach, recasting the elliptic partial differential equation for a marginally outer trapped surface as a damped nonlinear wave equation. To enhance performance, BHaHAHA incorporates a multigrid-inspired refinement strategy, an over-relaxation technique, and OpenMP parallelization. When compared to a na\"ive hyperbolic relaxation implementation, these enhancements result in 64x speedups for difficult common-horizon finds on a single spacetime slice, enabling BHaHAHA to achieve runtimes within 10% of the widely used (single-core) AHFinderDirect and outperform it on multiple cores. For dynamic horizon tracking with typical core counts on a high-performance-computing cluster, BHaHAHA is approximately 2.1 times faster than AHFinderDirect at accuracies limited by interpolation of metric data from the host NR code. Implemented and tested in both the Einstein Toolkit and BlackHoles@Home, BHaHAHA demonstrates that hyperbolic relaxation can be a robust, versatile, and performant approach for AH finding.</description>

      <title>Towards Realistic Detection Pipelines of Taiji: New Challenges in Data Analysis and High-Fidelity Simulations of Space-Borne Gravitational Wave Antenna</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Taiji, a Chinese space-based gravitational wave detection project, aims to explore the millihertz gravitational wave universe with unprecedented sensitivity, targeting astrophysical and cosmological sources including Galactic binaries, massive black hole binaries, extreme mass-ratio inspirals, and stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds, etc. These observations are expected to provide transformative insights into astrophysics, cosmology, and fundamental physics. However, Taiji's data analysis faces unique challenges distinct from ground-based detectors like LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA, such as the overlap of numerous signals, extended data durations, more rigorous accuracy requirements for the waveform templates, non-negligible subdominant waveform complexities, incompletely characterized noise spectra, non-stationary noises, and various data anomalies. This paper presents the second round of Taiji Data Challenge, a collection of simulation datasets designed as a shared platform for resolving these critical data analysis problems. The current platform distinguishes from previous works by the systematic integration of orbital dynamics based on the full drag-free and attitude control simulation, extended noise sources, more sophisticated and overlapping gravitational wave signals, second-generation time-delay interferometry and the coupling effect of time-varying armlengths, etc. Concurrently released is the open-source toolkit Triangle, which offers the capabilities for customized simulation of signals, noises and other instrumental effects. By taking a step further towards realistic detection, Taiji Data Challenge II and Triangle altogether serve as a new testbed, supporting the development of Taiji's global analysis and end-to-end pipelines, and ultimately bridging the gaps between observation and scientific objectives.</description>

      <title>A neural network approach to determining photometric metallicities of M-type dwarf stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: M dwarfs are the most abundant stars in the Galaxy and serve as key targets for stellar and exoplanetary studies. It is particularly challenging to determine their metallicities because their spectra are complex. For this reason, several authors have focused on photometric estimates of the M-dwarf metallicity. Although artificial neural networks have been used in the framework of modern astrophysics, their application to a photometric metallicity estimate for M dwarfs remains unexplored. We develop an accurate method for estimating the photometric metallicities of M dwarfs using artificial neural networks to address the limitations of traditional empirical approaches. We trained a neural network on a dataset of M dwarfs with spectroscopically derived metallicities. We used eight absolute magnitudes in the visible and infrared from Gaia, 2MASS, and WISE as input features. Batch normalization and dropout regularization stabilized the training and prevented overfitting. We applied the Monte Carlo dropout technique to obtain more robust predictions. The neural network demonstrated a strong performance in estimating photometric metallicities for M dwarfs in the range of -0.45&lt;[Fe/H]&lt;0.45dex and for spectral types as late as M5.0V. On the test sample, the predictions showed uncertainties down to 0.08dex. This surpasses the accuracy of previous methods. We further validated our results using an additional sample of 46 M dwarfs in wide binary systems with FGK-type primary stars with well-defined metallicities and achieved an excellent predictive performance that surpassed the 0.1dex error threshold. This study introduces a ML-based framework for estimating the photometric metallicities of M dwarfs and provides a scalable data-driven solution for analyzing large photometric surveys. The results outline the potential of artificial neural networks to enhance the determination of stellar parameters.</description>

      <title>Denoising Milky Way stellar survey data with normalizing flow models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Gaia dataset has revealed many intricate Milky Way substructures in exquisite detail, including moving groups and the phase spiral. Precise characterisation of these features and detailed comparisons to theoretical models require engaging with Gaia's heteroscedastic noise model, particularly in more distant parts of the Galactic disc and halo. We propose a general, novel machine-learning approach using normalizing flows for denoising density estimation, with particular focus on density estimation from stellar survey data such as that from Gaia. Normalizing flows transform a simple base distribution into a complex target distribution through bijective transformations resulting in a highly expressive and flexible model. The denoising is performed using importance sampling. We demonstrate that this general procedure works excellently on Gaia data by reconstructing detailed local velocity distributions artificially corrupted with noise. For example, we show the multiple branches of the Hercules stream and the phase-space spiral can both be well captured by our model. We discuss hyperparameter choice to optimally recover substructure and compare our approach to extreme deconvolution. The model therefore promises to be a robust tool for studying the Milky Way's kinematics in Galactic locations where the noise from Gaia is significant.</description>

      <title>Sequential simulation-based inference for extreme mass ratio inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extreme mass-ratio inspirals pose a difficult challenge in terms of both search and parameter estimation for upcoming space-based gravitational-wave detectors such as LISA. Their signals are long and of complex morphology, meaning they carry a large amount of information about their source, but are also difficult to search for and analyse. We explore how sequential simulation-based inference methods, specifically truncated marginal neural ratio estimation, could offer solutions to some of the challenges surrounding extreme-mass-ratio inspiral data analysis. We show that this method can efficiently narrow down the volume of the complex 11-dimensional search parameter space by a factor of $10^6-10^7$ and provide 1-dimensional marginal proposal distributions for non-spinning extreme-mass-ratio inspirals. We discuss the current limitations of this approach and place it in the broader context of a global strategy for future space-based gravitational-wave data analysis.</description>

      <title>Predicting the cryogenic performance of superconducting detectors by their visual properties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02357v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The testing and quality assurance of cryogenic superconducting detectors is a time- and labor-intensive process. As experiments deploy increasingly larger arrays of detectors, new methods are needed for performing this testing quickly. Here, we propose a process for flagging under-performing detector wafers before they are ever tested cryogenically. Detectors are imaged under an optical microscope, and computer vision techniques are used to analyze the images, searching for visual defects and other predictors of poor performance. Pipeline performance is verified via a suite of images with simulated defects, yielding a detection accuracy of 98.6%. Lastly, results from running the pipeline on prototype microwave kinetic inductance detectors from the planned SPT-3G+ experiment are presented.</description>

      <title>Rapid inference and comparison of gravitational-wave population models with neural variational posteriors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07197v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA catalog has been analyzed with an abundance of different population models due to theoretical uncertainty in the formation of gravitational-wave sources. To expedite model exploration, we introduce an efficient and accurate variational Bayesian approach that learns the population posterior with a normalizing flow and serves as a drop-in replacement for existing samplers. With hardware acceleration, inference takes just seconds for the current set of black-hole mergers and readily scales to larger catalogs. The trained posteriors provide an arbitrary number of independent samples with exact probability densities, unlike established stochastic sampling algorithms that otherwise match with Jensen-Shannon divergences below 0.1 nats in our 14-dimensional parameter space, while requiring up to three orders of magnitude fewer likelihood evaluations and as few as $\mathcal{O}(10^3)$. Provided the posterior support is covered, discrepancies can be addressed with smoothed importance sampling, which quantifies a goodness-of-fit metric for the variational approximation while also estimating the evidence for Bayesian model selection. Neural variational inference thus enables interactive development, analysis, and comparison of population models, making it a useful tool for astrophysical interpretation of current and future gravitational-wave observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13119v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We train a novel deep learning architecture to perform likelihood-free inference on the value of the cosmological parameters from halo catalogs of the Quijote N-body simulations. Our model takes as input a halo catalog where each halo is characterized by its position, mass, and velocity modulus. By construction, our model is E(3) invariant and is designed to extract information hierarchically. Unlike graph neural networks, it does not require the transformation of the input halo (or galaxy) catalog into a graph. Given its simplicity, our model can process point clouds with large numbers of points. We discuss the advantages of this class of methods but also point out their limitations and potential ways to improve them for cosmological data.</description>

      <title>Projections of Earth's technosphere: Scenario modeling, worldbuilding, and overview of remotely detectable technosignatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00067v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study uses methods from futures studies to develop a set of ten self-consistent scenarios for Earth's 1000-year future, which can serve as examples for defining technosignature search strategies. We apply a novel worldbuilding pipeline that evaluates the dimensions of human needs in each scenario as a basis for defining the observable properties of the technosphere. Our scenarios include three with zero-growth stability, two that have collapsed into a stable state, one that oscillates between growth and collapse, and four that continue to grow. Only one scenario includes rapid growth that could lead to interstellar expansion. We examine absorption spectral features for a few scenarios to illustrate that nitrogen dioxide can serve as a technosignature to distinguish between present-day Earth, pre-agricultural Earth, and an industrial 1000-year future Earth. Three of our scenarios are spectrally indistinguishable from pre-agricultural Earth, even though these scenarios include expansive technospheres. Up to nine of these scenarios could represent steady-state examples that could persist for much longer timescales, and it remains possible that short-duration technospheres could be the most abundant. Our scenario set provides the basis for further systematic thinking about technosignature detection as well as for imagining a broad range of possibilities for Earth's future.</description>

      <title>A pioneering experiment combining single-antenna and aperture-synthesis data to measure Faraday rotation with GMIMS and the CGPS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10623v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Structures in the magnetoionic medium exist across a wide range of angular sizes owing to large-scale magnetic fields coherent over the Galactic spiral arms combined with small-scale fluctuations in the magnetic field and electron density resulting from energy injection processes such as supernovae. For the first time, we produce diffuse Galactic synchrotron emission Faraday rotation maps covering all spatial scales down to $3'$ resolution for magnetic field studies. These maps complement total and polarized intensity maps combining single-antenna and interferometric data that have been produced, such as the Canadian Galactic Plane Survey (CGPS). Combined maps have sensitivity to large scales from the single-antenna component and angular resolution from the interferometric component. We combine Global Magneto-Ionic Medium Survey High-Band North single-antenna and CGPS aperture-synthesis polarization data after spatial filtering, producing Stokes $Q$ and $U$ maps for the four CGPS frequency channels. We calculate rotation measures (RMs) for all pixels using a linear fit to polarization angle versus wavelength squared. Smooth polarized emission regions require the large-scale sensitivity of the single-antenna to illuminate the Faraday rotation, while aperture synthesis reveals small-scale RM variability. While these maps show magnetic field structures on the full range of spatial scales they probe, the RM values should be interpreted with caution, as the narrow $\lambda^2$ coverage limits sensitivity to Faraday complexity. Despite this limitation of the CGPS 35 MHz bandwidth, we demonstrate that useful Faraday rotation information can be obtained from the combined dataset, highlighting the important synergy between future broadband interferometric and single-antenna polarization surveys.</description>

      <title>FLARE: A Framework for Stellar Flare Forecasting using Stellar Physical Properties and Historical Records</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18218v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stellar flare events are critical observational samples for astronomical research; however, recorded flare events remain limited. Stellar flare forecasting can provide additional flare event samples to support research efforts. Despite this potential, no specialized models for stellar flare forecasting have been proposed to date. In this paper, we present extensive experimental evidence demonstrating that both stellar physical properties and historical flare records are valuable inputs for flare forecasting tasks. We then introduce FLARE (Forecasting Light-curve-based Astronomical Records via features Ensemble), the first-of-its-kind large model specifically designed for stellar flare forecasting. FLARE integrates stellar physical properties and historical flare records through a novel Soft Prompt Module and Residual Record Fusion Module. Our experiments on the publicly available Kepler light curve dataset demonstrate that FLARE achieves superior performance compared to other methods across all evaluation metrics. Finally, we validate the forecast capability of our model through a comprehensive case study.</description>

      <title>Visible Emission Line Coronagraph (VELC) onboard ADITYA-L1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21184v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Aditya-L1, India's first dedicated mission to study the Sun and its atmosphere from the Sun-Earth Lagrangian L1 location was successfully launched on 2023 September 2. It carries seven payloads. The Visible Emission Line Coronagraph (VELC) is a major payload on Aditya-L1. VELC is designed to carry out imaging and spectroscopic observations (the latter in three emission lines of the corona), simultaneously. Images of the solar corona in the continuum at 5000 A, with a field of view (FoV) from 1.05 Ro to 3 Ro can be obtained at variable intervals depending on the data volume that can be downloaded. Spectroscopic observations of the solar corona in three emission lines, namely 5303 A Fexiv, 7892 A Fexi, and 10747 A Fexiii are possible simultaneously, with different exposure times and cadence. Four slits, each of width 50 um, separated by 3.75 mm help to simultaneously obtain spectra at four positions in the solar corona at all the aforementioned lines. A Linear Scan Mechanism (LSM) makes it possible to scan the solar corona up to +/-1.5 Ro. The instrument has the facility to carry out spectropolarimetric observations at 10747 A also in the FoV range 1.05 - 1.5 Ro. Various components of the instrument were tested interferometrically on the optical bench before installation. The individual components were aligned and performance of the payload was checked in the laboratory using a laser source and tungsten lamp. Wavelength calibration of the instrument was verified using Sun as a light source. All the detectors were calibrated for different parameters such as dark current and its variation with exposure time. Here, we discuss the various features of the VELC, alignment, calibration, performance, possible observations, initial data analysis and results of initial tests conducted in-orbit.</description>
