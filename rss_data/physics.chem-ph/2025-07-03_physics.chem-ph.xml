      <title>Fully Analytic Nuclear Gradients for the Bethe--Salpeter Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) formalism, combined with the $GW$ approximation for ionization energies and electron affinities, is emerging as an efficient and accurate method for predicting optical excitations in molecules. In this letter, we present the first derivation and implementation of fully analytic nuclear gradients for the BSE@$G_0W_0$ method. Building on recent developments for $G_0W_0$ nuclear gradients, we derive analytic nuclear gradients for several BSE@$G_0W_0$ variants. We validate our implementation against numerical gradients and compare excited-state geometries and adiabatic excitation energies obtained from different BSE@$G_0W_0$ variants with those from state-of-the-art wavefunction methods.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Dimensionality of Molecular Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chemical space which encompasses all stable compounds is unfathomably large and its dimension scales linearly with the number of atoms considered. The success of machine learning methods suggests that many physical quantities exhibit substantial redundancy in that space, lowering their effective dimensionality. A low dimensionality is favorable for machine learning applications, as it reduces the required number of data points. It is unknown however, how far the dimensionality of physical properties can be reduced, how this depends on the exact physical property considered, and how accepting a model error can help further reducing the dimensionality. We show that accepting a modest, nearly negligible error leads to a drastic reduction in independent degrees of freedom. This applies to several properties such as the total energy and frontier orbital energies for a wide range of neutral molecules with up to 20 atoms. We provide a method to quantify an upper bound for the intrinsic dimensionality given a desired accuracy threshold by inclusion of all continuous variables in the molecular Hamiltonian including the nuclear charges. We find the intrinsic dimensionality to be remarkably stable across molecules, i.e. it is a property of the underlying physical quantity and the number of atoms rather than a property of an individual molecular configuration and therefore highly transferable between molecules. The results suggest that the feature space of state-of-the-art molecular representations can be compressed further, leaving room for more data efficient and transferable models.</description>

      <title>3D-Printed Enclosure Wire-Guided Liquid Microfilm for Versatile Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a 3D-printing-based design to produce wire-guided liquid microfilms that can be used for versatile spectroscopic applications. We demonstrate the ability of our instrument to provide optically useful liquid microfilms with highly tunable thicknesses over the range 25 - 180 $\mu$m, with standard temporal thickness deviation less than 1.0% on the low end of the range of flow rates, and spatially homogeneous microfilms that remain stable over the course of ten hours. We then show the device's versatility through its use in Raman, fluorescence, and nonlinear spectroscopy. Our approach is highly reproducible as a unique advantage of a 3D-printed enclosure and limited other components. The 3D-printable file for the enclosure is included in the supplementary materials. This innovation in design shows the feasibility of applying 3D-printing to physical and chemical instrumentation for faster adoption of experimental techniques.</description>

      <title>Super high capacity of silicon carbon anode over 6500 mAh g-1 for lithium battery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As silicon is approaching its theoretical limit for the anode materials in lithium battery, searching for a higher limit is indispensable. Herein, we demonstrate the possible of achieving ultrahigh capacity over 6500 mAh g-1 in silicon-carbon composites. Considering the numerous defects inside the silicon nanostructures, it is deduced the formation of quasi-Bose Einstein condensation should be possible, which can lead to the low viscosity flow of lithium-ions through the anode. At a charge-discharge rate of 0.1C (0.42 A g-1), the initial discharge specific capacity reaches 6694.21 mAh g-1, with a Coulomb efficiency (CE) of 74.71%, significantly exceeding the theoretical capacity limit of silicon. Further optimization of the anode material ratio results in improved cycling stability, with a discharge specific capacity of 5542.98 mAh g-1 and a CE of 85.25% at 0.1C. When the initial discharge capacity is 4043.01 mAh g-1, the CE rises to 86.13%. By training a multilayer perceptron with material parameters as inputs and subsequently optimizing it using a constrained genetic algorithm, an initial discharge specific capacity of up to 7789.55 mAh g-1 can be achieved theoretically. This study demonstrates that silicon-carbon composites have great potential to significantly enhance the energy density of lithium-ion batteries.</description>

      <title>Synthesizable by Design: A Retrosynthesis-Guided Framework for Molecular Analog Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The disconnect between AI-generated molecules with desirable properties and their synthetic feasibility remains a critical bottleneck in computational drug and material discovery. While generative AI has accelerated the proposal of candidate molecules, many of these structures prove challenging or impossible to synthesize using established chemical reactions. Here, we introduce SynTwins, a novel retrosynthesis-guided molecular analog design framework that designs synthetically accessible molecular analogs by emulating expert chemist strategies through a three-step process: retrosynthesis, similar building block searching, and virtual synthesis. In comparative evaluations, SynTwins demonstrates superior performance in generating synthetically accessible analogs compared to state-of-the-art machine learning models while maintaining high structural similarity to original target molecules. Furthermore, when integrated with existing molecule optimization frameworks, our hybrid approach produces synthetically feasible molecules with property profiles comparable to unconstrained molecule generators, yet its synthesizability ensured. Our comprehensive benchmarking across diverse molecular datasets demonstrates that SynTwins effectively bridges the gap between computational design and experimental synthesis, providing a practical solution for accelerating the discovery of synthesizable molecules with desired properties for a wide range of applications.</description>

      <title>Valence photoelectron spectra of thiouracils in the gas phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07361v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a combined experimental and theoretical study of the vibrationally resolved valence photoelectron spectra of the complete series of thiouracils (2-thiouracil, 4-thiouracil and 2,4-dithiouracil) for binding energies between 8 and 17 eV. The theoretical spectra were calculated using equation-of-motion coupled cluster theory for ionization potential (EOM-IP-CCSD) combined with the time-independent double-harmonic adiabatic Hessian approach. For all three thiouracils, the first ionization potential is found between 8.4 and 8.7 eV, which is 1 eV lower than for the canonical nucleobase uracil. Ionization bands up to 12 eV show strong vibrational progressions and are well reproduced by the calculations. These bands are attributed to the ionization of (primarily) sulfur- and oxygen-localized valence molecular orbitals. For higher binding energies, the calculations indicate that nonadiabatic couplings are important for the interpretation of the photoelectron spectra.</description>

      <title>Delocalized Excitation Transfer in Open Quantum Systems with Long-Range Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04383v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interplay between coherence and system-environment interactions is at the basis of a wide range of phenomena, from quantum information processing to charge and energy transfer in molecular systems, biomolecules, and photochemical materials. In this work, we use a Frenkel exciton model with long-range interacting qubits coupled to a damped collective bosonic mode to investigate vibrationally assisted transfer processes in donor-acceptor systems featuring internal substructures analogous to light-harvesting complexes. We find that certain delocalized excitonic states maximize the transfer rate and that the entanglement is preserved during the dissipative transfer over a wide range of parameters. We investigate the reduction in transfer caused by static disorder, white noise, and finite temperature and study how transfer efficiency scales as a function of the number of dimerized monomers and the component number of each monomer, finding which excitonic states lead to optimal transfer. Finally, we provide a realistic experimental setting to realize this model in analog trapped-ion quantum simulators. Analog quantum simulation of systems comprising many and increasingly complex monomers could offer valuable insights into the design of light-harvesting materials, particularly in the non-perturbative intermediate parameter regime examined in this study, where classical simulation methods are resource-intensive.</description>

      <title>Optimal Symbolic Construction of Matrix Product Operators and Tree Tensor Network Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18630v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This research introduces an improved framework for constructing matrix product operators (MPOs) and tree tensor network operators (TTNOs), crucial tools in quantum simulations. A given (Hamiltonian) operator typically has a known symbolic "sum of operator strings" form that can be translated into a tensor network structure. Combining the existing bipartite-graph-based approach and a newly introduced symbolic Gaussian elimination preprocessing step, our proposed method improves upon earlier algorithms in cases when Hamiltonian terms share the same prefactors. We test the performance of our method against established ones for benchmarking purposes. Finally, we apply our methodology to the model of a cavity filled with molecules in a solvent. This open quantum system is cast into the hierarchical equation of motion (HEOM) setting to obtain an effective Hamiltonian. Construction of the corresponding TTNO demonstrates a sub-linear increase of the maximum bond dimension.</description>
