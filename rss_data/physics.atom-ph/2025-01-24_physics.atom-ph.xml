      <title>Precision determination of the excited-state hyperfine splitting of Cadmium ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precision determination of the hyperfine splitting of cadmium ions is essential to study space-time variation of fundamental physical constants and isotope shifts. In this work, we present the precision frequency measurement of the excited-state $^2{P}_{3/2}$ hyperfine splitting of $^{111,113}\mathrm{Cd}^+$ ions using the laser-induced fluorescence technique. By introducing the technology of sympathetic cooling and setting up free-space beat detection unit based on the optical comb, the uncertainties are improved to 14.8 kHz and 10.0 kHz, respectively, two orders of magnitude higher than the reported results from the linear transformation of isotope shifts. The magnetic dipole constants $A_{P_{3/2}}$ of $^{111}\mathrm{Cd}^+$ and $^{113}\mathrm{Cd}^+$ are estimated to be 395 938.8(7.4) kHz and 411 276.0(5.0) kHz, respectively. The difference between the measured and theoretical hyperfine structure constants indicates that more physical effects are required to be considered in the theoretical calculation, and provides critical data for the examination of deviation from King-plot linearity in isotope shifts.</description>

      <title>Systematic opacity calculations for kilonovae -- II. Improved atomic data for singly ionized lanthanides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lanthanides play most important roles in the opacities for kilonova, ultraviolet-optical-infrared emission from neutron star mergers. Although several efforts have been made to construct atomic data, the accuracy in the opacity is not fully assessed and understood. In this paper, we perform atomic calculations for singly ionized lanthanides with improved strategies, aiming at understanding the physics of the lanthanide opacities in kilonova ejecta and necessary accuracy in atomic data. Our results show systematically lower energy level distributions as compared with our previous study (Paper I). As a result, the opacities evaluated with our new results are higher by a factor of up to 3 - 10, depending on the element and wavelength range. For a lanthanide-rich element mixture, our results give a higher opacity than that in Paper I by a factor of about 1.5. We also present opacities by using the results of ab-initio atomic calculations by using Grasp2K code. In general, our new opacities show good agreements with those with ab-initio calculations. We identify that structure of the lanthanide opacities are controlled by transition arrays among several configurations, for which derivation of accurate energy level distribution is important to obtain reliable opacities.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal interactions induce frequency shifts in superradiant lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superradiant lasers, which consist of incoherently driven atoms coupled to a lossy cavity, are a promising source of coherent light due to their stable frequency and superior narrow linewidth. We show that when a fraction of the atoms is not driven, a shift in the lasing frequency and a broadening of the linewidth occur, limiting the performance of a superradiant laser. We explain this behavior by identifying nonreciprocal interactions between driven and undriven atoms, i.e., competing alignment and antialignment of their dipoles. Our results have implications for the realization of superradiant lasers, establishing the relevance of nonreciprocal phenomena for quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Resonant Photon Scattering in the Presence of External Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This theoretical study explores resonant elastic photon scattering in the presence of external electric and magnetic fields, motivated by potential applications in storage ring experiments, such as the Gamma Factory project at CERN. In this framework, resonant scattering involves head-on collisions of relativistic ion beams and counter-propagating laser photons, leading to a strong enhancement of the external field strength due to the Lorentz transformation between ion rest and laboratory frame. Calculations for He-like Ca ions reveal a notable impact of the external fields on the scattering rate as well as the angular distribution and polarization of emitted photons. This opens interesting avenues for diverse applications for the Gamma Factory project, such as as resonance condition tuning, beam cooling, and polarization control.</description>

      <title>Quasi-analytical lineshape for the 1S-2S laser spectroscopy of antihydrogen and hydrogen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04509v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The accuracy of high precision and fundamental measurements of atomic transition frequencies via laser spectroscopy depends upon fitting the spectral data with a lineshape. With atomic hydrogen and antihydrogen 1S-2S two-photon spectroscopy, computer intensive Monte-Carlo simulations have been used to compute the optical Bloch equations in order to match and interpret the experimental spectra. For the highest resolutions, one tries to minimize saturation effects going to regimes of low excitation probability, where perturbation theory can provide reliable results. Here we describe an analytical approach to the lineshape based on perturbation theory accounting for the AC-Stark shift and ionization. The expressions can be used for beam experiments or integrated over the magnetic field profile for a trapped sample. Theses lineshapes, providing fast results, allow for studies of many systematic effects that influence the accuracy of the determination of the central frequency. This development has relevance to hydrogen beam experiments and to trapped hydrogen and antihydrogen, as developed by the ALPHA collaboration at CERN, for tests of the CPT-symmetry and the highest accuracy measurement on antimatter.</description>

      <title>Temperature sensitivity of a Thorium-229 solid-state nuclear clock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11590v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum state-resolved spectroscopy of the low energy thorium-229 nuclear transition was recently achieved. The five allowed transitions within the electric quadrupole structure were measured to the kilohertz level in a calcium fluoride host crystal, opening many new areas of research using nuclear clocks. Central to the performance of solid-state clock operation is an understanding of systematic shifts such as the temperature dependence of the clock transitions. In this work, we measure the four strongest transitions of thorium-229 in the same crystal at three temperature values: 150 K, 229 K, and 293 K. We find shifts of the unsplit frequency and the electric quadrupole splittings, corresponding to decreases in the electron density, electric field gradient, and field gradient asymmetry at the nucleus as temperature increases. The $\textit{m}$ = $\pm 5/2 \rightarrow \pm 3/2$ line shifts only 62(6) kHz over the temperature range, i.e., approximately 0.4 kHz/K, representing a promising candidate for a future solid-state optical clock. Achieving 10$^{-18}$ precision requires crystal temperature stability of 5$\mu$K.</description>
