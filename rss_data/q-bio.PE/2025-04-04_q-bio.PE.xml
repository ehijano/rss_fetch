      <title>Modelling \textit{Aedes albopictus} management, incorporating immigration and bi-directional \textit{Wolbachia} interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: \textit{Aedes albopictus} mosquitoes are competent vectors for the spread of at least 24 different arboviruses, including dengue, Ross River, and Japanese encephalitis viruses. However, they remain less studied than their more urban cousins, \textit{Aedes aegypti}. We model an Incompatible Insect Technique (IIT) strategy for mosquito control, with bi-directional incompatibility between two strains of \textit{Wolbachia} (\walba/\walbb\, $\times$ \arwp) and age-based cytoplasmic incompatibility decay in a well-mixed population. An important consideration in bi-directional IIT control programs is reversibility when immigration is included. We explore the establishment probability after female contamination of an artificially-infected \textit{Wolbachia} mosquito strain, finding a conservative threshold of 40\% likely driven by mating inefficiencies -- this threshold needs validation in future field and lab experiments. We consider the suppression dynamics and probability of mosquito management success for different release strategies, showing differences in success between release cessation and six months later for different immigration rates. Importantly, our model suggests bi-directional IIT control programs are reversible with low amounts of immigration. We determine a corresponding cost proxy (numbers of mosquitoes released), showing similar short-term costs with differences in medium- and longer-term costs between release strategies. This work demonstrates opportunities to optimise the suppression of these medically important mosquitoes.</description>

      <title>Stability of complex communities: A perspective from discrete-time dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the stability of complex communities is a central focus in ecology, many important theoretical advancements have been made to identify drivers of ecological stability. However, previous results often rely on the continuous-time dynamics, assuming that species have overlapping generations. In contrast, numerous real-world communities consist of species with non-overlapping generations, whose quantitative behavior can only be precisely represented by discrete-time dynamics rather than continuous ones. Here, we develop a theoretical framework and propose a metric to quantify the stability of complex communities characterized by non-overlapping generations and diverse interaction types. In stark contrast to existing results for overlapping generations, we find that increasing self-regulation strength first stabilizes and then destabilizes complex communities. This pattern is further confirmed in both exploitative (E. aerogenes, P. aurantiaca, P. chlororaphis, P. citronellolis) and competitive (P. putida, P. veroni, S. marcescens) soil microbial communities. Moreover, we show that communities with diverse interaction types become the most stable, which is corroborated by empirical mouse microbial networks. Furthermore, we reveal that the prevalence of weak interactions can stabilize communities, which is consistent with findings from existing microbial experiments. Our analyses of complex communities with non-overlapping generations provide a more comprehensive understanding of ecological stability and informs practical strategies for ecological restoration and control.</description>

      <title>Bayesian eco-evolutionary game dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The symbiotic relationship between the frameworks of classical game theory and evolutionary game theory is well-established. However, evolutionary game theorists have mostly tapped into the classical game of complete information where players are completely informed of all other players' payoffs. Of late, there is a surge of interest in eco-evolutionary interactions where the environment's state is changed by the players' actions which, in turn, are influenced by the changing environment. However, in real life, the information about the true environmental state must pass through some noisy channel (like usually imperfect sensory apparatus of the players) before it is perceived by the players: The players naturally are prone to sometimes perceive the true state erroneously. Given the uncertain perceived environment, the players may adopt bet-hedging kind of strategies in which they play different actions in different perceptions. In a population of such ill-informed players, a player would be confused about the information state of her opponent, and an incomplete information situation akin to a Bayesian game surfaces. In short, we contemplate possibility of natural emergence of symbiotic relationship between the frameworks of Bayesian games and eco-evolutionary games when the players are equipped with inefficient sensory apparatus. Herein, we illustrate this connection using a setup of infinitely large, well-mixed population of players equipped with two actions for exploiting a resource (the environment) at two different rates so that the resource state evolves accordingly. The state of the resource impacts every player's decision of playing particular action. We investigate continuous state environment in the presence of a Gaussian noisy channel. Employing the formalism of replicator dynamics, we find that noisy information can be effective in preventing resource from going extinct.</description>

      <title>A Behaviour and Disease Model of Testing and Isolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There has been interest in the interactions between infectious disease dynamics and behaviour for most of the history of mathematical epidemiology. This has included consideration of which mathematical models best capture each phenomenon, as well as their interaction, but typically in a manner that is agnostic to the exact behaviour in question. Here, we investigate interacting behaviour and disease dynamics specifically related to behaviours around testing and isolation. This epidemiological-behavioural interaction is of particular interest as, prospectively, it is well-placed to be informed by real-world data temporally monitoring test results and compliance with testing policy. To carry out our investigation we extend an existing "behaviour and disease" (BaD) model by incorporating the dynamics of symptomatic testing and isolation. We provide a dynamical systems analysis of the ordinary differential equations that define this model, providing theoretical results on its behaviour early in a new outbreak (particularly its basic reproduction number) and endemicity of the system (its steady states and associated stability criteria). We then supplement these findings with a numerical analysis to inform how temporal and cumulative outbreak metrics depend on the model parameter values for epidemic and endemic regimes. As the presented interdisciplinary modelling approach can accommodate further extensions (including, but not limited to, adding testing capacity, decay in behavioural effects and multiple pathogen variants), we hope that our work will encourage further modelling studies integrating specific measured behaviours and disease dynamics that may reduce the health and economic impacts of future epidemics.</description>

      <title>Addressing missing context in regulatory variation across primate evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In primates, loci associated with adaptive trait variation often fall in non-coding regions. Understanding the mechanisms linking these regulatory variants to fitness-relevant phenotypes remains challenging, but can be addressed using functional genomic data. However, such data are rarely generated at scale in non-human primates. When they are, only select tissues, cell types, developmental stages, and cellular environments are typically considered, despite appreciation that adaptive variants often exhibit context-dependent effects. In this review, we 1) discuss why context-dependent regulatory loci might be especially evolutionarily relevant in primates, 2) explore challenges and emerging solutions for mapping such context-dependent variation, and 3) discuss the scientific questions these data could address. We argue that filling this gap will provide critical insights into evolutionary processes, human disease, and regulatory adaptation.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Trade-off between Infections and Social Interactions Using a Compact Model of Endemic Infections on Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05327v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In many epidemiological and ecological contexts, there is a trade-off between infections and interactions. This arises because the links between individuals capable of spreading infections are also often associated with beneficial activities. Here, we consider how the presence of explicit network structure changes the optimal solution of a class of infection-interaction trade-offs. In order to do this, we develop and analyse a low-dimensional dynamical system approximating the network SIS epidemic. We find that network structure in the form of heterogeneous numbers of contacts can have a significant impact on the optimal number of contacts that comes out of a trade-off model.</description>
