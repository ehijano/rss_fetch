      <title>Towards Enhancing Data Equity in Public Health Data Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-driven decisions shape public health policies and practice, yet persistent disparities in data representation skew insights and undermine interventions. To address this, we advance a structured roadmap that integrates public health data science with computer science and is grounded in reflexivity. We adopt data equity as a guiding concept: ensuring the fair and inclusive representation, collection, and use of data to prevent the introduction or exacerbation of systemic biases that could lead to invalid downstream inference and decisions. To underscore urgency, we present three public health cases where non-representative datasets and skewed knowledge impede decisions across diverse subgroups. These challenges echo themes in two literatures: public health highlights gaps in high-quality data for specific populations, while computer science and statistics contribute criteria and metrics for diagnosing bias in data and models. Building on these foundations, we propose a working definition of public health data equity and a structured self-audit framework. Our framework integrates core computational principles (fairness, accountability, transparency, ethics, privacy, confidentiality) with key public health considerations (selection bias, representativeness, generalizability, causality, information bias) to guide equitable practice across the data life cycle, from study design and data collection to measurement, analysis, interpretation, and translation. Embedding data equity in routine practice offers a practical path for ensuring that data-driven policies, artificial intelligence, and emerging technologies improve health outcomes for all. Finally, we emphasize the critical understanding that, although data equity is an essential first step, it does not inherently guarantee information, learning, or decision equity.</description>

      <title>A State Model for the Analysis of Stem Cell Proliferation and Differentiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stem cells are characterized by their ability to self-renew, as well as to differentiate and give rise to new populations of cells. Stem cell divisions are crucial for generative processes that occur during early development, and later in adulthood to support tissue regenerative capabilities. This property of stemness, the ability of self-renewal or tissue-specific differentiation, is also observed in cancer cells facilitating the sustenance of tumor growth, and in bipotent megakaryocytic-erythroid progenitors (MEPs) to produce blood cells. We are interested in modeling the size of the stem cell population required to adequately generate tissues or colonies of cells. We develop a state model that characterizes stem cell divisions and the dynamic changes of the stem cell and differentiated cell populations. In our model, the probabilities of self-renewal and differentiation events that stem cells undergo can vary over time instead of remaining constant throughout the process. We provide an estimation method for the division probabilities and using a simulation study, we show that our method provides good estimates even with a small sample size.</description>

      <title>DESA: An R Package for Detecting Epidemics using a School-Absenteeism Surveillance Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Absenteeism of elementary school children has been shown to be effective in the early detection of an incoming influenza epidemic within a given population. This paper introduces DESA, an R package designed to: 1) model an epidemic using school absenteeism data, 2) raise an alert for an incoming epidemic using school absenteeism data, 3) evaluate the timeliness of the raised alert using different metrics, and 4) simulate community-level household populations, epidemics, and school absenteeism to facilitate research in related fields. This paper provides an overview of the functions in the package and demonstrates its complete workflow using simulated data generated within the package. DESA offers researchers and public health officials a tool for improving early detection of seasonal influenza epidemics or epidemics of other diseases. The package is available on CRAN, making it readily accessible to the R user community.</description>

      <title>Causal resilience curves: A data-driven framework for quantifying the spatiotemporal impacts of metro service disruptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07514v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Urban metro systems move vast numbers of passengers with a high level of efficiency in resource use, but frequently experience disruptions that result in delays, crowding, and deterioration in passenger satisfaction and patronage. To quantify these adverse consequences, this paper presents a novel, data-driven causal inference framework to measure metro resilience by estimating both the direct and spillover effects of service disruptions on passenger demand, journey time, travel speed and on-board crowding. By integrating high-frequency smart card data into a synthetic control design, we use weighted non-disrupted days to construct unbiased counterfactuals, which resolves confounding factors and accurately captures disruption propagation across the network. The impact estimates are further translated into station-level causal resilience curves that reveal spatial heterogeneity in the temporal patterns of degradation and recovery across locations, providing metro operators with actionable insights for targeted interventions and resource allocation. A case study of the Hong Kong MTR demonstrates the framework's superiority over naive typical-day comparisons and machine-learning benchmarks in delivering unbiased resilience curves. This paper is the first to derive causal estimates of dynamic metro resilience. This practical tool can be generalised to evaluate resilience in a broad range of public transport systems.</description>

      <title>Forecasting Influenza Hospitalizations Using a Bayesian Hierarchical Nonlinear Model with Discrepancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14339v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The annual influenza outbreak leads to significant public health and economic burdens making it desirable to have prompt and accurate probabilistic forecasts of the disease spread. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) hosts annually a national flu forecasting competition which has led to the development of a variety of flu forecast modeling methods. Beginning in 2013, the target to be forecast was weekly percentage of patients with an influenza-like illness (ILI), but in 2021 the target was changed to weekly hospitalizations. Reliable hospitalization data has only been available since 2021, but ILI data has been available since 2010 and has been successfully forecast for several seasons. In this manuscript, we introduce a two component modeling framework for forecasting hospitalizations utilizing both hospitalization and ILI data. The first component is for modeling ILI data using a nonlinear Bayesian model. The second component is for modeling hospitalizations as a function of ILI. For hospitalization forecasts, ILI is first forecast then hospitalizations are forecast with ILI forecasts used as a predictor. In a simulation study, the hospitalization forecast model is assessed and two previously successful ILI forecast models are compared. Also assessed is the usefulness of including a systematic model discrepancy term in the ILI model. Forecasts of state and national hospitalizations for the 2023-24 flu season are made, and different modeling decisions are compared. We found that including a discrepancy component in the ILI model tends to improve forecasts during certain weeks of the year. We also found that other modeling decisions such as the exact nonlinear function to be used in the ILI model or the error distribution for hospitalization models may or may not be better than other decisions, depending on the season, location, or week of the forecast.</description>

      <title>Warnings based on risk matrices: a coherent framework with consistent evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08891v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Risk matrices are widely used across a range of fields and have found increasing utility in warning decision practices globally. However, their application in this context presents challenges, which range from potentially perverse warning outcomes to a lack of objective verification (i.e., evaluation) methods. This paper introduces a coherent framework for generating multi-level warnings from risk matrices to address these challenges. The proposed framework is general, is based on probabilistic forecasts of hazard severity or impact and is compatible with the Common Alerting Protocol (CAP). Moreover, it includes a family of consistent scoring functions for objectively evaluating the predictive performance of risk matrix assessments and the warnings they produce. These scoring functions enable the ranking of forecasters or warning systems and the tracking of system improvements by rewarding accurate probabilistic forecasts and compliance with warning service directives. A synthetic experiment demonstrates the efficacy of these scoring functions, while the framework is illustrated through warnings for heavy rainfall based on operational ensemble prediction system forecasts for Tropical Cyclone Jasper (Queensland, Australia, 2023). This work establishes a robust foundation for enhancing the reliability and verifiability of risk-based warning systems.</description>

      <title>Temporal Point Process Modeling of Aggressive Behavior Onset in Psychiatric Inpatient Youths with Autism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15821v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Aggressive behavior, including aggression towards others and self-injury, occurs in up to 80% of children and adolescents with autism, making it a leading cause of behavioral health referrals and a major driver of healthcare costs. Predicting when autistic youth will exhibit aggression can be challenging due to their communication difficulties. Many are minimally verbal or have poor emotional insight. Recent advances in Machine Learning and wearable biosensing demonstrate the ability to predict aggression within a limited future window (typically one to three minutes) in autistic individuals. However, existing works don't estimate aggression onset probability or the expected number of aggression onsets over longer periods, nor do they provide interpretable insights into onset dynamics. To address these limitations, we apply Temporal Point Processes (TPPs) - particularly self-exciting Hawkes processes - to model the timing of aggressive behavior onsets in psychiatric inpatient autistic youth. We benchmark several TPP models by evaluating their goodness-of-fit and predictive metrics. Our results demonstrate that self-exciting TPPs more accurately captures the irregular and clustered nature of aggression onsets, especially compared to traditional Poisson models. These incipient findings suggest that TPPs can provide interpretable, probabilistic forecasts of aggression onset along a time continuum, supporting future clinical decision-making and preemptive intervention.</description>

      <title>HAL-Based Plug-in Estimation with Pointwise Asymptotic Normality of the Causal Dose-Response Curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05607v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimating and obtaining reliable inference for the marginally adjusted causal dose-response curve for continuous treatments without relying on parametric assumptions is a well-known statistical challenge. Parametric models risk introducing significant bias through model misspecification, compromising the accurate representation of the underlying data and dose-response relationship. On the other hand, nonparametric models face difficulties as the dose-response curve is not pathwise differentiable, preventing consistent estimation at standard rates. The Highly Adaptive Lasso (HAL) maximum likelihood estimator offers a promising approach to this issue. In this paper, we introduce a HAL-based plug-in estimator for the causal dose-response curve, bridge theoretical development and empirical application, and assess its empirical performance against other estimators. This work emphasizes not just theoretical proofs, but also demonstrates their application through comprehensive simulations, thereby filling an essential gap between theory and practice. Our comprehensive simulations demonstrate that the HAL-based estimator achieves pointwise asymptotic normality with valid inference and consistently outperforms existing approaches for estimating the causal dose-response curve.</description>

      <title>Faster Random Walk-based Capacitance Extraction with Generalized Antithetic Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20586v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Floating random walk-based capacitance extraction has emerged in recent years as a tried and true approach for extracting parasitic capacitance in very large scale integrated circuits. Being a Monte Carlo method, its performance is dependent on the variance of sampled quantities and variance reduction methods are crucial for the challenges posed by ever denser process technologies and layout-dependent effects. In this work, we present a novel, universal variance reduction method for floating random walk-based capacitance extraction, which is conceptually simple, highly efficient and provably reduces variance in all extractions, especially when layout-dependent effects are present. It is complementary to existing mathematical formulations for variance reduction and its performance gains are experienced on top of theirs. Numerical experiments demonstrate substantial such gains of up to 30% in number of walks necessary and even more in actual extraction times compared to the best previously proposed variance reduction approaches for the floating random-walk.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Artificial Intelligence Method for Estimating Flicker in Power Systems (Changes are marked)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13611v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel hybrid AI method combining H filtering and an adaptive linear neuron network for flicker component estimation in power distribution systems.The proposed method leverages the robustness of the H filter to extract the voltage envelope under uncertain and noisy conditions followed by the use of ADALINE to accurately identify flicker frequencies embedded in the envelope.This synergy enables efficient time domain estimation with rapid convergence and noise resilience addressing key limitations of existing frequency domain approaches.Unlike conventional techniques this hybrid AI model handles complex power disturbances without prior knowledge of noise characteristics or extensive training.To validate the method performance we conduct simulation studies based on IEC Standard 61000 4 15 supported by statistical analysis Monte Carlo simulations and real world data.Results demonstrate superior accuracy robustness and reduced computational load compared to Fast Fourier Transform and Discrete Wavelet Transform based estimators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19356v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graphs are central to the chemical sciences, providing a natural language to describe molecules, proteins, reactions, and industrial processes. They capture interactions and structures that underpin materials, biology, and medicine. This primer, Graph Data Modeling: Molecules, Proteins, &amp; Chemical Processes, introduces graphs as mathematical objects in chemistry and shows how learning algorithms (particularly graph neural networks) can operate on them. We outline the foundations of graph design, key prediction tasks, representative examples across chemical sciences, and the role of machine learning in graph-based modeling. Together, these concepts prepare readers to apply graph methods to the next generation of chemical discovery.</description>
