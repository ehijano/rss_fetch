      <title>Path integral approach for predicting the diffusive statistics of geometric phases in chaotic Hamiltonian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From the integer quantum Hall effect, to swimming at low Reynolds number, geometric phases arise in the description of many different physical systems. In many of these systems the temporal evolution prescribed by the geometric phase can be directly measured by an external observer. By definition, geometric phases rely on the history of the system's internal dynamics, and so their measurement is directly related to temporal correlations in the system. They, thus, provide a sensitive tool for studying chaotic Hamiltonian systems. In this work we present a toy model consisting of an autonomous, low-dimensional, chaotic Hamiltonian system designed to have a simple planar internal state space, and a single geometric phase. The diffusive phase dynamics in the highly chaotic regime is thus governed by the loop statistics of planar random walks. We show that the na\"ive loop statistics result in ballistic behavior of the phase, and recover the diffusive behavior by considering a bounded shape space, or a quadratic confining potential.</description>

      <title>Mamba time series forecasting with uncertainty propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: State space models, such as Mamba, have recently garnered attention in time series forecasting due to their ability to capture sequence patterns. However, in electricity consumption benchmarks, Mamba forecasts exhibit a mean error of approximately 8\%. Similarly, in traffic occupancy benchmarks, the mean error reaches 18\%. This discrepancy leaves us to wonder whether the prediction is simply inaccurate or falls within error given spread in historical data. To address this limitation, we propose a method to quantify the predictive uncertainty of Mamba forecasts. Here, we propose a dual-network framework based on the Mamba architecture for probabilistic forecasting, where one network generates point forecasts while the other estimates predictive uncertainty by modeling variance. We abbreviate our tool, Mamba with probabilistic time series forecasting, as Mamba-ProbTSF and the code for its implementation is available on GitHub (https://github.com/PessoaP/Mamba-ProbTSF). Evaluating this approach on synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets, we find Kullback-Leibler divergence between the learned distributions and the data--which, in the limit of infinite data, should converge to zero if the model correctly captures the underlying probability distribution--reduced to the order of $10^{-3}$ for synthetic data and $10^{-1}$ for real-world benchmark, demonstrating its effectiveness. We find that in both the electricity consumption and traffic occupancy benchmark, the true trajectory stays within the predicted uncertainty interval at the two-sigma level about 95\% of the time. We end with a consideration of potential limitations, adjustments to improve performance, and considerations for applying this framework to processes for purely or largely stochastic dynamics where the stochastic changes accumulate, as observed for example in pure Brownian motion or molecular dynamics trajectories.</description>

      <title>Singular Value Decomposition and Its Blind Spot for Quantum Chaos in Non-Hermitian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of chaos and complexity in non-Hermitian quantum systems poses significant challenges due to the emergence of complex eigenvalues in their spectra. Recently, the singular value decomposition (SVD) method was proposed to address these challenges. In this work, we identify two critical shortcomings of the SVD approach when analyzing Krylov complexity and spectral statistics in non-Hermitian settings. First, we demonstrate that SVD fails to correctly reproduce the Hermitian limit for systems with non-positive definite spectra, exemplified by a variant of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model. Second, and more fundamentally, Krylov complexity and spectral statistics derived via SVD cannot distinguish chaotic from integrable non-Hermitian dynamics, leading to results that conflict with complex spacing ratio analysis. Our findings reveal that SVD is inadequate for probing quantum chaos in non-Hermitian systems, and we advocate employing more robust methods, such as the bi-Lanczos algorithm, for future research in this direction.</description>

      <title>On the relationship between Koopman operator approximations and neural ordinary differential equations for data-driven time-evolution predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12940v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work explores the relationship between state space methods and Koopman operator-based methods for predicting the time-evolution of nonlinear dynamical systems. We demonstrate that extended dynamic mode decomposition with dictionary learning (EDMD-DL), when combined with a state space projection, is equivalent to a neural network representation of the nonlinear discrete-time flow map on the state space. We highlight how this projection step introduces nonlinearity into the evolution equations, enabling significantly improved EDMD-DL predictions. With this projection, EDMD-DL leads to a nonlinear dynamical system on the state space, which can be represented in either discrete or continuous time. This system has a natural structure for neural networks, where the state is first expanded into a high dimensional feature space followed by a linear mapping which represents the discrete-time map or the vector field as a linear combination of these features. Inspired by these observations, we implement several variations of neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and EDMD-DL, developed by combining different aspects of their respective model structures and training procedures. We evaluate these methods using numerical experiments on chaotic dynamics in the Lorenz system and a nine-mode model of turbulent shear flow, showing comparable performance across methods in terms of short-time trajectory prediction, reconstruction of long-time statistics, and prediction of rare events. These results highlight the equivalence of the EDMD-DL implementation with a state space projection to a neural ODE representation of the dynamics. We also show that these methods provide comparable performance to a non-Markovian approach in terms of prediction of extreme events.</description>

      <title>Master Stability Functions in Complex Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19163v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Synchronization is an emergent and fundamental phenomenon in nature and engineered systems. Understanding the stability of a synchronized phenomenon is crucial for ensuring functionality in various complex systems. The stability of the synchronization phenomenon is extensively studied using the Master Stability Function (MSF). This powerful and elegant tool plays a pivotal role in determining the stability of synchronization states, providing deep insights into synchronization in coupled systems. Although MSF analysis has been used for 25 years to study the stability of synchronization states, a systematic investigation of MSF across various networked systems remains missing from the literature. In this article, we present a simplified and unified MSF analysis for diverse undirected and directed networked systems. We begin with the analytical MSF framework for pairwise-coupled identical systems with diffusive and natural coupling schemes and extend our analysis to directed networks and multilayer networks, considering both intra-layer and inter-layer interactions. Furthermore, we revisit the MSF framework to incorporate higher-order interactions alongside pairwise interactions. To enhance understanding, we also provide a numerical analysis of synchronization in coupled R\"ossler systems under pairwise diffusive coupling and propose algorithms for determining the MSF, identifying stability regimes, and classifying MSF functions. Overall, the primary goal of this review is to present a systematic study of MSF in coupled dynamical networks in a clear and structured manner, making this powerful tool more accessible. Furthermore, we highlight cases where the study of synchronization states using MSF remains underexplored. Additionally, we discuss recent research focusing on MSF analysis using time series data and machine learning approaches.</description>
