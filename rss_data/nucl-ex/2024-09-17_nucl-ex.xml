      <title>Imaging the structure of atomic nuclei in high-energy nuclear collisions from STAR experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In relativistic heavy-ion collisions, the extractions of properties of quark-gluon plasma (QGP) are hindered by a limited understanding of its initial conditions, where the nuclear structure of the colliding ions play a significant role. In these proceedings, we present the first quantitative demonstration using ``collective flow assisted nuclear shape imaging" method to extract the quadrupole deformation and triaxiality from $^{238}$U using data from the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). We achieve this by comparing bulk observables in $^{238}$U+$^{238}$U collisions with nearly spherical $^{197}$Au+$^{197}$Au collisions. A similar comparative measurement performed in collisions of $^{96}$Ru+$^{96}$Ru and $^{96}$Zr+$^{96}$Zr, suggests the presence of moderate quadrupole deformation of $^{96}$Ru, large octupole deformation of $^{96}$Zr, as well as an apparent neutron skin difference between these two species. The prospect of this nuclear shape imaging method as a novel tool for the study of nuclear structure is also elaborated.</description>

      <title>N$^{\mathbf{3}}$LL + $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^2)$ predictions of lepton-jet azimuthal angular distribution in deep-inelastic scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an analysis of lepton-jet azimuthal decorrelation in deep-inelastic scattering (DIS) at next-to-next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic (N$^{3}$LL) accuracy, combined with fixed-order corrections at $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^2)$. In this study, jets are defined in the lab frame using the anti-$k_T$ clustering algorithm and the winner-take-all recombination scheme. The N$^{3}$LL resummation results are derived from the transverse-momentum dependent factorization formula within the soft-collinear effective theory, while the $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^2)$ fixed-order matching distribution is calculated using the {\tt NLOJET++} event generator. The azimuthal decorrelation between the jet and electron serves as a critical probe of the three-dimensional structure of the nucleon. Our numerical predictions provide a robust framework for precision studies of QCD and the nucleon's internal structure through jet observables in DIS. These results are particularly significant for analyses involving jets in HERA data and the forthcoming electron-ion collider experiments.</description>

      <title>Multiple-models prediction for light neutron-rich isotopes cross section by $Q_g$ systematics in $^{40}$Ar projectile fragmentation reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precise predictions for nuclei near drip lines are crucial for experiments in new generation of rare isotope facilities. A multi-models investigation of the $Q_g$ systematics for fragments production cross sections, with $Q_g$ defined as the difference of mass excess (ME) between the projectile ($Z_{p}, A_{p}$) and the fragment ($Z_{f}, A_{f}$) nuclei $Q_{g}=ME(Z_{p}, A_{p})-ME(Z_{f}, A_{f})$, has been performed to verify the model prediction abilities for light neutron-rich isotopes in measured $^{40}$Ar + $^9$Be projectile fragmentation reactions from 57$A$ MeV to 1$A$ GeV. The models used are the FRACS parametrizations and the newly developed Bayesian neural networks (BNN) model. %method The results show that FRACS, BNN, and $Q_g$ extrapolations are generally consistent, except for fragments near the nuclear mass of the projectile. Additionally, both measured data and model extrapolations provide evidence for a shell closure at $N=$ 16 in fluorine and neon, as well as the disappearance of the traditional magic number $N=$ 20 in neon, sodium and magnesium.</description>

      <title>Pion-nucleon scattering with decuplet contribution in heavy baryon SU(3) chiral perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the complete $T$ matrices with decuplet contributions for pion-nucleon scattering to order $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^3)$ in heavy baryon SU(3) chiral perturbation theory. The baryon mass in the chiral limit $M_0$ and the low-energy constants are determined by fitting to phase shifts of $\pi N$, the experimental octet-baryon masses, and the value of $\sigma_{\pi N}$ simultaneously. By using these constants, we obtain the accurate $KN$ $\sigma$ terms, $\sigma_{KN}^{(1)}=(375.07\pm33.02)$ MeV and $\sigma_{KN}^{(2)}=(275.32\pm32.24)$ MeV. An excellent description of the phase shifts is obtained for all partial waves. We also present results for scattering lengths and scattering volumes. In addition, the convergence of the approach is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Fuzzy logic for reconstructing arbitrary moments of multiplicity distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Identity Method is a statistical technique developed to reconstruct moments of multiplicity distributions of particles produced in high-energy nuclear collisions. The method leverages principles from fuzzy logic, allowing for a more nuanced representation of particle identification by assigning degrees of membership to different particle types based on detector signals. In this contribution, a mathematical framework, based on a multivariate moment generation function, is developed that allows the derivation of the formulas used in the Identity Method in a more robust way. Moreover, within the introduced framework, the Identity Method is easily extended to cope with arbitrarily higher-order moments. The techniques developed here offer significant potential for improving the accuracy of multiplicity distribution analyses in high-energy nuclear collisions. While the primary focus of the work presented is on applications in high-energy and nuclear physics, it can also be applied in other areas where signal identification is probabilistic and data are noisy, such as medical imaging, remote sensing, and various other fields of experimental science.</description>

      <title>The Current State of the Controversy over Screening in Nuclear Reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A controversy about the possibility of dynamic effects in nuclear screening has been around for several decades. On the one hand, there is the claim that there are no dynamic effects, and that the classic Salpeter correction based on static Debye screening is all that is needed for astrophysical applications. The size of the correction is on the order of 5% in typical solar fusion reactions. On the other hand, numerical simulations have shown that there is a dynamical effect, which essentially cancels the Salpeter correction. The results of the numerical simulations were later independently confirmed. The astrophysical community, however, has so far largely ignored the possibility of dynamical screening. The present paper is meant to serve as a reminder of the controversy. Not only does the claim of an absence of a dynamical effect equally warrant an independent confirmation, but there is motivation for further investigation, such as the assessment of current laboratory experiments and a quantitative study of the dynamical effect in case it will turn out to be real.</description>

      <title>Multiple rescattering effects in the hard knockout reaction $\mathbf{^2\mbox{H}(p,2p)n}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interaction of a proton with a deuteron is the simplest nuclear reaction. However, it allows the study of precursors of nuclear medium effects such as initial-state/final-state interactions (ISI/FSI). In case of hard proton knockout, the deviation of ISI/FSI from the 'standard' values may carry a signal of color transparency. In this regard, it is important to define the 'standard' as precisely as possible. This work continues previous studies within the framework of the Generalized Eikonal Approximation (GEA). The focus is on processes where the participating protons experience multiple soft rescattering on the spectator neutron. It is shown that correct treatment of deviations of the trajectories of outgoing protons from the longitudinal direction leads to a significant modification of partial amplitudes with soft rescattering of two outgoing protons and non-vanishing amplitudes with rescattering of incoming and outgoing protons. The new treatment of multiple rescattering is important in kinematics with a forward spectator neutron.</description>

      <title>Ab initio calculations of anomalous seniority breaking in the $\pi g_{9/2}$ shell for the $N=50$ isotones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We performed \textit{ab initio} valence-space in-medium similarity renormalization group (VS-IMSRG) calculations based on chiral two-nucleon and three-nucleon interactions to investigate the anomalous seniority breaking in the neutron number $N=50$ isotones: $^{92}$Mo, $^{94}$Ru, $^{96}$Pd, and $^{98}$Cd. Our calculations well reproduced the measured low-lying spectra and electromagnetic $E2$ transitions in these nuclei, supporting partial seniority conservation in the first $\pi g_{9/2}$ shell. Recent experiments have revealed that, compared to the symmetric patterns predicted under the conserved seniority symmetry, the $4^+_1\to2^+_1$ $E2$ transition strength in $^{94}$Ru is significantly enhanced and that in $^{96}$Pd is suppressed. In contrast, the $6^+_1\to 4^+_1$ and $8^+_1\to6^+_1$ transitions exhibit the opposite trend. We found that this anomalous asymmetry is sensitive to subtle seniority breaking effects, providing a stringent test for state-of-the-art nucleon-nucleon interactions and nuclear models. We analyzed the anomalous asymmetry using VS-IMSRG calculations across various valence spaces. Our \textit{ab initio} results suggest that core excitations of both proton and neutron across the $Z=50$ shell are ascribed to the observed anomalous seniority breaking in the $N=50$ isotones.</description>

      <title>Radii of Mirror Nuclei and Isobaric Triplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08193v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a review of absolute root-mean-square charge radii of stable nuclei up to $Z=32$, which includes a previously overlooked uncertainty in the combined analysis of muonic x-ray and electron scattering experiments. From these \textit{reference radii} and isotope shift measurements, we obtain those of 12 mirror pairs with a traceable and realistic uncertainty budget. The difference in radii between mirror nuclei is found to be proportional to the isospin asymmetry, confirming recent calculations by Novario \emph{et al.} [PRL~130, 032501]. From the fitted proportionality constant and its uncertainty, the radii of 73 previously unknown mirror partners are predicted. These are useful e.g. for benchmarking atomic and nuclear theory, calibrating entire chains, and as an input to nuclear beta-decay calculations. The radii of $(T=1,T_z=0)$ nuclei are interpolated assuming negligible isospin symmetry breaking. This completes a model-independent, high-precision extraction of the charge and weak radii of all nuclei involved in the testing of the unitarity of the CKM matrix.</description>

      <title>Applicability of Hydrodynamics in Hadronic Phase of Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.14792v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The hadronic phase and its dynamics in relativistic heavy-ion collisions are topics of immense discussion. The hadronic phase contains various massive hadrons with an abundance of the lightest hadron, i.e., $\pi$-mesons. In this work, we consider that pions are in the thermal equilibrium in the hadronic phase and use second-order massive viscous hydrodynamics to obtain its expansion to the boundary of the kinetic freeze-out. We achieve the kinetic freeze-out boundary with the Knudsen number ($Kn$) limit: $Kn&gt;1$. When this condition is met, hydrodynamics expansion breaks down, and the mean free path becomes sufficiently large in comparison with the system size so that the particle yields get preserved. Further, we investigate the effect of the massive fluid on the resonance particle yields, including re-scattering and regeneration, along with their natural decay width. These resonances can play an important role in determining the characteristics of the hadronic phase as they have sufficiently small lifetimes, which may be comparable to the hadronic phase lifetime. In the current study, we predict the hadronic phase lifetime, which is further used to determine the $K^*(892)^0/K$, $\phi(1020)/K$, and $\rho(770)^0/\pi$ ratios at the kinetic freeze-out. We obtain these ratios as a function of charged particle multiplicity and transverse momentum and compare our findings with experimental data. Our results qualitatively agree with the experimental data indicating the possible hydrodynamical evolution of the hadronic phase.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty quantification in $(p,n)$ reactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18629v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Charge-exchange reactions are versatile probes for nuclear structure. In particular, when populating isobaric analog states, these reactions are used to study isovector nuclear densities and neutron skins. The quality of the information extracted from charge-exchange data depends on the accuracy of the reaction models and their inputs; this work addresses these two points. First, we quantify the uncertainties due to effective nucleon-nucleus interactions by propagating the parameter posterior distributions of the recent global optical model KDUQ [1] to $(p,n)$ reaction observables populating the isobaric analogue state, at beam energies in the range of $25-160$ MeV. Our analysis, focusing on $^{48}$Ca, shows that the total parametric uncertainties on the cross sections are around 60-100%. The source of this uncertainty is mainly the transition operator as the uncertainties from the distorted waves alone are less than about 15%. Second, we perform a comparison between two- and three-body models that both describe the dynamics of the reaction within the DWBA. The predictions from these two models are similar and generally agree with the available data, suggesting that 1-step DWBA is sufficient to describe the reaction process. Only at a beam energy of 25 MeV there are possibly signs that a 1-step assumption is not fully correct. This work provides motivation for the quantification of uncertainties associated with the transition operator in three-body model. It also suggests that further constraint of the optical potential parameters is needed for increased model precision.</description>

      <title>Measurement of $J/\psi$ and $\psi\left(2S\right)$ production in $p+p$ and $p+d$ interactions at 120 GeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11459v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the $p+p$ and $p+d$ differential cross sections measured in the SeaQuest experiment for $J/\psi$ and $\psi\left(2S\right)$ production at 120 GeV beam energy covering the forward $x$-Feynman ($x_F$) range of $0.5 &lt; x_F &lt;0.9$. The measured cross sections are in good agreement with theoretical calculations based on the nonrelativistic QCD (NRQCD) using the long-distance matrix elements deduced from a recent global analysis of proton- and pion-induced charmonium production data. The $\sigma_{\psi\left(2S\right)} / \sigma_{J/\psi}$ cross section ratios are found to increase as $x_F$ increases, indicating that the $q \bar{q}$ annihilation process has larger contributions in the $\psi\left(2S\right)$ production than the $J/\psi$ production. The $\sigma_{pd}/2\sigma_{pp}$ cross section ratios are observed to be significantly different for the Drell-Yan process and $J/\psi$ production, reflecting their different production mechanisms. We find that the $\sigma_{pd}/2\sigma_{pp}$ ratios for $J/\psi$ production at the forward $x_F$ region are sensitive to the $\bar{d}/ \bar{u}$ flavor asymmetry of the proton sea, analogous to the Drell-Yan process. The transverse momentum ($p_T$) distributions for $J/\psi$ and $\psi\left(2S\right)$ production are also presented and compared with data collected at higher center-of-mass energies.</description>

Abstract: Magnetic Johnson noise is an important consideration for many applications involving precision magnetometry, and its significance will only increase in the future with improvements in measurement sensitivity. The fluctuation-dissipation theorem can be utilized to derive analytic expressions for magnetic Johnson noise in certain situations. But when used in conjunction with finite element analysis tools, the combined approach is particularly powerful as it provides a practical means to calculate the magnetic Johnson noise arising from conductors of arbitrary geometry and permeability. In this paper, we demonstrate this method to be one of the most comprehensive approaches presently available to calculate thermal magnetic noise. In particular, its applicability is shown to not be limited to cases where the noise is evaluated at a point in space but also can be expanded to include cases where the magnetic field detector has a more general shape, such as a finite size loop, a gradiometer, or a detector that consists of a polarized atomic species trapped in a volume. Furthermore, some physics insights gained through studies made using this method are discussed</description>

Abstract: Inspired by the EMC effect, the Cd puzzle and the SU3-IBM, a hypothesis can be given for a nucleus, that only the nucleus itself is a trivial (0,0) representation of the SU(3) group, which leads to a simple conclusion that spherical nucleus does not exist and the spherical mean field is not allowed. The key conclusion is that the color degree of freedom is required even at the low energy excitation of the nucleus.</description>

      <title>Baryon stopping and charge deposition in heavy-ion collisions due to gluon saturation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06788v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute baryon and electric charge deposition in high-energy heavy-ion collisions using the Color Glass Condensate (CGC) Effective Field Theory, where at leading order charge is deposited through multiple scatterings of valence quarks with a saturated gluon target. A simplified phenomenological formula is derived to describe charge deposition, from which the parametrical dependence with collisional energy and geometry can be extracted. We present an approximate analytical prediction of the so-called baryon stopping parameter $\alpha_B$, which shows excellent agreement with the state-of-the art extractions of $\alpha_B$ from experimental data. These results are further validated using the McDIPPER framework, by computing charge deposition at midrapidity across a range of collision energies ($\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}= 62.4 - 5020$ GeV).</description>
