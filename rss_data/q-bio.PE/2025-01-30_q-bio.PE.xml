      <title>Sensitivity Analysis of SEIR SEI Model of Dengue Disease</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dengue is a vector borne infectious disease. The disease is transmitted byAedes mosquitoes. In the present work, SEIR - SEI compartmental epidemiological model is used to describe dengue disease transmission dynamics. The human population is classified into four epidemiological states: Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious and Recovered humans. The mosquito population is divided into three epidemiological states: Susceptible, Exposed and Infectious mosquitoes. Associated basic reproduction number which determines whether the disease will persist or die out, is calculated by Next Generation method. Stability of the equilibrium points of the model is analyzed in terms of basic reproduction number. Sensitivity analysis is carried out to study importance of modelparameters.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of Stochastic and Predictable Models in the HIV Epidemic Across Genders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study conducts a comparative analysis of stochastic and deterministic models to better understand the dynamics of the HIV epidemic across genders. By incorporating gender-specific transmission probabilities and treatment uptake rates, the research addresses gaps in existing models that often overlook these critical factors. The introduction of gender-specific treatment, where only one gender receives treatment, allows for a detailed examination of its effects on both male and female populations. Two compartmental models, divided by gender, are analyzed in parallel to identify the parameters that most significantly impact the control of infected populations and the number of treated females. Stochastic methods, including the Euler, Runge-Kutta, and Non-Standard Finite Difference (SNSFD) approaches, demonstrate that stochastic models provide a more accurate and realistic portrayal of HIV transmission and progression compared to deterministic models. Key findings reveal that the stochastic Runge-Kutta method is particularly effective in capturing the epidemic's complex dynamics, such as subtle fluctuations in transmission and population changes. The study also emphasizes the crucial role of transmission probabilities and treatment rates in shaping the epidemic's trajectory, highlighting their importance for optimizing public health interventions. The research concludes that advanced stochastic modeling is essential for improving public health policies and responses, especially in resource-constrained settings.</description>

      <title>An SIRS-model considering waning efficiency and periodic re-vaccination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend the classical SIRS (Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered-Susceptible) model from mathematical epidemiology by incorporating a vaccinated compartment, V, accounting for an imperfect vaccine with waning efficacy over time. The SIRSV-model divides the population into four compartments and introduces periodic re-vaccination for waning immunity. The efficiency of the vaccine is assumed to decay with the time passed since the vaccination. Periodic re-vaccinations are applied to the population. We develop a partial differential equation (PDE) model for the continuous vaccination time and a coupled ordinary differential equation (ODE) system when discretizing the vaccination period. We analyze the equilibria of the ODE model and investigate the linear stability of the disease-free equilibrium (DFE). Furthermore, we explore an optimization framework where vaccination rate, re-vaccination time, and non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are control variables to minimize infection levels. The optimization objective is defined using different norm-based measures of infected individuals. A numerical analysis of the model's dynamic behavior under varying control parameters is conducted using path-following methods. The analysis focuses on the impacts of vaccination strategies and contact limitation measures. Bifurcation analysis reveals complex behaviors, including bistability, fold bifurcations, forward and backward bifurcations, highlighting the need for combined vaccination and contact control strategies to manage disease spread effectively.</description>

      <title>The time-dependent reproduction number for epidemics in heterogeneous populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The time-dependent reproduction number Rt can be used to track pathogen transmission and to assess the efficacy of interventions. This quantity can be estimated by fitting renewal equation models to time series of infectious disease case counts. These models almost invariably assume a homogeneous population. Individuals are assumed not to differ systematically in the rates at which they come into contact with others. It is also assumed that the typical time that elapses between one case and those it causes (known as the generation time distribution) does not differ across groups. But contact patterns are known to widely differ by age and according to other demographic groupings, and infection risk and transmission rates have been shown to vary across groups for a range of directly transmitted diseases. Here, we derive from first principles a renewal equation framework which accounts for these differences in transmission across groups. We use a generalisation of the classic McKendrick-von Foerster equation to handle populations structured into interacting groups. This system of partial differential equations allows us to derive a simple analytical expression for Rt which involves only group-level contact patterns and infection risks. We show that the same expression emerges from both deterministic and stochastic discrete-time versions of the model and demonstrate via simulations that our Rt expression governs the long-run fate of epidemics. Our renewal equation model provides a basis from which to account for more realistic, diverse populations in epidemiological models and opens the door to inferential approaches which use known group characteristics to estimate Rt.</description>

      <title>Spinal study of a population model for colonial species with interactions and environmental noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study a stochastic model for the dynamics of colonial species, which reproduce through fission or fragmentation. The fission rate depends on the relative sizes of colonies in the population, and the growth rate of colonies is influenced by intrinsic and environmental stochasticities. Our setting thus captures the effect of an external noise, correlating the trait dynamics of all colonies. In particular, we study the effect of the strength of this correlation on the distribution of resources between colonies. We then extend this model to a large class of structured branching processes with interactions in which the particle type evolves according to a diffusion. The branching and death rates are general functions of the whole population. In this framework, we derive a $\psi$-spine construction and a Many-to-One formula, extending previous works on interacting branching processes. Using this spinal construction, we also propose an alternative simulation method and illustrate its efficiency on the colonial population model. The extended framework we propose can model various ecological systems with interactions, and individual and environmental noises.</description>

      <title>Likelihood landscape of binary latent model on a tree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the optimization landscape of maximum likelihood estimation for a binary latent tree model with hidden variables at internal nodes and observed variables at the leaves. This model, known as the Cavender-Farris-Neyman (CFN) model in statistical phylogenetics, is also a special case of the ferromagnetic Ising model. While the likelihood function is known to be non-concave with multiple critical points in general, gradient descent-type optimization methods have proven surprisingly effective in practice. We provide theoretical insights into this phenomenon by analyzing the population likelihood landscape in a neighborhood of the true parameter vector. Under some conditions on the edge parameters, we show that the expected log-likelihood is strongly concave and smooth in a box around the true parameter whose size is independent of both the tree topology and number of leaves. The key technical contribution is a careful analysis of the expected Hessian, showing that its diagonal entries are large while its off-diagonal entries decay exponentially in the graph distance between the corresponding edges. These results provide the first rigorous theoretical evidence for the effectiveness of optimization methods in this setting and may suggest broader principles for understanding optimization in latent variable models on trees.</description>

      <title>Dispersal-induced instability in complex ecosystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.04206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2003.04206v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In his seminal work in the 1970s, Robert May suggested that there is an upper limit to the number of species that can be sustained in stable equilibrium by an ecosystem. This deduction was at odds with both intuition and the observed complexity of many natural ecosystems. The so-called stability-diversity debate ensued, and the discussion about the factors contributing to ecosystem stability or instability continues to this day. We show in this work that dispersal can be a destabilising influence. To do this, we combine ideas from Alan Turing's work on pattern formation with May's random-matrix approach. We demonstrate how a stable equilibrium in a complex ecosystem with trophic structure can become unstable with the introduction of dispersal in space, and we discuss the factors which contribute to this effect. Our work highlights that adding more details to the model of May can give rise to more ways for an ecosystem to become unstable. Making May's simple model more realistic is therefore unlikely to entirely remove the upper bound on complexity.</description>

      <title>Adapting Physics-Informed Neural Networks to Improve ODE Optimization in Mosquito Population Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05108v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Physics informed neural networks have been gaining popularity due to their unique ability to incorporate physics laws into data-driven models, ensuring that the predictions are not only consistent with empirical data but also align with domain-specific knowledge in the form of physics equations. The integration of physics principles enables the method to require less data while maintaining the robustness of deep learning in modelling complex dynamical systems. However, current PINN frameworks are not sufficiently mature for real-world ODE systems, especially those with extreme multi-scale behavior such as mosquito population dynamical modelling. In this research, we propose a PINN framework with several improvements for forward and inverse problems for ODE systems with a case study application in modelling the dynamics of mosquito populations. The framework tackles the gradient imbalance and stiff problems posed by mosquito ordinary differential equations. The method offers a simple but effective way to resolve the time causality issue in PINNs by gradually expanding the training time domain until it covers entire domain of interest. As part of a robust evaluation, we conduct experiments using simulated data to evaluate the effectiveness of the approach. Preliminary results indicate that physics-informed machine learning holds significant potential for advancing the study of ecological systems.</description>

      <title>Impact of complex spatial population structure on early and long-term adaptation in rugged fitness landscapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17108v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the exploration of rugged fitness landscapes by spatially structured populations with demes on the nodes of a graph, connected by migrations. In the rare migration regime, we find that finite structures can adapt more efficiently than very large ones, especially in high-dimensional fitness landscapes. Furthermore, we show that, in most landscapes, migration asymmetries associated with some suppression of natural selection allow the population to reach higher fitness peaks first. In this sense, suppression of selection can make early adaptation more efficient. However, the time it takes to reach the first fitness peak is then increased. We also find that suppression of selection tends to enhance finite-size effects. We extend our study to frequent migrations, suggesting that our conclusions hold in this regime. We then investigate the impact of spatial structure with rare migrations on long-term evolution by studying the steady state of the population. For this, we define an effective population size for the steady-state distribution. We find that suppression of selection is associated to reduced steady-state effective population sizes, and reduced average steady-state fitnesses.</description>

      <title>Breakdown of random-matrix universality in persistent Lotka-Volterra communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.09140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.09140v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The eigenvalue spectrum of a random matrix often only depends on the first and second moments of its elements, but not on the specific distribution from which they are drawn. The validity of this universality principle is often assumed without proof in applications. In this Letter, we offer a pertinent counterexample in the context of the generalized Lotka-Volterra equations. Using dynamic mean-field theory, we derive the statistics of the interactions between species in an evolved ecological community. We then show that the full statistics of these interactions, beyond those of a Gaussian ensemble, are required to correctly predict the eigenvalue spectrum and therefore stability. Consequently, the universality principle fails in this system. We thus show that the eigenvalue spectra of random matrices can be used to deduce the stability of ``feasible'' ecological communities, but only if the emergent non-Gaussian statistics of the interactions between species are taken into account.</description>

      <title>Comparing temporal and aggregated network descriptions of fluid transport in the Mediterranean Sea</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17527v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ocean currents exhibit strong time dependence at all scales that influences physical and biochemical dynamics. Network approaches to fluid transport permit to address explicitly how connectivity across the seascape is affected by the spatiotemporal variability of currents. However, such temporal aspect is mostly neglected, relying on a static representation of the flow. We here investigate the role of current variability on networks describing physical transport across the Mediterranean basin. We first focus on degree distributions and community structure comparing ensembles of temporal networks that explicitly resolve time dependence and their aggregated, i.e. time-averaged, counterparts. Furthermore, we explore the implications of the two approaches in a simple reaction dispersal model for a generic tracer. Our analysis evidences that aggregation induces structural network changes that cannot be easily avoided, not even introducing a pruning of the aggregated adjacency matrix. We also highlight that, depending on the time scales considered, the importance of the temporal features of the networks can vary significantly. Finally, we find that the tracer evolution obtained from a temporal dispersal kernel cannot be always approximated by aggregated adjacency matrices, in particular during transients of the dynamics.</description>
