      <title>Classical Dirac particle II. Interaction with an electromagnetic plane wave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a previous work we have described the classical structure and analyzed the interaction of the classical Dirac particle with uniform and oscillating electric and magnetic fields. In the present paper we consider the interaction of the Dirac particle at rest with an electromagnetic plane wave packet. The integration of the dynamical equations is done numerically with a Mathematica notebook that is available to the reader. Independently of the electric charge of the Dirac particle the interaction produces a linear momentum transfer such that the center of mass of the particle is moving with a component of its CM velocity in the direction of the propagation of the wave. The electromagnetic plane wave transfers energy, linear momentum and angular momentum to the particle. The CM spin is also modified and its change depends on the torque of the external Lorentz force defined at the center of charge position with respect to the center of mass and on the work of the external force along the center of mass trajectory of the particle. We analyze how the different physical parameters of the wave and the spin orientation determine the outcome of the numerical experiment.</description>

      <title>Comment on "Magnetic moments in the Poynting theorem, Maxwell equations, Dirac equation, and QED"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper ``Magnetic moments in the Poynting theorem, Maxwell equations, Dirac equation, and QED", arXiv:2501.02022, by Peter J. Mohr, purports to show that Maxwell's equation, $\mathbf{\nabla}\cdot{\bf B}=0$, and Poynting's theorem require significant modications for the $\bf B$ field of a magnetic dipole. We show here that, because of critical errors in the paper, these claims are false, and that Maxwell's equation and the Poynting theorem are the same for a magnetic moment as for any other charge-current distribution.</description>

      <title>Stability analysis of Euler's elastica ring using harmonic balance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stability analysis of elastic rings subjected to various loading conditions is examined, focusing on stable and unstable configurations. The harmonic balance method is employed to investigate the stability range under different loading conditions. This method provides improved accuracy in results and yields a smooth, stable range of values for all modes of symmetry. Additionally, the bifurcation analysis technique of linearization is utilized to identify unstable regions, and it demonstrates good agreement with the results obtained using the harmonic balance method.</description>

      <title>Geometry and dynamics of spring networks of spherical topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spring network model constitutes the backbone in the representations of a host of physical systems. In this work, we report the disturbance-driven microscopic dynamics of an isolated, closed spring network of spherical topology in mechanical equilibrium. The system permits self-intersection. We first show the lowest-energy configurations of the closed spring networks as packings of regular triangles. The dynamics of the disturbed spring network is analyzed from the multiple perspectives of energetics, structural instability, and speed distribution. We reveal the crumpling transition of strongly disturbed spring networks and the rapid convergence of the speed distribution toward the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. This work demonstrates the rich physics arising from the interplay of flexibility and dynamics. The results may yield insights into the shape fluctuation and structural instability of deformable membranes from the dynamical perspective.</description>

      <title>Unified Evolution of Electromagnetic Sources in Homogeneous Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19986v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study the behavior of elementary electromagnetic sources, i.e., point-like electric charges and intrinsic magnetic dipoles, in the presence of homogeneous electromagnetic fields in a classical and covariant setting. We show that the respective evolution equations for both kinds of sources can be formulated using a single Lorentz-like transformation with suitably adjusted parameters, thereby unifying the fundamental behavior of these intrinsic particle properties. We arrive at this description by expressing the evolution of the electric sources, governed by the Lorentz force, as a series of infinitesimal boosts and rotations acting on them, with the electric and magnetic field as the corresponding parameters. Upon suitable adjustments, we find a new effective Lorentz-like transformation, applicable to both electric and magnetic sources. We provide the results using both the tensorial and pseudovector representation of the magnetic sources. Finally, we obtain a non-relativistic limit of the evolution equation for magnetic sources.</description>

      <title>Incremental Collision Laws Based on the Bouc-Wen Model: Improved Collision Models and Further Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07953v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the article titled "The Bouc-Wen Model for Binary Direct Collinear Collisions of Convex Viscoplastic Bodies" and published in the Journal of Computational and Nonlinear Dynamics (Volume 20, Issue 6, June 2025), the authors studied mathematical models of binary direct collinear collisions of convex viscoplastic bodies that employed two incremental collision laws based on the Bouc-Wen differential model of hysteresis. It was shown that the models possess favorable analytical properties, and several model parameter identification studies were conducted, demonstrating that the models can accurately capture the nature of a variety of collision phenomena. In this article, the aforementioned models are augmented by modeling the effects of external forces as time-dependent inputs that belong to a certain function space. Furthermore, the range of the parameters under which the models possess favorable analytical properties is extended to several corner cases that were not considered in the prior publication. Finally, the previously conducted model parameter identification studies are extended, and an additional model parameter identification study is provided in an attempt to validate the ability of the augmented models to represent the effects of external forces.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically accurate and geometric locking-free finite element implementation of a refined shell theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23369v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate finite element analysis of refined shell theories is crucial but often hindered by membrane and shear locking effects. While various element-based locking-free techniques exist, this work addresses the problem at the theoretical level by utilizing results from asymptotic analysis. A formulation of a 2D refined shell theory incorporating transverse shear is developed using rescaled coordinates and angles of rotation, ensuring equal asymptotic orders of magnitude for extension, bending, and rotation measures and their respective stiffnesses. This novel approach, implemented via isogeometric analysis, is shown to be both asymptotically accurate relative to the underlying refined shell theory and inherently free from membrane and shear locking. Numerical simulations of semi-cylindrical shells show excellent agreement between the analytical solutions, 2D refined shell theory predictions, and 3D elasticity theory, validating the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed formulation.</description>
