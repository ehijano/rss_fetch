      <title>Probing the Information Theoretical Roots of Spatial Dependence Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intuitively, there is a relation between measures of spatial dependence and information theoretical measures of entropy. For instance, we can provide an intuition of why spatial data is special by stating that, on average, spatial data samples contain less than expected information. Similarly, spatial data, e.g., remotely sensed imagery, that is easy to compress is also likely to show significant spatial autocorrelation. Formulating our (highly specific) core concepts of spatial information theory in the widely used language of information theory opens new perspectives on their differences and similarities and also fosters cross-disciplinary collaboration, e.g., with the broader AI/ML communities. Interestingly, however, this intuitive relation is challenging to formalize and generalize, leading prior work to rely mostly on experimental results, e.g., for describing landscape patterns. In this work, we will explore the information theoretical roots of spatial autocorrelation, more specifically Moran's I, through the lens of self-information (also known as surprisal) and provide both formal proofs and experiments.</description>

      <title>Capacity Results for Non-Ergodic Multi-Modal Broadcast Channels with Controllable Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Movable antennas and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces enable a new paradigm in which channel statistics can be controlled and altered. Further, the known trajectory and operation protocol of communication satellites results in networks with predictable statistics. The predictability of future changes results in a non-ergodic model for which the fundamentals are largely unknown. We consider the canonical two-user broadcast erasure channel in which channel statistics vary at a priori known points. We consider a multi-modal setting with two non-transient modes (whose lengths scale linearly with the blocklength) and an arbitrary number of transient modes. We provide a new set of outer-bounds on the capacity region of this problem when the encoder has access to causal ACK/NACK feedback. The outer-bounds reveal the significant role of the non-transient mode with higher erasure probability both on the outer and the inner bounds. We show the outer-bounds are achievable in non-trivial regimes, characterizing the capacity region for a wide range of parameters. We also discuss the regimes where the inner and outer bounds diverge and analyze the gap between the two. A key finding of this work is the significant gain of inter-modal coding over the separate treating of individual modes.</description>

      <title>Capacity-Maximizing Dynamic User Association in Double RIS-Aided Broadcast Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an information-theoretic framework to dynamically pair up different reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) with wireless users with goal of maximizing the fundamental network capacity. We focus on a double RIS-aided broadcast packet network with two users. We show using a dynamic RIS-user association and an opportunistic protocol, the network capacity could be significantly enhanced and superior to other benchmarks with static associations. The results include new outer-bounds on network capacity and their achievability. We discuss the optimal RIS-user association.</description>

      <title>Movable Antenna Empowered Downlink NOMA Systems: Power Allocation and Antenna Position Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates a novel communication paradigm employing movable antennas (MAs) within a multiple-input single-output (MISO) non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) downlink framework, where users are equipped with MAs. Initially, leveraging the far-field response, we delineate the channel characteristics concerning both the power allocation coefficient and positions of MAs. Subsequently, we endeavor to maximize the channel capacity by jointly optimizing power allocation and antenna positions. To tackle the resultant non-convex problem, we propose an alternating optimization (AO) scheme underpinned by successive convex approximation (SCA) to converge towards a stationary point. Through numerical simulations, our findings substantiate the superiority of the MA-assisted NOMA system over both orthogonal multiple access (OMA) and conventional NOMA configurations in terms of average sum rate and outage probability.</description>

      <title>Optical IRS for Visible Light Communication: Modeling, Design, and Open Issues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical intelligent reflecting surface (OIRS) offers a new and effective approach to resolving the line-of-sight blockage issue in visible light communication (VLC) by enabling redirection of light to bypass obstacles, thereby dramatically enhancing indoor VLC coverage and reliability. This article provides a comprehensive overview of OIRS for VLC, including channel modeling, design techniques, and open issues. First, we present the characteristics of OIRS-reflected channels and introduce two practical models, namely, optics model and association model, which are then compared in terms of applicable conditions, configuration methods, and channel parameters. Next, under the more practically appealing association model, we discuss the main design techniques for OIRS-aided VLC systems, including beam alignment, channel estimation, and OIRS reflection optimization. Finally, open issues are identified to stimulate future research in this area.</description>

      <title>EVM Analysis of Distributed Massive MIMO with 1-Bit Radio-Over-Fiber Fronthaul</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the uplink performance of a distributed massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) architecture in which the remotely located access points (APs) are connected to a central processing unit via a fiber-optical fronthaul carrying a dithered and 1-bit quantized version of the received radio-frequency (RF) signal. The innovative feature of the proposed architecture is that no down-conversion is performed at the APs. This eliminates the need to equip the APs with local oscillators, which may be difficult to synchronize. Under the assumption that a constraint is imposed on the amount of data that can be exchanged across the fiber-optical fronthaul, we investigate the tradeoff between spatial oversampling, defined in terms of the total number of APs, and temporal oversampling, defined in terms of the oversampling factor selected at the central processing unit, to facilitate the recovery of the transmitted signal from 1-bit samples of the RF received signal. Using the so-called error-vector magnitude (EVM) as performance metric, we shed light on the optimal design of the dither signal, and quantify, for a given number of APs, the minimum fronthaul rate required for our proposed distributed massive MIMO architecture to outperform a standard co-located massive MIMO architecture in terms of EVM.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Inter-Satellite Links for In-Flight Connectivity Scheme in Space-Air-Ground Integrated Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Space-air-ground integrated networks (SAGIN) are pivotal for achieving uninterrupted in-flight connectivity (IFC). Most existing studies, however, merely treat satellites as transparent forwarding nodes, and overlook their caching capabilities in enhancing the IFC data rate. In this paper, we consider an IFC-oriented SAGIN, where the satellites collaboratively deliver the content to airborne passengers to facilitate airborne communication. Considering the cached files instantaneously accessible via satellites, this work pioneers the integration of multiple inter-satellite links (ISLs) into the IFC framework, thereby innovating the content delivery process. To minimize the average delay of content delivery, we formulate an optimization problem and propose an exact penalty-based method to derive the satellite association scheme. Our proposed framework has a low complexity and thus paves the way for high-speed Internet connectivity to aviation passengers. Finally, simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed IFC framework for SAGIN.</description>

      <title>Achievable Rate Optimization for Large Stacked Intelligent Metasurfaces Based on Statistical CSI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stacked intelligent metasurface (SIM) is an emerging design that consists of multiple layers of metasurfaces. A SIM enables holographic multiple-input multiple-output (HMIMO) precoding in the wave domain, which results in the reduction of energy consumption and hardware cost. On the ground of multiuser beamforming, this letter focuses on the downlink achievable rate and its maximization. Contrary to previous works on multiuser SIM, we consider statistical channel state information (CSI) as opposed to instantaneous CSI to overcome challenges such as large overhead. Also, we examine the performance of large surfaces. We apply an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm regarding the phases of the SIM and the allocated transmit power. Simulations illustrate the performance of the considered large SIM-assisted design as well as the comparison between different CSI considerations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new application of multi-orbit cyclic subspace codes to construct large optical orthogonal codes, with the aid of the multiplicative structure of finite fields extensions. This approach is different from earlier approaches using combinatorial and additive (character sum) structures of finite fields. Consequently, we immediately obtain new classes of optical orthogonal codes with different parameters.</description>

      <title>LoByITFL: Low Communication Secure and Private Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) faces several challenges, such as the privacy of the clients data and security against Byzantine clients. Existing works treating privacy and security jointly make sacrifices on the privacy guarantee. In this work, we introduce LoByITFL, the first communication-efficient Information-Theoretic (IT) private and secure FL scheme that makes no sacrifices on the privacy guarantees while ensuring security against Byzantine adversaries. The key ingredients are a small and representative dataset available to the federator, a careful transformation of the FLTrust algorithm and the use of a trusted third party only in a one-time preprocessing phase before the start of the learning algorithm. We provide theoretical guarantees on privacy and Byzantine-resilience, and provide convergence guarantee and experimental results validating our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Network Connectivity--Information Freshness Tradeoff in Information Dissemination Over Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a gossip network consisting of a source generating updates and $n$ nodes connected according to a given graph structure. The source keeps updates of a process, that might be generated or observed, and shares them with the gossiping network. The nodes in the network communicate with their neighbors and disseminate these version updates using a push-style gossip strategy. We use the version age metric to quantify the timeliness of information at the nodes. We first find an upper bound for the average version age for a set of nodes in a general network. Using this, we find the average version age scaling of a node in several network graph structures, such as two-dimensional grids, generalized rings and hyper-cubes. Prior to our work, it was known that when $n$ nodes are connected on a ring the version age scales as $O(n^{\frac{1}{2}})$, and when they are connected on a fully-connected graph the version age scales as $O(\log n)$. Ours is the first work to show an age scaling result for a connectivity structure other than the ring and the fully-connected network, which constitute the two extremes of network connectivity. Our work helps fill the gap between these two extremes by analyzing a large variety of graphs with intermediate connectivity, thus providing insight into the relationship between the connectivity structure of the network and the version age, and uncovering a network connectivity--information freshness tradeoff.</description>

      <title>Track Initialization and Re-Identification for~3D Multi-View Multi-Object Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a 3D multi-object tracking (MOT) solution using only 2D detections from monocular cameras, which automatically initiates/terminates tracks as well as resolves track appearance-reappearance and occlusions. Moreover, this approach does not require detector retraining when cameras are reconfigured but only the camera matrices of reconfigured cameras need to be updated. Our approach is based on a Bayesian multi-object formulation that integrates track initiation/termination, re-identification, occlusion handling, and data association into a single Bayes filtering recursion. However, the exact filter that utilizes all these functionalities is numerically intractable due to the exponentially growing number of terms in the (multi-object) filtering density, while existing approximations trade-off some of these functionalities for speed. To this end, we develop a more efficient approximation suitable for online MOT by incorporating object features and kinematics into the measurement model, which improves data association and subsequently reduces the number of terms. Specifically, we exploit the 2D detections and extracted features from multiple cameras to provide a better approximation of the multi-object filtering density to realize the track initiation/termination and re-identification functionalities. Further, incorporating a tractable geometric occlusion model based on 2D projections of 3D objects on the camera planes realizes the occlusion handling functionality of the filter. Evaluation of the proposed solution on challenging datasets demonstrates significant improvements and robustness when camera configurations change on-the-fly, compared to existing multi-view MOT solutions.

      <title>ChatGPT as the Marketplace of Ideas: Should Truth-Seeking Be the Goal of AI Content Governance?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As one of the most enduring metaphors within legal discourse, the marketplace of ideas has wielded considerable influence over the jurisprudential landscape for decades. A century after the inception of this theory, ChatGPT emerged as a revolutionary technological advancement in the twenty-first century. This research finds that ChatGPT effectively manifests the marketplace metaphor. It not only instantiates the promises envisaged by generations of legal scholars but also lays bare the perils discerned through sustained academic critique. Specifically, the workings of ChatGPT and the marketplace of ideas theory exhibit at least four common features: arena, means, objectives, and flaws. These shared attributes are sufficient to render ChatGPT historically the most qualified engine for actualizing the marketplace of ideas theory.
  The comparison of the marketplace theory and ChatGPT merely marks a starting point. A more meaningful undertaking entails reevaluating and reframing both internal and external AI policies by referring to the accumulated experience, insights, and suggestions researchers have raised to fix the marketplace theory. Here, a pivotal issue is: should truth-seeking be set as the goal of AI content governance? Given the unattainability of the absolute truth-seeking goal, I argue against adopting zero-risk policies. Instead, a more judicious approach would be to embrace a knowledge-based alternative wherein large language models (LLMs) are trained to generate competing and divergent viewpoints based on sufficient justifications. This research also argues that so-called AI content risks are not created by AI companies but are inherent in the entire information ecosystem. Thus, the burden of managing these risks should be distributed among different social actors, rather than being solely shouldered by chatbot companies.</description>

      <title>A Dynamical Systems Approach to Bots and Online Political Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bots have become increasingly prevalent in the digital sphere and have taken up a proactive role in shaping democratic processes. While previous studies have focused on their influence at the individual level, their potential macro-level impact on communication dynamics is still little understood. This study adopts an information theoretic approach from dynamical systems theory to examine the role of political bots shaping the dynamics of an online political discussion on Twitter. We quantify the components of this dynamic process in terms of its complexity, predictability, and the remaining uncertainty. Our findings suggest that bot activity is associated with increased complexity and uncertainty in the structural dynamics of online political communication. This work serves as a showcase for the use of information-theoretic measures from dynamical systems theory in modeling human-bot dynamics as a computational process that unfolds over time.</description>

      <title>Delay-Doppler Domain Pulse Design for OTFS-NOMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the challenge of developing an orthogonal time-frequency space (OTFS)-based non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) system where each user is modulated using orthogonal pulses in the delay Doppler domain. Building upon the concept of the sufficient (bi)orthogonality train-pulse [1], we extend this idea by introducing Hermite functions, known for their orthogonality properties. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed Hermite functions outperform the traditional OTFS-NOMA schemes, including power-domain (PDM) NOMA and code-domain (CDM) NOMA, in terms of bit error rate (BER) over a high-mobility channel. The algorithm's complexity is minimal, primarily involving the demodulation of OTFS. The spectrum efficiency of Hermite-based OTFS-NOMA is K times that of OTFS-CDM-NOMA scheme, where K is the spreading length of the NOMA waveform.</description>

      <title>Partial Information Decomposition for Data Interpretability and Feature Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Partial Information Decomposition of Features (PIDF), a new paradigm for simultaneous data interpretability and feature selection. Contrary to traditional methods that assign a single importance value, our approach is based on three metrics per feature: the mutual information shared with the target variable, the feature's contribution to synergistic information, and the amount of this information that is redundant. In particular, we develop a novel procedure based on these three metrics, which reveals not only how features are correlated with the target but also the additional and overlapping information provided by considering them in combination with other features. We extensively evaluate PIDF using both synthetic and real-world data, demonstrating its potential applications and effectiveness, by considering case studies from genetics and neuroscience.</description>

      <title>Game of Coding: Beyond Trusted Majorities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16643v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coding theory revolves around the incorporation of redundancy into transmitted symbols, computation tasks, and stored data to guard against adversarial manipulation. However, error correction in coding theory is contingent upon a strict trust assumption. In the context of computation and storage, it is required that honest nodes outnumber adversarial ones by a certain margin. However, in several emerging real-world cases, particularly, in decentralized blockchain-oriented applications, such assumptions are often unrealistic. Consequently, despite the important role of coding in addressing significant challenges within decentralized systems, its applications become constrained. Still, in decentralized platforms, a distinctive characteristic emerges, offering new avenues for secure coding beyond the constraints of conventional methods. In these scenarios, the adversary benefits when the legitimate decoder recovers the data, and preferably with a high estimation error. This incentive motivates them to act rationally, trying to maximize their gains. In this paper, we propose a game theoretic formulation for coding, called the game of coding, that captures this unique dynamic where each of the adversary and the data collector (decoder) have a utility function to optimize. The utility functions reflect the fact that both the data collector and the adversary are interested in increasing the chance of data being recoverable by the data collector. Moreover, the utility functions express the interest of the data collector to estimate the input with lower estimation error, but the opposite interest of the adversary. As a first, still highly non-trivial step, we characterize the equilibrium of the game for the repetition code with a repetition factor of 2, for a wide class of utility functions with minimal assumptions.</description>

      <title>Finite-sample expansions for the optimal error probability in asymmetric binary hypothesis testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09605v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The problem of binary hypothesis testing between two probability measures is considered. New sharp bounds are derived for the best achievable error probability of such tests based on independent and identically distributed observations. Specifically, the asymmetric version of the problem is examined, where different requirements are placed on the two error probabilities. Accurate nonasymptotic expansions with explicit constants are obtained for the error probability, using tools from large deviations and Gaussian approximation. Examples are shown indicating that, in the asymmetric regime, the approximations suggested by the new bounds are significantly more accurate than the approximations provided by either of the two main earlier approaches -- normal approximation and error exponents.</description>

      <title>Subset-Based Instance Optimality in Private Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.01262v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new definition of instance optimality for differentially private estimation algorithms. Our definition requires an optimal algorithm to compete, simultaneously for every dataset $D$, with the best private benchmark algorithm that (a) knows $D$ in advance and (b) is evaluated by its worst-case performance on large subsets of $D$. That is, the benchmark algorithm need not perform well when potentially extreme points are added to $D$; it only has to handle the removal of a small number of real data points that already exist. This makes our benchmark significantly stronger than those proposed in prior work. We nevertheless show, for real-valued datasets, how to construct private algorithms that achieve our notion of instance optimality when estimating a broad class of dataset properties, including means, quantiles, and $\ell_p$-norm minimizers. For means in particular, we provide a detailed analysis and show that our algorithm simultaneously matches or exceeds the asymptotic performance of existing algorithms under a range of distributional assumptions.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Geometry codes in the sum-rank metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.08903v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the first geometric construction of codes in the sum-rank metric, which we called linearized Algebraic Geometry codes, using quotients of the ring of Ore polynomials with coefficients in the function field of an algebraic curve. We study the parameters of these codes and give lower bounds for their dimension and minimum distance. Our codes exhibit quite good parameters, respecting a similar bound to Goppa's bound for Algebraic Geometry codes in the Hamming metric. Furthermore, our construction yields codes asymptotically better than the sum-rank version of the Gilbert-Varshamov bound.</description>

      <title>On the Properties and Estimation of Pointwise Mutual Information Profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10240v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The pointwise mutual information profile, or simply profile, is the distribution of pointwise mutual information for a given pair of random variables. One of its important properties is that its expected value is precisely the mutual information between these random variables. In this paper, we analytically describe the profiles of multivariate normal distributions and introduce a novel family of distributions, Bend and Mix Models, for which the profile can be accurately estimated using Monte Carlo methods. We then show how Bend and Mix Models can be used to study the limitations of existing mutual information estimators, investigate the behavior of neural critics used in variational estimators, and understand the effect of experimental outliers on mutual information estimation. Finally, we show how Bend and Mix Models can be used to obtain model-based Bayesian estimates of mutual information, suitable for problems with available domain expertise in which uncertainty quantification is necessary.</description>
