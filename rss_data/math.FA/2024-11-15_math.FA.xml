      <title>Mixing Douglas' and weak majorization and factorization theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Douglas' majorization and factorization theorem characterizes the inclusion of operator ranges in Hilbert spaces. Notably, it reinforces the well-established connections between the inclusion of kernels of operators in Hilbert spaces and the (inverse) inclusion of the closures of the ranges of their adjoints. This note aims to present a ''mixed'' version of these concepts for operators with a codomain in a product space. Additionally, an application in control theory of coupled systems of linear partial differential equations is presented.</description>

      <title>Riesz-Schur transforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate nontrigonometric forms of Riesz transforms in the context of Schur multipliers. This refines Grothendieck-Haagerup's endpoint criterion with a new condition for the Schatten p-boundedness of Schur multipliers and strengthens Potapov/Sukochev's solution of Arazy's conjecture. We recover as well dimension-free estimates for trigonometric Riesz transforms. Our discrete approach is much simpler than previous harmonic analysis and probabilistic approaches. As an application, we find a very simple proof of recent criteria for Schur multipliers of H\"ormander-Mikhlin and Marcinkiewicz type.</description>

      <title>Direct sums and abstract Kadets--Klee properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{X} = \{ X_{\gamma} \}_{\gamma \in \Gamma}$ be a family of Banach spaces and let $\mathcal{E}$ be a Banach sequence space defined on $\Gamma$. The main aim of this work is to investigate the abstract Kadets--Klee properties, that is, the Kadets--Klee type properties in which the weak convergence of sequences is replaced by the convergence with respect to some linear Hausdorff topology, for the direct sum construction $(\bigoplus_{\gamma \in \Gamma} X_{\gamma})_{\mathcal{E}}$. As we will show, and this seems to be quite atypical behavior when compared to some other geometric properties, to lift the Kadets--Klee properties from the components to whole direct sum it is not enough to assume that all involved spaces have the appropriate Kadets--Klee property. Actually, to complete the picture one must add a dichotomy in the form of the Schur type properties for $X_{\gamma}$'s supplemented by the variant of strict monotonicity for $\mathcal{E}$. Back down to earth, this general machinery naturally provides a blue print for other topologies like, for example, the weak topology or the topology of local convergence in measure, that are perhaps more commonly associated with this type of considerations. Furthermore, by limiting ourselves to direct sums in which the family $\mathcal{X}$ is constant, that is, $X_{\gamma} = X$ for all $\gamma \in \Gamma$ and some Banach space $X$, we return to the well-explored ground of K{\"o}the--Bochner sequence spaces $\mathcal{E}(X)$. Doing all this, we will reproduce, but sometimes also improve, essentially all existing results about the classical Kadets--Klee properties in K{\"o}the--Bochner sequence spaces.</description>

      <title>Lower bounds for the weak-type constants of the operators $\Lambda_m$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The operators $\Lambda_m$ ($m\in\mathbb{N}\cup \{0\}$) arise when one studies the action of the Beurling-Ahlfors transform on certain radial function subspaces. It is known that the weak-type $(1,1)$ constant of $\Lambda_0$ is equal to $1/\ln(2)\approx 1.44$. We show that the weak-type $(1,1)$ constant of $\Lambda_m$ is larger than $1.34$ for every $m\in \mathbb{N}$ (in particular, it does not tend to $1$ when $m\to\infty$). This disproves a conjecture of Gill [Mich. Math. J. 59 (2010), No. 2, 353-363]. We also prove a companion result for the adjoint operators.</description>

      <title>Weak-* and completely isometric structure of noncommutative function algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study operator algebraic and function theoretic aspects of algebras of bounded nc functions on subvarieties of the nc domain determined by all levels of the unit ball of an operator space (nc operator balls). Our main result is the following classification theorem: under very mild assumptions on the varieties, two such algebras $H^\infty(\mathfrak{V})$ and $H^\infty(\mathfrak{W})$ are completely isometrically and weak-* isomorphic if and only if there is a nc biholomorphism between the varieties. For matrix spanning homogeneous varieties in injective operator balls, we further sharpen this equivalence, showing that there exists a linear isomorphism between the respective balls that maps one variety onto the other; in general, we show, the homogeneity condition cannot be dropped. We highlight some difficulties and open problems, contrasting with the well studied case of row ball.</description>

      <title>Sharp Matrix Empirical Bernstein Inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present two sharp empirical Bernstein inequalities for symmetric random matrices with bounded eigenvalues. By sharp, we mean that both inequalities adapt to the unknown variance in a tight manner: the deviation captured by the first-order $1/\sqrt{n}$ term asymptotically matches the matrix Bernstein inequality exactly, including constants, the latter requiring knowledge of the variance. Our first inequality holds for the sample mean of independent matrices, and our second inequality holds for a mean estimator under martingale dependence at stopping times.</description>

      <title>A dynamical approach to sampling and interpolation in unimodular groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.05125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.05125v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a notion of covolume for point sets in locally compact groups that simultaneously generalizes the covolume of a lattice and the reciprocal of the Beurling density for amenable, unimodular groups. This notion of covolume arises naturally from transverse measure theory applied to the hull dynamical system associated to a point set. Using groupoid techniques, we prove necessary conditions for sampling and interpolation in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces on unimodular groups in terms of this new notion of covolume. These conditions generalize previously known density theorems for compactly generated groups of polynomial growth, while also covering important new examples, in particular model sets arising from cut-and-project schemes.</description>

      <title>Complements of unions: insights on spaceability and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.01561v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents two general criteria to determine spaceability results in the complements of unions of subspaces. The first criterion applies to countable unions of subspaces under specific conditions and is closely related to the results of Kitson and Timoney in [J. Math. Anal. Appl. \textbf{378} (2011), 680-686]. This criterion extends and recovers some classical results in this theory. The second criterion establishes sufficient conditions for the complement of a union of Lebesgue spaces to be $\left(\alpha,\beta\right)$-spaceable, or not, even when they are not locally convex. We use this result to characterize the measurable subsets having positive measure. Armed with these results, we have improved existing results in environments such as: Lebesgue measurable function sets, spaces of continuous functions, sequence spaces, nowhere H\"{o}lder function sets, Sobolev spaces, non-absolutely summing operator spaces, and even sets of functions of bounded variation.</description>

      <title>Weaving Riesz Bases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02229v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores woven frames in separable Hilbert spaces with an initial focus on the finite-dimensional case. We begin by simplifying the problem to bases, for which we obtain a unique characterization. We establish a condition that is both necessary and sufficient for vector reconstruction, which applies to Fourier matrices. Furthermore, we show that these characterizations are still valid in the infinite-dimensional case, for Riesz bases. Finally, we obtain several results for weaving Riesz bases of translations.</description>

      <title>On accumulated spectrograms for Gabor frames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02059v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Analogs of classical results on accumulated spectrograms, the sum of spectrograms of eigenfunctions of localization operators, are established for Gabor multipliers. We show that the lattice $\ell^1$ distance between the accumulated spectrogram and the indicator function of the Gabor multiplier mask is bounded by the number of lattice points near the boundary of the mask and that this bound is sharp in general. The methods developed for the proofs are also used to show that the Weyl-Heisenberg ensemble restricted to a lattice is hyperuniform when the Gabor frame is tight.</description>

      <title>There are no unconditional Schauder frames of translates in $L^p(\mathbb{R})$, $1 \le p \le 2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01757v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is known that a system formed by translates of a single function cannot be an unconditional Schauder basis in the space $L^p(\mathbb{R})$ for any $1 \le p &lt; \infty$. To the contrary, there do exist unconditional Schauder frames of translates in $L^p(\mathbb{R})$ for every $p&gt;2$. The existence of such a system for $1 &lt; p \leq 2$, however, has remained an open problem. In this paper the problem is solved in the negative: we prove that none of the spaces $L^p(\mathbb{R})$, $1 \le p \le 2$, admits an unconditional Schauder frame of translates.</description>

      <title>Non-convergence of some non-commuting double ergodic averages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08630v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $S$ and $T$ be measure-preserving transformations of a probability space $(X,{\mathcal B},\mu)$. Let $f$ be a bounded measurable functions, and consider the integrals of the corresponding `double' ergodic averages: \[\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \int f(S^ix)f(T^ix)\ d\mu(x) \qquad (n\ge 1).\] We construct examples for which these integrals do not converge as $n\to\infty$. These include examples in which $S$ and $T$ are rigid, and hence have entropy zero, answering a question of Frantzikinakis and Host.
  Our proof begins with a corresponding construction for orthogonal operators on a Hilbert space, and then obtains transformations of a Gaussian measure space from them.</description>
