      <title>Euclid: Searches for strong gravitational lenses using convolutional neural nets in Early Release Observations of the Perseus field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Euclid Wide Survey (EWS) is predicted to find approximately 170 000 galaxy-galaxy strong lenses from its lifetime observation of 14 000 deg^2 of the sky. Detecting this many lenses by visual inspection with professional astronomers and citizen scientists alone is infeasible. Machine learning algorithms, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have been used as an automated method of detecting strong lenses, and have proven fruitful in finding galaxy-galaxy strong lens candidates. We identify the major challenge to be the automatic detection of galaxy-galaxy strong lenses while simultaneously maintaining a low false positive rate. One aim of this research is to have a quantified starting point on the achieved purity and completeness with our current version of CNN-based detection pipelines for the VIS images of EWS. We select all sources with VIS IE &lt; 23 mag from the Euclid Early Release Observation imaging of the Perseus field. We apply a range of CNN architectures to detect strong lenses in these cutouts. All our networks perform extremely well on simulated data sets and their respective validation sets. However, when applied to real Euclid imaging, the highest lens purity is just 11%. Among all our networks, the false positives are typically identifiable by human volunteers as, for example, spiral galaxies, multiple sources, and artefacts, implying that improvements are still possible, perhaps via a second, more interpretable lens selection filtering stage. There is currently no alternative to human classification of CNN-selected lens candidates. Given the expected 10^5 lensing systems in Euclid, this implies 10^6 objects for human classification, which while very large is not in principle intractable and not without precedent.</description>

      <title>Processing of GASKAP-HI pilot survey data using a commercial supercomputer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern radio telescopes generate large amounts of data, with the next generation Very Large Array (ngVLA) and the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) expected to feed up to 292 GB of visibilities per second to the science data processor (SDP). However, the continued exponential growth in the power of the world's largest supercomputers suggests that for the foreseeable future there will be sufficient capacity available to provide for astronomers' needs in processing 'science ready' products from the new generation of telescopes, with commercial platforms becoming an option for overflow capacity. The purpose of the current work is to trial the use of commercial high performance computing (HPC) for a large scale processing task in astronomy, in this case processing data from the GASKAP-HI pilot surveys. We delineate a four-step process which can be followed by other researchers wishing to port an existing workflow from a public facility to a commercial provider. We used the process to provide reference images for an ongoing upgrade to ASKAPSoft (the ASKAP SDP software), and to provide science images for the GASKAP collaboration, using the joint deconvolution capability of WSClean. We document the approach to optimising the pipeline to minimise cost and elapsed time at the commercial provider, and give a resource estimate for processing future full survey data. Finally we document advantages, disadvantages, and lessons learned from the project, which will aid other researchers aiming to use commercial supercomputing for radio astronomy imaging. We found the key advantage to be immediate access and high availability, and the main disadvantage to be the need for improved HPC knowledge to take best advantage of the facility.</description>

      <title>Adaptive extended Kalman filter and point ahead angle prediction in the detection of gravitational waves in space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the detection of gravitational waves in space, during the science phase of the mission, the point ahead angle mechanism (PAAM) serves to steer a laser beam to compensate for the angle generated by the relative motion of the two spacecrafts (SCs) during the approximately 10 seconds of flight time a laser beam will take from one SC to reach a distant SC of three million kilometers away. The common practice for pointing stability control of a laser beam is to first do a coarse tracking by the PAAM to steer a laser beam to compensate for the relative motion between two SCs, to be followed by a fine pointing stability control. In the present work, by exploiting the near-circular orbit structure of individual SC in the triangular constellation, the feasibility of inserting an adaptive Kalman filter (AEKF) into the PAAM control loop is investigated. By adopting a colored measurement noise model that closely resembles the prospective on orbit situation, numerical simulation suggests that the dynamic range of the PAAM may be reduced to the level of nano-radians using the prediction of the pointing head angle (PAA) by the AEKF. This will cut down on the TTL coupling noise and the position noise budget allocated to the PAAM. This in turn reduces the dynamic range of the fine pointing control and leaves room to improve its accuracy, thereby offers the prospect of reduction of the position noise budget allocated to the laser pointing instability as a whole.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Scheme for Fuzzy Dark Matter Simulations Combining the Schr\"odinger and Hamilton-Jacobi-Madelung Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a hybrid numerical scheme for the fuzzy dark matter model: It combines a wave-based approach to solve the Schr\"odinger equation using Fourier continuations with Gram polynomials and a fluid-based approach to solve the Hamilton-Jacobi-Madelung equations. This hybrid scheme facilitates zoom-in simulations for cosmological volumes beyond the capabilities of wave-based solvers alone and accurately simulates the full nonlinear dynamics of fuzzy dark matter. We detail the implementation of a Hamilton-Jacobi-Madelung solver, the methodology for phase matching at fluid-wave boundaries, the development of a local pseudospectral wave solver based on Fourier continuations, new grid refinement criteria for both fluid and wave solvers, an interpolation algorithm based on Fourier continuations, and the integration of these building blocks into the adaptive mesh refinement code GAMER. The superiority of the scheme is demonstrated through various performance and accuracy tests, tracking the linear power spectrum evolution in a 10 Mpc/h box, and a hybrid cosmological simulation in a 5.6 Mpc/h box. The corresponding code is published as part of the GAMER project on https://github.com/gamer-project/gamer.</description>

      <title>High strehl and high contrast for the ELT instrument METIS -- Final design, implementation, and predicted performance of the single-conjugate adaptive optics system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Mid-infrared ELT Imager and Spectrograph (METIS) is a first-generation instrument for the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT), Europe's next-generation 39 m ground-based telescope for optical and infrared wavelengths. METIS will offer diffraction-limited imaging, low- and medium-resolution slit spectroscopy, and coronagraphy for high-contrast imaging between 3 and 13 microns, as well as high-resolution integral field spectroscopy between 3 and 5 microns. The main METIS science goals are the detection and characterisation of exoplanets, the investigation of proto-planetary disks, and the formation of planets.
  The Single-Conjugate Adaptive Optics (SCAO) system corrects atmospheric distortions and is thus essential for diffraction-limited observations with METIS. Numerous challenging aspects of an ELT Adaptive Optics (AO) system are addressed in the mature designs for the SCAO control system and the SCAO hardware module: the complex interaction with the telescope entities that participate in the AO control, wavefront reconstruction with a fragmented and moving pupil, secondary control tasks to deal with differential image motion, non-common path aberrations and mis-registration. A K-band pyramid wavefront sensor and a GPU-based Real-Time Computer (RTC), tailored to the needs of METIS at the ELT, are core components. This current paper serves as a natural sequel to our previous work presented in Hippler et al. (2018). It includes updated performance estimations in terms of several key performance indicators, including achieved contrast curves. We outline all important design decisions that were taken, and present the major challenges we faced and the main analyses carried out to arrive at these decisions and eventually the final design. We also elaborate on our testing and verification strategy, and, last not least, comprehensively present the full design, hardware and software.</description>

      <title>A geometric approach to estimate background in astronomical images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating the true background in an astronomical image is fundamental to detecting faint sources. In a typical low-photon count astronomical image, such as in the far and near-ultraviolet wavelength range, conventional methods relying on the 3-sigma clipping and median or mode estimation often fail to capture the true background level accurately. As a consequence, differentiating true sources from noise peaks remains a challenging task. Additionally, in such images, effectively identifying and excluding faint sources during the background estimation process remains crucial, as undetected faint sources could contaminate the background. This results in overestimating the true background and obscuring the detection of very faint sources. To tackle this problem, we introduce a geometric approach based on the method of steepest descent to identify local minima in an astronomical image. The proposed algorithm based on the minima statistics effectively reduces the confusion between sources and background in the image; thereby ensuring a better background estimation and enhancing the reliability of faint source detection. Our algorithm performs well compared to conventional methods in estimating the background even in crowded field images. In low-photon count, less crowded images, our algorithm recovers the background within 10\%, while traditional methods drastically underestimate it by a few orders of magnitude. In crowded fields, the conventional methods overestimates the background by $\sim 200\%$ whereas our algorithm recovers the true background within $\sim 14\%$. We provide a simple prescription to create a background map using our algorithm and discuss its application in large astronomical surveys.</description>

      <title>Parametric Resonance in RF Axion Haloscopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The axion were proposed as a result to a solution to the Strong CP Problem in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) and is now considered a leading candidate for dark matter. Direct axion dark matter detection experiments are challenging due to the axion's weak interaction with electromagnetism. Recent work has suggested the possibility of an enhancement of astrophysical axion-to-photon decay through parametric resonance. We explore here the feasibility of using parametric resonance to enhance the signal in direct axion-like particle dark matter detectors.</description>

      <title>Accelerated nested sampling with $\beta$-flows for gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is an ever-growing need in the gravitational wave community for fast and reliable inference methods, accompanied by an informative error bar. Nested sampling satisfies the last two requirements, but its computational cost can become prohibitive when using the most accurate waveform models. In this paper, we demonstrate the acceleration of nested sampling using a technique called posterior repartitioning. This method leverages nested sampling's unique ability to separate prior and likelihood contributions at the algorithmic level. Specifically, we define a `repartitioned prior' informed by the posterior from a low-resolution run. To construct this repartitioned prior, we use a $\beta$-flow, a novel type of conditional normalizing flow designed to better learn deep tail probabilities. $\beta$-flows are trained on the entire nested sampling run and conditioned on an inverse temperature $\beta$. Applying our methods to simulated and real binary black hole mergers, we demonstrate how they can reduce the number of likelihood evaluations required for convergence by up to an order of magnitude, enabling faster model comparison and parameter estimation. Furthermore, we highlight the robustness of using $\beta$-flows over standard normalizing flows to accelerate nested sampling. Notably, $\beta$-flows successfully recover the same posteriors and evidences as traditional nested sampling, even in cases where standard normalizing flows fail.</description>

      <title>A simulation framework for APD, SiPM, and MPPCs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a Python module for simulating Silicon Photo-Multipliers, Avalanche Photo-Diodes, and Multi-Pixel Photon Counters. This module allows users to perform noise analyses: Dark Count Rate, crosstalk, and afterpulsing. Furthermore, the simulation framework novelty is the capability of simulating assemblies of SiPM arrays (MPPCa) for large area detectors like Ring Imaging Cherenkov detectors, Cherenkov Telescopes, Positron Emission Tomography, and any detector using SiPM arrays. Users can simulate ring- or shower-like-shaped signals based on the expected number of photons generated by the source. We validate the performance of the simulation module with data from four different SiPM: Broadcom AFBR-S4N66P024M, Hamamatsu S14160-636050HS, Onsemi MICROFC-60035, and FBK NUV-HD3.</description>

      <title>Expanded Generalized Needlet Internal Linear Combination (eGNILC) Framework for the 21-cm Foreground Removal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Generalized Needlet Internal Linear Combination (GNILC) method is a non-parametric component separation algorithm to remove the foreground contamination of the 21-cm intensity mapping data. In this work, we perform the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) along the frequency axis in the expanded GNILC framework (denoted eGNILC) which helps reduce the power loss in low multipoles, and further demonstrate its performance. We also calculate the eGNILC bias to modify the criterion for determining the degrees of freedom of the foreground (dof), and embed the Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) in mixing matrix computation to obtain a blind component separation method. We find that the eGNILC bias is related to the averaged domain size and the dof of the foreground but not the underlying 21-cm signal. In case of no beam effect, the eGNILC bias is negligible for simple power law foregrounds outside the Galactic plane. We also examine the eGNILC performance in the SKA-MID (SKA Phase-I in mid-frequency) and BINGO (Baryon Acoustic Oscillations from Integrated Neutral Gas Observations) simulations. We show that if the adjacent frequency channels are not highly correlated, eGNILC can recover the underlying 21-cm signal with good accuracy. With the varying Airy disk beam applied to both SKA-MID and BINGO, the power spectra of 21-cm can be effectively recovered at the multipoles $\ell \in [20, 250]$ and $[20, 300]$ respectively. With no instrumental noise, the SKA-MID exhibits $\lesssim 20\%$ power loss and BINGO exhibits $\sim 10\%$ power loss. The varying Airy-disk beam only causes significant errors at large multipoles.</description>

      <title>Partial Alignment of Astrometric Position Excursions of International Celestial Reference Frame Quasars with Radio Jet Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Published analyses of very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) data for the sources included in the third International Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF3) catalog have revealed object-specific, excess astrometric variability and quasi-coherent trajectories as functions of time. A fraction of these sources show markedly elongated distributions of positions on the sky measured with diurnal observations. Here we apply a novel statistical and data-processing method to the diurnal position measurements stretching over 40 years to quantify the degree of elongation and its position angle, for each source with more than 200 data points. We find that 49\% of the examined sources have distribution elongations in excess of 1.3. Robust uncertainties of the directions of maximal astrometric dispersion are computed by the bootstrapping method, and the results are compared with a larger catalog of radio jet directions by Plavin et al. 2022. Nearly one-half of the sources with smaller position angle uncertainties are found to have astrometric position excursions from their mean positions aligned with the radio jet structures within $\pm 30\degr$.</description>

      <title>A possible misaligned orbit for the young planet AU Mic c</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The AU Microscopii planetary system is only 24 Myr old, and its geometry may provide clues about the early dynamical history of planetary systems. Here, we present the first measurement of the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect for the warm sub-Neptune AU\,Mic\,c, using two transits observed simultaneously with VLT/ESPRESSO, CHEOPS, and NGTS. After correcting for flares and for the magnetic activity of the host star, and accounting for transit-timing variations, we find the sky-projected spin-orbit angle of planet c to be in the range $\lambda_c=67.8_{-49.0}^{+31.7}$ degrees (1-$\sigma$). We examine the possibility that planet c is misaligned with respect to the orbit of the inner planet b ($\lambda_b=-2.96_{-10.30}^{+10.44}$ degrees), and the equatorial plane of the host star, and discuss scenarios that could explain both this and the planet's high density, including secular interactions with other bodies in the system or a giant impact. We note that a significantly misaligned orbit for planet c is in some degree of tension with the dynamical stability of the system, and with the fact that we see both planets in transit, though these arguments alone do not preclude such an orbit. Further observations would be highly desirable to constrain the spin-orbit angle of planet c more precisely.</description>

      <title>RAMBO I: Project introduction and first results with uGMRT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic hot stars can emit both coherent and incoherent non-thermal radio emission. Understanding the nature of these emissions and their connection to stellar rotation and magnetic field characteristics remains incomplete. The RAdio Magnetospheres of B and O stars (RAMBO) project aims to address this gap by systematically detecting and characterizing gyrosynchrotron and cyclotron maser radio emission in rapidly rotating magnetic hot stars. Using the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope, we present the first detection of radio emission from HD55522 at 650 MHz, confirming it as a new radio-bright magnetic hot star. This supports the predictions of the Centrifugal Breakout model, furthering its application in understanding particle acceleration mechanisms in centrifugal magnetospheres of hot stars. Additionally, we report non-detections for four other targets, improving sensitivity limits by a factor of a few compared to previous observations. These findings demonstrate the potential of RAMBO to uncover the complexities of radio emission in massive stars and highlight the need for broader, multi-wavelength observations to probe magnetospheric physics comprehensively. The sensitivity of the Square Kilometre Array will enable significant advancements.</description>

      <title>No evidence for fast, galaxy-wide ionised outflows in a nearby quasar -- the importance of accounting for beam smearing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To test the scenario that outflows accelerated by active galactic nuclei (AGN) have a major impact on galaxy-wide scales, we have analysed deep VLT/MUSE data for the type-2 quasar/ultraluminous infrared galaxy F13451+1232 - an object that represents the major mergers considered in models of galaxy evolution. After carefully accounting for the effects of atmospheric seeing that had smeared the emission from known compact nuclear outflows across the MUSE field of view, we find that the large-scale kinematics in F13451+1232 are consistent with gravitational motions that are expected in a galaxy merger. Therefore, the fast ($\mathrm{W_{80}}&gt;500$ km s$^{-1}$) warm-ionised AGN-driven outflows in this object are limited to the central $\sim$100 pc of the galaxy, although we cannot rule out larger-scale, lower-velocity outflows. Moreover, we directly demonstrate that failure to account for the beam-smearing effects of atmospheric seeing would have led to the mass outflow rates and kinetic powers of spatially-extended emission being overestimated by orders of magnitude. We also show that beam-smeared compact-outflow emission can be significant beyond radial distances of 3.5 arcseconds (more than eight times the radius of the seeing disk), and support the argument that some previous claims of large-scale outflows in active galaxies were likely the result of this effect rather than genuine galaxy-wide ($r&gt;5$ kpc) outflows. Our study therefore provides further evidence that warm-ionised AGN-driven outflows are limited to the central kiloparsecs of galaxies and highlights the critical importance of accounting for atmospheric seeing in ground-based observational studies of active galaxies.</description>

      <title>The BINGO/ABDUS Project: Forecast for cosmological parameter from a mock Fast Radio Bursts survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There are hosts of surveys that will provide excellent data to search for and locate Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) at cosmological distances. The BINGO project is one such surveys, and this collaboration has already estimated a FRB detection rate that the project will yield with the main telescope helped by a set of outrigger stations. This paper aims to simulate and estimate the potential of FRBs in constraining our current cosmological model. We present a forecast of the future constraints that the BINGO FRB detections and localizations will have when added to other current cosmological datasets. We quantify the dispersion measure (DM) as a function of redshift ($z$) for the BINGO FRB mock sample. Furthermore, we use current datasets (Supernovae, Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations, and Cosmic Microwave Background data) prior to assessing the efficacy of constraining dark energy models using Monte Carlo methods. Our results show that spatially located BINGO FRB dataset will provide promising constraints on the population of host galaxies intrinsic DM and be able to measure the nuisance parameters present within a FRB cosmological analysis. Still, they will also provide alternative estimates on other parameters such as the Hubble constant and the dark energy equation of state. In particular, we should see that BINGO FRB data can put constraints on the degenerate $w-H_0$ plane, which the CMB is incapable of measuring, allowing FRBs to be a viable alternative to BAO to constrain the dark energy equation of state. We conclude that FRBs remain a promising future probe for cosmology and that the FRBs detected by the BINGO project will contribute significantly to our knowledge of the current cosmological model.</description>

      <title>Do SETI Optimists Have a Fine-Tuning Problem?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07097v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In ecological systems, be it a petri dish or a galaxy, populations evolve from some initial value (say zero) up to a steady state equilibrium, when the mean number of births and deaths per unit time are equal. This equilibrium point is a function of the birth and death rates, as well as the carrying capacity of the ecological system itself. We show that the occupation fraction versus birth-to-death rate ratio is S-shaped, saturating at the carrying capacity for large birth-to-death rate ratios and tending to zero at the other end. We argue that our astronomical observations appear inconsistent with a cosmos saturated with ETIs, and thus SETI optimists are left presuming that the true population is somewhere along the transitional part of this S-curve. Since the birth and death rates are a-priori unbounded, we argue that this presents a fine-tuning problem. Further, we show that if the birth-to-death rate ratio is assumed to have a log-uniform prior distribution, then the probability distribution of the ecological filling fraction is bi-modal - peaking at zero and unity. Indeed, the resulting distribution is formally the classic Haldane prior, conceived to describe the prior expectation of a Bernoulli experiment, such as a technological intelligence developing (or not) on a given world. Our results formally connect the Drake Equation to the birth-death formalism, the treatment of ecological carrying capacity and their connection to the Haldane perspective.</description>

      <title>First operation of LArTPC in the stratosphere as an engineering GRAMS balloon flight (eGRAMS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13209v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: GRAMS (Gamma-Ray and AntiMatter Survey) is a next-generation balloon/satellite experiment utilizing a LArTPC (Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber), to simultaneously target astrophysical observations of cosmic MeV gamma-rays and conduct an indirect dark matter search using antimatter. While LArTPCs are widely used in particle physics experiments, they have never been operated at balloon altitudes. An engineering balloon flight with a small-scale LArTPC (eGRAMS) was conducted on July 27th, 2023, to establish a system for safely operating a LArTPC at balloon altitudes and to obtain cosmic-ray data from the LArTPC. The flight was launched from the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency's (JAXA) Taiki Aerospace Research Field in Hokkaido, Japan. The total flight duration was 3 hours and 12 minutes, including a level flight of 44 minutes at a maximum altitude of 28.9 km. The flight system was landed on the sea and successfully recovered. The LArTPC was successfully operated throughout the flight, and about 0.5 million events of the cosmic-ray data including muons, protons, and Compton scattering gamma-ray candidates, were collected. This pioneering flight demonstrates the feasibility of operating a LArTPC in high-altitude environments, paving the way for future GRAMS missions and advancing our capabilities in MeV gamma-ray astronomy and dark matter research.</description>
