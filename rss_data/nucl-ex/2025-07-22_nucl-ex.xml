      <title>On the Impossibility of Obtaining Time-Independent, Three-Dimensional, Spherically-Symmetric Densities of Confined Systems of Relativistically Moving Constituents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum mechanical definition of probability, the uncertainty principle and Poincare invariance provide strong basic restrictions on the ability to define spatial densities associated with form factors describing the properties of confined systems of relativistically moving constituents. Despite this, many papers ignore one or more of these restrictions. Here I show how to obtain time-independent, two-dimensional densities that are consistent with the stated restrictions. This is done using the light-front, infinite momentum frame formalism. Two-dimensional density interpretations of the axial-vector form factor and all three gravitational form factors are obtained. Additionally, an expression of a two-dimensional mass density related to the trace of the energy momentum tensor is obtained. I also show that all known methods for finding three-dimensional densities: using the Breit frame, Abel transformations, Wigner distributions and spherically-symmetric wave packets with vanishing spatial extent violate the basic restrictions in different manners. Furthermore, the use of the latter leads to densities that vanish almost everywhere in space as time increases from an initial value.</description>

      <title>Understanding radial flow fluctuations through event-by-event momentum rescaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transverse momentum ($p_{\mathrm{T}}$) differential radial flow fluctuation, $v_0(p_{\mathrm{T}})$, has emerged as a new probe of the quark-gluon plasma in heavy-ion collisions. I present a framework that recasts $v_0(p_{\mathrm{T}})$ as a $p_{\mathrm{T}}$-dependent momentum rescaling function $g(p_{\mathrm{T}})$. This transformation reveals that constant rescaling ($g(p_{\mathrm{T}})=1$) alone captures the main features of $v_0(p_{\mathrm{T}})$, including its characteristic rise-and-fall pattern that emerges naturally from the particle spectral shape. Analysis of ATLAS data at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=5.02$ TeV reveals small but significant deviations of $g(p_{\mathrm{T}})$ from unity with clear centrality dependence. This transformation converts $v_0(p_{\mathrm{T}})$ into a transparent probe of $p_{\mathrm{T}}$-dependent dynamics: $g(p_{\mathrm{T}})&lt;1$ signals suppressed fluctuations while $g(p_{\mathrm{T}})&gt;1$ indicates enhanced fluctuations relative to global radial flow. Predictions for lower energies reveal spectral shape differences alone could generate substantial variations in $v_0(p_{\mathrm{T}})$. This framework enables direct connections between theoretical predictions and underlying physics mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Inference of Nuclear-Matter Density from Proton Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background: Proton elastic scattering at intermediate energy is widely employed as a tool for determining the matter radius of atomic nuclei. The sensitivity of the approach relies on high-resolution measurements at small scattering angles and low-momentum transfer. Under these conditions, the Glauber multiple scattering theory accurately describes the proton-nucleus elastic cross section.
  Purpose: Investigate the sensitivity of the Glauber multiple scattering theory to uncertainties associated with input parameters such as the nuclear-matter density distribution and nucleon-nucleon data.
  Method: A joint Bayesian inference was performed using 12 angular distributions of elastic scattering at different energies on ${}^{58}$Ni, ${}^{90}$Zr, and ${}^{208}$Pb targets. A Metropolis-Hastings algorithm was implemented to make an uncertainty quantification analysis for the input parameters used in the Glauber multiple scattering theory.
  Results: The experimental cross sections were fitted simultaneously using a joint Bayesian inference approach. Posterior probability density distributions of 42 input parameters were obtained from the analysis. A moderate correlation between the nuclear density parameters and the nucleon-nucleon cross sections was found. This correlation impacts the extraction of the nuclear-matter radius.
  Conclusions: The present analysis provided a consistent method for extracting the nuclear-matter density distribution of ${}^{58}$Ni, ${}^{90}$Zr, and ${}^{208}$Pb from data across different incident energies. Due to the correlation of the nucleon-nucleon cross sections with the other input parameters, a constrained Bayesian inference using free nucleon-nucleon cross section data was performed. The nuclear-matter radii obtained from the analysis are in good agreement with multiple results reported in the literature</description>

      <title>Timelike electromagnetic form factors of hyperons at large $q^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the last few years there has been considerable progress in the study of the electromagnetic form factors of baryons in the timelike region, through electron-positron scattering, with increasing square transfer momentum $q^2$. The modulus of the electric ($G_E$) and magnetic ($G_M$) form factors has been measured for nucleons, hyperons and other baryons at BaBar, CLEO, Belle and BESIII. The novel measurements motivated the extension of a covariant quark model, developed to the spacelike region ($q^2 \le 0$), to the timelike region, without any further parameter fitting. The extension is based on asymptotic relations derived from analyticity and unitarity, valid for the large-$q^2$ region. We use the model to make predictions for the effective form factor $|G|$ (combination of $G_E$ and $G_M$) and the ratio $|G_E/G_M|$ for spin 1/2 hyperons at large $q^2$ (above 10 GeV$^2$). Our calculations are in good agreement with the data from CLEO and BESIII for $\Lambda$, $\Sigma^+$ and $\Xi^-$ above $q^2=15$ GeV$^2$. Upcoming data for $\Sigma^0$, $\Sigma^-$ and $\Xi^-$ at large $q^2$ may be used to further test our predictions. We also compare our model calculations with the scarce available data for $|G_E/G_M|$. We conclude that the present $q^2$ range is not large enough to test our calculations, but that a more definitive test can be made by experiments above $q^2=20$ GeV$^2$.</description>

      <title>Radiative corrections to the parity-violating spin asymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The parity-violating spin asymmetry Apv for elastic electron scattering from spin-zero nuclei, together with its QED corrections, is evaluated non-perturbatively within the phase-shift analysis. Dispersion corrections, taking into account low-lying transient nuclear excitations, are estimated with the help of the lowest-order $\gamma Z$ box diagrams. Collision energies between 5 $-$ 500 MeV are considered, and results are provided for the $^{12}$C and $^{208}$Pb target nuclei. In addition, we have evaluated Apv at GeV energies and small scattering angles -- relevant for the Pb Radius Experiment (PREx) -- revealing that the low-lying nuclear excited states give no measurable dispersive contribution. However, they are important at lower energies and backward angles.</description>

      <title>Spin correlations and Bell nonlocality in $\Lambda\bar\Lambda$ pair production from $e^+e^-$ collisions with a thrust cut</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive theoretical study of spin correlations in $\Lambda\bar{\Lambda}$ production from $e^+e^-$ annihilation, providing the theoretical predictions for the Belle II experiment. Using soft-collinear effective theory, we perform the first resummation of large logarithms for the longitudinal ($C_{LL}$) and transverse ($C_{TT}$) spin correlations for events with a cut on the thrust variable. Our calculation achieves next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy and incorporates the determination of polarized fragmenting jet functions. This framework provides robust predictions with significantly reduced theoretical uncertainties compared to fixed-order parton model approaches. Furthermore, we establish a direct mapping between the experimentally accessible spin correlation, $C_{TT}$, and a testable CHSH-Bell inequality. This result reframes $C_{TT}$ as a quantitative probe of quantum decoherence, providing a novel tool to measure the degree of parton-level entanglement that survives the fragmentation and hadronization process.</description>

      <title>Cryogenic light detectors with thermal signal amplification for $0\nu\beta\beta$ search experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As a step towards the realization of cryogenic-detector experiments to search for neutrinoless double-beta decay (such as CROSS, BINGO, and CUPID), we investigated a batch of 10 Ge light detectors (LDs) assisted by Neganov-Trofimov-Luke (NTL) signal amplification. Each LD was assembled with a large cubic light-emitting crystal (45 mm side) using the recently developed CROSS mechanical structure. The detector array was operated at milli-Kelvin temperatures in a pulse-tube cryostat at the Canfranc underground laboratory in Spain. We achieved good performance with scintillating bolometers from CROSS, made of Li$_{2}$$^{100}$MoO$_4$ crystals and used as reference detectors of the setup, and with all LDs tested (except for a single device that encountered an electronics issue). No leakage current was observed for 8 LDs with an electrode bias up to 100 V. Operating the LDs at an 80 V electrode bias applied in parallel, we obtained a gain of around 9 in the signal-to-noise ratio of these devices, allowing us to achieve a baseline noise RMS of $O$(10 eV). Thanks to the strong current polarization of the temperature sensors, the time response of the devices was reduced to around half a millisecond in rise time. The achieved performance of the LDs was extrapolated via simulations of pile-up rejection capability for several configurations of the CUPID detector structure. Despite the sub-optimal noise conditions of the LDs (particularly at high frequencies), we demonstrated that the NTL technology provides a viable solution for background reduction in CUPID.</description>

      <title>Experimental Search for the Chiral Magnetic Effect in Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collisions: A Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09742v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The chiral magnetic effect (CME) refers to generation of the electric current along a magnetic field in a chirally imbalanced system of quarks. The latter is predicted by quantum chromodynamics to arise from quark interaction with non-trivial topological fluctuations of the vacuum gluonic field. The CME has been actively searched for in relativistic heavy-ion collisions, where such gluonic field fluctuations and a strong magnetic field are believed to be present. The CME-sensitive observables are unfortunately subject to a possibly large non-CME background, and firm conclusions on a CME observation have not yet been reached. In this perspective, we review the experimental status and progress in the CME search, from the initial measurements more than a decade ago, to the dedicated program of isobar collisions in 2018 and the release of the isobar blind analysis result in 2022, to intriguing hints of a possible CME signal in Au+Au collisions, and discuss future prospects of a potential CME discovery in the anticipated high-statistic Au+Au collision data at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider by 2025. We hope such a perspective will help sharpening our focus on the fundamental physics of the CME and steer its experimental search.</description>

      <title>Commissioning of a radiofrequency quadrupole cooler-buncher for collinear laser spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10740v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A RadioFrequency Quadrupole (RFQ) cooler-buncher system has been developed and implemented in a collinear laser spectroscopy setup. This system is dedicated to convert a continuous ion beam into short bunches, while enhancing beam quality and reducing energy spread. The functionality of the RFQ cooler-buncher has been verified through offline tests with stable rubidium and indium beam, delivered from a surface ion source and a laser ablation ion source, respectively. With a transmission efficiency exceeding 60\%, bunched ion beams with a full width at half maximum of approximately 2~$\mu$s in the time-of-flight spectrum have been successfully achieved. The implementation of the RFQ cooler-buncher system also significantly improves the overall transmission efficiency of the collinear laser spectroscopy setup.</description>

      <title>Correlation between particle spectra and elliptic flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18690v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new observable to probe the collective nature of the radial expansion of the quark-gluon plasma. This observable, dubbed $v_{02}(p_T)$, represents the correlation of the spectrum with elliptic flow, in the same way as the recently measured $v_0(p_T)$ represents the correlation of the spectrum with the transverse momentum per particle. The advantage of $v_{02}(p_T)$ over $v_0(p_T)$ is that it is measured using a three-particle cumulant, as opposed to a pair correlation, which significantly reduces the sensitivity to nonflow effects. We predict non-trivial differences between $v_{02}(p_T)$ and $v_0(p_T)$ in semi-central Pb+Pb collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) on the basis of hydrodynamic simulations. A hint of these differences can be seen in the modification of $p_T$ spectra observed by ALICE in event-shape-engineered events.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic spin distributions in multinucleon transfer reactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11905v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time-dependent covariant density functional theory (TD-CDFT) combined with angular momentum projection is developed and applied to study multinucleon transfer (MNT) reactions, with a focus on the intrinsic angular momentum distributions of the final fragments. Using the illustrative reaction $^{40}$Ca + $^{208}$Pb across a range of impact parameters, we find that the MNT process generates broad distributions of intrinsic spins. These distributions arise from the conversion of relative orbital angular momentum into intrinsic spin due to frictional interactions between the colliding nuclei. Additionally, mutual information (entanglement Shannon entropy) is employed to analyze correlations between the intrinsic spins of the fragments.</description>
