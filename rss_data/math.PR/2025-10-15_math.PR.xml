      <title>Quenched and Annealed CLTs for the one-periodic Aztec diamond in random environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic behavior of random dimer coverings of the one-periodic Aztec diamond in random environment. We investigate quenched limit theorems for the height function and we extend annealed limit theorems that were recently studied in [arXiv:2507.08560]. We consider more general choices of random edge weights (independence is not assumed) and we distinguish two cases where the random edge weights satisfy the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) under different scalings. For both cases, we prove convergence to the Gaussian Free Field for the quenched fluctuations. For the annealed version, it had been shown in [arXiv:2507.08560], that Gaussian Free Field fluctuations can be dominated by the much larger fluctuations of the random environment. To access quenched fluctuations we analyze the Schur process with random parameters in a way that allows to prove the annealed CLT for the height function for non i.i.d. weights. We consider specific examples where we determine the asymptotic fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Maximum displacement of critical centered branching random walks under minimal assumptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the critical centered branching random walk with offspring and displacement distributions having finite variance, under minimal assumptions on its structure. We show that the probability that the position of the right-most particle is larger than $r$ decays like an explicit constant times $r^{-2}$; this generalizes an earlier result by Lalley and Shao. In addition, we obtain the convergence in distribution of the progeny of the branching random walk conditioned on the position of the right-most particle being large. Our results are applied to multitype branching random walks under minimal assumptions.</description>

      <title>Feynman Formula for Discrete-time Quantum Walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12038v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explicitly connect (discrete-time) quantum walks on Z with a four-state Markov additive process via a Feynman-type formula (2.5). Using this representation, we derive a relation between the spectral decomposition of the Markov additive process and the limiting density of the homogeneous quantum walk. In addition, we consider a space-time rescaling of quantum walks, which leads to a system of quantum transport PDEs in continuous time and space with a phase interaction term. Our probabilistic representation for this type of PDE offers an efficient Monte Carlo computational technique.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: These are lecture notes for a mini-course on stochastic sewing, taught at the University of Edinburgh and Beijing Institute of Technology in Spring/Summer 2025. The aim is to introduce the reader to stochastic sewing techniques and to show how they can be successfully applied to study various problems in stochastic analysis, including: regularization by noise for stochastic differential equations driven by Brownian motion or fractional Brownian motion, well-posedness of stochastic PDEs with irregular drift, the study of averaging operators and local times, and the analysis of numerical algorithms.</description>

      <title>Stochastic nonlinear wave equation with rougher than white noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the singular stochastic wave equation on $\mathbb T^2$, with a cubic nonlinearity and Gaussian rough Mat\'ern forcing (a Fourier multiplier of order $\alpha&gt;0$ applied to space-time white noise) and establish local well-posedness for $\alpha &lt; \tfrac{3}{8}$. This extends [GKO18] beyond white noise and strengthens the quadratic-case result [OO21] ($\alpha&lt;\tfrac 12$). Our argument develops new trilinear estimates in Bourgain spaces together with sharp, case-specific cubic counting estimates.</description>

      <title>Planted clique recovery in random geometric graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the problem of identifying planted cliques in random geometric graphs, focusing on two distinct algorithmic approaches: the first based on vertex degrees (VD) and the other on common neighbors (CN). We analyze the performance of these methods under varying regimes of key parameters, namely the average degree of the graph and the size of the planted clique. We demonstrate that exact recovery is achieved with high probability as the graph size increases, in a specific set of parameters. Notably, our results reveal that the CN-algorithm significantly outperforms the VD-algorithm. In particular, in the connectivity regime, tiny planted cliques (even edges) are correctly identified by the CN-algorithm, yielding a significant impact on anomaly detection. Finally, our results are confirmed by a series of numerical experiments, showing that the devised algorithms are effective in practice.</description>

      <title>Cyclic and alternating $U$-statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define cyclic $U$-statistics as a variant of $U$-statistics based on variables $X_1,\dots,X_n$ that are assumed to be cyclically ordered. We also define alternating $U$-statistics where in the definition terms are summed with alternating sings (in three different ways). Only $U$-statistics of order 2 are considered. The definitions are inspired by special cases studied by Chebikin (2008) and Even-Zohar (2017) for random permutations.
  We show limit theorems similar to well-known results for standard $U$-statistics, but with some differences between the different versions. In particular, we find both ``nondegenerate'' normal limits and ``degenerate'' non-normal limits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A family of random matrices is said to converge strongly to a limiting family of operators if the operator norm of every noncommutative polynomial of the matrices converges to that of the limiting operators. Recent developments surrounding the strong convergence phenomenon have led to new progress on important problems in random graphs, geometry, operator algebras, and applied mathematics. We review classical and recent results in this area, and their applications to various areas of mathematics.</description>

      <title>Interacting point processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study two different types of vector point processes with interacting components, introducing a migration-type effect. The first case concerns two groups which modify their states with rate functions depending on time only. This yields a representation of the vector process in terms of independent non-homogeneous Skellam processes. In the general case, the decomposition involves independent Poisson processes. The second model is a birth-death-migration vector process. In the case of the linear death-migration we show that, for a fixed time instant, the vector is equal in distribution to the sum of two independent Multinomial random variables. As a byproduct we derive the distribution of a pure migration process. Finally, we study the described vector processes time-changed with the inverse of Bernstein subordinator, establishing a general result concerning the relatioship between fractional difference-differential equations and the probability mass function of a wider class of point processes.</description>

      <title>The Diameter of (Threshold) Geometric Inhomogeneous Random Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the diameter of threshold (zero temperature) Geometric Inhomogeneous Random Graphs (GIRG) is $\Theta(\log n)$. This has strong implications for the runtime of many distributed protocols on those graphs, which often have runtimes bounded as a function of the diameter.
  The GIRG model exhibits many properties empirically found in real-world networks, and the runtime of various practical algorithms has empirically been found to scale in the same way for GIRG and for real-world networks, in particular related to computing distances, diameter, clustering, cliques and chromatic numbers. Thus the GIRG model is a promising candidate for deriving insight about the performance of algorithms in real-world instances.
  The diameter was previously only known in the one-dimensional case, and the proof relied very heavily on dimension one. Our proof employs a similar Peierls-type argument alongside a novel renormalization scheme. Moreover, instead of using topological arguments (which become complicated in high dimensions) in establishing the connectivity of certain boundaries, we employ some comparatively recent and clearer graph-theoretic machinery. The lower bound is proven via a simple ad-hoc construction.</description>

      <title>Two-Sided Free Boundary Problems Arising From Branching-Selection Particle Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and analyse a two-sided free boundary problem arising from a generalization of the well-known $N$-particle branching Brownian motion ($N$-BBM) model, called the $(N, p)$-BBM, where selection can occur on both the leftmost and rightmost particles according to a parameter $p\in(0,1)$. The main result here establishes that, as $N\to\infty$, the empirical distribution of the $(N,p)$-BBM converges to a deterministic hydrodynamic limit described by a free boundary problem on a finite interval with two moving boundaries, and explicit Neumann and Dirichlet boundary conditions parametrized by $p$. We further prove that the asymptotic velocity $v_{N,p}$ of the $(N,p)$-BBM converges, as $N\to\infty$, to $v_p$, the unique travelling wave speed of the limiting free boundary problem. These results generalize previous one-sided models and connect to broader classes of free boundary problems found in evolutionary dynamics and flame propagation.</description>

      <title>Dimension-Free Minimax Rates for Learning Pairwise Interactions in Attention-Style Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the convergence rate of learning pairwise interactions in single-layer attention-style models, where tokens interact through a weight matrix and a non-linear activation function. We prove that the minimax rate is $M^{-\frac{2\beta}{2\beta+1}}$ with $M$ being the sample size, depending only on the smoothness $\beta$ of the activation, and crucially independent of token count, ambient dimension, or rank of the weight matrix. These results highlight a fundamental dimension-free statistical efficiency of attention-style nonlocal models, even when the weight matrix and activation are not separately identifiable and provide a theoretical understanding of the attention mechanism and its training.</description>

      <title>Mean-Field Games with Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a framework of Constrained Mean-Field Games (CMFGs), where each agent solves a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP). This formulation captures scenarios in which agents' strategies are subject to feasibility, safety, or regulatory restrictions, thereby extending the scope of classical mean field game (MFG) models. We first establish the existence of CMFG equilibria under a strict feasibility assumption, and we further show uniqueness under a classical monotonicity condition. To compute equilibria, we develop Constrained Mean-Field Occupation Measure Optimization (CMFOMO), an optimization-based scheme that parameterizes occupation measures and shows that finding CMFG equilibria is equivalent to solving a single optimization problem with convex constraints and bounded variables. CMFOMO does not rely on uniqueness of the equilibria and can approximate all equilibria with arbitrary accuracy. We further prove that CMFG equilibria induce $O(1 / \sqrt{N})$-Nash equilibria in the associated constrained $N$-player games, thereby extending the classical justification of MFGs as approximations for large but finite systems. Numerical experiments on a modified Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) epidemic model with various constraints illustrate the effectiveness and flexibility of the framework.</description>

      <title>Improved Central Limit Theorem and Bootstrap Approximations for Linear Stochastic Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we refine the Berry-Esseen bounds for the multivariate normal approximation of Polyak-Ruppert averaged iterates arising from the linear stochastic approximation (LSA) algorithm with decreasing step size. We consider the normal approximation by the Gaussian distribution with covariance matrix predicted by the Polyak-Juditsky central limit theorem and establish the rate up to order $n^{-1/3}$ in convex distance, where $n$ is the number of samples used in the algorithm. We also prove a non-asymptotic validity of the multiplier bootstrap procedure for approximating the distribution of the rescaled error of the averaged LSA estimator. We establish approximation rates of order up to $1/\sqrt{n}$ for the latter distribution, which significantly improves upon the previous results obtained by Samsonov et al. (2024).</description>

      <title>Boosted second moment method in random regular graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Determining the asymptotic independence ratio of random regular graphs is a key challenge in the area of sparse random graphs. Due to the interpolation method, very good upper bounds are known, which are actually known to be sharp for sufficiently large degrees.
  This paper provides explicit lower bounds for given degrees $d$, beating the previous best bounds for $d \geq 10$. The starting point is a second moment argument that we can boost by arguing that the obtained independent set has a certain spatial Markov property. One can then exploit this property by making local modifications to the independent set, resulting in substantial improvements.
  Our approach can also be used to prove the existence of other objects in random regular graphs. To demonstrate this, we consider the problem of decomposing random regular graphs into stars.</description>

      <title>Contraction and entropy production in continuous-time Sinkhorn dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the vanishing-step-size limit of the Sinkhorn algorithm at finite regularization parameter $\varepsilon$ was shown to be a mirror descent in the space of probability measures. We give $L^2$ contraction criteria in two time-dependent metrics induced by the mirror Hessian, which reduce to the coercivity of certain conditional expectation operators. We then give an exact identity for the entropy production rate of the Sinkhorn flow, which was previously known only to be nonpositive. Examining this rate shows that the standard semigroup analysis of diffusion processes extends systematically to the Sinkhorn flow. We show that the flow induces a reversible Markov dynamics on the target marginal as an Onsager gradient flow. We define the Dirichlet form associated to its (nonlocal) infinitesimal generator, prove a Poincar\'e inequality for it, and show that the spectral gap is strictly positive along the Sinkhorn flow whenever $\varepsilon &gt; 0$. Lastly, we show that the entropy decay is exponential if and only if a logarithmic Sobolev inequality (LSI) holds. We give for illustration two immediate practical use-cases for the Sinkhorn LSI: as a design principle for the latent space in which generative models are trained, and as a stopping heuristic for discrete-time algorithms.</description>

Abstract: We provide error bounds for the N-intertwined mean-field approximation (NIMFA) for local density-dependent Markov population processes with a well-distributed underlying network structure showing NIMFA being accurate when a typical vertex has many neighbors. The result justifies some of the most common approximations used in epidemiology, statistical physics and opinion dynamics literature under certain conditions. We allow interactions between more than 2 individuals, and an underlying hypergraph structure accordingly.</description>

      <title>Uniform convergence of conditional distributions for one-dimensional diffusion processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.08911v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the quasi-stationary behavior of the one-dimensional diffusion process with a regular or exit boundary at 0 and an entrance boundary at $\infty$. By using the Doob's $h$-transform, we show that the conditional distribution of the process converges to its unique quasi-stationary distribution exponentially fast in the total variation norm, uniformly with respect to the initial distribution. Moreover, we also use the same method to show that the conditional distribution of the process converges exponentially fast in the $\psi$-norm to the unique quasi-stationary distribution. The rate of convergence of the conditional empirical measure to the quasi-ergodic distribution is also considered. Finally, two examples arising in population dynamics are also given to illustrate the main results.</description>

      <title>An optimal transport approach for the multiple quantile hedging problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.01121v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the multiple quantile hedging problem, which is a class of partial hedging problems containing as special examples the quantile hedging problem (F{\"o}llmer \&amp; Leukert 1999) and the PnL matching problem (introduced in Bouchard \&amp; Vu 2012). In complete non-linear markets, we show that the problem can be reformulated as a kind of Monge optimal transport problem. Using this observation, we introduce a Kantorovitch version of the problem and prove that the value of both problems coincide. In the linear case, we thus obtain that the multiple quantile hedging problem can be seen as a semi-discrete optimal transport problem, for which we further introduce the dual problem. We then prove that there is no duality gap, allowing us to design a numerical method based on SGA algorithms to compute the multiple quantile hedging price.</description>

Abstract: This paper considers the orthogonal expansion of the fractional Brownian motion relative to the Legendre polynomials. Such an expansion has not only theoretical but also practical interest, since it can be applied to approximate and simulate the fractional Brownian motion in continuous time. The relations for the mean square approximation error are presented, and a comparison with the previously obtained result is carried out.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11387v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we present the distribution of the telegraph meander, a random function obtained by conditioning the telegraph process to stay above the zero level. The reflection principle for finite-velocity random motions allows the law of the telegraph meander to be expressed in terms of the spatial derivative of the law of the telegraph process with initial negative velocity. As a result, we are able to obtain the characteristic function, the moments and the hyperbolic equation that governs the law of the telegraph meander. Furthermore, we prove that Brownian meander is the weak limit of the telegraph meander.</description>

      <title>Random dynamics and invariant measures for a class of non-Newtonian fluids of differential type on 2D and 3D Poincar\'e domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04801v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we consider a class of incompressible stochastic third-grade fluids (non-Newtonian fluids) equations on two- as well as three-dimensional Poincar\'e domains $\mathcal{O}$ (which may be bounded or unbounded). Our aims are to study the well-posedness and asymptotic analysis for the solutions of the underlying system. Firstly, we prove that the underlying system defined on $\mathcal{O}$ has a unique weak solution (in the analytic sense) under Dirichlet boundary condition and it also generates random dynamical system $\Psi$. Secondly, we consider the underlying system on bounded domains. Using the compact Sobolev embedding $\mathbb{H}^1(\mathcal{O}) \hookrightarrow\mathbb{L}^2(\mathcal{O})$, we prove the existence of a unique random attractor for the underlying system on bounded domains with external forcing in $\mathbb{H}^{-1}(\mathcal{O})+\mathbb{W}^{-1,\frac{4}{3}}(\mathcal{O})$. Thirdly, we consider the underlying system on unbounded Poincar\'e domains with external forcing in $\mathbb{L}^{2}(\mathcal{O})$ and show the existence of a unique random attractor. In order to obtain the existence of a unique random attractor on unbounded domains, due to the lack of compact Sobolev embedding $\mathbb{H}^1(\mathcal{O}) \hookrightarrow\mathbb{L}^2(\mathcal{O})$, we use the uniform-tail estimates method which helps us to demonstrate the asymptotic compactness of $\Psi$.
  Note that due to the presence of several nonlinear terms in the underlying system, we are not able to use the energy equality method to obtain the asymptotic compactness of $\Psi$ in unbounded domains, which makes the analysis of this work in unbounded domains more difficult and interesting. Finally, as a consequence of the existence of random attractors, we address the existence of invariant measures for underlying system.</description>

      <title>The Law of Large Numbers and CLT for Non-stationary Markov Jump Processes Exhibiting Time-of-Day Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08282v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a general law of large numbers and central limit theorem for cumulative reward processes associated with finite state Markov jump processes with non-stationary transition rates. Such models commonly arise in service operations and manufacturing applications in which time-of-day, day-of-week, and secular effects are of first-order importance in predicting system behavior. Our theorems allow for non-stationary reward environments that continuously accumulate reward, while also including contributions from non-stationary lump-sum rewards of random size that are collected at either jump times of the underlying process, jump times of a Poisson process modulated by the underlying process, or scheduled deterministic times. As part of our development, we also obtain a new central limit theorem for the special case in which the jump process transition rates and reward structure are periodic (as may occur over a weekly time interval), as well as for jump process models with resetting. We include a simulation study illustrating the quality of our CLT approximations for several non-stationary stochastic models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03048v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a generalisation of Sch\"{u}tz and Trimper's elephant random walk to finitely generated groups. We focus on the simplest non-abelian setting, i.e. groups whose Cayley graphs are homogeneous trees of degree $d \ge 3$. We show that the asymptotic speed of the walk does not depend on the memory parameter $p \in [0, 1)$ and equals $\frac{d - 2}{d}$, the asymptotic speed of simple random walk on these graphs. We also establish upper bounds on the rate of convergence to the limiting speed. These upper bounds depend on $p$ and exhibit a phase transition at the critical value $p_d = \frac{d + 1}{2d}$. Numerical experiments suggest that these upper bounds are tight. Along the way, we also obtain estimates on the return probability.</description>

      <title>Persistence probabilities for fractionally integrated fractional Brownian noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10265v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main objective of this study is fractionally integrated fractional Brownian noise, I(t/a,H) where a&gt;0 is the 'multiplicity' of integration, and H is the Hurst parameter . The subject of the analysis is the persistence exponent e(a,H) that determines the power-law asymptotic of probability that the process will not exceed a fixit level in a growing time interval (0,T). In the important cases (a=1,H) and (a=2,H=1/2) these exponents are well known. To understand the problematic exponents e(2,H), we consider the (a,H) parameters from the maximum (for the task) area G= (a+H&gt;1,0&lt;H&lt;1) ). We prove the decrease of the exponents with increasing 'a' and describe their behavior near the boundary of G, including infinity. The discovered identity of the exponents with the parameters (a,H) and (a+2H-1,1-H) actually refutes the long-standing hypothesis that e(2,H)=H(1-H). Our results are based on well known the continuity lemma for the persistence exponents and on a generalization of Slepian's lemma for a family of Gaussian processes smoothly dependent on a parameter.</description>

      <title>On Kemeny's Constant for Markov Processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19273v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mean time taken by an irreducible Markov chain on a finite state space to hit a target chosen at random according to the stationary distribution does not depend on the initial state of the chain. This mean time is known as Kemeny's constant. I present a new approach, based on time reversal and a mean occupation time formula.
  The method is used to prove a similar result for continuous-time Markov processes. In this generality, the constancy holds only almost surely with respect to the stationary distribution of the process, but with extra effort the exceptional set can be made to disappear in certain situations. Some examples are provided.</description>

Abstract: This work is concerned with homogenization problems for elliptic equations of the type \[ \begin{cases} \mathfrak{L}_{\delta} u_{\delta} + \lambda u_{\delta} = f_{\delta} \qquad \text{in} \;\; D, \\ \qquad \quad \;\, u = 0 \qquad \, \text{on} \;\; \partial D, \end{cases} \] where $\delta &gt; 0$, $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$, $D$ is a bounded open set in $\mathbb{R}^{d}$, and $f_{\delta} \in H^{-1}(D)$. The operator $ \mathfrak{L}_{\delta} u = -{\rm div} \left( A^\delta \nabla u + C^\delta u \right) + B^\delta \nabla u +k^\delta u $ involved uniformly bounded diffusion coefficients $A^\delta$, where drifts $B^\delta$, $C^\delta$, and potential $k^\delta$ are possibly unbounded. An application to homogenization of the corresponding diffusion processes is also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00667v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the question of how many edge-disjoint near-maximal cliques may be found in the dense Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph $G(n,p)$. Recently Acan and Kahn showed that the largest such family contains only $O(n^2/(\log{n})^3)$ cliques, with high probability, which disproved a conjecture of Alon and Spencer. We prove the corresponding lower bound, $\Omega(n^2/(\log{n})^3)$, by considering a random graph process which sequentially selects and deletes near-maximal cliques. To analyse this process we use the Differential Equation Method. We also give a new proof of the upper bound $O(n^2/(\log{n})^3)$ and discuss the problem of the precise size of the largest such clique packing.</description>

      <title>Verification theorem related to a zero sum stochastic differential game, based on a chain rule for non-smooth functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06243v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the framework of stochastic zero-sum differential games, we establish a verification theorem, inspired by those existing in stochastic control, to provide sufficient conditions for a pair of feedback controls to form a Nash equilibrium. Suppose the validity of the classical Isaacs' condition and the existence of a (what is termed) quasi-strong solution to the Bellman-Isaacs (BI) equations. If the diffusion coefficient of the state equation is non-degenerate, we are able to show the existence of a saddle point constituted by a couple of feedback controls that achieve the value of the game: moreover, the latter is equal to the (necessarily unique) solution of the BI equations. A suitable generalization is available when the diffusion is possibly degenerate. Similarly we have also improved a well-known verification theorem in stochastic control theory. The techniques of stochastic calculus via regularization we use, in particular specific chain rules, are borrowed from a companion paper of the authors.</description>

      <title>Ultra-Discretization of Yang-Baxter Maps, Probability Distributions and Independence Preserving Property</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21359v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the relationship between Yang-Baxter maps and the independence preserving (IP) property, motivated by their role in integrable systems, from the perspective of ultra-discretization. Yang-Baxter maps satisfy the set-theoretic Yang-Baxter equation, while the IP property ensures independence of transformed random variables. The relationship between these two seemingly unrelated properties has recently started to be studied by Sasada and Uozumi (2024). Ultra-discretization is a concept primarily used in the context of integrable systems and is an area of active research, serving as a method for exploring the connections between different integrable systems. However, there are few studies on how the stationary distribution for integrable systems changes through ultra-discretization. In this paper, we introduce the concept of ultra-discretization for probability distributions, and prove that the properties of being a Yang-Baxter map and having the IP property are both preserved under ultra-discretization. Applying this to quadrirational Yang-Baxter maps, we confirm that their ultra-discrete versions retain these properties, yielding new examples of piecewise linear maps having the IP property. We also explore implications of our results for stationary distributions of integrable systems and pose several open questions.</description>

      <title>The Kirkwood closure point process: A solution of the Kirkwood-Salsburg equations for negative activities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08242v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Kirkwood superposition is a well-known tool in statistical physics to approximate the $n$-point correlation functions for $n\geq 3$ in terms of the density $\rho $ and the radial distribution function $g$ of the underlying system. However, it is unclear whether these approximations are themselves the correlation functions of some point process. If they are, this process is called the Kirkwood closure process. For the case that $g$ is the negative exponential of some nonnegative and regular pair potential $u$ existence of the the Kirkwood closure process was proved by Ambartzumian and Sukiasian. This result was generalized to the case that $u$ is a locally stable and regular pair potential by Kuna, Lebowitz and Speer, provided that $\rho$ is sufficiently small. In this work, it is shown that it suffices for $u$ to be stable and regular to ensure the existence of the Kirkwood closure process. Furthermore, for locally stable $u$ it is proved that the Kirkwood closure process is Gibbs and that the kernel of the GNZ-equation satisfies a Kirkwood-Salsburg type equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01253v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider an $N$-soliton solution of the focusing nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equations. We give conditions for the synchronous collision of these $N$ solitons. When the solitons velocities are well separated and the solitons have equal amplitude, we show that the local wave profile at the collision point scales as the $\operatorname{sinc}(x)$ function. We show that this behaviour persists when the amplitudes of the solitons are i.i.d. sub-exponential random variables. Namely the central collision peak exhibits universality: its spatial profile converges to the $\operatorname{sinc}(x)$ function, independently of the distribution. We derive Central Limit Theorems for the fluctuations of the profile in the near-field regime (near the collision point) and in the far-regime.</description>

Abstract: This article considers embeddings of bounded degree graphs into general metric spaces. Our first main result is a metric analogue of Matou\v{s}ek's extrapolation that relates the Poincar\'e constants $\gamma(G,\varrho^p)$ and $\gamma(G,\varrho^q)$ for any pair of exponents $0 &lt; p,q &lt; \infty$, any bounded degree expander graph $G$, and any metric space $\mathcal{M}=(M,\varrho)$. Our second main result provides a sharp estimate of the Poincar\'e constant $\gamma(G,\varrho)$ in terms of the cardinalities of the vertex set of $G$ and the target metric space $\mathcal{M}=(M,\varrho)$, in the setting of \textit{random} graphs. Both theorems utilize a novel structural dichotomy for metric embeddings of graphs.
  These results lead to the resolution of several problems within the theory of metric embeddings. Among the applications are estimates on the nonlinear spectral gap of metric snowflakes, optimal estimates on the minimum cardinality of (bi-Lipschitz) universal metric spaces for graphs, and sharp lower bounds on the bi-Lipschitz distortion of random regular graphs into arbitrary metric spaces of large cardinality.</description>

Abstract: For the type A, BC, and D root systems, we determine equivalent conditions between the coefficients of an exponential holomorphic function and the asymptotic values taken by the Dunkl bilinear form when one of its entries is the function. We establish these conditions over the $|\theta N| \rightarrow\infty$ regime for the type A and D root systems and over the $|\theta_0 N|\rightarrow \infty, \frac{\theta_1}{\theta_0 N}\rightarrow c\in\mathbb{C}$ regime for the type BC root system. We also generalize existing equivalent conditions over the $\theta N \rightarrow c\in\mathbb{C}$ regime for the type A root system and over the $\theta_0 N\rightarrow c_0\in\mathbb{C}, \frac{\theta_1}{\theta_0 N}\rightarrow c_1\in\mathbb{C}$ regime for the type BC root system and prove new equivalent conditions over the $\theta N \rightarrow c\in\mathbb{C}$ regime for the type D root system. Furthermore, we determine the asymptotics of the coefficients of the Bessel functions over the regimes that we have mentioned.</description>
