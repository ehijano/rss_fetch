      <title>Moist Vortex Dynamics of Axisymmetric Tropical Cyclones Before Reaching Symmetric Neutrality - Part I: A Generalized Tangential Wind Formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The potential intensity (PI) theory of tropical cyclones (TCs) provides a reasonable estimate of the maximum intensity of a steady-state TC in a quiescent environment. The traditional PI theory relies on the symmetric neutrality (SN) assumption, where the isolines of absolute angular momentum (M) are parallel to the saturation entropy (s*) surfaces within the eyewall updraft. When the SN is not valid, there is currently no quantitative theory that explicitly describes how these surfaces directly relate to the maximum tangential wind (vmax) near the surface. In this study, the PI theory is revisited without making the SN assumption. Under non-SN conditions, it is found that the balance between the centrifugal torque and baroclinic torque provides a strong constraint on the vortex structure and balanced intensity. Specifically, it is shown that the gradient between s* and M along constant temperature (T) throughout the saturated eyewall determines the structure of the M surface and the balanced intensity at the low level. The same technique can be applied to obtain the generalized terms that correspond to the unbalanced component. It is shown that this generalized vmax equation is the natural extension of the traditional PI formula into the non-symmetric neutrality regime. Verifying against axisymmetric simulations, it is shown that the generalized vmax equation can accurately quantify the various contributions to vmax during the rapid intensification process. The implications of these findings on the TC rapid intensification, such as the TC inner-core structure and the upper-tropospheric mixing process, are examined.</description>

      <title>Reanalysis-based Global Radiative Response to Sea Surface Temperature Patterns: Evaluating the Ai2 Climate Emulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sensitivity of the radiative flux at the top of the atmosphere to surface temperature perturbations cannot be directly observed. The relationship between sea surface temperature and top-of-atmosphere radiation can be estimated with Green's function simulations by locally perturbing the sea surface temperature boundary conditions in atmospheric climate models. We perform such simulations with the Ai2 Climate Emulator (ACE), a machine learning-based emulator trained on ERA5 reanalysis data (ACE2-ERA5). This produces a sensitivity map of the top-of-atmosphere radiative response to surface warming that aligns with our physical understanding of radiative feedbacks. However, ACE2-ERA5 likely underestimates the radiative response to historical warming. We argue that Green's function experiments can be used to evaluate the performance and limitations of machine learning-based climate emulators by examining if causal physical relationships are correctly represented and testing their capability for out-of-distribution predictions.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-permitting machine learning reveals sources of dynamic sea level predictability across daily-to-seasonal timescales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable dynamic sea level forecasts are hindered by numerous sources of uncertainty on daily-to-seasonal timescales (1-180 days) due to atmospheric boundary conditions and internal ocean variability. Studies have demonstrated that certain initial states can extend predictability horizons; thus, identifying these initial conditions may help improve forecast skill. Here, we identify sources of dynamic sea level predictability on daily-to-seasonal timescales using neural networks trained on CESM2 large ensemble data to forecast dynamic sea level. The forecasts yield not only a point estimate for sea level but also a standard deviation to quantify forecast uncertainty based on the initial conditions. Forecasted uncertainties can be leveraged to identify state-dependent sources of predictability at most locations and forecast leads. Network forecasts, particularly in the low-latitude Indo-Pacific, exhibit skillful deterministic predictions and skillfully forecast exceedance probabilities relative to local linear baselines. For networks trained at Guam and in the western Indian Ocean, the transfer of sources of predictability from local sources to remote sources is presented by the deteriorating utility of initial condition information for predicting exceedance events. Propagating Rossby waves are identified as a potential source of predictability for dynamic sea level at Guam. In the Indian Ocean, persistence of thermosteric sea level anomalies from the Indian Ocean Dipole may be a source of predictability on subseasonal timescales, but El Ni\~no drives predictability on seasonal timescales. This work shows how uncertainty-quantifying machine learning can help identify changes in sources of state-dependent predictability over a range of forecast leads.</description>

      <title>When tiny convective spread affects a midlatitude jet: spread sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the evolution of spread over three days in a numerical ensemble experiment starting from tiny initial condition uncertainty. We simulate a real event during which three mesoscale convective systems occur in close proximity to the midlatitude jet. The spread evolution is compared with an existing conceptual three-stage model. Each system follows the first stage, characterised by development of convective variability. Nevertheless, we find significant variation among the systems in their propensity to interact with the jet stream, which characterises conceptual stage 2. One exemplary convective system follows the conceptual evolution of Baumgart et al., i.e., convective uncertainty initially projects onto the jet by upper-tropospheric outflow, which further amplifies spread through nonlinear growth as it propagates downstream. Rossby-like dispersion in the downstream spread is strongly associated with the convective variability. In contrast, for another convective system, convective variability projects onto the local anticyclonic flow aloft. Subsequently, this anticyclonic perturbation hardly (if at all) projects convective uncertainty onto the particularly straight jet stream, which truncates the conceptual evolution. For the third system, negligible fingerprints of second and third stages are identified. Alongside convective heating, longwave radiation jointly dominates the spread evolution near the convective systems (as opposed to earlier studies). Longwave-radiative tendencies of convective anvils outlive the accompanied heating tendencies and extend spatially. Furthermore, we link convective variability of the exemplary system directly to longwave-radiative tendencies. Therefore, longwave radiation appears to contributes substantially to stages 1 and 2 here. Finally, we identify flow dependence of the impact of convection on the jet.

      <title>Opportunities and challenges of quantum computing for climate modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adaptation to climate change requires robust climate projections, yet the uncertainty in these projections performed by ensembles of Earth system models (ESMs) remains large. This is mainly due to uncertainties in the representation of subgrid-scale processes such as turbulence or convection that are partly alleviated at higher resolution. New developments in machine learning-based hybrid ESMs demonstrate great potential for systematically reduced errors compared to traditional ESMs. Building on the work of hybrid (physics + AI) ESMs, we here discuss the additional potential of further improving and accelerating climate models with quantum computing. We discuss how quantum computers could accelerate climate models by solving the underlying differential equations faster, how quantum machine learning could better represent subgrid-scale phenomena in ESMs even with currently available noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices, how quantum algorithms aimed at solving optimisation problems could assist in tuning the many parameters in ESMs, a currently time-consuming and challenging process, and how quantum computers could aid in the analysis of climate models. We also discuss hurdles and obstacles facing current quantum computing paradigms. Strong interdisciplinary collaboration between climate scientists and quantum computing experts could help overcome these hurdles and harness the potential of quantum computing for this urgent topic.</description>

      <title>Skillful Nowcasting of Convective Clouds With a Cascade Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate nowcasting of convective clouds from satellite imagery is essential for mitigating the impacts of meteorological disasters, especially in developing countries and remote regions with limited ground-based observations. Recent advances in deep learning have shown promise in video prediction; however, existing models frequently produce blurry results and exhibit reduced accuracy when forecasting physical fields. Here, we introduce SATcast, a diffusion model that leverages a cascade architecture and multimodal inputs for nowcasting cloud fields in satellite imagery. SATcast incorporates physical fields predicted by FuXi, a deep-learning weather model, alongside past satellite observations as conditional inputs to generate high-quality future cloud fields. Through comprehensive evaluation, SATcast outperforms conventional methods on multiple metrics, demonstrating its superior accuracy and robustness. Ablation studies underscore the importance of its multimodal design and the cascade architecture in achieving reliable predictions. Notably, SATcast maintains predictive skill for up to 24 hours, underscoring its potential for operational nowcasting applications.</description>

      <title>Abyssal Slope Currents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11152v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Realistic computational simulations in different oceanic basins reveal prevalent prograde mean flows (i.e. in the direction of topographic Rossby wave propagation along isobaths; a.k.a. topostrophy) on topographic slopes in the deep ocean, consistent with the barotropic theory of eddy-driven mean flows. Attention is focused on the Western Mediterranean Sea with strong currents and steep topography. These prograde mean currents induce an opposing bottom drag stress and thus a turbulent boundary-layer mean flow in the downhill direction, evidenced by a near-bottom negative mean vertical velocity. The slope-normal profile of diapycnal buoyancy mixing results in down-slope mean advection near the bottom (a tendency to locally increase the mean buoyancy) and up-slope buoyancy mixing (a tendency to decrease buoyancy) with associated buoyancy fluxes across the mean isopycnal surfaces (diapycnal downwelling). In the upper part of the boundary layer and nearby interior, the diapycnal turbulent buoyancy flux divergence reverses sign (diapycnal upwelling), with upward Eulerian mean buoyancy advection across isopycnal surfaces. These near-slope tendencies abate with further distance from the boundary. An along-isobath mean momentum balance shows an advective acceleration and a bottom-drag retardation of the prograde flow. The eddy buoyancy advection is significant near the slope, and the associated eddy potential energy conversion is negative, consistent with mean vertical shear flow generation for the eddies. This cross-isobath flow structure differs from previous proposals, and a new one-dimensional model is constructed for a topostrophic, stratified, slope bottom boundary layer. The broader issue of the return pathways of the global thermohaline circulation remains open, but the abyssal slope region is likely to play a dominant role.</description>

      <title>Next-order balanced model captures submesoscale physics and statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03422v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using nonlinear simulations in two settings, we demonstrate that QG$^\mathrm{+1}$, a potential-vorticity based next-order-in-Rossby balanced model, captures several aspects of ocean submesoscale physics. In forced-dissipative 3D simulations under baroclinically unstable Eady-type background states, the statistical equilibrium turbulence exhibits long cyclonic tails and a plethora of rapidly-intensifying ageostrophic fronts. Despite that the model requires setting an explicit, small value for the fixed scaling Rossby number, the emergent flows are nevertheless characterized by vorticity and convergence values larger than the local Coriolis frequency, as observed in upper-ocean submesoscale flows. Simulations of QG$^\mathrm{+1}$ under the classic strain-induced frontogenesis set-up show realistic frontal asymmetry and a provable finite time blow-up, quantitatively comparable to simulations of the semigeostrophic equations. The inversions in the QG$^\mathrm{+1}$ model are straightforward linear Poisson problems, allowing for the reconstruction of all flow fields from the PV and surface buoyancy, while avoiding the semigeostrophic coordinate transformation. Taken together, these results suggest QG$^\mathrm{+1}$ might be a useful tool for studying upper-ocean submesoscale dynamics.</description>

      <title>CLLMate: A Multimodal Benchmark for Weather and Climate Events Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19058v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Forecasting weather and climate events is crucial for making appropriate measures to mitigate environmental hazards and minimize losses. However, existing environmental forecasting research focuses narrowly on predicting numerical meteorological variables (e.g., temperature), neglecting the translation of these variables into actionable textual narratives of events and their consequences. To bridge this gap, we proposed Weather and Climate Event Forecasting (WCEF), a new task that leverages numerical meteorological raster data and textual event data to predict weather and climate events. This task is challenging to accomplish due to difficulties in aligning multimodal data and the lack of supervised datasets. To address these challenges, we present CLLMate, the first multimodal dataset for WCEF, using 26,156 environmental news articles aligned with ERA5 reanalysis data. We systematically benchmark 23 existing MLLMs on CLLMate, including closed-source, open-source, and our fine-tuned models. Our experiments reveal the advantages and limitations of existing MLLMs and the value of CLLMate for the training and benchmarking of the WCEF task.</description>

      <title>Analysis, forecasting and system identification of a floating offshore wind turbine using dynamic mode decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07263v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article presents the data-driven equation-free modeling of the dynamics of a hexafloat floating offshore wind turbine based on the application of dynamic mode decomposition (DMD). All the analyses are performed on experimental data collected from an operating prototype. The DMD has here used i) to extract knowledge from the dynamic system through its modal analysis, ii) for short-term forecasting from the knowledge of the immediate past of the system state, and iii) for the system identification and reduced order modeling. The forecasting method for the motions, accelerations, and forces acting on the floating system is developed using Hankel-DMD, a methodological extension that includes time-delayed copies of the states in an augmented state vector. The system identification task is performed by applying Hankel-DMD with control (Hankel-DMDc), which models the system including the effect of forcing terms. The influence of the main hyperparameters of the methods, namely the number of delayed copies in the state and input vector and the length of the observation time, is investigated with a full factorial analysis using three error metrics analyzing complementary aspects of the prediction: the normalized root mean square error, the normalized average minimum-maximum absolute error, and the Jensen-Shannon divergence. A Bayesian extension of the Hankel-DMD and Hankel-DMDc is introduced by considering the hyperparameters as stochastic variables varying in suitable ranges defined after the full factorial analysis, enriching the predictions with uncertainty quantification. Results show the capability of the approaches for short-term forecasting and system identification, suggesting their potential for real-time continuously-learning digital twinning and surrogate data-driven reduced order modeling.</description>
