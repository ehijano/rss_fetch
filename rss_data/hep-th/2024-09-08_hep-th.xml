      <title>Allowed Coulomb branch scaling dimensions of four-dimensional $\mathcal{N} = 2$ SCFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A basic datum of a rank-$r$ $\mathcal{N}{=}2$ superconformal field theory (SCFT) is the $r$-tuple of its Coulomb branch scaling dimensions, i.e., the scaling dimensions of a set of special protected scalar operators whose vevs generate the coordinate ring of the Coulomb branch of the theory. It is well known that when the coordinate ring is freely generated these scaling dimensions can only take values in a small set of rational numbers. But there are further constraints on which $r$-tuples of these numbers can appear. The main aim of this work is to clarify what these are. Along the way we also compute explicitly the $r$-tuples of allowed scaling dimensions for theories of ranks $r = 2, 3, 4$.</description>

      <title>Long-distance N-partite information for fermionic CFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mutual information, $I_2$, of general spacetime regions is expected to capture the full data of any conformal field theory (CFT). For spherical regions, this data can be accessed from long-distance expansions of the mutual information of pairs of regions as well as of suitably chosen linear combinations of mutual informations involving more than two regions and their unions -- namely, the $N$-partite information, $I_N$. In particular, the leading term in the $I_2$ long-distance expansion is fully determined by the spin and conformal dimension of the lowest-dimensional primary of the theory. When the operator is a scalar, an analogous formula for the tripartite information $I_3$ contains information about the OPE coefficient controlling the fusion of such operator into its conformal family. When it is a fermionic field, the coefficient of the leading term in $I_3$ vanishes instead. In this paper we present an explicit general formula for the long-distance four-partite information $I_4$ of general CFTs whose lowest-dimensional operator is a fermion $\psi$. The result involves a combination of four-point and two-point functions of $\psi$ and $\bar{\psi}$ evaluated at the locations of the regions. We perform explicit checks of the formula for a $(2+1)$-dimensional free fermion in the lattice finding perfect agreement. The generalization of our result to the $N$-partite information (for arbitrary $N$) is also discussed. Similarly to $I_3$, we argue that $I_5$ vanishes identically at leading order for general fermionic theories, while the $I_N$ with $N=7,9, \dots$ only vanish when the theory is free.</description>

      <title>All-orders moduli for type II flux backgrounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the old problem of determining the exact bulk moduli of generic $\mathrm{SU}(3)$-structure flux backgrounds of type II string theory. Using techniques from generalised geometry, we show that the infinitesimal deformations are counted by a spectral sequence in which the vertical maps are either de Rham or Dolbeault differentials (depending on the type of the exceptional complex structure (ECS)) and the horizontal maps are linear maps constructed from the flux and intrinsic torsion. Our calculation is exact, covering all possible supergravity $\mathrm{SU}(3)$-structure flux backgrounds including those which are not conformally Calabi--Yau, and goes beyond the usual linear approximation in three important ways: (i) we allow for finite flux; (ii) we consider perturbative higher-derivative corrections to the supergravity action; and (iii) we consider obstructions arising from higher-order deformations. Despite these extensions we find that the spectral sequence reproduces the na\"ive expectations that come from considering the effective superpotential in the small-flux limit. In particular, by writing the moduli in a form that is independent of the K\"ahler potential on the space of ECSs, and arguing the superpotential does not receive higher-derivative corrections, we show that the spectral sequence is perturbatively exact. Further, preliminary results show that a Tian--Todorov-like lemma implies that all the obstructions vanish. This has implications for the tadpole conjecture, showing that such perturbative, higher-order effects do not provide a way of circumventing the bound.</description>

      <title>Quantum Anatomy of Supersymmetric Black Holes in AdS Spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The entropy of the universe might decrease if black holes did not have entropy. Hawking's derivation of black hole temperature and the first law of thermodynamics suggest that black holes indeed have entropy. However, Einstein's classical gravity does not allow black holes to have internal degrees of freedom that entropy implies. Thus it is the central mission of quantum gravity to uncover the many quantum microstates of black holes. Via the AdS/CFT correspondence, black holes in Anti-de-Sitter (AdS) spacetimes are dual to ensembles of quantum states in conformal field theories (CFTs). Recently, the number of supersymmetric quantum states in CFTs has been counted to successfully account for the supersymmetric AdS black hole entropy. We take a step forward by studying properties of such supersymmetric quantum states dual to black holes. First, a supersymmetric AdS black hole may exist only if its charges obey a certain relation. We reproduce the same relation from a certain ensemble of the supersymmetric states in CFT. This gives a heuristic derivation of the supersymmetric black hole charge constraint for AdS black holes in $3$, $4$, $5$, and $7$ dimensions from the respective microscopic theories. Second, we find explicit expressions for the black hole cohomologies in the weakly coupled 4d maximal Super-Yang-Mills theory with gauge groups $SU(2)$ and $SU(3)$. These are connected to the actual microstates of quantum black holes in the 5-dimensional AdS spacetime.</description>

      <title>Microscopic entropy of static black holes in 3d Lovelock gravities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a microscopic derivation of the semi-classical entropy of static black holes in 3d Lovelock gravities, which are certain 3d Horndeski theories that were recently discovered from higher-dimensional Lovelock gravities via various methods and admit novel black hole solutions analogous to higher-dimensional ones. Assuming the ground state is described by the soliton obtained from the black hole solution by performing a double Wick rotation, we reproduce the semi-classical entropy from Cardy formula without central charges for the asymptotic growth of the number of states. We explain in detail how the mass of the soliton, which is needed in the Cardy formula, can be computed in the mini-superspace formalism.</description>

      <title>Response of interferometers to the vacuum of quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has recently been suggested that exotic quantum gravity effects could lead to large vacuum fluctuations, potentially observable with realistic detectors. Experiments are currently being built to search for these signals. Here we analyze the minimal model of quantum gravity at low energies -- the usual effective quantum field theory of gravitons -- and show that it unambiguously predicts an unobservably small variation in the measured interferometer length $\Delta L \sim \ell_{\rm pl} \sim 10^{-35}~{\rm m}$. Thus, detection of a large, gravitationally-induced length variation would signal a severe breakdown of effective quantum field theory in low energy quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Cosmology with non-conformal holographic matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effect on cosmological evolution of a strongly coupled quantum field that undergoes renormalization group flow from a UV CFT to an IR CFT. The field theory is defined by perturbation of a holographic CFT by a relevant operator associated with a bulk scalar field that evolves from a local maximum of its potential near the boundary to a local minimum of its potential deep in the bulk. By studying the gravity solutions dual to this theory on $\mathbb{R}^3 \times S^1$, we find that the equation of state parameter $w$ for the field theory has the conformal behavior $w=1/3$ for high and low temperatures, but dips to lower values for intermediate temperatures. Thus, at scales where the field theory has significant scale-dependence, its effect on cosmological evolution is intermediate between matter and radiation. Compared to the unperturbed UV CFT (which acts as radiation), the energy density experiences less dilution during the expansion as a result of the RG flow, and the rate of expansion is greater.</description>

      <title>Remote Hawking-Moss instanton and the Lorentzian path integral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hawking-Moss (HM) bounce solution implies that the tunneling amplitude between vacua is uniquely determined by the vacuum energy at the initial vacuum and the top of a potential barrier, regardless of the field distance between them $\Delta \phi$. This implausible conclusion was carefully discussed in [E. J. Weinberg, Phys. Rev. Lett. 98, 251303, (2007)], and it was concluded that the conventional HM amplitude is not reliable for a transition to the top of distant local maxima (hereinafter referred to as the remote HM transition). We revisit this issue and study the impact of the quantum tunneling effect on the remote HM transition. We demonstrate that the amplitude for such a distant transition is indeed smaller than the conventional HM amplitude by employing the Lorentzian path integral in a simple setup. We consider a linear potential, which allows for analytic treatments, and evaluate the up-tunneling probability of a homogeneous scalar field in de Sitter spacetime. The Picard-Lefschetz theory is employed to identify the relevant Lefschetz thimble, representing the relevant tunneling trajectory. We then compare the resulting transition amplitude with the conventional HM amplitude. We find that when the field separation $|\Delta \phi|$ is larger, the quantum-tunneling amplitude, estimated by our Lorentzian path integral, is smaller than that of the conventional HM amplitude. This implies that the transition amplitude may be significantly suppressed if the thermal interpretation is not applicable and the quantum-tunneling effect is dominant for the remote HM transition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a toy model to reproduce the fractal structure of kink and antikink collisions on one topological sector of $\phi^6$ theory. Using the toy model, we investigate the missing bounce windows observed in the fractal structure, and show that the coupling between two oscillation modes modulate the emergence of the missing bounce windows. By numerical calculation, we present that the two bounce resonance corresponds to the lower eigenfrequency of the toy model.</description>

      <title>The decoupling of moduli about the standard embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the cohomology of an elliptic differential complex arising from the infinitesimal moduli of heterotic string theory. We compute these cohomology groups at the standard embedding, and show that they decompose into a direct sum of cohomologies. While this is often assumed in the literature, it had not been explicitly demonstrated. Given a stable gauge bundle over a complex threefold with trivial canonical bundle and no holomorphic vector fields, we also show that the Euler characteristic of this differential complex is zero. This points towards a perfect obstruction theory for the heterotic moduli problem, at least for the most physically relevant compactifications.</description>

      <title>Modular flavored dark matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discrete flavor symmetries have been an appealing approach for explaining the observed flavor structure, which is not justified in the Standard Model (SM). Typically, these models require a so-called flavon field in order to give rise to the flavor structure upon the breaking of the flavor symmetry by the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of the flavon. Generally, in order to obtain the desired vacuum alignment, a flavon potential that includes additional so-called driving fields is required. On the other hand, allowing the flavor symmetry to be modular leads to a structure where the couplings are all holomorphic functions that depend only on a complex modulus, thus greatly reducing the number of parameters in the model. We show that these elements can be combined to simultaneously explain the flavor structure and dark matter (DM) relic abundance. We present a modular model with flavon vacuum alignment that allows for realistic flavor predictions while providing a successful fermionic DM candidate.</description>

Abstract: We show that the mass of a scalar field transforming in the fundamental of an $SU(N|N+1)$ supergroup internal symmetry is protected against one-loop corrections from quartic, gauge, and yukawa interactions. Although the negative-norm states responsible for this protection are likely fatal to a unitary interpretation of the theory, such ultraviolet insensitivity may open a new avenue to understanding the lightness of the Higgs.</description>

      <title>Signatures of Linearized Gravity in Atom Interferometers: a Simplified Computational Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a general framework for calculating the leading-order, fully-relativistic contributions to the gravitational phase shift in single-photon atom interferometers within the context of linearized gravity. We show that the atom gradiometer observable, which only depends on the atom interferometer propagation phase, can be written in terms of three distinct contributions: the Doppler phase shift, which accounts for the tidal displacement of atoms along the baseline, the Shapiro phase shift, which accounts for the delay in the arrival time of photons at atom-light interaction points, and the Einstein phase shift, which accounts for the gravitational redshift measured by the atoms. For specific atom gradiometer configurations, we derive the signal and response functions for two physically-motivated scenarios: ($i$) transient gravitational waves in the transverse-traceless gauge and, for the first time, in the proper detector frame, and ($ii$) transient massive objects sourcing weak and slow-varying Newtonian potentials. We find that the Doppler contribution of realistic Newtonian noise sources ($e.g.$, a freight truck or a piece of space debris) at proposed atom gradiometer experiments, such as AION, MAGIS and AEDGE, can exceed the shot noise level and thus affect physics searches if not properly subtracted.</description>

      <title>Finite time path field theory perturbative methods for local quantum spin chain quenches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss local magnetic field quenches using perturbative methods of finite time path field theory in the following spin chains: Ising and XY in a transverse magnetic field. Their common characteristics are: i) they are integrable via mapping to second quantized noninteracting fermion problem; ii) when the ground state is nondegenerate (true for finite chains except in special cases) it can be represented as a vacuum of Bogoliubov fermions. By switching on a local magnetic field perturbation at finite time, the problem becomes nonintegrable and must be approached via numeric or perturbative methods. Using the formalism of finite time path field theory based on Wigner transforms of projected functions, we show how to: i) calculate the basic "bubble" diagram in the Loschmidt echo of a quenched chain to any order in the perturbation; ii) resum the generalized Schwinger-Dyson equation for the fermion two point retarded functions in the "bubble" diagram, hence achieving the resummation of perturbative expansion of Loschmidt echo for a wide range of perturbation strengths under certain analiticity assumptions. Limitations of the assumptions and possible generalizations beyond it and also for other spin chains are further discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the equivariant K-theory of torus fixed points of Cherkis bow varieties of affine type A. We deduce formulas for the generating series of the Euler numbers of these varieties and observe their modularity in certain cases. We also obtain refined formulas on the motivic level for a class of bow varieties strictly containing Nakajima quiver varieties. These series hence generalise results of Nakajima-Yoshioka. As a special case, we obtain formulas for certain Zastava spaces. We define a parabolic analogue of Nekrasov's partition function and find an equation relating it to the classical partition function.</description>

      <title>Decoherence due to Casimir effect?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Open system dynamics of an electron is studied in the presence of radiation field, confined between two parallel conducting pates. It has been suggested in previous works that the quantized zero-point modes of this field lead to finite decoherence effects, possibly due to the Casimir force. However, in this work it is shown that the off-diagonal elements of the reduced density matrix of the electron are suppressed due to the sudden switching on of the interaction with the environment, and would not be observationally relevant in typical scenarios. The work clarifies important theoretical aspects of the setup and argues that any irreversible loss of coherence, in general, should not be ascribed to vacuum fluctuations. It can only originate from emission of bremsstrahlung by the electron, due to the acceleration caused by the effective Coulomb potential of all the infinite image charges.</description>

      <title>Krylov Complexity of Optical Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the Krylov complexity in quantum optical systems subject to time--dependent classical external fields. We focus on various interacting quantum optical models, including a collection of two--level atoms, photonic systems and the quenched oscillator. These models have Hamiltonians which are linear in the generators of $SU(2)$, $H(1)$ (Heisenberg--Weyl) and $SU(1,1)$ group symmetries allowing for a straightforward identification of the Krylov basis. We analyze the behaviour of complexity for these systems in different regimes of the driven field, focusing primarily on resonances. This is achieved via the Gauss decomposition of the unitary evolution operators for the group symmetries. Additionally, we also investigate the Krylov complexity in a three--level $SU(3)$ atomic system using the Lanczos algorithm, revealing the underlying complexity dynamics. Throughout we have exploited the the relevant group structures to simplify our explorations.</description>

      <title>Quasiperiodic arrangement of magnetodielectric $\delta$-plates: Green's functions and Casimir energies for $N$ bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a variety of finite quasiperiodic configurations with magnetodielectric $\delta$-function plates created from simple substitution rules. While previous studies for $N$ bodies involved interactions mediated by a scalar field, we extended our analysis of Green's function and corresponding Casimir energy to the electromagnetic field using plates with magnetic and dielectric properties for handling finite-size quasiperiodic lattices. The Casimir energy is computed for a class of quasiperiodic structures built from $N$ purely conducting or permeable $\delta$-plates. The Casimir energy of this quasiperiodic sequence of plates turns out to be either positive or negative, indicating that the pressure from the quantum vacuum tends to cause the stack of plates to expand or contract depending on their arrangement. We also handle the transverse electric and transverse magnetic mode Green's functions for $\delta$-plates and derive the Faddeev-like equation with the transition matrix for $N$ purely conducting or permeable plates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Euler characteristic of a very affine variety encodes the algebraic complexity of solving likelihood (or scattering) equations on this variety. We study this quantity for the Grassmannian with $d$ hyperplane sections removed. We provide a combinatorial formula, and explain how to compute this Euler characteristic in practice, both symbolically and numerically. Our particular focus is on generic hyperplane sections and on Schubert divisors. We also consider special Schubert arrangements relevant for physics. We study both the complex and the real case.</description>

      <title>Relativistic BEC extracted from a complex FRG flow equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on the functional renormalization group (FRG) under the local potential approximation, we analyze the Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) in the relativistic complex scalar theory. This framework leads to a complex flow equation of the effective potential, even with the well-known Litim regulator. In order to evaluate the condensate from such a complex effective potential, we impose a condition between chemical potential and mass, analogously to those in the free theory or the mean field theory. We elucidate that for the strongly (weakly) coupled theory, the phase diagrams computed from the FRG are more (less) deviated from that under the mean field approximation. This result implies that quantum fluctuations strongly affect the nonperturbative formation of the BEC.</description>

      <title>Curvature of an Arbitrary Surface for Discrete Gravity and for $d=2$ Pure Simplicial Complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a computation of curvature of arbitrary two-dimensional surfaces of three-dimensional objects, which is a contribution to discrete gravity with potential applications in network geometry. We begin by linking each point of the surface in question to its four closest neighbors, forming quads. We then focus on the simplices of $d=2$, or triangles embedded in these quads, which make up a pure simplicial complex with $d=2$. This allows us to numerically compute the local metric along with zweibeins, which subsequently leads to a derivation of discrete curvature defined at every triangle or face. We provide an efficient algorithm with $\mathcal{O}(N \log{N})$ complexity that first orients two-dimensional surfaces, solves the nonlinear system of equations of the spin-connections resulting from the torsion condition, and returns the value of curvature at each face.</description>

      <title>Local descriptions of the heterotic SU(3) moduli space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The heterotic $SU(3)$ system, also known as the Hull--Strominger system, arises from compactifications of heterotic string theory to six dimensions. This paper investigates the local structure of the moduli space of solutions to this system on a compact 6-manifold $X$, using a vector bundle $Q=(T^{1,0}X)^* \oplus {End}(E) \oplus T^{1,0}X$, where $E\to X$ is the classical gauge bundle arising in the system. We establish that the moduli space has an expected dimension of zero. We achieve this by studying the deformation complex associated to a differential operator $\bar{D}$, which emulates a holomorphic structure on $Q$, and demonstrating an isomorphism between the two cohomology groups which govern the infinitesimal deformations and obstructions in the deformation theory for the system. We also provide a Dolbeault-type theorem linking these cohomology groups to \v{C}ech cohomology, a result which might be of independent interest, as well as potentially valuable for future research.</description>

      <title>Memory burden effect mimics reheating signatures on SGWB from ultra-low mass PBH domination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultra-low mass primordial black holes (PBH), briefly dominating the expansion of the universe, would leave detectable imprints in the secondary stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB). Such a scenario leads to a characteristic doubly peaked spectrum of SGWB and strongly depends on the Hawking evaporation of such light PBHs. However, these observable signatures are significantly altered if the memory burden effect during the evaporation of PBHs is taken into account. We show that for the SGWB induced by PBH density fluctuations, the memory burden effects on the Hawking evaporation of ultra-low mass PBHs can mimic the signal arising due to the non-standard reheating epoch before PBH domination. Finally, we point out that this degeneracy can be broken by the simultaneous detection of the first peak in the SGWB, which is typically induced by the inflationary adiabatic perturbations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.00256v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have obtained charged asymptotically AdS black hole solutions in Einstein Gauss Bonnet gravity in presence of string cloud. It turns out that there exist three black holes in certain range of parameters for small enough chemical potential. However, for large chemical potential, these black holes merge into a single one. The free energy of the black holes is computed from the on shell Euclidean action by subtracting the contribution of an extremal black hole. We have studied the free energy and specific heat of the solutions, which shows that the medium sized black hole is unstable. As an application, we have studied the quark-antiquark potential in the dual gauge theory. This study provides necessary ingredients for study of the dual theories in the context of condensed matter systems.</description>

      <title>A Scaling Relation, $Z_m$-type Deconfinement Phases and Imaginary Chemical Potentials in Finite Temperature Large-$N$ Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10672v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the effective potentials for the Polyakov loops in finite temperature SU$(N)$ gauge theories obey a certain scaling relation with respect to temperature in the large-$N$ limit. This scaling relation strongly constrains the possible terms in the Polyakov loop effective potentials. Moreover, by using the effective potentials in the presence of imaginary chemical potentials or imaginary angular velocities in several models, we find that phase transitions to $Z_m$-type deconfinement phases ($Z_m$ phase) occur, where the eigenvalues of the Polyakov loop are distributed $Z_m$ symmetrically. Physical quantities in the $Z_m$ phase obey the scaling properties of the effective potential. The models include Yang-Mills (YM) theories, the bosonic BFSS matrix model and ${\mathcal N}=4$ supersymmetric YM theory on $S^3$. Thus, the phase diagrams of large-$N$ gauge theories with imaginary chemical potentials are very rich and the stable $Z_m$ phase would be ubiquitous. Monte-Carlo calculations also support this. As a related topic, we discuss the phase diagrams of large-$N$ YM theories with real angular velocities in finite volume spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06165v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we evaluate the one loop partition function of a scalar field in the near horizon geometry of the extremal Reissner Nordstr\"{o}m black hole from an infinite product over quasinormal modes using the Denef-Hartnoll-Sachdev (DHS) formula. We show that, the logarithmic divergent term of the one loop partition function computed using the DHS formula agrees with the heat kernel method. Using the same formula, we also evaluate the one loop partition function of scalar field in the near extremal Kerr Newman black hole and observe that it reduces to the same in the near horizon $AdS_2\times S^2$ geometry of the extremal Reissner Nordstr\"{o}m black hole when the angular velocity at the horizon is tuned to $2\pi T_{BH}$ value. We observe that, for higher spin fields, the mode functions become irregular at the horizon for certain quasinormal frequencies and therefore we remove them to obtain the one loop determinant.</description>

Abstract: Not much is known about superstring scattering amplitudes in curved backgrounds. Using the hybrid formalism in $\rm AdS_3 \times S^3$ with pure NS-NS three-form flux, we compute a $\rm PSU(1,1|2)$-covariant three-point amplitude for half-BPS vertex operators inserted in the $\rm AdS_3$ boundary and show that it agrees with the RNS computation. The zero-mode prescription for the fermions in $\rm AdS$ is defined in terms of the ``standard'' spacetime SUSY generator. It is found that integrating out the fermionic worldsheet fields in the path integral gives rise to the target-space vielbein, which explicitly encodes that the conformal group on the boundary is identified with the symmetry group of the $\rm AdS$ bulk.</description>

      <title>CMB Implications of Multi-field Axio-dilaton Cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10820v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Axio-dilaton models are among the simplest scalar-tensor theories that contain the two-derivative interactions that naturally compete at low energies with the two-derivative inter-actions of General Relativity. Such models are well-motivated as the low energy fields arising from string theory compactification. We summarize these motivations and compute their cosmological evolution, in which the dilaton acts as dark energy and its evolution provides a framework for dynamically evolving particle masses. The derivative axion-dilaton couplings play an important role in the success of these cosmologies. We derive the equations for fluctuations needed to study their implications for the CMB anisotropy, matter spectra and structure growth. We use a modified Boltzmann code to study in detail four benchmark parameter choices, including the vanilla Yoga model, and identify couplings that give viable cosmologies, including some with surprisingly large matter-scalar interactions. The axion has negligible potential for most of the cosmologies we consider but we also examine a simplified model for which the axion potential plays a role, using axion-matter couplings motivated by phenomenological screening considerations. We find such choices can also lead to viable cosmologies.</description>

      <title>Quantizing Galilean spacetime: a reconstruction of Maxwell's equations in empty space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.11380v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As was recently shown, non-relativistic quantum theory can be derived by means of a projection method from a continuum of classical solutions for (massive) particles. In this paper we show that Maxwell's equations in empty space can be derived using the same method. In this case the starting point is a continuum of solutions of equations of motion for massless particles describing the structure of Galilean space-time. As a result of the projection, the space-time structure itself is changed by the appearance of a new fundamental constant $c$ with the dimension of a velocity. This maximum velocity $c$, derived here for massless particles, is analogous to the accuracy limit $\hbar$ derived earlier for massive particles. The projection method can thus be interpreted as a generalized quantization. We suspect that all fundamental fields can be traced back to continuous sets of particle trajectories, and that in this sense the particle concept is more fundamental than the field concept.</description>

Abstract: Cold-atom analog experiments are a promising new tool for studying relativistic vacuum decay, enabling one to empirically probe early-Universe theories in the laboratory. However, existing proposals place stringent requirements on the atomic scattering lengths that are challenging to realize experimentally. Here we eliminate these restrictions and show that any stable mixture between two states of a bosonic isotope can be used as a faithful relativistic analog. This greatly expands the landscape of suitable experiments, and will expedite efforts to study vacuum decay with cold atoms.</description>

Abstract: The static QCD force from the lattice can be used to extract $\Lambda_{\overline{\textrm{MS}}}$, which determines the running of the strong coupling. Usually, this is done with a numerical derivative of the static potential. However, this introduces additional systematic uncertainties; thus, we use another observable to measure the static force directly. This observable consists of a Wilson loop with a chromoelectric field insertion. We work in the pure SU(3) gauge theory. We use gradient flow to improve the signal-to-noise ratio and to address the field insertion. We extract $\Lambda_{\overline{\textrm{MS}}}^{n_f=0}$ from the data by exploring different methods to perform the zero-flow-time limit. We obtain the value $\sqrt{8t_0} \Lambda_{\overline{\textrm{MS}}}^{n_f=0} =0.629^{+22}_{-26}$, where $t_0$ is a flow-time reference scale. We also obtain precise determinations of several scales: $r_0/r_1$, $\sqrt{8 t_0}/r_0$, $\sqrt{8 t_0}/r_1$ and we compare these to the literature. The gradient flow appears to be a promising method for calculations of Wilson loops with chromoelectric and chromomagnetic insertions in quenched and unquenched configurations</description>

      <title>Using gravitational waves to see the first second of the Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04388v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves are a unique probe of the early Universe, as the Universe is transparent to gravitational radiation right back to the end of inflation. In this article, we summarise detection prospects and the wide scope of primordial events that could lead to a detectable stochastic gravitational wave background. Any such background would shed light on what lies beyond the Standard Model, sometimes at remarkably high scales. We overview the range of strategies for detecting a stochastic gravitational wave background before delving deep into three major primordial events that can source such a background. Finally, we summarize the landscape of other sources of primordial backgrounds.</description>

      <title>An algebraic approach to gravitational quantum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17626v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most approaches towards a quantum theory of gravitation indicate the existence of a minimal length scale of the order of the Planck length. Quantum mechanical models incorporating such an intrinsic length scale call for a deformation of Heisenberg's algebra resulting in a generalized uncertainty principle and constitute what is called gravitational quantum mechanics. Utilizing the position representation of this deformed algebra, we study various models of gravitational quantum mechanics. The free time evolution of a Gaussian wave packet is investigated as well as the spectral properties of a particle bound by an external attractive potential. Here the cases of a box with infinite walls and an attractive potential well of finite depth are considered.</description>

      <title>Entanglement production through a cosmological bounce</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11296v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In quantum cosmology, it is expected that the Big Bang singularity is resolved and the universe undergoes a bounce. We find that for Gaussian initial states, matter-gravity entanglement entropy rises rapidly during the bounce, declines, and then approaches a steady-state value following the bounce. These observations suggest that matter-gravity entanglement is a feature of the macroscopic universe and that there is no Second Law of entanglement entropy.</description>

      <title>Future singularity in an anisotropic universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18368v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate future singularities originating from the anisotropy in the Universe. We formulate a new class of singularities in the homogeneous and anisotropic universe, comparing them with the known singularities in the homogeneous and isotropic universe. We also discuss the physical consequences of the new singularities. Moreover, we develop a novel reconstruction method for the anisotropic universe by introducing four scalar fields to reconstruct cosmological models in which future singularities appear. We present an explicit example where the anisotropy may grow in the future up to singularity.</description>

      <title>Conformal BK equation at QCD Wilson-Fisher point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08660v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-energy scattering in pQCD in the Regge limit is described by the evolution of Wilson lines governed by the BK equation. In the leading order, the BK equation is conformally invariant and the eigenfunctions of the linearized BFKL equation are powers. It is a common belief that at $d\neq 4$ the BFKL equation is useless since unlike $d=4$ case it cannot be solved by usual methods. However, we demonstrate that at critical Wilson-Fisher point of QCD the relevant part of NLO BK restores the conformal invariance so the solutions are again powers. As a check of our approach to high-energy amplitudes at the Wilson-Fisher point, we calculate the anomalous dimensions of twist-2 light-ray operators in the Regge limit $j\rightarrow 1$.}</description>

      <title>Degenerate and irregular topological recursion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02608v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the theory of $x-y$ duality to propose a new definition / construction for the correlation differentials of topological recursion; we call it "generalized topological recursion". This new definition coincides with the original topological recursion of Chekhov-Eynard-Orantin in the regular case and allows, in particular, to get meaningful answers in a variety of irregular and degenerate situations.</description>

      <title>Local renormalisation from causal loop-tree duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17319v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report recent progress on the development of a local renormalisation formalism based on causal loop-tree duality (cLTD). By performing an expansion around the UV-propagator in an Euclidean space, we manage to build counter-terms to cancel the non-integrable terms in the UV limit. This procedure is then combined with the so-called causal representation, and the UV expansion is performed at the level of on-shell energies. The resulting expressions are more compact, and they retain nice properties of the original causal representation. The proposed formalism is tested up to three-loops, with relevant families of topologies. In all the cases, we successfully cancel the UV divergences and achieve a smooth numerical implementation. These results constitute a first step towards a new renormalisation program in four space-time dimensions (by-passing DREG), perfectly suitable for fully numerical simulations.</description>
