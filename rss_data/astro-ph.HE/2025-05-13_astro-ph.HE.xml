      <title>Surprising Variation of Gamma Rays from the Sun over the Solar Cycle Revealed with Fermi-LAT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The steady-state gamma-ray emission from the Sun is thought to consist of two emission components due to interactions with Galactic cosmic rays: (1) a hadronic component covering the solar disk, and (2) a leptonic component peaking at the solar edge and extending into the heliosphere. The flux of these components is expected to vary with the 11-year solar cycle, being highest during solar minimum and lowest during solar maximum, because it is correlated with the cosmic-ray flux. No study has yet analyzed the flux variation of the two components separately over solar cycles.
  In this work, we measure the temporal variations of the flux of each component over 15 years of Fermi Large Area Telescope observations and compare them with the sunspot number and Galactic cosmic-ray flux from AMS-02 near the Earth.
  We find that the flux variation of the disk anticorrelates with solar activity and correlates with cosmic-ray protons, confirming its emission mechanism. The flux variation of the extended component anticorrelates with solar activity only until mid 2012. After that, we no longer observe any correlation or anticorrelation, even with the CR electron flux. This most likely suggests that cosmic-ray transport and modulation in the inner heliosphere are unexpectedly complex and different for electrons and protons or, alternatively, the presence of an additional, unknown component of gamma rays or cosmic rays.
  These findings impact space weather research and emphasize the need for close monitoring of Cycle 25 and the ongoing polarity reversal.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Two Models for the Angular Structure of the Outflows Producing the Swift/XRT "Larger-Angle Emission" of Gamma-Ray Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The instantaneous emission from a relativistic surface endowed with a Lorentz factor $\Gamma$ that decreases away from the outflow symmetry axis can naturally explain the three phases observed by Swift/XRT in GRBs and their afterglows (GRB tail, afterglow plateau and post-plateau).
  We expand the analytical formalism of the "Larger-Angle Emission" model previously developed for "Power-Law" outflows to "n-Exponential" outflows (e.g. exponential with $n=1$ and Gaussian with $n=2$) and compare their abilities to account for the X-ray emission of XRT afterglows.
  We assume power-law $\Gamma$-dependences of two spectral characteristics (peak-energy and peak intensity) and find that, unlike Power-Law outflows, n-Exponential outflows cannot account for plateaus with a temporal dynamical range larger than 100.
  To include all information existing in the Swift/XRT measurements of X-ray aferglows (0.3-10 keV unabsorbed flux and effective spectral slope), we calculate 0.3 keV and 10 keV light-curves using a broken power-law emission spectrum of peak-energy and low-and high-energy slopes that are derived from the effective slope measured by XRT. This economical peak-energy determination is found to be consistent with more expensive spectral fits.
  The angular distributions of the Lorentz factor, comoving frame peak-energy, and peak-intensity ($\Gamma (\theta), E'_p (\theta), i'_p(\theta)$) constrain the (yet-to-be determined) convolution of various features of the production of relativistic jets by solar-mass black-holes and of their propagation through the progenitor/circumburst medium, while the $E'_p (\Gamma)$ and $i'_p (\Gamma)$ dependences may constrain the GRB dissipation mechanism and the GRB emission process.</description>

      <title>Softness Ratio of SWIFT Gamma-ray Bursts and Relevant Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The properties of X-ray flashes (XRFs) and X-ray rich gamma-ray bursts (XRRs) as compared with classical gamma-ray bursts (C-GRBs) have been widely discussed during the \emph{Swift} era. It has been proposed that XRFs and XRRs are low-energy extensions of the GRB population so that they should follow similar correlations. To further examine this idea, we collect a sample of $303$ GRBs detected by \emph{Swift} over the past two decades, all of which have reliable redshifts and spectral parameters. The bursts are classified into XRFs, XRRs, and C-GRBs based on their softness ratio (SR), which is calculated by dividing the $25-50$ keV fluence with the $50-100$ keV fluence. A strong correlation is found among the isotropic energy $E_{\mathrm{iso}}$, peak luminosity $L_{\mathrm{p}}$, and rest frame burst duration $T_{90, \mathrm{rest}}$, i.e., $E_{\mathrm{iso}} \propto L_{\mathrm{p}}^{0.88\pm0.02} T_{90, \mathrm{rest}}^{0.58\pm0.02}$. Additionally, two tight three-parameter correlations involving SR and the rest-frame peak energy $E_{\mathrm{p}}$ are also derived, i.e. $E_{\mathrm{p}} \propto E_{\mathrm{iso}}^{0.20\pm0.02} \mathrm{SR}^{-2.27\pm0.15}$ and $E_{\mathrm{p}} \propto L_{\mathrm{p}}^{0.17\pm0.02} \mathrm{SR}^{-2.33\pm0.14}$. It is interesting to note that XRFs, XRRs, and C-GRBs all follow the above correlations. The implications of these correlations and their potential application in cosmology are discussed.</description>

      <title>Systematic Investigation into Radio Supernovae with Markov Chain Monte Carlo Analysis: Implications for Massive Stars' Mass Loss and Shock Acceleration Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic analysis of radio supernovae (SNe) to investigate the statistical tendencies of SN progenitors' mass-loss rates and shock acceleration efficiencies. We conduct parameter estimation through Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis for 32 radio SN samples with a clear peak observed in their light curves, and successfully fit 27 objects with the widely-used radio SN model. We find the inferred mass-loss rates of stripped-envelope SN progenitors are by an order of magnitude greater ($\sim 10^{-3}\,M_\odot{\rm yr}^{-1}$) than those of SN II progenitors ($&lt;10^{-4}\,M_\odot{\rm yr}^{-1}$). The efficiencies of electron acceleration and magnetic field amplification are found to be less than $10^{-2}$, and the possibility of their energy equipartition is not ruled out. On the other hand, we find the following two properties that might be related to limitations of the standard model for radio SNe; one is the extremely high magnetic field amplification efficiency, and the other is the shallower density gradient of the outer ejecta. We suggest the new interpretation that these peculiar results are misleading due to the setup that is not included in our model, and we identify the missing setup as a dense CSM in the vicinity of the progenitor. This means that a large fraction of radio SN progenitors might possess dense CSM in the vicinity of the progenitor, which is not smoothly connected with the outer CSM.</description>

      <title>Mastering 3D-detection of Extensive Air Showers in Cherenkov Light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new SPHERE seires complex extensive air showers detector is under development. The main goal of its mission is to study the mass composition of cosmic ray nuclei in the 1-100 PeV energy range at a new level. The already well-established telescope of Cherenkov light reflected from the snow-covered ice surface of Lake Baikal from an altitude of 500-1000 m will be supported by a detector of direct light pointed upward. Since the two detectors will study the same shower at different stages of its development, it could be called a 3D detection, which is completely new for the EAS method. The development is based on an extensive MC modeling of the shower and the detection process using the Supercomputer Complex of the Lomonosov Moscow State University.</description>

      <title>Non-ideal stability analysis of differentially rotating plasmas with global curvature effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The linear stability of global non-axisymmetric modes in differentially rotating, magnetized, non-ideal plasma is crucial for understanding turbulence and transport phenomena. We investigate the competition between the local Magneto-Rotational Instability (MRI) and the Magneto-Curvature Instability (MCI)--a distinct non-axisymmetric low-frequency curvature-driven global branch--by developing and applying a non-ideal global spectral method, validated against NIMROD code simulations, and an extended effective potential formalism. Our analysis reveals that the global, low-frequency MCI persists at low magnetic Reynolds numbers (Rm), whereas the localized, high-frequency MRI is stabilized by diffusive broadening of its structure around its Alfv\'enic resonances. Consequently, we identify the global MCI as the primary onset mechanism for magnetohydrodynamic instability in systems with finite curvature, e.g., astrophysical rotators. We establish distinct parameter regimes for mode dominance: MCI prevails in geometrically moderate-thickness disks with high curvature and intermediate radial gaps, while MRI dominates in thin, low-curvature disks with large radial gaps. Mode competition is also highly sensitive to the flow profile, particularly vorticity and its gradient, with non-uniform shear profiles exhibiting more robust instability due to flow-curvature and shear contributions. A key outcome is the development of "spectral diagrams" derived from the global spectral method. These diagrams comprehensively map dominant instabilities and their characteristics, offering a predictive tool for critical onset parameters (i.e., flow curvature, magnetic field, and Rm) and facilitating the interpretation of experimental and simulation results. Notably, these diagrams demonstrate that the global MCI is generally the sole unstable mode at the initial onset of instability.</description>

      <title>Patterns of X-ray and $\gamma$-ray Flares: from Blazar to Maganetar and Sun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using Gaussian process methods, we analyzed the light curves of three extreme solar X-ray flares observed by the RHESSI satellite. Their variability characteristics were then compared with those of HXMT-HE X-ray burst (XRB; in SGR 1935+2154) associated with fast radio burst (FRB) 200428 and blazar $\gamma$-ray giant flares, to investigate the origins of these extreme flaring events. The variability patterns of the solar X-ray flares follow the stochastically driven damped simple harmonic oscillator (SHO) model. The derived timescales $t_{\rm B\underline{} steep}$ and $t_{\rm B\underline{~} flat}$ (corresponding to PSD breaks) are in the range of 4-7 s and 16-53 s, respectively. The FRB-associated HXMT-HE burst has a $Q$ value near 0.3, matching those of the solar flares occurred on 23 July 2002 (flare 1) and 3 November 2003 (flare 2). By contrast, blazar $\gamma$-ray giant flares show $Q &gt;$ 0.3, similar to the solar flare occurred on 25 February 2014 (flare 3). We proposed that the critically damped state of the system may be the condition triggering the association between the XRB in SGR 1935+2154 and the FRB. In this scenario, the critical damping $Q$ value of the system is around 0.3, not the theoretical 0.5. The similarity in $Q$ values might imply that the FRB-associated HXMT-HE XRB and solar X-ray flares 1 $\&amp;$ 2 share comparable dynamic behavior, while blazar $\gamma$-ray flares and solar X-ray flare 3 exhibit another distinct but similar dynamic behavior. Like solar X-ray flares, these extreme flares may all be related to the magnetic reconnection process.</description>

      <title>Black Hole Envelopes in Little Red Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations by the James Webb Space Telescope have uncovered a population of compact, red object ($z\sim 4\text{--}7$) known as little red dots (LRDs). The presence of broad Balmer emission lines indicates active galactic nuclei powered by supermassive black holes (BHs), while LRDs exhibit unusually weak X-ray and radio emission and low variability, suggesting super-Eddington accretion that obscures the central engine. We suggest that such an extreme accretion disc inevitably drives strong outflows, which would disrupt the LRDs themselves unless confined within the nuclear region -- posing a general feedback problem for overmassive BHs. To resolve this, we propose that the BH is embedded in a massive, optically thick envelope that gravitationally confines the outflow, making any outflow a no-go. This envelope, powered by accretion on to the BH, radiates at nearly the Eddington limit, and is sustained by an infall of the interstellar medium at a rate on the order of $\sim 1 M_{\odot}~{\rm yr}^{-1}$. A photosphere emerges either within the envelope or in the infalling medium, with a characteristic temperature of $5000$ - $7000 {\rm K}$, near the Hayashi limit. The resulting blackbody emission naturally explains the red optical continuum of the distinct V-shaped spectrum observed in most LRDs. Furthermore, the dynamical time-scale at the photosphere, $\sim 0.01~{\rm pc}$, is consistent with the observed year-scale variabilities. The nuclear structure and spectral features of LRDs are shaped by this envelope, which not only regulates feedback but also acts as a gas reservoir that sustains rapid BH growth in the early universe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is a brief review of the recent progress in understanding the evolution of the accretion disks in tidal disruption events (TDEs). Special attention is paid to (1) thermal-viscous instability that causes the disk to transition from a thick state to a thin one, and back and forth, (2) interactions between the fallback material and existing disk. Challenges to the current model from late-time X-ray observations are highlighted and possible solutions are discussed.</description>

      <title>Estimating the Lensing Probability for Binary Black Hole Mergers in AGN disk by Using Mismatch Threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar-mass binary black holes (BBH) may form, evolve, and merge within the dense environments of active galactic nuclei (AGN) disks, thereby contributing to the BBH population detected by gravitational wave (GW) observatories. Mergers occurring in AGN disks may be gravitationally lensed by the supermassive black hole at the AGN centre. The probability of such lensing events has been approximately estimated by using the Einstein criterion in previous work. However, a more reasonable approach to calculating the lensing probability should be based on whether the detector can distinguish the lensed GW waveform from the unlensed one. In this work, we calculate the lensing probability of LIGO sources embedded in AGN disk by relating threshold mismatch to the signal-to-noise ratio of the observed events. For the sensitivity of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA O3 observation runs, our results indicate that the lensing probability is several times higher than previous estimates. If AGNs are indeed the primary formation channel for BBHs, we could quantify the probability of detecting the lensed GW events in such a scenario. The non-detections, on the other hand, will place stricter constraints on the fraction of AGN disk BBHs and even the birthplaces of BBH mergers.</description>

      <title>Tracing the evolution of eccentric precessing binary black holes: a hybrid approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To describe a general bound binary black hole system, we need to consider orbital eccentricity and the misalignment of black holes' spin vectors with respect to the orbital angular momentum. While binary black holes produced through many formation channels have negligible eccentricity close to merger, they often have a non-negligible eccentricity at formation, and dynamical interactions could produce binaries with non-negligible eccentricity in the bands of current and proposed gravitational-wave (GW) detectors. Another quantity that carries information about the formation channel is the angle between each black hole's spin vector and the binary's orbital angular momentum (referred to as the spin tilt) at formation. The spin tilts inferred in GW astronomy are usually those when the binary is in the band of a GW detector, but these can differ significantly from those at formation. Therefore, it is necessary to evolve the binary back in time to compute the tilts at formation. For many formation scenarios, the tilts in the formal limit of infinite orbital angular momentum, also known as tilts at infinity, are a good approximation to those at formation. We thus generalize the publicly available \texttt{tilts\_at\_infinity} code to compute the tilts at infinity for eccentric, spin-precessing binaries. This code employs hybrid post-Newtonian evolution, starting with orbit-averaged evolution for higher frequencies and then transitioning to precession-averaged evolution to compute the tilts at infinity. We find that the transition frequency used in the quasicircular case still gives acceptably small errors in the eccentric case, and show that eccentricity and hybrid evolution both have a significant effect on the tilts at infinity for many binaries. Finally, we give examples of cases where the tilts at infinity are and are not a good approximation to the tilts at formation in the eccentric case.</description>

      <title>Iterative Relaxation Method to Obtain Global Transonic Flows around Compact Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flows around compact objects are necessarily transonic. Due to their dissipative nature, finding of sonic points is not trivial. Becker and Le in 2003 (BL03) proposed a novel methodology to obtain global transonic solutions, using iterative relaxation technique and exploiting the inner boundary conditions of the central object. In the current work, we propose a generic methodology -- IRM-SP and IRM-SHOCK to obtain any class of global accretion and wind solutions, given a set of constants of motion. We have considered viscosity in the system, which transports angular momentum outwards. In addition, it heats the system. Radiative processes like bremsstrahlung which cools the system is also incorporated. An interplay between heating and cooling process, along with gravity and centrifugal forces gives rise to multiple sonic points and hence shocks. The proposed methodology successfully generates any class of accretion as well as wind solutions, allowing us to unify them. Additionally, we report here rigorously the mathematical as well as the computational algorithm needed, to find sonic point(s) and thus obtain global transonic flows around compact objects.</description>

      <title>Zooming into the neutrino-associated blazar candidate J1718+4239</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The radio quasar NVSS~J171822+423948 (J1718+4239) was proposed as the counterpart of the IceCube neutrino event IC-201221A. To reveal the nature of the source, we conducted new very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations of this blazar candidate with the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA). The observations were carried out in dual-band mode between $4$ and $7$~GHz. Archival radio data from the literature were also collected for comparison. Our analysis revealed highly variable, Doppler-boosted radio emission of the source, with compact structure at both kpc and pc scales, a slightly inverted spectrum, and a maximum jet inclination angle of $\theta\le5\degr$. These results confirm J1718+4239 as a blazar-type object.</description>

      <title>Traces of wobbling accretion disk in X-ray pulsar Her X-1 from observations of the ART-XC telescope of the SRG observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long uninterrupted observations of the X-ray binary system Her X-1 were performed with the Mikhail Pavlinsky ART-XC telescope of the Spectrum-R\"ontgen-Gamma (SRG) X-ray Observatory in the 4--25 keV energy range with a total exposure of about two days around the main turn-on of the X-ray source. We present the results of timing and spectral analysis of these observations. The opening of the X-ray source is determined to occur at the orbital phase $\phi_{b}\approx 0.25$. The analysis of the X-ray light curve reveals a first direct observational evidence of the nutation of a tilted precessing accretion disk with a period of $\simeq0.87$ days. The appearance of X-ray pulsations near the orbital phase $\phi_{b}\simeq 0.77$ prior to the main turn-on at the maximum of the nutation variability has been also detected. During the X-ray eclipse, a non-zero X-ray flux is measured, which is presumably associated with scattering of an X-ray emission in a hot corona around the optical star illuminated by the X-rays from the central neutron star. An increase in the X-ray flux after the main turn-on can be described by the passage of the radiation from the central source through a scattering corona above the precessing accretion disk.</description>

      <title>Thermal and Kinematic Properties of Ejecta in SN1987A revealed by XRISM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis of high-resolution spectra from the shock-heated plasmas in SN~1987A, based on an observation using the Resolve instrument onboard the X-Ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission (XRISM).The 1.7--10 keV Resolve spectra are accurately represented by a single component, plane-parallel shock plasma model, with a temperature of $2.84_{-0.08}^{+0.09}$ keV and an ionization parameter of $2.64_{-0.45}^{+0.58} \times 10^{11}$ s cm$^{-3}$.The Resolve spectra are also well reproduced by the 3-D magneto-hydrodynamic simulation presented by Orlando et al. (2020) suggesting substantial contribution from the ejecta.The metal abundances obtained with Resolve align with the LMC value, indicating that the X-rays in 2024 originate from non-metal-rich shock-heated ejecta and the reverse shock has not reached the inner metal-rich region of ejecta.Doppler widths of the atomic lines from Si, S, and Fe correspond to velocities of 1,500--1,700 km s$^{-1}$, where the thermal broadening effects in this non-metal-rich plasma are negligible. Therefore, the line broadening seen in Resolve spectra is determined by the large bulk motion of ejecta. For reference, we determined a 90\% upper limit on non-thermal emission from a pulsar wind nebula at $4.3 \times 10^{-13}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ in the 2 -- 10 keV range, aligning with NuSTAR findings by Greco et al. (2022). Additionally, we searched for the $^{44}$Sc K line feature and found a $1\sigma$ upper limit of $1.0 \times 10^{-6}$ photons cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, which translates to an initial $^{44}$Ti mass of approximately $2 \times 10^{-4} M_{\odot}$, consistent with previous X-ray to soft gamma-ray observations (Boggs et al. 2015; Grebenev et al. 2012; Leising 2006).</description>

      <title>EP241021a: a months-duration X-ray transient with luminous optical and radio emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the discovery of a peculiar X-ray transient, EP241021a, by the Einstein Probe (EP) mission, and the results from multiwavelength follow-up observations. The transient was first detected with the Wide-field X-ray Telescope as an intense flare lasting for ~100 s, reaching a luminosity of L_(0.5-4 keV)~10^48 erg/s at z=0.748. Further observations with EP's Follow-up X-ray Telescope reveal a huge drop in the X-ray flux by a factor of &gt;1000 within 1.5 days. After maintaining a nearly plateau phase for ~7 days, the X-ray flux declines as t^-1.2 over a period of ~30 days, followed by a sudden decrease to an undetectable level by EP and XMM-Newton, making it the longest afterglow emission detected among known fast X-ray transients. A bright counterpart at optical and radio wavelengths was also detected, with high peak luminosities in excess of 10^44 erg/s and 10^41 erg/s, respectively. In addition, EP241021a exhibits a non-thermal X-ray spectrum, red optical color, X-ray and optical rebrightenings in the light curves, and fast radio spectral evolution, suggesting that relativistic jets may have been launched. We discuss possible origins of EP241021a, including a choked jet with supernova shock breakout, a merger-triggered magnetar, a highly structured jet, and a repeating partial tidal disruption event involving an intermediate-mass black hole, but none can perfectly explain the multiwavelength properties. EP241021a may represent a new type of X-ray transients with months-duration evolution timescales, and future EP detections and follow-up observations of similar systems will provide statistical samples to understand the underlying mechanisms at work.</description>

      <title>Towards holographic color superconductivity in QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the holographic V-QCD model by introducing a charged scalar field sector to represent the condensation of paired quark matter in the deconfined phase. By incorporating this new sector into the previously established framework for nuclear and quark matter, we obtain a phase diagram that, in addition to the first-order deconfinement transition and its critical end-point, also features a second-order transition between paired and unpaired quark matter. The critical temperature for quark pairing exhibits only a mild dependence on the chemical potential and can reach values as high as $T_\mathrm{crit} \approx 30~\rm MeV$. Comparison of the growth rate for the formation of homogeneous paired phases to the growth rate of previously discovered modulated phases suggests that the former is subdominant to the latter.</description>

      <title>Disruptions of stars and binary systems on chaotic orbits in the axisymmetric Milky Way center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-spherical potentials allow a wide range of trajectories, both regular and chaotic, whose periapse distances can vary orbit to orbit. In particular chaotic trajectories can bring a system arbitrarily close to the central massive black hole leading to a disruption. In this paper, we work with an observationally benchmarked model of the innermost 200 pc of the Milky Way and show that low z-angular momentum trajectories are commonly chaotic. We compute the timescales and properties of close pericenter passages, and compare the implied collisionless disruption rate to the well-studied collisional rate from 2-body scatterings. We find that the relative collisionless rate can dominate by orders of magnitude. Our calculations are relevant for a wide range of disruption phenomena, including the production of hypervelocity stars (HVSs) and tidal disruption events (TDEs). Most of these disruptions involve stars come from the Nuclear Stellar Cluster, with a pericenter distribution that strongly favours shallow encounters, and a preference for high inclination interactions. The latter implies that unbound disrupted material - whether ejected stars or stellar debris - would be preferentially directed towards the galactic poles. Many of our conclusions apply generally to any galaxy with a non-spherical galactic centre potential and central massive black hole.</description>

      <title>Submillimeter observations of the white dwarf pulsar AR Sco</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AR Scorpii, the so called white dwarf pulsar, contains a rapidly rotating magnetic white dwarf (WD; Pspin = 117.0564 s) interacting with a cool, red dwarf (RD) companion in a 3.56 hour orbit. It is a strong radio source with an inverted spectral index between 1-200 GHz that is indicative of synchrotron emission. This paper presents the first submillimeter observations of AR Scorpii using the Submillimeter Array, helping to fill a critical gap in the spectral energy distribution between 10-600 GHz. The average flux densities at 220 and 345 GHz are 124 and 86 mJy, respectively. The lower than expected flux density at 345 GHz suggests a break in the synchrotron emission at about 200 GHz. A periodogram analysis of the 220 GHz observations shows a modulation with an amplitude of ~6% at a period of 58.26 s or at twice the spin frequency of the white dwarf. This modulation is the first direct detection of the WD spin period at radio frequencies and implies that the synchrotron emission arises near the WD and and not from an interaction with the photosphere of the RD. A fit to the spectral energy distribution shows that the synchrotron emission arises from a small, low density region with a magnetic field of 43 MG at a distance of 0.6 orbital radii from the WD. This result implies that AR Scorpii contains a weakly magnetic WD (~15 MG) and not a strongly magnetic WD (~500 MG) as previously asserted.</description>

      <title>Constraining gas motion and non-thermal pressure beyond the core of the Abell 2029 galaxy cluster with XRISM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a detailed spectroscopic study of the gas dynamics and hydrostatic mass bias of the galaxy cluster Abell 2029, utilizing high-resolution observations from XRISM Resolve. Abell 2029, known for its cool core and relaxed X-ray morphology, provides an excellent opportunity to investigate the influence of gas motions beyond the central region. Expanding upon prior studies that revealed low turbulence and bulk motions within the core, our analysis covers regions out to the scale radius $R_{2500}$ (670~kpc) based on three radial pointings extending from the cluster center toward the northern side. We obtain accurate measurements of bulk and turbulent velocities along the line of sight. The results indicate that non-thermal pressure accounts for no more than 2% of the total pressure at all radii, with a gradual decrease outward. The observed radial trend differs from many numerical simulations, which often predict an increase in non-thermal pressure fraction at larger radii. These findings suggest that deviations from hydrostatic equilibrium are small, leading to a hydrostatic mass bias of around 2% across the observed area.</description>

      <title>Superluminal Motion and Jet Parameters in the High-Redshift Blazar J1429+5406</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the relativistic jet of the powerful radio-emitting blazar J1429+5406 at redshift z=3.015. Our understanding of jet kinematics in z&gt;3 quasars is still rather limited, based on a sample of less than about 50 objects. The blazar J1429+5406 was observed at a high angular resolution using the method of very long baseline interferometry over more than two decades, between 1994 and 2018. These observations were conducted at five radio frequencies, covering a wide range from 1.7 to 15 GHz. The outer jet components at ~20-40 milliarcsecond (mas) separations from the core do not show discernible apparent motion. On the other hand, three jet components within the central 10 mas region exhibit significant proper motion in the range of (0.045-0.16)mas/year, including one that is among the fastest-moving jet components at z&gt;3 known to date. Based on the proper motion of the innermost jet component and the measured brightness temperature of the core, we estimated the Doppler factor, the bulk Lorentz factor, and the inclination angle of the jet with respect to the line of sight. The core brightness temperature is at least 3.6 x 10^{11} K, well exceeding the equipartition limit, indicating Doppler-boosted radio emission. The low jet inclination (&lt;5.4 deg) firmly places J1429+5406 into the blazar category.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The IceCube Upgrade will provide unprecedented sensitivity to dark matter particles annihilating in the core of the Sun. For dark matter candidates with spin-dependent couplings to nuclei and that annihilate significantly to tau leptons or neutrinos, we find that the IceCube Upgrade will be capable of testing parameter space that is beyond the reach of existing direct detection experiments. After calculating the sensitivity of the IceCube Upgrade to dark matter annihilation in the Sun, we explore dark matter models that could be tested by this experiment, identifying two classes of scenarios as promising targets for such searches.</description>

      <title>Radio polarization from runaway star bowshocks-I. The general case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High velocity stars move through the interstellar medium with V &gt; 30 km/s. When the star has powerful winds, under the appropriate conditions, the interaction of the wind with the interstellar material produces a system of shocks. The outer shock, called the bowshock, perturbs the ambient medium, heating and compressing the gas. The dust in the compressed bowshock cools, producing infrared radiation. This emission appears as extended coma-shape structures. The discovery of radio nonthermal emission from two stellar bowshock nebulae indicates that these sources might be accelerating electrons up to relativistic energies. The produced nonthermal radio emission is most probably synchrotron which has a high degree of polarization. In this work we model the synchrotron emission of runaway massive star bowshocks aiming to produce synthetic radio emission and polarization maps for two frequencies: 1.40 and 4.86 GHz. We model the interacting plasmas in a steady-state regime by means of magnetohydrodynamics simulations and we compute the injection and transport of the relativistic electrons in the diffusion approximation. We include in the model the most important depolarization effects. Our main conclusions are i) the effects of Faraday rotation within the source are important at the lowest frequency considered, ii) inferring the local magnetic field direction from polarization measurements only can be misleading, iii) thermal radio emission produced by ionized plasma within the bowshock structure and surroundings can surpass the polarized one for the considered frequencies, and iv) the contribution from the background electrons is minor.</description>

      <title>Discovery of Main-sequence Radio Pulse emitters from widefield sky surveys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic AB stars are known to produce periodic radio pulses by the electron cyclotron maser emission (ECME) mechanism. Only 19 such stars, known as 'Main-sequence Radio Pulse emitters' (MRPs) are currently known. The majority of MRPs have been discovered through targeted observation campaigns that involve carefully selecting a sample of stars that are likely to produce ECME, and which can be detected by a given telescope within reasonable amount of time. These selection criteria inadvertently introduce bias in the resulting sample of MRPs, which affects subsequent investigation of the relation between ECME properties and stellar magnetospheric parameters. The alternative is to use all-sky surveys. Until now, MRP candidates obtained from surveys were identified based on their high circular polarisation ($\gtrsim 30\%$). In this paper, we introduce a complementary strategy, which does not require polarisation information. Using multi-epoch data from the Australian SKA Pathfinder (ASKAP) telescope, we identify four MRP candidates based on the variability in the total intensity light curves. Follow-up observations with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) confirm three of them to be MRPs, thereby demonstrating the effectiveness of our strategy. With the expanded sample, we find that ECME is affected by temperature and the magnetic field strength, consistent with past results. There is, however, a degeneracy regarding how the two parameters govern the ECME luminosity for magnetic A and late-B stars (effective temperature $\lesssim 16$ kK). The current sample is also inadequate to investigate the role of stellar rotation, which has been shown to play a key role in driving incoherent radio emission.</description>

      <title>Rapid formation of a very massive star &gt;50000 $M_\odot$ and subsequently an IMBH from runaway collisions. Direct N-body and Monte Carlo simulations of dense star clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. We present simulations of a massive young star cluster using \textsc{Nbody6++GPU} and \textsc{MOCCA}. The cluster is initially more compact than previously published models, with one million stars, a total mass of $5.86 \times 10^5~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$, and a half-mass radius of $0.1~\mathrm{pc}$.
  Aims. We analyse the formation and growth of a very massive star (VMS) through successive stellar collisions and investigate the subsequent formation of an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) in the core of a dense star cluster.
  Methods. We use both direct \textit{N}-body and Monte Carlo simulations, incorporating updated stellar evolution prescriptions (SSE/BSE) tailored to massive stars and VMSs. These include revised treatments of stellar radii, rejuvenation, and mass loss during collisions. While the prescriptions represent reasonable extrapolations into the VMS regime, the internal structure and thermal state of VMSs formed through stellar collisions remain uncertain, and future work may require further refinement.
  Results. We find that runaway stellar collisions in the cluster core produce a VMS exceeding $5 \times 10^4~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ within 5 Myr, which subsequently collapses into an IMBH.
  Conclusions. Our model suggests that dense stellar environments may enable the formation of very massive stars and massive black hole seeds through runaway stellar collisions. These results provide a potential pathway for early black hole growth in star clusters and offer theoretical context for interpreting recent JWST observations of young, compact clusters at high redshift.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric extensions of nuclear equations of state: probing the breakdown scale of relativistic mean-field theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phenomenological calculations of the properties of dense matter, such as relativistic mean-field theories, represent a pathway to predicting the microscopic and macroscopic properties of neutron stars. However, such theories do not generically have well-controlled uncertainties and may break down within neutron stars. To faithfully represent the uncertainty in this breakdown scale, we develop a hybrid representation of the dense-matter equation of state, which assumes the form of a relativistic mean-field theory at low densities, while remaining agnostic to any nuclear theory at high densities. To achieve this, we use a nonparametric equation of state model to incorporate the correlations of the underlying relativistic mean-field theory equation of state at low pressures and transition to more flexible correlations above some chosen pressure scale. We perform astrophysical inference under various choices of the transition pressure between the theory-informed and theory-agnostic models. We further study whether the chosen relativistic mean-field theory breaks down above some particular pressure and find no such evidence. Using simulated data for future astrophysical observations at about two-to-three times the precision of current constraints, we show that our method can identify the breakdown pressure associated with a potential strong phase transition.</description>

Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of compact stars admixed with non-self annihilating self-interacting fermionic dark matter, delineating the dependence on the nuclear equation of state by considering the two limiting parametrized equations of state for neutron star matter obtained by smoothly matching the low-density chiral effective theory and the high-density perturbative QCD. These two parametrizations are the limiting cases of a wide variety of smooth equations of state, i.e. the softest and stiffest possible one without a phase transition, that generate masses and radii compatible with 2M$_\odot$ observations and the tidal constraint from GW170817. With an exhaustive analysis of the possible stable mass-radius configurations, we determine the quantity of dark matter contained in stars with masses and radii compatible with the aforementioned astrophysical constraints. We find that for dark particle masses of a few tenths of GeV, the dark core collapses and no stable solutions are found for the two limiting ordinary matter equations of state. For lower masses, the dark matter fraction is limited to 10%, being at most 1% for masses ranging from 0.1 to 10 GeV for the limiting soft nuclear equation of state. For the limiting stiff nuclear equation of state, the dark matter fraction can reach values of more than 10%, but the dark particle mass is being constrained to 0.3 GeV and 10 GeV for the weak self-interacting case and has to be at least 5 GeV for the strong self-interacting one. For dark particle masses of less than 0.1 GeV, stable neutron star configurations should have less than 1% of self-interacting dark matter to be compatible with the constraint of the tidal deformability from GW170817 for the two limiting ordinary matter equations of state studied.</description>

      <title>Effects of inner crusts on $g$-mode oscillations in neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07188v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we investigate the influence of neutron stars' crusts on the non-radial $g$-mode oscillations and examine their correlations with nuclear matter properties fixed by adopting 10 different relativistic density functionals. At subsaturation densities, neutron star matter takes non-uniform structures and form the crusts. We find that the Brunt-V\"{a}is\"{a}l\"{a} (BV) frequency increases significantly at densities slightly above the neutron drip density (i.e., neutron stars' inner crusts), which leads to crust $g$-mode oscillations with their frequencies insensitive to the adopted density functional. At larger densities, BV frequency increases as well due to the core-crust transitions and emergence of muons, which lead to core $g$-mode oscillations. It is found that the obtained core $g$-mode frequencies generally increase with the slope of nuclear symmetry energy $L$, which eventually intersect with that of the crust $g$ modes adopting large enough $L$. This leads to the avoid-crossing phenomenon for the global $g$ modes that encompass contributions from both the crust and core. The correlation between the global $g_1$ mode and $L$ is identified for neutron stars with masses $M\gtrsim 1.4\ M_{\odot}$, which enables the measurements of $L$ based on gravitational wave observations. In our future study, the effects of the discontinuities in density or shear modulus should be considered, while the temperature, rotation, magnetic field, and superfluid neutron gas in neutron stars could also play important roles.</description>

      <title>Localizing Dynamically-Formed Black Hole Binaries in Milky Way Globular Clusters with LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18682v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dynamical formation of binary black holes (BBHs) in globular clusters (GCs) may contribute significantly to the observed gravitational wave (GW) merger rate. Furthermore, LISA may detect many BBH sources from GCs at mHz frequencies, enabling the characterization of such systems within the Milky Way and nearby Universe. In this work, we use Monte Carlo N-body simulations to construct a realistic sample of Galactic clusters, thus estimating the population, detectability, and parameter measurement accuracy of BBHs hosted within them. In particular, we show that the GW signal from $0.7\pm 0.7$, $2.0\pm 1.7$, $3.6\pm 2.3$, $13.4\pm 4.7$ BBHs in Milky Way GCs can exceed the signal-to-noise ratio threshold of $\rm SNR =30$, 5, 3, and 1 for a 10-year LISA observation, with $\sim 50\%$ of detectable sources exhibiting high eccentricities ($e\gtrsim0.9$). Moreover, the Fisher matrix and Bayesian analyses of the GW signals indicate these systems typically feature highly-resolved orbital frequencies ($\delta f_{\rm orb}/ f_{\rm orb} \sim 10^{-7}-10^{-5}$) and eccentricities ($\delta e/ e \sim 10^{-3}-0.1$), as well as a measurable total mass when SNR exceeds $\sim20$. Notably, we show that high-SNR BBHs can be confidently localized to specific Milky Way GCs with a sky localization accuracy of $\delta \Omega \sim 1$~deg$^2$, and address the large uncertainties in their distance measurement ($\delta R \sim 0.3 - 20$~kpc). The detection and localization of even a single BBH in a Galactic GC would allow accurate tracking of its long-term orbital evolution, enable a direct test of the role of GCs in BBH formation, and provide a unique probe into the evolutionary history of Galactic clusters.</description>

      <title>J1406+0102: Dust Obscured Galaxy Hiding Super Eddington Accretion System with Bright Radio Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.05605v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent high-$z$ quasar observations strongly indicate that super-Eddington accretion is a crucial phase to describe the presence of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) with $M_\mathrm{BH} \gtrsim 10^9 M_\odot$ at $z \gtrsim 7$. Motivated by theoretical predictions that the super-Eddington phase efficiently produces outflows and jets bright in radio bands, we identify a super-Eddington radio-loud dust-obscured galaxy (DOG) J1406+0102 at $z=0.2367$. This source is discovered by cross-matching the infrared-bright DOGs of Nobriguchi et al. (2019) with the VLA/FIRST 1.4 GHz radio survey data and the SDSS optical spectral catalog. J1406+0102 shows broad components in the Balmer lines, and by assuming that those lines are from the broad line region, they give BH mass estimations of $\log (M_\mathrm{BH}/M_\odot)=7.30 \pm 0.25$. Combined with an AGN luminosity of $\log (L_\mathrm{bol,[OIII]}/\mathrm{erg}~\mathrm{s}^{-1}) = 45.91\pm0.38$ estimated from the intrinsic [OIII] luminosity, this implies a super-Eddington accretion rate of $\lambda_\mathrm{Edd} \simeq 3$. We show that 1) J1406+0102 shows strong AGN feedback, with the [OIII] outflow velocity exceeds the escape velocity of the host galaxy halo and a kinetic efficiency of $\approx$ 8%, sufficient to quench the host galaxy; 2) its expected growth trajectory places it on an over-massive BH track; and 3) if representative of radio-loud DOGs, such sources can contribute significantly to the high-energy ($\gtrsim$ 100 TeV) cosmic neutrino background.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07894v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sub-GeV neutrinos produced in a stellar core may emerge from main sequence stars, white dwarfs and brown dwarfs producing possible observable signals of dark matter capture. A distribution of these stars near the Milky Way galactic center will produce a neutrino flux that can be probed at Earth based neutrino observatories like Super-Kamiokande and Hyper-Kamiokande. We demonstrate that this can provide a handle to probe dark matter masses in the $200\,$MeV\,$-$\,$2\,$GeV mass scales that compares favourably with present day direct detection bounds.</description>

      <title>A monolithic first--order BSSNOK formulation of the Einstein--Euler equations and its solution with path-conservative finite difference CWENO schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12055v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new, monolithic first--order (both in time and space) BSSNOK formulation of the coupled Einstein--Euler equations. The entire system of hyperbolic PDEs is solved in a completely unified manner via one single numerical scheme applied to both the conservative sector of the matter part and to the first--order strictly non--conservative sector of the spacetime evolution. The coupling between matter and space-time is achieved via algebraic source terms. The numerical scheme used for the solution of the new monolithic first order formulation is a path-conservative central WENO (CWENO) finite difference scheme, with suitable insertions to account for the presence of the non--conservative terms. By solving several crucial tests of numerical general relativity, including a stable neutron star, Riemann problems in relativistic matter with shock waves and the stable long-time evolution of single and binary puncture black holes up and beyond the binary merger, we show that our new CWENO scheme, introduced two decades ago for the compressible Euler equations of gas dynamics, can be successfully applied also to numerical general relativity, solving all equations at the same time with one single numerical method. In the future the new monolithic approach proposed in this paper may become an attractive alternative to traditional methods that couple central finite difference schemes with Kreiss-Oliger dissipation for the space-time part with totally different TVD schemes for the matter evolution and which are currently the state of the art in the field.</description>

      <title>Measuring Hubble constant using localized and unlocalized fast radio bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03994v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Hubble constant ($H_0$) is one of the most important parameters in the standard $\rm \Lambda CDM$ model. The measurements given by the main two methods show a gap larger than $4\sigma$, which is known as Hubble tension. Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are extragalactic pulses with durations of milliseconds. They can be used as cosmological probes. We constrain $H_0$ using localized and nonlocalized FRBs. We first used 108 localized FRBs to constrain $H_0$ using the probability distributions of \DMhost and \DMIGM from the IllustrisTNG simulation. Then, we used a Monte Carlo sampling to calculate the pseudo-redshift distributions of 527 nonlocalized FRBs from CHIME observations. The 108 localized FRBs yield a constraint of $H_0=69.40_{-1.97}^{+2.14}$ ${\rm km\ s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}}$, which lies between the early- and late-time values. The constraint of $H_{0}$ from nonlocalized FRBs yields $H_0=68.81_{-0.68}^{+0.68}$ ${\rm km\ s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}}$. This result indicates that the uncertainty on the constraint of $H_0$ drops to $\sim1\%$ when the number of localized FRBs is increased to $\sim500$. These uncertainties only include the statistical error. The systematic errors are also discussed and play a dominant role in the current sample.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18657v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study eccentric equatorial orbits of a stellar-mass black hole around an intermediate-mass slowly rotating Kerr black hole in the presence of gravitational radiation and a dark matter halo. The stellar-mass companion will inspiral towards the central black hole while emitting gravitational waves. The evolution is affected by the dynamical friction force caused by the presence of dark matter surrounding the intermediate-mass black hole at the core. Previous studies have shown that the presence of dark matter can be deduced from the gravitational waveforms. We explore the combined effects of slow-rotation of the central black hole and the presence of the dark matter halo around it on the system's gravitational wave emission.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00769v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study time-like geodesics around a spherically symmetric black hole in Kalb-Ramond (KR) gravity, characterized by the parameter $l$, which induces spontaneous Lorentz symmetry breaking. The geodesic equations and effective potential are derived to investigate the influence of $l$. We calculate the marginally bound orbits and innermost stable circular orbits, analyzing the parameter's impact. Periodic orbits are computed numerically and classified within the standard taxonomy, revealing significant effects of $l$ on their momentum and energy. Additionally, we explore an extreme mass ratio inspiral system under the adiabatic approximation to derive gravitational waveforms emitted by an object orbiting a supermassive black hole in KR gravity. These waveforms reflect the distinctive characteristics of periodic orbits and highlight the influence of $l$. With advancements in gravitational wave detection, these results offer insights into black holes influenced by Lorentz symmetry-breaking fields.</description>

      <title>Collective Neutrino Oscillations in Three Flavors on Qubit and Qutrit Processors</title>

Abstract: Collective neutrino flavor oscillations are of primary importance in understanding the dynamic evolution of core-collapse supernovae and subsequent terrestrial detection, but also among the most challenging aspects of numerical simulations. This situation is complicated by the quantum many-body nature of the problem due to neutrino-neutrino interactions which demands a quantum treatment. An additional complication is the presence of three flavors, which often is approximated by the electron flavor and a heavy lepton flavor. In this work, we provide both qubit and qutrit encodings for all three flavors, and develop optimized quantum circuits for the time evolution and analyze the Trotter error. We conclude our study with a hardware experiment of a system of two neutrinos with superconducting hardware: the IBM Torino device for qubits and AQT device for qutrits. We find that error mitigation greatly helps in obtaining a signal consistent with simulations. While hardware results are comparable at this stage, we expect the qutrit setup to be more convenient for large-scale simulations since it does not suffer from probability leakage into nonphsycial qubit space, unlike the qubit setup.</description>

      <title>Black holes surrounded by massive vector fields in Kaluza-Klein gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00678v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an exact black hole solution surrounded by massive vector fields predicted by Kaluza-Klein (KK) gravity. KK gravity in four dimensions (4D) is of particular interest, as it predicts a tower of particle states, including gravitons with spin-0 and spin-1 components, in addition to the massless spin-2 gravitons of general relativity. The extra degrees of freedom in the gravitational sector modify the law of gravity, allowing the theory to explain the effects attributed to dark matter in the universe. In this paper, we construct a black hole solution surrounded by massive spin-1 gravitons within KK theory. In addition to the influence of the massive vector fields, we incorporate an interaction term between the black hole and the massive vector field. The black hole solution is affected by the mass of the spin-1 graviton and an additional parameter that encodes corrections to Newton's constant, as well as the coupling between the massive vector field and the black hole mass. We find that the coupling between the massive vector field and the black hole mimics the effect of an electric charge. To this end, we investigate the accretion disk, quasinormal modes (QNMs), and the stability of the black hole spacetime. Finally, we use Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations of Sgr A* to constrain the black hole parameters.</description>

      <title>Klein-Gordon particles in a nonuniform external magnetic field in Bonnor-Melvin rainbow gravity background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05717v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of rainbow gravity on Klein-Gordon (KG) bosons in a quantized nonuniform magnetic field in the background of Bonnor-Melvin (BM) spacetime with a cosmological constant. In the process, we show that the BM spacetime introduces domain walls (i.e., infinitely impenetrable hard walls) at \(r = 0\) and \(r = \pi/\sqrt{2\Lambda}\), as a consequence of the effective gravitational potential field generated by such a magnetized BM spacetime. As a result, the motion of KG particles/antiparticles is restricted indefinitely within the range \(r \in [0, \pi/\sqrt{2\Lambda}]\), and the particles and antiparticles cannot be found elsewhere. Next, we provide a conditionally exact solution in the form of the general Heun function \(H_G(a, q, \alpha, \beta, \gamma, \delta, z)\). Within the BM domain walls and under the condition of exact solvability, we study the effects of rainbow gravity on KG bosonic fields in a quantized nonuniform external magnetic field in the BM spacetime background. We use three pairs of rainbow functions: \( f(u) = (1 - \tilde{\beta} |E|)^{-1}, \, h(u) = 1 \); and \( f(u) = 1, \, h(u) = \sqrt{1 - \tilde{\beta} |E|^\upsilon} \), with \(\upsilon = 1,2\), where \(u = |E| / E_p\), \(\tilde{\beta} = \beta / E_p\), and \(\beta\) is the rainbow parameter. We find that such pairs of rainbow functions, \((f(u), h(u))\), fully comply with the theory of rainbow gravity, ensuring that \(E_p\) is the maximum possible energy for particles and antiparticles alike. Moreover, we show that the corresponding bosonic states form magnetized, rotating vortices, as intriguing consequences of such a magnetized BM spacetime background.</description>

      <title>Constraining Population III stellar demographics with next-generation gravitational-wave observatories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18615v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Next-generation gravitational-wave observatories will reach farther into the universe than currently possible, revealing black-hole mergers from early stellar binary systems such as Population III stars, whose properties are currently poorly constrained. We develop a method to infer the properties of their progenitor populations from gravitational-wave catalogs. Using Bayesian deep learning, we train an emulator for population-synthesis predictions of black-hole merger properties across redshift as a function of the initial stellar mass function, crucially accounting for systematic uncertainty due to the finite number of training simulations. Combined with a nonparametric model for star formation history, we analyze catalogs containing both Population I/II and III sources simulated with full Bayesian parameter estimation for a detector network of Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope with one year of observing time. We demonstrate our ability to separate these two populations at high redshifts where both make comparable contributions to the black-hole merger rate, excluding a Population III merger rate of zero at nearly 100% credibility. Moreover, we can place meaningful constraints on the Population III progenitor distributions; in particular, we constrain the spectral index of the initial mass function to within roughly +/-0.5 of the true value and the log of the star formation rate density to within ~25% over redshifts 10 to 20. By leveraging astrophysics-informed and astrophysics-agnostic models, we demonstrate the discriminative power of our combined inference approach and highlight the potential of next-generation gravitational-wave observatories to uncover the details of high-redshift stellar populations.</description>
