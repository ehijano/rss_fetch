      <title>Qubit parametrization of the variational discrete action theory for the multiorbital Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The variational discrete action theory (VDAT) at \mathcal{N}=3 is a potent tool for accurately capturing Mott and Hund physics at zero temperature in d=\infty at a cost comparable to the Gutzwiller approximation, which is recovered by VDAT at \mathcal{N}=2. Here we develop a qubit parametrization of the gauge constrained algorithm of VDAT at \mathcal{N}=3 for the multiorbital Hubbard model with general density-density interactions. The qubit parametrization yields an explicit variational trial energy, and the variational parameters consist of the momentum density distribution, the shape of a reference fermi surface, and the pure state of a qubit system with dimension of the local Hilbert space. To illustrate the power of the qubit parametrization, we solve for the ground state properties of the multiorbital Hubbard model with Hund coupling for local orbital number N_{orb}=2-7. A Taylor series expansion of the partially optimized trial energy is used to explain how the Hund's coupling changes the order of the Mott transition. For the case of the SU(2N_{orb}) Hubbard model, an explicit approach for computing the critical U_{c} for the Mott transition is provided, yielding an analytical expression for U_{c} in the large N_{orb} limit. Additionally, we provide an analytical solution for the ground state properties of the single band Hubbard model with a special density of states. Finally, we demonstrate that the qubit parametrization can also be applied to \mathcal{N}=2, for both G-type and B-type variants, where the G-type yields an identical expression to the slave spin mean-field theory. The qubit parametrization not only improves the efficiency and transparency of VDAT at \mathcal{N}=3, but also provides the key advances for the construction of a one-body reduced density matrix functional capable of capturing Mott and Hund physics.</description>

      <title>Extended s-wave altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose extended s-wave altermagnets (sAMs) as a class of magnetic states which are fully gapped, spin-compensated, and feature spin-polarized bands. sAMs are formed through valley-exchange symmetries, which act as momentum-space translations beyond standard crystallographic spin-group classifications. Using an effective two-valley model, we demonstrate that sAMs exhibit isotropic spin splitting, enable spin-selective transport in tailored heterostructures, and give rise to descendant pair density wave order. From a microscopic sAM minimal model, we develop the guiding principles to identify sAMs in quantum magnets.</description>

      <title>Critical quantum liquids and the cuprate high temperature superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theoretical framework for the cuprate superconductors, rooted in a fractionalized Fermi liquid (FL*) description of the intermediate-temperature pseudogap phase at low doping. The FL* theory predicted hole pockets each of fractional area $p/8$ at hole doping $p$, in contrast to the area $p/4$ in a spin density wave state or its thermal fluctuation. A recent magnetotransport observation of the Yamaji angle is in good agreement with area $p/8$.
  We review a theory for the FL* phase of a single-band model using a pair of ancilla qubits on each site. Its mean field theory yields hole pockets of area $p/8$, and matches the gapped photoemission spectrum in the anti-nodal region of the Brillouin zone. Fluctuations are described by the SU(2) gauge theory of a background spin liquid with critical Dirac spinons. A Monte Carlo study of the thermal SU(2) gauge theory transforms the hole pockets into Fermi arcs. One route to confinement upon lowering temperature yields a $d$-wave superconductor via a Kosterlitz-Thouless transition of $h/(2e)$ vortices, with nodal Bogoliubov quasiparticles featuring anisotropic velocities and vortices surrounded by charge order halos. An alternative route produces a charge-ordered metallic state that exhibits quantum oscillations in agreement with experimental data.
  Increasing doping from the FL* phase drives a transition to a conventional Fermi liquid at large doping, passing through an intermediate strange metal regime. We formulate a theory of this metal using a critical quantum `charge' liquid of mobile electrons in the presence of disorder, developed via an extension of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model.
  At low temperatures, and across optimal and over doping, we address the regimes of extended non-Fermi liquid behavior by Griffiths effects near quantum phase transitions in disordered metals.</description>

      <title>Bosonization and Kramers-Wannier dualities in general dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that the noninteracting Majorana chain is dual to the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model, either through the Jordan-Wigner transformation or by gauging fermion parity. In this correspondence, the minimal translation of the Majorana chain maps to the celebrated Kramers-Wannier (KW) duality of the spin model, with the critical point mapped to the self-dual point. In this work, we generalize this mapping to two and higher dimensions by constructing a unitary equivalence between the parity-gauged fermionic system and a spin system defined on arbitrary polyhedral decompositions of space. Imposing the flatness condition on the gauge field yields a bosonization duality between the original (ungauged) fermionic system and a gauged spin system obeying a Gauss law. The dependence of the Gauss law in the spin system on the Kasteleyn orientation (and the discrete spin structure) of the fermionic system is made explicit. Applying this bosonization to one or two copies of Majorana fermions on translationally invariant lattices, we derive higher-dimensional analogs of KW (self-)dualities in spin systems arising from fermionic minimal translations. The KW (self-)dualities are non-invertible due to projections onto eigenspaces of higher-form symmetries in the associated symmetry operators. The bosonization framework we present is intuitive, general, and systematic, encompassing other known exact bosonization methods while offering a novel approach to establish new connections between fermionic and spin systems in arbitrary dimensions.</description>

      <title>Insulating ground state and 2-k magnetic structure of candidate Weyl Hydrogen atom K$_2$Mn$_3$(AsO$_4$)$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ideal Weyl 'Hydrogen-atom' semi-metal exhibits only a single pair of Weyl nodes and no other trivial states at the Fermi energy. Such a material would be a panacea in the study of Weyl quasi particles allowing direct unambiguous observation of their topological properties. The alluaudite-like K$_2$Mn$_3$(AsO$_4$)$_3$ compound was recently proposed as such a material. Here we use comprehensive experimental work and first principle calculations to assess this prediction. We find K$_2$Mn$_3$(AsO$_4$)$_3$ crystallizes in the $C2/c$ symmetry with a quasi-1D Mn sublattice, growing as small needle-like crystals. Bulk properties measurements reveal magnetic transitions at $\approx$ 8 and $\approx$ 4 K which neutron scattering experiments show correspond to two distinct magnetic orders, first a partially ordered ferrimagnetic $\mathbf{k_1}$= (0, 0, 0) structure at 8 K and a second transition of $\mathbf{k_2}$= (1, 0, 0) at 4 K to a fully ordered state. Below the second transition, both ordering vectors are necessary to describe the complex magnetic structure with modulated spin magnitudes. Both of the best-fit magnetic structures in this work are found to break the symmetry necessary for the generation of the Weyl nodes, though one of the magnetic structures allowed by $\mathbf{k_1}$ does preserve this symmetry. However, the crystals are optically transparent and ellipsometry measurements reveal a large band-gap, undermining expectations of semi-metallic behavior. Density functional theory calculations predict an insulating antiferromagnetic ground state, in contrast to previous reports, and suggest potential frustration on the magnetic sublattice. Given the wide tunability of the alluaudite structure we consider ways to push the system closer to semi-metallic state.</description>

      <title>Bosonization in $R$-paraparticle Luttinger models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reintroduce the parafermion-paraboson classification in $R$-paraparticles in terms of their average occupation numbers, analogous to Green's parastatistics. The notion of $p$-order in $R$-parafermions is also redefined as the maximum number of particles that can occupy a quantum state. An example of an order-$2$ $R$-parafermion with $m=2$ internal degrees of freedom is presented, which obeys an exclusion principle that is not Pauli's. The interacting $R$-parafermions are studied in the context of bosonization. Specifically, we show that while density waves are generally bosonic in nature and that flavor-charge separation naturally occurs for any one-dimensional $R$-parafermion system described by the Luttinger model, flavor waves do not always satisfy bose statistics. Comparison of the partition functions further show that only $(p=1)$-ordered $R$-parafermions are compatible with the bosonization procedure in the low-energy limit. Based from these results, we discuss a potential realization of parafermion signatures in one-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>A two-state generalisation of the strong collision model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Muon spin relaxation is a powerful technique for probing static and dynamic local magnetic fields. The strong collision model, based on a Gaussian-Markovian process, is commonly used to account for dynamical effects. Yet, it remains limited in describing systems where the local field undergoes discrete state changes. To address this, I introduce a generalized two-state strong collision model that explicitly incorporates transitions between distinct local field environments during fluctuations. This extension allows for a more accurate representation of dynamical effects, particularly in systems where each collision alters the underlying static polarisation function. Analytical and numerical solutions are presented, and the model's applicability is demonstrated {\color{black}and discussed} across relevant physical systems -- including low-dimensional magnets, systems with dynamic disorder and ion and muon diffusion. These results offer an enhanced framework for interpreting data in complex materials and extend the method's reach to a broader class of dynamical phenomena in condensed matter physics.</description>

      <title>A configuration interaction approach to solve the Anderson impurity model; applications to elemental Ce</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate calculations of strongly correlated materials remain a formidable challenge in condensed matter physics, particularly due to the computational demand of conventional methods. This paper presents an efficient solver for dynamical mean field theory using configuration interaction (CI). The method is shown to have improved efficiency compared to traditional, exact diagonalization approaches. Hence, it provides an accessible, open-source alternative that can be executed on standard laptop computers or on supercomputers. The solver is demonstrated on cerium in the $\gamma$-, $\alpha$- and $\epsilon$-phases. An analysis of how the electronic structure of Ce evolves as function of lattice compression is made. It is argued that the electronic structure evolves from a localized nature of the 4f shell in $\gamma$-Ce to an essentially itinerant nature of the 4f shell of $\epsilon$-Ce. The transition between these two phases, as function of compression, can hence be seen as a Mott transition. However, this transition is intercepted by the strongly correlated $\alpha$-phase of elemental Ce, for which the 4f shell forms a Kondo singlet.</description>

      <title>Evolution of quasiparticle edge states with Hubbard interaction in Rice-Mele chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the behaviour of edge states in Rice-Mele model with Hubbard interaction, U , at half-filling using density matrix renormalization group, exact diagonalization and effective charge dynamics in Kumar representation. For a fixed dimerization, $\delta$, and staggered potential, V , we find by increasing U the quasiparticle edge states in the charge gap to come down in energy from V in the absence of Hubbard interaction to zero energy for U $\approx$ 2V . This presents an uncommon case where repulsion leads to zero-energy edge states. Upon increasing U further, the edge state energy starts increasing again until they are lost in the bulk. However, upon increasing U even further, these edge states reappear in the high energy gap. So, with Hubbard interaction, the edge states in Rice-Mele chain transmigrate from the physical charge gap to a high energy gap.</description>

      <title>Spin structures and phase diagrams of the spin-$\frac{5}{2}$ triangular-lattice antiferromagnet Na$_2$BaMn(PO$_4$)$_2$ under magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We combine single-crystal neutron diffraction studies and Monte Carlo simulations to determine the spin structures and finite-temperature phase diagram of the spin-5/2 triangular-lattice antiferromagnet Na$_2$BaMn(PO$_4$)$_2$ in magnetic field. With the application of a magnetic field in two different directions, namely along the $c$-axis and in the $ab$-plane of the trigonal symmetry, we track the evolution of the spin structure through changes of the magnetic propagation vector. We account for these results with a minimal Heisenberg Hamiltonian that includes easy-axis anisotropy and weak, frustrated interlayer couplings in addition to intralayer exchange. Guided by representation analysis, we refine symmetry-allowed modes to the measured intensities and obtain the spin structures for all field-induced phases, which we compare quantitatively with simulated configurations. Taken together, our measurements and simulations show that frustrated interlayer exchange -- rather than purely 2D physics -- organizes the unexpectedly rich field-induced phases of Na$_2$BaMn(PO$_4$)$_2$.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Hall effect in topological Dirac semimetals in parallel magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the second-harmonic response of two-dimensional topological Dirac semimetals subjected to an external in-plane magnetic field. The quantum kinetic equation for the Wigner distribution function is derived and then solved to evaluate the second-order electric-field contributions to the current density. Both the Berry curvature dipole and the field-induced terms in the current are analyzed across a broad range of model parameters. We propose that our theory can be tested experimentally by measuring the dependence of the anomalous Hall resistivity on the in-plane magnetic field in the surface states of the topological insulator SnTe, in WTe$_2$ and WSe$_2$ monolayers, as well as in the Kondo lattice material Ce$_3$Bi$_4$Pd$_3$ at very low temperatures.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Field Induced Band Deformation in a Lieb Lattice:Aharonov-Bohm Caging and Zeeman Splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flat-band systems are highly sensitive to external perturbations, providing a route to study unconventional localization, transport, and spin physics. Lieb lattice, a two-dimensional geometry with an inherent flat band, exemplifies this behavior and is experimentally realizable in ultracold atoms, photonic arrays, and superconducting circuits. In this work, we present a comprehensive study of magnetic field induced band deformation in the Lieb lattice by jointly considering orbital Peierls phases and Zeeman spin splitting. A perpendicular magnetic flux generates Aharonov Bohm caging, confining particles into localized flat-band states, while Zeeman coupling lifts spin degeneracy and induces spin-resolved energy shifts. The competition between these two mechanisms gives rise to rich band restructuring and tunable spin-selective flat-band phenomena. These results establish the Lieb lattice as a controllable setting for spin-selective transport and magneticfield engineering in synthetic quantum platforms such as ultracold atoms, photonic lattices, and superconducting circuits, offering guiding principles for quantum simulation and the corresponding experiments, which opens the avenue for controlled engineering of spin-resolved localization and flat-band physics in synthetic quantum matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While tremendous research has revealed that symmetry enriches topological phases of matter, more general principles that protect topological phases have yet to be explored. In this Letter, we elucidate the roles of subspaces in free-fermionic topological phases. A subspace property for Hamiltonians enables us to define new topological invariants. They result in peculiar topological boundary phenomena, i.e., the emergence of an unpaired zero mode or zero-winding skin modes, characterizing subspace-protected topological phases. We establish and demonstrate the bulk-boundary correspondence in subspace-protected topological phases. We further discuss the interplay of the subspace property and internal symmetries. Toward application, we also propose possible platforms possessing the subspace property.</description>

      <title>Quantum melting a Wigner crystal into Hall liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments have shown that, counterintuitively, applying a magnetic field to a Wigner crystal can induce quantum Hall effects. In this work, using variational Monte Carlo, we show that magnetic fields can melt zero-field Wigner crystals into integer quantum Hall liquids. This melting originates from quantum oscillations in the liquid's ground state energy, which develops downward cusps at integer filling factors due to incompressibility.

      <title>Dynamics of the Fermion-Rotor System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the dynamics of the fermion-rotor system, a simple impurity model in d=1+1 dimensions that consists of a collection of purely right-moving fermions interacting with a quantum mechanical rotor localised at the origin. This was first introduced by Polchinski as a toy model for monopole-fermion scattering and is surprisingly subtle, with ingoing and outgoing fermions carrying different quantum numbers. We show that the rotor acts as a twist operator in the low-energy theory, changing the quantum numbers of excitations that have previously passed through the origin to ensure scattering consistent with all symmetries.
  We further show how generalisations of this model with multiple rotors and unequal charges can be viewed as a UV-completion of boundary states for chiral theories, including the well-studied 3450 model. We compute correlation functions between ingoing and outgoing fermions and show that fermions dressed with the rotor degree of freedom act as local operators and create single-particle states, generalising an earlier result obtained in a theory with a single rotor and equal charges. Finally, we point out a mod 2 anomaly in these models that descends from the Witten anomaly in 4d</description>

      <title>Physical constraints on effective non-Hermitian systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interacting and open quantum systems can be formulated in terms of an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian (NHH), however, there are important constraints that must be satisfied by the effective action and the associated Green's functions. One common approach to many-body non-Hermitian (NH) systems is to incorporate the anti-Hermitian part of the Hamiltonian directly in the Matsubara Green's function. Here, we show that such an approach is incompatible with the standard framework for systems with interactions. Furthermore, we furnish a consistent physical description for such systems by determining their distinction from conventional interacting physics, and find that they are described by pseudo-Hermitian quantum mechanics. Furthermore, we characterize the zero-temperature distribution functions within several frameworks for NH systems. As an application of our results, we consider the electromagnetic response of a NH quasiparticle Hamiltonian based on the (1+1)-dimensional NH Dirac model subject to various physical descriptions.</description>

      <title>A Fermi Surface Descriptor Quantifying the Correlations between Anomalous Hall Effect and Fermi Surface Geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.05788v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the last few decades, basic ideas of topology have completely transformed the prediction of quantum transport phenomena. Following this trend, we go deeper into the incorporation of modern mathematics into quantum material science focusing on geometry. Here we investigate the relation between the geometrical type of the Fermi surface and Anomalous and Spin Hall Effects. An index, $\mathbb{H}_F$, quantifying the hyperbolic geometry of the Fermi surface, shows a universal correlation (R$^2$ = 0.97) with the experimentally measured intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity, of 16 different compounds spanning a wide variety of crystal, chemical, and electronic structure families, including those where topological methods give R$^2$ = 0.52. This raises a question about the predictive limits of topological physics and its transformation into a wider study of bandstructures' and Fermi surfaces' geometries and relating them to the quantum geometry theory of a more general metric of eigenstates, opening horizon for the prediction of phenomena beyond topological understanding.</description>

      <title>Origin of the hidden energy scale and the $f$-ratio in geometrically frustrated magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12966v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sufficiently clean geometrically frustrated (GF) magnets are the largest class of candidate materials that may host quantum spin liquids (QSLs). Some of them have been shown to exhibit spin-glass freezing, potentially precluding QSLs, at the "hidden energy scale", which is significantly lower than the microscopic energy scale of spin interactions. Here, we investigate the origin of the hidden energy scale and its relationship to the $f$-ratio, the figure of merit for the degree of frustration in GF magnetic materials. The available experimental and numerical data provide evidence that GF magnets display, universally, two distinct temperature scales in the specific heat, the lowest of which is of the order of the hidden energy scale $T^*$. We argue that this scale is determined by non-magnetic excitations, similar to spin exchanges in chains of spins. The collective entropy of such excitations matches the entropy of the ground states of the Ising model on the same lattice, which provides a way to verify the proposed scenario in experiment. We demonstrate that in the presence of quenched disorder, a broad class of materials exhibits spin-glass freezing at temperatures of order $T^*$, in accordance with experimental observations. As $T^*$ is a property of the clean GF medium, it leads to a constraint on the $f$-ratio.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07635v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by recent experimental findings, we investigate various scenarios of the doped Hubbard model with impurity potentials. We calculate the lattice Green's function in a finite-size cluster and then map it to the continuum real space, which allows for a direct comparison with scanning-tunneling-microscopy measurements on the local density of states. Our simulations successfully reproduce experimental data, including the characteristic stripe- and ladder-shaped structures observed in cuprate systems. Moreover, our results establish a connection between previous numerical findings on stripe-ordered ground states and experimental observations, thus providing new insights into microscopic mechanisms of the Mott insulator to superconductor transition in cuprates.</description>

      <title>Topological charge excitations and Green's function zeros in paramagnetic Mott insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13302v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of topological features in the charge excitations of Mott insulators in the Chern-Hubbard model. In the strong correlation regime, treating electrons as the sum of holons and doublons excitations, we compute the topological phase diagram of Mott insulators at half-filling using composite operator formalism. The Green function zeros manifest as the tightly bound pairs of such elementary excitations of the Mott insulators. Our analysis examines the winding number associated with the occupied Hubbard bands and the band of Green's function zeros. We show that both the poles and zeros show gapless states and zeros, respectively, in line with bulk-boundary correspondence. The gapless edge states emerge in a junction geometry connecting a topological Mott band insulator and a topological Mott zeros phase. These include an edge electronic state that carries a charge and a charge-neutral gapless zero mode. Our study is relevant to several twisted materials with flat bands where interactions play a dominant role.</description>

Abstract: We show that the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasua-Yoisida interaction between overscreened spins in two channel Kondo impurity systems is a relevant perturbation when the number of impurities N is greater than 3 driving the system to a new quantum critical point with anomalous dimensions $\frac{1}{ (N+1)} $ for the spin operator and the Sommerfeld coefficient of the specific heat scales as $\gamma \sim T^{- \frac{3}{N+1}}$. The critical point universal properties are relevant to many strong correlation problems, such as impurity placed in a Majorana metal and the multichannel Kondo lattice model of heavy fermion materials. We discuss relevance of our results for cluster DMFT studies of quantum criticality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18806v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ability to engineer topologically distinct materials opens the possibility of enabling novel phenomena in low-dimensional nano-systems, as well as manufacturing novel quantum devices. One of the simplest examples, the SSH model with both even and odd number of sites, demonstrates the connection between localized edge states and the topology of the system. We show that the SSH model hosts localized spin centers due to the interplay between the localized edge states and the on-site Hubbard interaction. We further show how one can engineer any number of localized spin centers within the chain by careful addition of defects. These spin centers are paired in spin-singlet or spin-triplet channels within each block separated by the defects, and together they construct an array of spin singlet and/or triplet qubits. As this system is realizable experimentally, our findings describe a novel way for manipulating and engineering spin qubits and therefore provide a platform for performing many-body quantum simulations on spin excitations like magnons and triplons.</description>

      <title>Realization of a doped quantum antiferromagnet with dipolar tunnelings in a Rydberg tweezer array</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08233v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Doping an antiferromagnetic Mott insulator is central to our understanding of a variety of phenomena in strongly-correlated electrons, including high-temperature superconductors. To describe the competition between tunneling $t$ of hole dopants and antiferromagnetic (AFM) spin interactions $J$, theoretical and numerical studies often focus on the paradigmatic $t$-$J$ model, and the direct analog quantum simulation of this model in the relevant regime of high-particle density has long been sought. Here, we realize a doped quantum antiferromagnet with next-nearest neighbour (NNN) tunnelings $t'$ and hard-core bosonic holes using a Rydberg tweezer platform. We utilize coherent dynamics between three Rydberg levels, encoding spins and holes, to implement a tunable bosonic $t$-$J$-$V$ model allowing us to study previously inaccessible parameter regimes. We observe dynamical phase separation between hole and spin domains for $|t/J|\ll 1$, and demonstrate the formation of repulsively bound hole pairs in a variety of spin backgrounds. The interference between NNN tunnelings $t'$ and perturbative pair tunneling gives rise to light and heavy pairs depending on the sign of $t$. Using the single-site control allows us to study the dynamics of a single hole in 2D square lattice (anti)ferromagnets. The model we implement extends the toolbox of Rydberg tweezer experiments beyond spin-1/2 models to a larger class of $t$-$J$ and spin-$1$ models.</description>

      <title>Exact Diagonalization, Matrix Product States and Conformal Perturbation Theory Study of a 3D Ising Fuzzy Sphere Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00842v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Numerical studies of phase transitions in statistical and quantum lattice models provide crucial insights into the corresponding Conformal Field Theories (CFTs). In higher dimensions, comparing finite-volume numerical results to infinite-volume CFT data is facilitated by choosing the sphere $S^{d-1}$ as the spatial manifold. Recently, the fuzzy sphere regulator in Ref. [Zhu et al, Phys. Rev. X 13 021009 (2023)] has enabled such studies with exact rotational invariance, yielding impressive agreement with known 3D Ising CFT predictions, as well as new results. However, systematic improvements and a deeper understanding of finite-size corrections remain essential. In this work, we revisit the fuzzy sphere regulator, focusing on the original Ising model, with two main goals. First, we assess the robustness of this approach using Conformal Perturbation Theory (CPT), to which we provide a detailed guidebook. We demonstrate how CPT provides a unified framework for determining the critical point, the speed of light, and residual deviations from CFT predictions. Applying this framework, we study finite-size corrections and clarify the role of tuning the model in minimizing these effects. Second, we develop a novel method for extracting Operator Product Expansion (OPE) coefficients from fuzzy sphere data. This method leverages the sensitivity of energy levels to detuning from criticality, providing new insights into level mixing and avoided crossings in finite systems. Our work also includes validation of CPT in a 1+1D Ising model away from the integrable limit.</description>

      <title>Fractional Chern insulator states in an isolated flat band of zero Chern number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09009v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A flat band with Chern number $C=0$, and well isolated from the rest of Hilbert space by a gap much larger than interaction strength, is a context that has not been regarded as relevant for fractional quantum Hall physics. In this work, we demonstrate the emergence of the fractional Chern insulator (FCI) states in such a trivial flat band, using large-scale exact diagonalization (ED) and infinite density matrix renormalization group (iDMRG) simulations. The $C=0$ isolated flat band is hosted by an anisotropic fluxed dice lattice. Both the quantum metric and Berry curvature of the $C=0$ flat band have a sharp peak at the $\Gamma$ point, whereas in the rest of the Brillouin zone (BZ) they mimic the quantum geometry of the lowest Landau level. We consider nearest-neighbor repulsion that is weak enough to ensure the isolated-band limit is always satisfied. From the projected ED simulations at $\nu_\mathrm{F}=2/3$ electron filling of the flat band (i.e. $1/3$ hole filling), we find the unexpected FCI with 3-fold ground-state degeneracy and $\sigma_\mathrm{H}=-1/3 (e^2/h)$. The momentum space carrier distribution shows that the quantum metric peak tends to push the interacting holes away from $\Gamma$ point towards the BZ regions with the nearly ``ideal'' quantum geometry, underlying the formation of FCI in the $C=0$ flat band. Besides, when tuning the single-particle anisotropy such that the quantum geometry of the $C=0$ flat band becomes less sharp around $\Gamma$, we find the ground state becomes a charge density wave with tripled unit cell at $\nu_\mathrm{F}=2/3$. Our two-band iDMRG simulations further corroborate the FCI in the isolated $C=0$ flat band, demonstrating in such parameter regime the fractionally quantized charge pumping upon flux insertion as well as the momentum-resolved entanglement spectrum characteristic of the $1/3$ Laughlin state.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Neel temperature and unusual thermal expansion in flux-grown FeCrAs crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21735v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report results from our experimental investigation of the distorted-kagome compound FeCrAs. For this work, we developed a procedure using tin metal as a flux to produce needlelike crystals. The crystals were characterized by single crystal x-ray diffraction as well as measurements of magnetization, electrical transport, and heat capacity. The physical behaviors are generally similar to published results on crystals grown from a stoichiometric melt with two notable exceptions. The Sommerfeld coefficient is found to be 18 mJ/K2/mol, a little more than half of the previously reported value, and the Neel temperature is found to be 150 K, about 25K higher than in previous reports. The reason for these discrepancies are uncertain, but they may be related to differences in stoichiometry or disorder; it is expected that the Cr/Fe ratio has some variability in this compound. In addition, we find unusual thermal expansion behavior, with an anomaly at the Neel temperature and nearly temperature independent thermal expansion along the hexagonal c-axis above this transition. This suggests significant spin-lattice coupling, which may provide insight into non-metallic transport properties that have been associated with anomalous charge carrier scattering.</description>
