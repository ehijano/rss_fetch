      <title>OmniMol: Transferring Particle Physics Knowledge to Molecular Dynamics with Point-Edge Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present OmniMol, a state-of-the-art transformer-based small molecule machine-learned interatomic potential (MLIP). OmniMol is built by adapting Omnilearned, a foundation model for particle jets found in high-energy physics (HEP) experiments such as at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Omnilearned is built with a Point-Edge-Transformer (PET) and pre-trained using a diverse set of one billion particle jets. It includes an interaction-matrix attention bias that injects pairwise sub-nuclear (HEP) or atomic (molecular-dynamics) physics directly into the transformer's attention logits, steering the network toward physically meaningful neighborhoods without sacrificing expressivity. We demonstrate OmniMol using the oMol dataset and find excellent performance even with relatively few examples for fine-tuning. This study lays the foundation for building interdisciplinary connections, given datasets represented as collections of point clouds.</description>

      <title>Chemically decisive benchmarks on the path to quantum utility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Progress towards quantum utility in chemistry requires not only algorithmic advances, but also the identification of chemically meaningful problems whose electronic structure fundamentally challenges classical methods. Here, we introduce a curated hierarchy of chemically decisive benchmark systems designed to probe distinct regimes of electronic correlation relevant to molecular, bioinorganic, and heavy-element chemistry. Moving beyond minimal toy models, our benchmark set spans multireference bond breaking (N$_2$), high-spin transition-metal chemistry (FeS), biologically relevant iron-sulfur clusters ([2Fe-2S]), and actinide-actinide bonding (U$_2$), which exhibits extreme sensitivity to active-space choice, relativistic treatment, and correlation hierarchy even within advanced multireference frameworks. As a concrete realization, we benchmark a recently developed automated and adaptive quantum algorithm based on generator-coordinate-inspired subspace expansion,ADAPT-GCIM, using a black-box workflow that integrates entropy-based active-space selection via the ActiveSpaceFinder tool. Across this chemically diverse problem set, ADAPT-GCIM achieves high accuracy in challenging correlation regimes. Equally importantly, these benchmarks expose general failure modes and design constraints-independent of any specific algorithm-highlighting the necessity of problem-aware and correlation-specific strategies for treating strongly correlated chemistry on quantum computers. To support systematic benchmarking and reproducible comparisons, the Hamiltonians for all systems studied are made openly available.</description>

      <title>The rise and fall of stretched bond errors: Extending the analysis of Perdew-Zunger self-interaction corrections of reaction barrier heights beyond the LSDA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Incorporating self-interaction corrections (SIC) significantly improves chemical reaction barrier height predictions made using density functional theory methods. We present a detailed, orbital-by-orbital analysis of these corrections for three semi-local density functional approximations (DFAs) situated on the three lowest rungs of the Jacob's Ladder of approximations. The analysis is based on Fermi-L\"owdin Orbital Self-Interaction Correction calculations performed at several steps along the reaction pathway from the reactants (R) to the transition state (TS) to the products (P) for four representative reactions selected from the BH76 benchmark set. For all three functionals, the major contribution to self-interaction corrections of the barrier heights can be traced to stretched bond orbitals that develop near the TS configuration. The magnitude of the ratio of the self-exchange-correlation energy to the self-Hartree energy (XC/H) for a given orbital is introduced as an indicator of one-electron self-interaction error. For the exact, but unknown density functional, XC/H = 1.0 for all orbitals, while for the practical DFAs studied here, XC/H spans a range of values. The largest values are obtained for stretched or strongly lobed orbitals. We show that significant differences in XC/H for corresponding orbitals in the R, TS, and P configurations can be used to identify the major contributors to the SIC of barrier heights and reaction energies. Based on such comparisons, we suggest that barrier height predictions made using the SCAN meta-generalized gradient approximation may have attained the best accuracy possible for a semi-local functional using the Perdew-Zunger SIC approach.</description>

      <title>A monolithic fabrication platform for intrinsically stretchable polymer transistors and complementary circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Soft, stretchable organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) can provide powerful on-skin signal conditioning, but current fabrication methods are often material-specific: each new polymer semiconductor (PSC) requires a tailored process. The challenge is even greater for complementary OFET circuits, where two PSCs must be patterned sequentially, which often leads to device degradation. Here, we introduce a universal, monolithic photolithography process that enables high-yield, high-resolution stretchable complementary OFETs and circuits. This approach is enabled by a process-design framework that includes (i) a direct, photopatternable, solvent-resistant, crosslinked dielectric/semiconductor interface, (ii) broadly applicable crosslinked PSC blends that preserve high mobility, and (iii) a patterning strategy that provides simultaneous etch masking and encapsulation. Using this platform, we achieve record integration density for stretchable OTFTs (55,000 cm^-2), channel lengths down to 2 um, and low-voltage operation at 5 V. We demonstrate photopatterning across multiple PSC types and realize complementary circuits, including 3 kHz stretchable ring oscillators, the first to exceed 1 kHz and representing more than a 60-fold increase in stage switching speed over the state of the art. Finally, we demonstrate the first stretchable complementary OTFT neuron circuit, where the output frequency is modulated by the input current to mimic neuronal signal processing. This scalable approach can be readily extended to diverse high-performance stretchable materials, accelerating the development and manufacturing of skin-like electronics.</description>

      <title>De novo emergence of metabolically active protocells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A continuous route from a disordered soup of simple chemical feedstocks to a functional protocell -- a compartment that metabolizes, grows, and propagates -- remains elusive. Here, we show that a homogeneous aqueous chemical mixture containing phosphorus, iron, molybdenum salts and formaldehyde spontaneously self-organizes into compartments that couple robust non-equilibrium chemical dynamics to their own growth. These structures mature to a sustained, dissipative steady state and support an organic synthetic engine, producing diverse molecular species including many core biomolecular classes. Internal spherules that are themselves growth-competent are produced within the protocells, establishing a rudimentary mode of self-perpetuation. The chemical dynamics we observe in controlled laboratory conditions also occur in reaction mixtures exposed to natural day-night cycles. Strikingly, the morphology and chemical composition of the protocells in our experiments closely resemble molybdenum-rich microspheres recently discovered in current oceanic environments. Our work establishes a robust, testable route to de novo protocell formation. The emergence of life-like spatiotemporal organization and chemical dynamics from minimal initial conditions is more facile than previously thought and could be a recurring natural phenomenon.</description>

      <title>In situ and operando laboratory X-ray absorption spectroscopy at high temperature and controlled gas atmosphere with a plug-flow fixed-bed cell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The capabilities of a plug-flow fixed-bed cell for operando studies of heterogeneous catalysts are demonstrated using laboratory-based X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) with a von Hamos spectrometer. The cell operates at temperatures up to 1000 deg C and pressures up to 10 bar, equipped with three mass flow controllers and two infrared lamps for rapid heating under inert/reactive gas atmospheres. Proof-of-principle studies include in situ MnO oxidation in 5% Ni/MnO and operando Ni nanoparticle evolution in 20-NiO/COK-12 (20.2% NiO on SiO2) during CO2 methanation before/after activation. Within 5-15 min per spectrum, oxidation state changes are resolved while catalytic activity is simultaneously quantified by online GC. Extended datasets and methods are available in the ancillary file SI.pdf (Supplementary Information file). A shortened version is submitted to Journal of Analytical Atomic Spectrometry as a Technical Note.</description>

      <title>Chemical Origin of Exciton Self-trapping in Cs$_3$Cu$_2$X$_5$ Cesium Copper Halides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Copper halides Cs3Cu2X5 (X=Cl, Br, I) are promising materials for optoelectronic applications due to their high photoluminescence efficiency, stability, and large Stokes shifts. In this work, we uncover the chemical bonding origin of the Stokes shift in these materials using density functional theory calculations. Upon excitation, one [Cu2X5]3- anion undergoes sizeable local distortions, driven by Cu-X and Cu-Cu bond formation. These structural changes coincide with the formation of a self-trapped exciton, where particularly the hole is strongly localized on one anion. Analysis of the electronic structure and bonding reveals reduced antibonding interactions and enhanced bonding character in the excited state, stabilizing the distorted geometry. Our results establish a direct link between orbital-specific hole localization and bond formation. It provides a fundamental understanding of the excitation mechanism in Cs3Cu2X5 and offers design principles to tune optical properties in 0D copper halides.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking foundation potentials against quantum chemistry methods for predicting molecular redox potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24063v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computational high-throughput virtual screening is essential for identifying redox-active molecules for sustainable applications such as electrochemical carbon capture. A primary challenge in this approach is the high computational cost associated with accurate quantum chemistry calculations. Machine learning foundation potentials (FPs) trained on extensive density functional theory (DFT) calculations offer a computationally efficient alternative. Here, we benchmark the MACE-OMol-0 and UMA FPs against a hierarchy of DFT functionals for predicting experimental molecular redox potentials for both electron transfer (ET) and proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) reactions. We find that these FPs achieve exceptional accuracy for PCET processes, rivaling their target DFT method. However, the performance is diminished for ET reactions, particularly for multi-electron transfers involving reactive ions that are underrepresented in the OMol25 training data, revealing a key out-of-distribution limitation. To overcome this, we propose an optimal hybrid workflow that uses the FPs for efficient geometry optimization and thermochemical analysis, followed by a crucial single-point DFT energy refinement and an implicit solvation correction. This pragmatic approach provides a robust and scalable strategy for accelerating high-throughput virtual screening in sustainable chemistry.</description>

      <title>Structural and Dynamical Crossovers in Dense Electrolytes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03382v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electrostatic interactions fundamentally govern the structure and transport of electrolytes. In concentrated electrolytes, however, electrostatic and steric correlations, together with ion-solvent coupling, give rise to complex behavior, such as underscreening, that remains challenging to explain despite extensive theoretical effort. Using molecular dynamics simulations of primitive electrolytes with and without space-filling solvent particles, we elucidate the structural and dynamical crossovers and their connection that emerge with increasing salt concentration. Explicit-solvent electrolytes exhibit a screening transition from a charge-dominated dilute regime to a density-dominated concentrated regime, accompanied by dynamical crossovers in ion self-diffusion and ion-pair lifetimes. These dynamical crossovers display a marked discontinuity, unlike the smoother variation of the screening crossover, which originates from short-range ion-counterion structures. The pronounced growth of ionic clusters leads to a percolation transition only at higher concentrations, whereas the onset of the structural and dynamical crossovers is associated primarily with local ion pairing or small aggregates. Both structural and dynamical behaviors are found to depend sensitively on ion-solvent coupling: implicit-solvent electrolytes exhibit a screening transition between two charge-dominated regimes, accompanied by qualitatively distinct dynamical behavior. Finally, we demonstrate that the diffusion-corrected ion-pair lifetime provides a consistent descriptor linking ionic structure and dynamics across electrolyte systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.01483v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The photoinduced switching of Fe(II)-based spin-crossover complexes from singlet to quintet takes place at ultrafast time scales. This a priori spin-forbidden transition triggered numerous time-resolved experiments of solvated samples to elucidate the mechanism at play. The involved intermediate states remain uncertain. We apply ultrafast x-ray spectroscopy in molecular films as a method sensitive to spin, electronic, and nuclear degrees of freedom. Combining the progress in molecule synthesis and film growth with the opportunities at x-ray free-electron lasers, we analyze the transient evolution of the Fe L3 fine structure at room temperature. Our measurements and calculations indicate the involvement of an Fe triplet intermediate state. The high-spin state saturates at half of the available molecules, limited by molecule-molecule interaction within the film.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11516v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present Free energy Estimators with Adaptive Transport (FEAT), a novel framework for free energy estimation -- a critical challenge across scientific domains. FEAT leverages learned transports implemented via stochastic interpolants and provides consistent, minimum-variance estimators based on escorted Jarzynski equality and controlled Crooks theorem, alongside variational upper and lower bounds on free energy differences. Unifying equilibrium and non-equilibrium methods under a single theoretical framework, FEAT establishes a principled foundation for neural free energy calculations. Experimental validation on toy examples, molecular simulations, and quantum field theory demonstrates improvements over existing learning-based methods. Our PyTorch implementation is available at https://github.com/jiajunhe98/FEAT.</description>

      <title>A molecule with half-M\"obius topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03516v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stereoisomers of C$_{13}$Cl$_2$ exhibiting helical orbitals around a ring of carbon atoms were synthesized by atom manipulation on NaCl surfaces. We resolved the enantiomeric geometries of the singlet states by atomic force microscopy and mapped their helical orbital densities by scanning tunnelling microscopy. A ${\pi}$-orbital basis of the helical, non-planar singlets that twists by 90{\deg} in one circulation is consistent with a half-M\"obius topology. In such a topology, the ${\pi}$-orbital basis changes sign with respect to two circumnavigations and is periodic with respect to four circumnavigations. A quasiparticle on a ring with this boundary condition could be interpreted as carrying a Berry phase of ${\pi}$/2. We demonstrate reversible switching of the topology, between the two singlets of oppositely threaded half-M\"obius topology, and the planar, topologically trivial, triplet state. Multireference calculations, including large-scale sample-based ab initio calculations executed on quantum hardware, reveal that the switching is associated with a helical pseudo Jahn-Teller effect.</description>
