      <description>arXiv:2602.05197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a general result on the depth of Du Bois complexes of a singular variety. We apply it to prove a conjecture of Mustata-Popa and to study the local cohomological defect, extending results of Ogus and Dao-Takagi over the complex numbers.</description>

      <title>Regions surrounded by parabolas in the plane and trees representing their shapes respecting their natural projection to the line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The author has been interested in regions surrounded by real algebraic curves of degree $1$ or $2$ in the plane. The author is mainly interested in their shapes and combinatorics. This is a fundamental and natural problem in mathematics being also elementary and connected to various fields. The shapes are understood via graphs the regions collapsing to respecting the canonical projection onto the 1st component.
  Our main result is the following: each tree is realized by regions surrounded by parabolas of two types, here.
  Related studies are elementary and interesting and surprisingly, this explicit field is started very recently, by Bodin, Popescu-Pampu and Sorea in the 2020s. After that, this is developing, due to the author. The author also investigates this motivated by studies on explicit construction of real algebraic maps onto the regions locally so-called moment maps: this comes from singularity theory of differentiable maps and real algebraic geometry.</description>

      <title>Generalized nearby cycles via relative and logarithmic $\mathscr{D}$-modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a regular map $F$ from a complex smooth affine variety $X$ to $\mathbb A^r_\mathbb C$, we construct generalized nearby-cycle modules of a regular holonomic $\mathscr D$-modules $\mathcal M$ along log strata with the log structure induced by the graph of $F$, whose relative supports are infinite unions of translated linear subvarieties of $\mathbb C^r$ determined by the zero loci of Bernstein-Sato ideals along monoid ideals. For a fixed log stratum, the nearby-cycle module corresponds to the Sabbah specialization complex of DR$(\mathcal M)$ under the relative regular Riemann-Hilbert correspondence of Fiorot-Fernandes-Sabbah, which generalizes the classical comparison theorem of Kashiwara-Malgrange for Deligne's nearby cycles. As an application, when $\mathcal M=\mathcal O_X$, we give a topological interpretation of the zero loci of Bernstein-Sato ideals of $F$ along monoid ideals under the exponential map, which answers a question of Budur-Shi-Zuo.</description>

      <title>On the boundedness of some real line arrangements of type at most one</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we show that real line arrangements of type at most one, admitting only intersection points of multiplicity at most five, satisfy certain boundedness properties. In particular, we prove that a free real arrangement of $d$ lines with intersection multiplicities bounded by $5$ can have at most $522$ lines and consequently there exist only finitely many combinatorial types of such arrangements.</description>

      <title>Vector bundles on Olsson fans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artin fans are algebro-geometric incarnations of cone complexes. We study weakly convex Olsson fans, generalising Artin fans in two ways: first, they admit lineality spaces, thus including tropical tori as well; second, they are defined over a base logarithmic scheme, thus providing a relative version of equivariant toric geometries. We determine conditions under which Olsson fans are well-behaved, in the sense that their geometry is determined combinatorially. We undertake the study of quasicoherent sheaves, and in particular vector bundles, on Olsson fans: we describe their moduli stack in the case of a (subdivided) cone, and some failures of algebraicity in the general case; Weyl convexity shows up naturally in this context.</description>

      <title>A Dieudonn\'e theory for analytic p-divisible groups and applications to Shimura varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study families of analytic $p$-divisible groups over adic spaces $S$ defined over $\mathbb{Q}_p$. We prove an equivalence between such families and Hodge-Tate triples, generalizing a theorem of Fargues. For a perfectoid space $S$, we construct a functor associating to an analytic $p$-divisible group $\mathcal{G} \rightarrow S$ a coherent sheaf $\mathcal{E}(\mathcal{G})$ on the relative Fargues--Fontaine curve $X_S$. Restricting to analytic $p$-divisible groups admitting a Cartier dual, we obtain an equivalence of categories with local shtukas satisfying a minuscule condition, compatible with the prismatic Dieudonn\'e theory of Ansch\"utz--Le Bras. We conclude with applications to moduli spaces: we show that the local Shimura varieties of EL and PEL types of Scholze--Weinstein are moduli spaces of analytic $p$-divisible groups with extra structure, and we give a reinterpretation of the Hodge--Tate period map of Scholze in terms of topologically $p$-torsion subgroups of abelian varieties.</description>

      <title>Algebro-geometric bootstrapping from OPE decoupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We conjecture that decoupling relations in the operator product expansion of a 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal field theory (SCFT) are encoded by an algebro-geometric object: a bifiltered affine scheme. We demonstrate how this scheme reproduces the Macdonald index (thus the Schur index) as well as the Higgs branch. Although the associated scheme typically admits continuous deformations, we find that a geometric extremization principle uniquely fixes these moduli, thereby providing a possible geometric route toward a classification of 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ SCFTs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.04978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the global analogue of the Fargues-Fontaine curve over function fields $F$. We prove some foundational results about its moduli of $G$-bundles $\operatorname{Bun}_{G,F}$, which is a geometrization of the global Kottwitz set $B(F,G)$. For example, $\operatorname{Bun}_{G,F}$ plays the role of Igusa stacks over function fields. We use $\operatorname{Bun}_{G,F}$ to reformulate the global Langlands conjecture for $G$ over $F$ in terms of categorical local Langlands, refining conjectures of Arinkin-Gaitsgory-Kazhdan-Raskin-Rozenblyum-Varshavsky and Zhu. Finally, we verify this conjecture when $G$ is commutative. Along the way, we prove a GAGA theorem for smooth proper schemes over sousperfectoid spaces, which is of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Causal Representation Meets Stochastic Modeling under Generic Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning meaningful causal representations from observations has emerged as a crucial task for facilitating machine learning applications and driving scientific discoveries in fields such as climate science, biology, and physics. This process involves disentangling high-level latent variables and their causal relationships from low-level observations. Previous work in this area that achieves identifiability typically focuses on cases where the observations are either i.i.d. or follow a latent discrete-time process. Nevertheless, many real-world settings require identifying latent variables that are continuous-time stochastic processes (e.g., multivariate point processes). To this end, we develop identifiable causal representation learning for continuous-time latent stochastic point processes. We study its identifiability by analyzing the geometry of the parameter space. Furthermore, we develop MUTATE, an identifiable variational autoencoder framework with a time-adaptive transition module to infer stochastic dynamics. Across simulated and empirical studies, we find that MUTATE can effectively answer scientific questions, such as the accumulation of mutations in genomics and the mechanisms driving neuron spike triggers in response to time-varying dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.05097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present new constructions of quasi-cyclic (QC) and generalized quasi-cyclic (GQC) codes from algebraic curves. Unlike previous approaches based on elliptic curves, our method applies to curves that are Kummer extensions of the rational function field, including hyperelliptic, norm-trace, and Hermitian curves. This allows QC codes with flexible co-index. Explicit parameter formulas are derived using known automorphism-group classifications.</description>

      <title>Rational Interpreters for Discrete Dynamics: Existence, Exactness, and Decomposition over $p$-adic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address an inverse problem in non-Archimedean dynamics: given a finite discrete dynamical system (equivalently, a functional graph on $N$ states), construct a continuous $p$-adic dynamical system whose residue-level behavior reproduces the prescribed transitions. Using the cylinder partition of $\mathcal{O}_K$ (viewed as \emph{Witt cylinders} for unramified $K/\mathbb{Q}_p$), we encode states by pairwise disjoint closed balls and formalize an \textbf{interpreter} as a map sending each state ball into its target ball.
  Our main existence result constructs rational interpreters that are analytic (hence pole-free) on the prescribed state cylinders, combining rigid-analytic Runge approximation with finite interpolation constraints. Under a linear-dominance condition on each cylinder, ball images are explicit and locally affine, leading to a robust classification of discrete behavior into contractive, indifferent, and expansive regimes. Good reduction provides a selection principle for natural interpreters; effective degree and height bounds for general rational interpreters remain open.
  For composite alphabets we prove a \textbf{Dynamic Chinese Remainder Theorem} for congruence-preserving systems: the CRT isomorphism $\Theta:\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}\xrightarrow{\sim}\prod_i\mathbb{Z}/p_i^{k_i}\mathbb{Z}$ (for $m=\prod p_i^{k_i}$) yields a factorization of the \emph{dynamics} (equivalently, the functional graph) on $\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}$ into dynamics on the prime-power components, compatible with reduction. Finally, we discuss an inverse-limit (profinite) extension: compatible towers define a $1$-Lipschitz map on $\mathbb{Z}_p$, while selecting compatible analytic/rational interpreters across levels becomes a separate problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.05652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For an even, integral hyperbolic lattice $L$, the symmetry group of $L$ is the quotient of the group of isometries of $L$ by the Weyl subgroup of $(-2)$-reflections. Following Nikulin, the exceptional lattice of $L$ is defined as the sublattice generated by elements that have finite orbit under the symmetry group of $L$. We prove that every hyperbolic lattice of rank at least $46$ has trivial exceptional lattice. In particular, every such lattice admits a symmetry of maximal Salem degree.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.05761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the diagonal F-thresholds of determinantal hypersurfaces arising from a generic matrix and from a generic symmetric matrix, as well as of the Pfaffian hypersurface arising from a generic skew-symmetric matrix of even size. The main ingredient is a cohomology vanishing theorem for certain line bundles on flag varieties in characteristic $p$. In the cases of the generic matrix and the generic skew-symmetric matrix, we show that the diagonal F-threshold attains its minimal possible value, namely the negative of the a-invariant. The symmetric case is more subtle and relies in addition on a polynomiality result for representations afforded by cohomology, building on work of the second author with VandeBogert.</description>

Abstract: We establish a function field analogue of Mertens' formula for Euler products restricted to primes in arithmetic progressions over the polynomial ring F_q[t]. Our results are in direct correspondence with those of Languasco and Zaccagnini for arithmetic progressions in the integers.
  Over function fields, Weil's Riemann hypothesis for Dirichlet L-functions holds unconditionally, and consequently the analogue of the GRH-strength asymptotic is obtained without any exceptional zero correction term.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a field, $L$ a finite Galois extension of $K$, and $X$ an abelian variety defined over $L$. If $X$ is isogenous over $L$ to an abelian variety defined over $K$, then the $\ell$-adic Galois representations associated to $X$ extend to representations $\bar{\rho}_{\ell,X}:\mathrm{Gal}(\bar{L}/K)\to\mathrm{Aut}(V_\ell X)$ for every prime $\ell$. This paper aims to show that the converse is true for abelian varieties of Type I, with some supplementary conditions needed on the endomorphisms of $X$, when $L$ is either a number field or a function field of prime characteristic different from $2$.</description>

      <title>Convex unions and completions from simplicial pseudomanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While intersections of convex sets are convex, their unions have rather complicated behavior. Some natural contexts where they appear include duality arguments involving boundaries of convex sets and valuations, which have an Euler characteristic-like structure. However, there are certain settings where the convexity property itself is important to consider. For example, this includes (preservation of) positivity properties of divisors on toric varieties under blowdowns. In the case of (restrictions of) conormal bundles, this can be interpreted in terms of interactions between local convexity data stored in rational equivalence relations. We consider generalizations to realizations of simplicial pseudomanifolds and replace rational equivalence with effects of PL homeomorphisms.
  Decomposing the PL homeomorphisms into edge subdivisions and contractions, we characterize the space of suitable contraction points compatible with local convexity properties in terms of convex unions and completions. This gives rise to certain external edge subdivisions that make this ``contraction space'' of the starting edge empty, which is unexpected given the expected ``increased convexity'' from edge subdivisions. We also obtain strong affine/linear restrictions on realizations of facets containing nearby edges preserving local convexity. This implies that contracting certain nearby edges results in a very large or very small contraction space of the starting edge. As for boundary behavior, there are parallels between effects of PL homeomorphisms on induced 4-cycles in the 1-skeleton. Finally, we find effects of PL homeomorphisms and suspensions on analogues of local convexity properties stored by linear systems of parameters. This indicates that simplicial spheres PL homeomorphic to the boundary of a cross polytope store record local convexity changes in the most natural way.</description>

      <title>$A$-hypergeometric Series with Parameters in the Core</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11085v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss the computational approach to the results established by Okuyama and Saito. Although their results are often difficult to compute, we prove that, when the negative support of a fake exponent $v$ with respect to a generic weight $w$ is included in a certain set, solutions can be computed using only the reduced Gr\"{o}bner basis, and we can construct all $A$-hypergeometric series with exponent $v$ in the direction $w$ by Frobenius's method. As an example, we describe the Aomoto-Gel'fand system of type $3 \times 3$ in details.</description>

Abstract: For $G$ a connected linear algebraic group over a $p$-adic field, we show that the action of $G(\mathbb{B}^+_{\mathrm{dR}})$ on each Schubert cell in the $\mathbb{B}_{\mathrm{dR}}^+$-affine Grassmannian is transitive in the \'{e}tale topology on affinoid perfectoids, generalizing a result in the reductive case due to Fargues and Scholze.</description>

      <title>Toward the noncommutative minimal model program for Fano varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20739v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the noncommutative minimal model program, as proposed by Halpern-Leistner, for Fano varieties. We construct lifts of Iritani's quantum cohomology central charge in the following examples: Grassmannians, smooth quadrics, and smooth cubic threefolds and fourfolds. Moreover, we verify that these lifted paths are quasi-convergent and give rise to the expected semiorthogonal decompositions of the bounded derived category. We also construct geometric stability conditions in the examples above and observe that, after suitable isomonodromic deformation of the quantum cohomology central charge, the quasi-convergent paths for Grassmannians and quadrics can be chosen to start in the geometric region.</description>

      <title>Polylogarithmic motivic Chabauty-Kim for $\mathbb{P}^1 \setminus \{ 0,1,\infty \}$: the geometric step via resultants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07400v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a finite set $S$ of distinct primes, we propose a method to construct polylogarithmic motivic Chabauty-Kim functions for $\mathbb{P}^1 \setminus \{ 0,1,\infty \}$ using resultants. For a prime $p\not\in S$, the vanishing loci of the images of such functions under the $p$-adic period map contain the solutions of the $S$-unit equation. In the case $\vert S\vert=2$, we explicitly construct a non-trivial motivic Chabauty-Kim function in depth 6 of degree 18, and prove that there do not exist any other Chabauty-Kim functions with smaller depth and degree. The method, inspired by work of Dan-Cohen and the first author, enhances the geometric step algorithm developed by Corwin and Dan-Cohen, providing a more efficient approach.</description>

      <title>On the multiplier spectrum of polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13437v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove several results on the multiplier spectrum of polynomials. We provide a detailed proof of the theorem stating that the multiplier spectrum morphism is generically injective on the moduli space of polynomials. We obtain a description of the non-injective locus of the multiplier spectrum morphism for polynomials of degree $d\geq2$. Roughly speaking, we prove that, apart from isolated exceptions, polynomials with the same multiplier spectrum are intertwined. More precisely, we show that, up to iteration and isolated exceptions, the polynomials are either equivalent or related by Ritt moves. We also investigate the relationship between Ritt moves and multiplier spectra over arithmetic progressions.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Geometry for Spin-Adapted Coupled Cluster Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16646v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop and numerically analyze an algebraic-geometric framework for spin-adapted coupled-cluster (CC) theory. Since the electronic Hamiltonian is SU(2)-invariant, physically relevant quantum states lie in the spin singlet sector. We give an explicit description of the SU(2)-invariant (spin singlet) many-body space by identifying it with an Artinian commutative ring, called the excitation ring, whose dimension is governed by a Narayana number. We define spin-adapted truncation varieties via embeddings of graded subspaces of this ring, and we identify the CCS truncation variety with the Veronese square of the Grassmannian. Compared to the spin-generalized formulation, this approach yields a substantial reduction in dimension and degree, with direct computational consequences. In particular, the CC degree of the truncation variety -- governing the number of homotopy paths required to compute all CC solutions -- is reduced by orders of magnitude. We present scaling studies demonstrating asymptotic improvements and we exploit this reduction to compute the full solution landscape of spin-adapted CC equations for water and lithium hydride.</description>
