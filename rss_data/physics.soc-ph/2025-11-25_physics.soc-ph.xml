      <title>Modeling Novel Oral Nicotine Use Among Adolescents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Novel oral nicotine products, particularly nicotine pouches, have rapidly gained popularity among adolescents. Among U.S. high school students, nicotine pouch use has doubled since 2021, with 2.4% reporting current use in 2024. We analyzed Florida Youth Tobacco Survey data from 2022-2024 to assess prevalence trends and developed a grade-structured compartmental model to project future trajectories and evaluate intervention strategies. The model accurately captured observed trends across all high school grades and projected continued growth without intervention. We evaluated single and multi-parameter intervention strategies. Single-parameter interventions demonstrated limited effectiveness while multi-parameter strategies showed substantial effects. These findings underscore the need for comprehensive, multi-faceted interventions incorporating prevention education, cessation support, policy enforcement, and peer influence modification. Grade-specific targeting can enhance overall program effectiveness. School-based interventions should be implemented rapidly to address the accelerating epidemic of oral nicotine use among adolescents.</description>

      <title>Predicting Healthcare Provider Engagement in SMS Campaigns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As digital communication grows in importance when connecting with healthcare providers, traditional behavioral and content message features are imbued with renewed significance. If one is to meaningfully connect with them, it is crucial to understand what drives them to engage and respond. In this study, the authors analyzed several million text messages sent through the Impiricus platform to learn which factors influenced whether or not a doctor clicked on a link in a message. Several key insights came to light through the use of logistic regression, random forest, and neural network models, the details of which the authors discuss in this paper.</description>

      <title>Decision-Making under Negativity Bias: Double Hysteresis in the Opinion-Dependent $q$-Voter Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Negative information often exerts a disproportionately strong impact on human decision-making, a phenomenon known as the negativity bias. In behavioral economics, this effect is formally captured by Prospect Theory, which posits that losses loom larger than equivalent gains. For example, a single negative product review can outweigh numerous positive ones, reflecting this principle of loss aversion in consumer behavior. While this psychological effect has been widely documented, its implications for collective opinion dynamics, critical for understanding market stability and reputation dynamics, remain poorly understood. Here, we generalize the $q$-voter model with independence by introducing opinion-dependent influence group sizes, $q_+$ and $q_-$, which represent the social reinforcement needed to change an opinion from negative to positive and from positive to negative, respectively. We study two versions of this asymmetric model: a baseline model that reduces to the standard $q$-voter model when $q_+ = q_- = q$, and an extended model that incorporates an additional asymmetry expressed as a preference for one opinion. In its reduced version, this represents a minimal model in terms of non-linearity within the $q$-voter framework that allows for discontinuous phase transitions and hysteresis. Using mean-field analysis and computer simulations, we show that these modifications lead to rich collective behaviors, including double hysteresis, one form of which is irreversible, providing a mechanism for path-dependence and the sustained, irrecoverable damage to collective sentiment, brand equity, or market confidence.</description>

      <title>Open networks in discrete time: Passing vs blocking behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a unified framework for analyzing the input-output behavior of discrete time complex networks viewed as open systems. Importantly, we focus on systems that are inherently modeled in discrete time-such as opinion dynamics, Markov chains, diffusion on networks, and population models-reflecting their natural formulation in many real-world contexts. By an open network, we mean one that is coupled to its environment, through both external signals that are received by designated input nodes and response signals that are released back into the environment via a separate set of output nodes. We develop a general framework for characterizing whether such networks amplify (pass) or suppress (block) the external inputs. Our approach combines the transfer function of the network with the discrete time controllability Gramian, using the H2-norm to quantify signal amplification. We introduce a computationally efficient network index based on the Gramian trace and eigenvalues, enabling scalable comparisons across network topologies. Application of our method to a broad set of empirical networks, spanning biological, technological, and ecological domains, uncovers consistent structural signatures associated with passing or blocking behavior. These findings shed light on how the network architecture and the particular selection of input and output nodes shape information flow in real-world systems, with broad implications for control, signal processing, and network design.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Parametric Car-Following Models in Naturalistic Congestion: Insights in Driver Behavior and Model Limitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Car-Following is a broadly studied state of driving, and many modeling approaches through various heuristics and engineering methods have been proposed. Congestion is a common traffic phenomenon also widely investigated, both from macroscopic and microscopic perspectives. Yet, current literature lack a unified evaluation of Car-Following models with naturalistic congestion data. This paper compares the performance of five parametric Car-Following models: IDM, ACC, Gipps, OVM, and FVDM, using a rich naturalistic congestion dataset. The five models in question is found to perform similarly when optimized over the same RMSNE metric. Sub-sequences of Car-Following where models noticeably disagree with driver behavior is noticed and separately investigated. A review of corresponding front-facing and cabin video data reveals distraction and driving with momentum as potential reasons for model-reality difference. We further show that drivers often employ coasting and idle creep under Car-Following in different speed ranges, which existing parametric models fail to capture. Finally, time-series clustering is performed and analysis of result clusters align with empirical findings.
  Our findings highlight the necessity to consider vehicle dynamical properties including coasting and idle creep abilities, which drivers take extensive use of under low speed congestions. Future research could integrate such parameters with traditional parametric models to improve congestion modeling performance. We also suggest future research into investigating temporal correlations between clustered blocks to reveal behavioral transition patterns exhibited by drivers in congestions.

      <title>A Mathematical Model of Opinion Dynamics with Application to Vaccine Denial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Public health outcomes can be heavily influenced by the landscape of public opinion; hence, it is important to understand how that landscape changes over time. For one, opinions on public health issues are responsive to official pronouncements, whether from the governmental or professional medical establishments. Additionally, in today's world of high speed communication, opinion can also be highly responsive to the broadcast opinions of "influencers" whose large numbers of followers assure them of a broad reach. To understand the opinion landscape in a general sense, we develop an ordinary differential equation model for opinion change that is based primarily on attraction to the opinions of prominent sources. The individual opinion change model is then used to develop a Fokker-Planck-type partial differential equation model for the overall opinion landscape. This model is shown to have a stable equilibrium solution, and the dependence of the equilibrium solution on key model parameters is illustrated with examples based on opinion regarding vaccination.</description>

      <title>The planar Lanchester model of insurgent warfare: Intricate Collateral Damage Functions and Global Bifurcation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most notable aspects of mathematical modeling is that it sheds light on the complexities arising from changes in parameters and their real-world implications, thus gaining better insight into the dynamics of economic, political, and security phenomena. Moreover, modifications to mathematical modeling will set the stage for embedding new features into the system and enriching the assessment of our analysis. In the case of the Lanchester model of warfare, the introduction of the collateral damage function was an attempt to turn the model into a more realistic framework for understanding counter-insurgencies and irregular battles. In this article, we focus on addressing the impact of sophisticated collateral damage functions in a modified Lanchester model of combat, which reflects the multifaceted nature of warfare. This analysis shows the possibility of global bifurcations and their repercussions for the combat situation between two players. Finally, we assess the codimension two bifurcation analysis of our system based on the interaction between collateral damage and the effectiveness of targeting insurgents.</description>

      <title>The Effects of Remote Working on Scientific Collaboration and Impact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic shifted academic collaboration from in-person to remote interactions. This study explores, for the first time, the effects on scientific collaborations and impact of such a shift, comparing research output before, during, and after the pandemic. Using large-scale bibliometric data, we track the evolution of collaboration networks and the resulting impact of research over time. Our findings are twofold: first, the geographic distribution of collaborations significantly shifted, with a notable increase in cross-border partnerships after 2020, indicating a reduction in the constraints of geographic proximity. Second, despite the expansion of collaboration networks, there was a concerning decline in citation impact, suggesting that the absence of spontaneous in-person interactions-which traditionally foster deep discussions and idea exchange-negatively affected research quality. As hybrid work models in academia gain traction, this study highlights the need for universities and research organizations to carefully consider the balance between remote and in-person engagement.</description>

      <title>Misinformation Dynamics in Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Information transmitted across modern communication platforms is degraded not only by intentional manipulation (disinformation) but also by intrinsic cognitive decay and topology-dependent social averaging (misinformation). We develop a continuous-fidelity field theory on multiplex networks with distinct layers representing private chats, group interactions, and broadcast channels. Our analytic solutions reveal three universal mechanisms controlling information quality: (i) groupthink blending, where dense group coupling drives fidelity to the initial group mean; (ii) bridge-node bottlenecks, where cross-community flow produces irreversible dilution; and (iii) a network-wide fidelity landscape set by a competition between broadcast truth-injection and structural degradation pathways. These results demonstrate that connectivity can reduce information integrity and establish quantitative control strategies to enhance fidelity in large-scale communication systems.</description>

      <title>Arriving Young, Leaving Old(er): Age-Structured International Migration on Subnational Scale in Austria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modelling migration is complicated, as people move for many reasons. Some leave their country for the first time, others return to places they once called home, or move on to new destinations. However, most models focus only on who arrives, missing the full picture of how migrant populations evolve. We introduce a model for diaspora flows that estimates both arrivals and exits using daily migration flow rates, disaggregated by age and nationality. Drawing on high-resolution administrative data from Austria covering over 1.8 million foreign nationals, the model allocates these movements across more than 2,000 municipalities based on the size of local diaspora communities. We find that exits are not exceptions but a consistent and predictable feature across all groups. Migration rejuvenates Austria's population, as both arriving and departing migrants are younger than the average resident. This effect has distinct age-geography patterns: younger migrants are drawn to cities, while older migrants are more evenly distributed in the country. By capturing both arrivals and exits simultaneously, our approach provides a more comprehensive and interpretable picture of migration dynamics, how populations change over time, and how they are influenced by space, age, and national origins.</description>

      <title>Trade-Off Between Multiplicity and Specificity in the Inter-layer Connectivity of non-identical Multilayer Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the coupled dynamics of multilayer networks with symmetric (MLs) and asymmetric (MLas) inter-layer connections. The symmetric inter-layer connections arise from a one-to-one correspondence between the nodes of different layers. In contrast, asymmetry results from the multiplicity of inter-layer connections, achieved by randomizing the links while preserving their overall density, thereby allowing one-to-many inter-layer connections. We investigate how different types of inter-layer coupling impact the dynamics of non-identical multilayer networks. We find that the specificity of one-to-one inter-layer connections facilitates intra-layer synchronization (ILS). In contrast, for networks with random inter-layer connectivity, ILS depends on how randomness affects intra-layer homomorphism (the set of permutations that preserve the network structure). Furthermore, amplitude death (AD) in MLs is observed at lower connectivity strength and frequency mismatch than the MLas. Moreover, AD in MLs depends on the density and topology, but does not depend on the size of the networks. On the other hand, AD in MLas is influenced by network size in addition to density, topology, and inter-layer mismatches. Moreover, both the MLs and MLas exhibit multi-stability, with the faster layer exhibiting a remanent periodic phase-locked oscillation, irrespective of the topology and inter-layer connectivity. In addition, remnant synchrony between nodes with homomorphic relationships is observed in the slower layer. Overall, we propose that symmetric inter-layer connections should be preferable for achieving intra-layer synchronization-regardless of global synchronization-and for sustaining permanent memory in multilayer networks with mismatched nodes across layers. However, to mitigate AD at low coupling values and layer mismatch, asymmetric inter-layer connectivity is more advantageous.</description>

      <title>Decarbonization pathways for liquid fuels: A multi-sector energy system perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-carbon liquid fuels play a key role in energy system decarbonization scenarios. This study uses a multi-sector capacity expansion model of the contiguous United States to examine fuels production in deeply decarbonized energy systems. Our analysis evaluates how the shares of biofuels, synthetic fuels, and fossil liquid fuels change under varying assumptions about resource constraints (biomass and CO2 sequestration availability), fuel demand distributions, and supply flexibility to produce different fuel products. Across all scenarios examined, biofuels provide a substantial share of liquid fuel supply, while synthetic fuels deploy only when biomass or CO2 sequestration is assumed to be more limited. Fossil liquid fuels remain in all scenarios examined, primarily driven by the extent to which their emissions can be offset with removals. Limiting biomass increases biogenic CO2 capture within biofuel pathways, while limiting sequestration availability increases the share of captured atmospheric (including biogenic) carbon directed toward utilization for synthetic fuel production. While varying assumptions about liquid fuel demand distributions and fuel product supply flexibility alter competition among individual fuel production technologies, broader energy system outcomes are robust to these assumptions. Biomass and CO2 sequestration availability are key drivers of energy system outcomes in deeply decarbonized energy systems.</description>

      <title>Twenty-Five Years of the Intelligent Driver Model: Foundations, Extensions, Applications, and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05909v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Intelligent Driver Model (IDM), proposed in 2000, has become a foundational tool in traffic flow modeling, renowned for its simplicity, computational efficiency, and ability to capture diverse traffic dynamics. Over the past 25 years, IDM has significantly advanced car-following theory and found extensive application in intelligent transportation systems, including driver assistance systems and autonomous vehicle control. However, IDM's deterministic framework and simplified assumptions face limitations in addressing real-world complexities such as stochastic variability, driver heterogeneity, and mixed traffic conditions. This paper provides a systematic review and critical reflection on IDM's theoretical foundations, academic influence, practical applications, and model extensions. While highlighting IDM's contributions, we emphasize the need to extend the model into a modular and extensible framework. Future directions include integrating stochastic elements, human behavioral insights, and hybrid modeling approaches that combine physics-based structures with data-driven methodologies. By reimagining IDM as a flexible modeling basis, this paper aims to inspire its continued development to meet the demands of intelligent, connected, and increasingly complex traffic systems.</description>

      <title>When Does Population Diversity Matter? A Unified Framework for Binary-Choice Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03665v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a modeling framework for binary-choice dynamics in which agents update their states using two mechanisms selected based on individual preference drawn from an arbitrary distribution. We compare annealed dynamics, where preferences change over time, and quenched dynamics, where they remain fixed. Our framework bridges gaps between existing models and provides a systematic approach to assess when individual-level diversity affects collective dynamics and when it can be effectively ignored. We identify a constraint on transition probabilities that makes annealed and quenched dynamics equivalent. We show that when this condition is satisfied, the quenched dynamics reduces to a one-dimensional system, ruling out oscillatory behavior that may otherwise emerge.</description>

      <title>Collective contributions to polarization in political voting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02496v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Politics around the world exhibits increasing polarization, demonstrated in part by rigid voting configurations in institutions like legislatures or courts. The crux of polarization is separation along a unidimensional ideological axis, an example of a statistical physics problem showing emergent collective order. Thus, we extend a foundational, statistical physics framework, restricted Boltzmann machines, to model institutional voting. The models are minimally parameterized, fit voting data well, and have parameters that transparently give vote probabilities -- all points in contrast to standard approaches. To obtain the model, we account for multi-dimensional voter preferences and the context in which such preferences are expressed to disentangle individual from collective contributions; for example, legislative bills can negotiate multiple issues, whose appeal adds up or competes for individual votes. With the example of U.S. Senate voting, we find that senators have multi-dimensional preferences, and, as one consequence, non-polarized coalitions coexist with polarized ones. Additionally, polarization is predominantly explained by fewer votes that elicit bipartisan coalitions. We show that these accounts can be consistent, if far more parsimonious, than emergent order from interactions. This highlights the collective choice of the content and the rules of voting as essential to the ebb and flow of polarization, which is naturally accounted for by a statistical physics approach.</description>

      <title>Assessment of deep learning models integrated with weather and environmental variables for wildfire spread prediction and a case study of the 2023 Maui fires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21327v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predicting the spread of wildfires is essential for effective fire management and risk assessment. With the fast advancements of artificial intelligence (AI), various deep learning models have been developed and utilized for wildfire spread prediction. However, there is limited understanding of the advantages and limitations of these models, and it is also unclear how deep learning-based fire spread models can be compared with existing non-AI fire models. In this work, we assess the ability of five typical deep learning models integrated with weather and environmental variables for wildfire spread prediction based on over ten years of wildfire data in the state of Hawaii. We further use the 2023 Maui fires as a case study to compare the best deep learning models with a widely-used fire spread model, FARSITE. The results show that two deep learning models, i.e., ConvLSTM and ConvLSTM with attention, perform the best among the five tested AI models. FARSITE shows higher precision, lower recall, and higher F1-score than the best AI models, while the AI models offer higher flexibility for the input data. By integrating AI models with an explainable AI method, we further identify important weather and environmental factors associated with the 2023 Maui wildfires.</description>

      <title>Friendship-paradox paradox: Do most people's friends really have more friends than they do?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13957v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The classical friendship paradox asserts that, on average, an individual's neighbors have a higher degree than the individual. This statement concerns network-level means and does not describe how often a typical node is locally dominated by its neighbors. Motivated by this distinction, we develop a framework that separates mean-based friendship paradox inequalities from two majority-type quantities: a global fraction measuring how many nodes have a degree smaller than the mean degree of their neighbors, and a local fraction based on hub centrality that measures how many nodes are dominated in a median-based sense. We show that neither fraction is constrained by the classical friendship paradox and that they can behave independently of each other. A simple example and two empirical networks illustrate how quadrant patterns in the joint distribution of a node's degree and its neighbors' degree determine the signs and magnitudes of the two fractions, and how left- or right-skewed degree distributions of neighboring nodes can yield opposite conclusions for mean-based and median-based comparisons. The resulting framework offers a clearer distinction between population averages and local majority relations and provides a foundation for future analyses of local advantage, disadvantage, and perception asymmetry in complex networks.</description>

      <title>A Network-Based Measure of Cosponsorship Influence on Bill Passing in the United States House of Representatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19554v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Each year, the United States Congress considers thousands of legislative proposals to select bills to present to the US President to sign into law. Naturally, the decision processes of members of Congress are subject to peer influence. In this paper, we examine the effect on bill passage of accrued influence between US Congress members in the US House of Representatives. We explore how the influence of a bill's cosponsors affects the bill's outcome (specifically, whether or not it passes in the House). We define a notion of influence by analyzing the structure of a network that we construct using cosponsorship dynamics. We award `influence' between a pair of Congress members when they cosponsor a bill that achieves some amount of legislative success. We find that properties of the bill cosponsorship network can be a useful signal to examine influence in Congress; they help explain why some bills pass and others fail. We compare our measure of influence to off-the-shelf centrality measures and conclude that our influence measure is more indicative of bill passage.</description>

      <title>Easy-access online social media metrics are associated with misinformation sharing activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15186v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Misinformation poses a significant challenge studied extensively by researchers, yet acquiring data to identify primary sharers is time-consuming and challenging. To address this, we propose a low-barrier approach to differentiate social media users who are more likely to share misinformation from those who are less likely. Leveraging insights from previous studies, we demonstrate that easy-access online social network metrics-average daily tweet count, and account age-can be leveraged to help identify potential low factuality content spreaders on X (previously known as Twitter). We find that higher tweet frequency is positively associated with low factuality in shared content, while account age is negatively associated with it. We also find that some of the effects differ depending on the number of accounts a user follows. Our findings show that relying on these easy-access social network metrics could serve as a low-barrier approach for initial identification of users who are more likely to spread misinformation, and therefore contribute to combating misinformation effectively on social media platforms.</description>
