      <title>Numerical simulations of electron acceleration driven by heavy ion beams in plasma with alternating density gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasma-Based Acceleration (PBA) has been demonstrated using laser, electron, and proton drivers. However, significant challenges remain in achieving high efficiency, stable acceleration, and scalable energy gain. Heavy ion beam drivers, with their high kinetic energy, offer the potential for greater energy transfer to the witness beam. Unfortunately, limited by the relatively low velocity of heavy ion, the dephasing length is really short leading to a low energy gain of the witness beam. Conventional method that increase plasma density linearly is ineffective in this context because the mismatch between the RMS beam radius and plasma wavelength will make the wakefield degrade or even disappear. In this paper, we propose a method that periodically switches the witness beam between different accelerating phase, allowing it to shift between adjacent accelerating cavities. Therefore, the plasma density does not only strictly increase, but also decrease. This will help maintain the structure of wakefield and increase the energy gain of the witness beam.</description>

      <title>A Compact Low-level RF Control System for Advanced Concept Compact Electron Linear Accelerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10623v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A compact low-level RF (LLRF) control system based on RF system-on-chip (RFSoC) technology has been designed for the Advanced Concept Compact Electron Linear-accelerator (ACCEL) program, which has challenging requirements in both RF performance and size, weight and power consumption (SWaP). The compact LLRF solution employs the direct RF sampling technique of RFSoC, which samples the RF signals directly without any analogue up and down conversion. Compared with the conventional heterodyne based architecture used for LLRF system of linear accelerator (LINAC), the elimination of analogue mixers can significantly reduce the size and weight of the system, especially with LINAC requires a larger number of RF channels. Based on the requirements of ACCEL, a prototype LLRF platform has been developed, and the control schemes have been proposed. The prototype LLRF system demonstrated magnitude and phase fluctuation levels below 1% and 1 degree, on the flat top of a 2 microseconds RF pulse. The LLRF control schemes proposed for ACCEL are implemented with a prototype hardware platform. This paper will introduce the new compact LLRF solution and summarize a selection of experimental test results of the prototype itself and with the accelerating structure cavities designed for ACCEL.</description>

      <title>Construction of approximate invariants for non-integrable Hamiltonian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07568v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a method to construct high-order polynomial approximate invariants (AI) for non-integrable Hamiltonian dynamical systems, and apply it to modern ring-based particle accelerators. Taking advantage of a special property of one-turn transformation maps in the form of a square matrix, AIs can be constructed order-by-order iteratively. Evaluating AI with simulation data, we observe that AI's fluctuation is actually a measure of chaos. Through minimizing the fluctuations with control knobs in accelerators, the stable region of long-term motions could be enlarged.</description>

      <title>Plasma Accelerator For Decaying Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23668v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a plasma wakefield acceleration scheme capable of boosting initially subrelativistic particles to relativistic velocities within millimeter-scale distances. A subluminal light pulse drives a wake whose velocity is continuously matched to the beam speed through a tailored plasma density, thereby extending the dephasing length. We develop a theoretical model that is generalizable across particle mass, initial velocity, and the particular accelerating bucket being used, and we verify its accuracy with particle-in-cell simulations using laser drivers with energies in the Joule range.</description>
