      <title>Crystal growth at a liquid-liquid interface upon drop impact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The crystallisation that occurs when a drop is placed in contact with a cold surface is a particularly challenging phenomenon to capture experimentally and describe theoretically. The situation of a liquid-liquid interface, where crystals appear on a mobile interface is scarcely studied although it provides a defect-free interface. In this paper, we quantify the dynamics of crystals appearing upon the impact of a drop on a cool liquid bath. We rationalize our observations with a model considering that crystals appear at a constant rate depending on the thermal shock on the expanding interface. This model provides dimensionless curves on the number and the surface area of crystals that we compare to our experimental measurements.</description>

      <title>Convective regimes of internally heated steady thermal convection of temperature-dependent viscous fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study dynamical regimes of thermal convection with temperature-dependent viscosity driven by homogeneous internal heating. Two-dimensional steady-state convective solutions with the Frank-Kamenetskii viscosity are obtained by the Newton method for a number of different values of the Rayleigh number and the strength of the dependence of the viscosity on temperature. By classifying the solutions with the top surface mobility, we find the sluggish lid regime between the mobile and stagnant lid regimes. The solutions of the sluggish regime are characterized by a large viscosity contrast through the boundary layer below the conductive lid and a rapid increase of the Nusselt number with respect to the Rayleigh number. For most solutions in the mobile and stagnant lid regimes, the Nusselt number is proportional to the 1/6 power of the Rayleigh number, which can be derived by taking into account the effect of thin and strong downwelling plumes. Time evolution calculations show that the steady solutions become unstable for large Rayleigh numbers, where additional downward plumes grow on the background convective flows. This can be explained by the timescale of the Rayleigh--Taylor instability for the thermal boundary layer between the conductive lid and the convective core, which is shorter than the timescale of horizontal advection by the background flow. In addition, steady convective solutions with Arrhenius-law viscosity are calculated for several values of the parameters. The obtained regime diagram qualitatively agrees with that of the Frank-Kamenetskii viscosity, while there is a slight difference in the locations of the regime boundaries.</description>

      <title>M2C: An Open-Source Software for Multiphysics Simulation of Compressible Multi-Material Flows and Fluid-Structure Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: M2C (Multiphysics Modeling and Computation) is an open-source software for simulating multi-material fluid flows and fluid-structure interactions under extreme conditions, such as high pressures, high temperatures, shock waves, and large interface deformations. It employs a finite volume method to solve the compressible Navier-Stokes equations and supports a wide range of thermodynamic equations of state. M2C incorporates models of laser radiation and absorption, phase transition, and ionization, coupled with continuum dynamics. Multi-material interfaces are evolved using a level set method, while fluid-structure interfaces are tracked using an embedded boundary method. Advective fluxes across interfaces are computed using FIVER (FInite Volume method based on Exact multi-material Riemann problems). For two-way fluid-structure interaction, M2C is coupled with the open-source structural dynamics solver Aero-S using a partitioned procedure. The M2C code is written in C++ and parallelized with MPI for high-performance computing. The source package includes a set of example problems for demonstration and user training. Accuracy is verified through benchmark cases such as Riemann problems, interface evolution, single-bubble dynamics, and ionization response. Several multiphysics applications are also presented, including laser-induced thermal cavitation, explosion and blast mitigation, and hypervelocity impact.</description>

      <title>Modelling the impact of synovial fluid elasticity on tangential stress</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rheological properties of synovial fluid have been observed to substantially impact its lubricating behaviour. While numerous studies have illustrated the importance of its shear-dependent viscosity, the impact of synovial fluid elasticity for oscillatory joint motion is far less characterised. Hence we consider how elasticity impacts the tangential stress, and thus friction, exerted on confining surfaces in rheological models of synovial fluid on the length and time scales of oscillatory joint motion, though in a simplified setting rather than considering the full complexity of a joint. Minor changes in the elastic constitutive equation from a canonical upper convected Oldroyd-B model lead to fundamentally different scalings and predictions for tangential stress compared to either a Newtonian fluid and an Oldroyd-B fluid. In particular, polymer elasticity within physiological fluids is predicted to have a profound effect on friction both within the oscillating joint and more generally, in turn suggesting further examination of synovial fluid elasticity in experimental and modelling studies.</description>

      <title>Benjamin-Feir Instability of Interfacial Gravity-Capillary Waves in a Two-Layer Fluid. Part I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a detailed investigation of the modulational stability of interfacial wave packets in a two-layer inviscid incompressible fluid with finite layer thicknesses and interfacial surface tension. The stability analysis is carried out for a broad range of density ratios and geometric configurations, enabling the construction of stability diagrams in the (\rho,k) -plane, where \rho is the density ratio and k is the carrier wavenumber. The Benjamin-Feir index is used as the stability criterion, and its interplay with the curvature of the dispersion relation is examined to determine the onset of modulational instability. The topology of the stability diagrams reveals several characteristic structures: a localized loop of stability within an instability zone, a global upper stability domain, an elongated corridor bounded by resonance and dispersion curves, and a degenerate cut structure arising in strongly asymmetric configurations. Each of these structures is associated with a distinct physical mechanism involving the balance between focusing/defocusing nonlinearity and anomalous/normal dispersion. Systematic variation of layer thicknesses allows us to track the formation, deformation, and disappearance of these regions, as well as their merging or segmentation due to resonance effects. Limiting cases of semi-infinite layers are analyzed to connect the results with known configurations, including the `half-space--layer', `layer--half-space', and `half-space--half-space' systems. The influence of symmetry and asymmetry in layer geometry is examined in detail, showing how it governs the arrangement and connectivity of stable and unstable regions in parameter space.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium evaporation of Lennard-Jones fluids: Enskog-Vlasov theory and Hertz-Knudsen model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Enskog-Vlasov equation is currently the most sophisticated kinetic model for describing non-equilibrium evaporative flows. While it enables more efficient simulations than the molecular dynamics (MD) methods, its accuracy in reproducing the flow properties of real fluids is limited by the underlying assumptions of the Vlasov forcing term. To address this limitation, this work proposes a molecular kinetic model specifically designed for real fluids, with the Lennard-Jones fluids as an example. The model is first applied to evaluate the equilibrium characteristics of a liquid-vapour system, including the liquid-vapour coexistence curve, vapour pressure, and surface tension coefficient. The results show excellent agreement with the MD simulation and experimental data. Furthermore, the model is used to investigate non-equilibrium evaporation, with a particular focus on the velocity distribution function adjacent to the liquid-vapour interface. The findings reveal significant deviations from the Maxwellian distribution in the vapour region, suggesting that the classical Hertz-Knudsen relation becomes inaccurate when non-equilibrium effects are pronounced. Therefore, this work represents a critical step towards the development of an accurate and efficient computational framework for modelling non-equilibrium liquid-vapour flows for real fluids, with direct relevance to practical applications such as flow cooling.</description>

      <title>Application of a Pressured-Based OpenFOAM Solver for Rotating Detonation Engines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study aims to develop a simulation framework for rotating detonation engines (RDEs) using multicomponentFluid solver in OpenFOAM v12 and to demonstrate reducing the computational costs by adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) and dynamic load balancing (DLB). RDEs have been extensively studied for improvements in efficiency for power generation and aircraft propulsion systems. A well-established framework, showing both high accuracy and cost efficiency, is required to facilitate further research and development in RDEs. The multicomponentFluid solver is validated against two problems: one-dimensional planar detonation simulation and two-dimensional RDE simulation, in which the present study's results are compared to reference results of experiments and simulations, respectively. In the problems, the present simulation results agree well with the validation data both qualitatively (e.g., pressure distribution and temperature field) and quantitatively (e.g., detonation velocity, mass flux, and specific impulse and thrust). In the two-dimensional RDE simulation, we propose a detonation velocity correction method for fair comparison with Chapman-Jouguet (CJ) detonation velocity. Moreover, the two-dimensional RDE simulation is optimized using AMR and DLB. By adopting both, computational costs decrease by up to 11.2 times. The effect of each of them is examined as well, which highlights the importance of DLB.</description>

      <title>Reduced order modeling of the unsteady pressure on turbine rotor blades using deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00013v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In transonic turbine stages, complex interactions between trailing edge shocks from nozzle guide vanes and rotor blades generate unsteady wall pressure fields, impacting rotor aerodynamic performance and structural integrity. While shock-related phenomena are prominent, unsteady pressure fluctuations can also arise in subsonic regimes from wake interactions. Traditional methods like Unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) simulations are accurate but computationally expensive. To address this, a novel deep learning-based Reduced Order Model (ROM) is proposed, built on a database of URANS simulations, to predict unsteady pressure fields on turbine rotor blades at a fraction of the cost. The model consists of a Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) integrated with a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to capture time-series data, overcoming the limitations of traditional linear ROMs in capturing nonlinear phenomena, such as moving shocks. The goal is to develop a ROM that accurately reproduces unsteady pressure fields from URANS simulations while reducing computational costs. The ROM is applied to the Turbine Aero-Thermal External Flows (TATEF2) project configuration, a representative test case in turbomachinery research. Model performance is evaluated using machine learning quality metrics and design-oriented criteria, including the accuracy of the first harmonic in the Fourier transform of the unsteady pressure field. The impact of the simulation database size on model accuracy is also analyzed, considering the number of training simulations required for task-specific accuracy as a key factor in industrial applicability.</description>

Abstract: Starting from the governing equations for geophysical flows, by means of a thin-shell approximation and a tangent plane approximation, we derive the equations describing, at leading order, the nonlinear ice-drift flow for regions centered around the North Pole. An exact solution is derived in the material/Lagrangian formalism, describing a superposition of oscillations, a mean Ekman flow and a geostrophic current.</description>

      <title>Curvature-based energy spectra revealing flow regime changes in Rayleigh-B\'enard convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22545v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the local curvature derived from velocity vector fields or particle tracks as a surrogate for structure size to compute curvature-based energy spectra. An application to homogeneous isotropic turbulence shows that these spectra replicate certain features of classical energy spectra such as the slope of the inertial range extending towards the equivalent curvature of the Taylor microscale. As this curvature-based analysis framework is sampling based, it also allows further statistical analyses of the time evolution of the kinetic energies and curvatures considered. The main findings of these analyses are that the slope for the inertial range also appears as a salient point in the probability density distribution of the angle of the vector comprising the two time evolution components. This density distribution further exhibits changing features of its shape depending on the Rayleigh number. This Rayleigh number evolution allows to observe a change in the flow regime between the Rayleigh numbers $10^6$ and $10^7$. Insight into this regime change is gathered by conditionally sampling the salient time evolution behaviours and projecting them back into physical space. Concretely, the regime change is manifested by a change in the spatial distribution for the different time evolution behaviours. Finally, we show that this analysis can be applied to measured Lagrangian particle tracks.</description>

      <title>Transition to the ultimate turbulent regime in stratified inclined duct flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10571v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The stratified inclined duct (SID) flow provides a canonical model for sustained, buoyancy-driven exchange between two reservoirs of different density, and emerges as a new paradigm in geophysical fluid dynamics. Yet, the flow dynamics remain unclear in the highly turbulent regime; laboratory experiments can access this regime but they lack resolution, while direct numerical simulations (DNS) at realistically high Prandtl number $Pr=7$ (for heat in water) have not achieved sufficiently high Reynolds numbers $Re$. We conduct three-dimensional DNS up to $Re= 8000$ and observe the transition to the so-called ultimate regime of turbulent convection as evidenced by the Nusselt number scaling $Nu \sim Ra^{1/2}$. We further report that the shear Reynolds number, a key parameter characterizing boundary layer (BL) dynamics, exceeds the threshold range of 420 for turbulent kinetic BLs with the emergence of logarithmic velocity profiles. Our work connects SID flow with the broader class of wall-bounded turbulent convection flows and gives insight into mixing in the vigorously turbulent regimes of oceanography and industry.</description>

      <title>The Interplay of Parametric and Magnetorotational Instabilities in Oscillatory Shear Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08839v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The evolution of warped disks is governed by internal, oscillatory shear flows driven by their distorted geometry. However, these flows are known to be vigorously unstable to a hydrodynamic parametric instability. In many warped systems, this might coexist and compete with the magnetorotational instability (MRI). The interplay of these phenomena and their combined impact on the internal flows has not been studied. To this end, we perform three-dimensional, magnetohydrodynamic unstratified shearing box simulations with an oscillatory radial forcing function to mimic the effects of a warped disk. In the hydrodynamic study, we find that the parametric instability manifests as strong, vertical `elevator' flows that resist the sloshing motion. Above a critical forcing amplitude, these also emerge in our magnetized runs and dominate the vertical stress, although they are partially weakened by the MRI, and hence the system equilibrates with larger radial sloshing flows. Below this critical forcing, the MRI effectively quenches the parametric instability. In all cases, we find that the internal stresses are anisotropic in character and better described by a viscoelastic relationship with the shearing flows. Unfortunately, these important effects are typically unresolved in global simulations of warped disks and are simplified in analytically tractable models. The incorporation of such complex, warp-amplitude-dependent, viscoelastic stresses will sensitively regulate the laminar flow response and inevitably modify the detailed spatio-temporal evolution of warped systems.</description>
