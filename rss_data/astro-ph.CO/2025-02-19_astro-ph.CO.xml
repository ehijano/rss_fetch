      <title>Constraining circular polarization of high-frequency gravitational waves with CMB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Circular polarization in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) offers a promising probe of the parity-violating physics of the early universe. In this paper, we propose a novel method to constrain the primordial circular polarization of high-frequency gravitational waves (GW) in the GHz range. An efficient conversion of gravitons to photons in a transverse cosmological magnetic field at the epoch of last scattering can generate excess chiral photons if the GW background is chiral in nature. This excess radiation distorts the CMB thermal black-body spectrum, which can be estimated by measuring the V-Stokes parameter in the CMB polarization. Using current upper limits on the angular power spectrum of circular polarization $C_l^{VV}$ from the CLASS, MIPOL, and SPIDER experiments, we obtain the most stringent constraints on the characteristic strain and circular polarization of the isotropic background of stochastic GWs at ${40\,\rm GHz}$ and ${150\,\rm GHz}$, respectively. Our work, therefore, provides an interesting possibility to constrain the circular polarization of high-frequency GWs using the V-mode polarization measurements of CMB.</description>

      <title>The Preference for Evolving Dark Energy from Cosmological Distance Measurements and Possible Signatures in the Growth Rate of Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we use a flexible parametrization of the equation of state of dark energy to explore its possible evolution with datasets from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), Planck cosmic microwave background, and either the 5-year Dark Energy Survey (DES) or the Pantheon+ (PP) supernova (SN) compilation. This parametrization, called transitional dark energy, allows for rapid changes in the equation of state but also changes like that in the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder parametrization. We find a 3.8{\sigma} preference for evolving dark energy over {\Lambda}CDM with the DES dataset and a weaker 2.4{\sigma} preference when using the PP dataset. This corroborates the finding of the DESI Collaboration, who found that their baryon acoustic oscillation data preferred evolving dark energy when fit with the CPL parametrization of the equation of state. Our analysis reveals no significant outliers in the DESI data around the TDE best-fit, while the data is asymmetrically distributed around the {\Lambda}CDM best-fit model such that the measured distances are on average smaller. The DESI and SN data both prefer an expansion history that implies a higher dark energy density around z=0.5 than in the Planck-{\Lambda}CDM model, with the inferred equation of state being greater than -1 around z=0 and close to or below -1 at z&gt;0.5. We show that when the expansion rate is greater than that in the Planck-{\Lambda}CDM model (around z=0.5), the growth rate calculated assuming General Relativity is suppressed relative to the Planck-{\Lambda}CDM model, and it rebounds as the expansion rate differences between the models become smaller closer to the present time. The resulting flattening of the $f\sigma_8(z)$ curve compared to the {\Lambda}CDM model could be an independent signature of the temporal evolution of dark energy.</description>

      <title>Detecting stochastic gravitational wave background from cosmic strings with next-generation detector networks: Component separation based on a multi-source astrophysical foreground noise model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) from cosmic strings is crucial for unveiling the evolutionary laws of the early universe and validating non-standard cosmological models. This study presents the first systematic evaluation of the detection capabilities of next-generation ground-based gravitational wave detector networks for cosmic strings. By constructing a hybrid signal model incorporating multi-source astrophysical foreground noise, including compact binary coalescences (CBCs) and compact binary hyperbolic encounters (CBHEs), we propose an innovative parameter estimation methodology based on multi-component signal separation. Numerical simulations using one-year observational data reveal three key findings: (1) The CE4020ET network, comprising the Einstein Telescope (ET-10 km) and the Cosmic Explorer (CE-40 km and CE-20 km), achieves nearly one order of magnitude improvement in constraining the cosmic string tension $G\mu$ compared to individual detectors, reaching a relative uncertainty $\Delta G\mu / G\mu &lt; 0.5$ for $G\mu &gt; 3.5 \times 10^{-15}$ under standard cosmological framework; (2) The network demonstrates enhanced parameter resolution in non-standard cosmological scenarios, providing a novel approach to probe pre-Big Bang Nucleosynthesis cosmic evolution; (3) Enhanced detector sensitivity amplifies CBHE foreground interference in parameter estimation, while precise modeling of such signals could further refine $G\mu$ constraints by $1-2$ orders of magnitude. This research not only quantifies the detection potential of third-generation detector networks for cosmic string models but also elucidates the intrinsic connection between foreground modeling precision and cosmological parameter estimation accuracy, offering theoretical foundations for optimizing scientific objectives of next-generation gravitational wave observatories.</description>

      <title>Does dark matter fall in the same way as standard model particles? A direct constraint of Euler's equation with cosmological data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since dark matter particles have never been directly detected, we do not know how they move, and in particular we do not know how they fall inside gravitational potential wells. Usually it is assumed that dark matter only interacts gravitationally with itself and with particles of the standard model, and therefore that its motion is governed by Euler's equation. In this paper, we test this assumption for the first time at cosmological scales, by combining measurements of galaxy velocities with measurements of gravitational potential wells, encoded in the Weyl potential. We find that current data are consistent with Euler's equation at redshifts $z\in [0.3,0.8]$, and we place constraints on the strength of a potential fifth force, which would alter the way dark matter particles fall. We find that a positive fifth force cannot exceed 7% of the gravitational interaction strength, while a negative fifth force is limited to 21%. The coming generation of surveys, including the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory and the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) will drastically improve the constraints, allowing to constrain a departure from pure gravitational interaction at the level of 2%.</description>

      <title>Selection Function of Clusters in Dark Energy Survey Year 3 Data from Cross-Matching with South Pole Telescope Detections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy clusters selected based on overdensities of galaxies in photometric surveys provide the largest cluster samples. Yet modeling the selection function of such samples is complicated by non-cluster members projected along the line of sight (projection effects) and the potential detection of unvirialized objects (contamination). We empirically constrain the magnitude of these effects by cross-matching galaxy clusters selected in the Dark Energy survey data with the \rdmpr$\,$ algorithm with significant detections in three South Pole Telescope surveys (SZ, pol-ECS, pol-500d). For matched clusters, we augment the \rdmpr$\,$catalog by the SPT detection significance. For unmatched objects we use the SPT detection threshold as an upper limit on the SZe signature. Using a Bayesian population model applied to the collected multi-wavelength data, we explore various physically motivated models to describe the relationship between observed richness and halo mass. Our analysis reveals the limitations of a simple lognormal scatter model in describing the data. We rule out significant contamination by unvirialized objects at the high-richness end of the sample. While dedicated simulations offer a well-fitting calibration of projection effects, our findings suggest the presence of redshift-dependent trends that these simulations may not have captured. Our findings highlight that modeling the selection function of optically detected clusters remains a complicated challenge, requiring a combination of simulation and data-driven approaches.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of Dark Energy Models: A Theoretical and Bayesian Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the background equivalence among three dark energy models by constructing explicit mappings between dynamical dark energy (DDE), interacting dark energy (IDE), and running vacuum (RV). In our approach, the dark sector functions that characterize each model-such as the equation of state parameter $\bar{w}(a)$ for DDE, the interaction term $Q$ for IDE, and the functional form $\Lambda(H)$ for RV-are transformed into one another under specific assumptions. Extending previous work by von Marttens et al., we demonstrate that running vacuum models, characterized by $\Lambda(H) = a_0 + a_1 \dot{H} + a_2 H^2$, can be reinterpreted as an interacting dark energy model with $Q = 3H\gamma \hat{\rho}_c$, which in turn is equivalent to a dynamic dark energy model with an appropriately defined $\bar{w}(a)$. Using Bayesian analysis with Type Ia supernovae, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, and Cosmic Chronometers, our observational constraints confirm that these theoretical equivalences hold at the background level. This study underscores the importance of seeking convergence in dark energy models, facilitating a better understanding of the dark sector.</description>

      <title>The cosmological Mass Varying Neutrino model in the late universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cosmological Mass Varying Neutrino model beyond the standard $\Lambda$CDM scenario is considered. The interaction of the fermionic field and the scalar field with the inverse power law Ratra-Peebles potential via the Yukawa coupling is studied in detail. Depending on the model parameter $\alpha$ of the Ratra-Peebles potential of the scalar field, the expansion rate of the universe, the mass equation, the mass of the scalar field, the sum of neutrino masses, the mutual influence of the sum of neutrino masses and the value of the scalar field Ratra-Peebles potential as well as the total density of the thermodynamic potential of the coupled fermionic and scalar fields at the critical point are explored. The values of the sum of neutrino masses $m_\nu(a_0)\leq0.07~{\rm eV}$ calculated for values of the model parameter $\alpha$ of the Ratra-Peebles potential $0&lt;\alpha\leq0.016$ are consistent with the constraint $m_\nu(a_0)&lt;0.071~{\rm eV}$ of the cosmological DESI measurements, while the values $m_\nu(a_0)\leq0.45~{\rm eV}$ for $0&lt;\alpha\leq0.143$ are consistent with the upper limit $m_\nu(a_0)&lt;0.45~{\rm eV}$ obtained in the KATRIN experiment.</description>

      <title>New gravitational wave probe of vector dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The longitudinal components of massive vector fields generated during inflation constitute a well-motivated dark matter candidate, with interesting phenomenological implications. During the epoch of radiation domination following inflation, their spectrum exhibits a peak at small scales, whose amplitude and position are governed by the parameters of the dark matter model. We calculate the stochastic gravitational wave spectrum induced at second order in fluctuations by such a longitudinal vector peak. We demonstrate that the amplitude of the gravitational wave spectrum can, in principle, reach significant values at nano-Hertz frequencies or lower. This result suggests a novel gravitational wave probe to test inflationary vector dark matter scenarios, independent from assumptions on the coupling of dark vectors to the Standard Model. Additionally, we derive new analytical formulas for the longitudinal vector transfer functions during radiation domination, offering a valuable tool for characterising the convolution integrals that govern the properties of the induced gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Trajectory Based RFI Subtraction and Calibration for Radio Interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.04188v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radio interferometry calibration and Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) removal are usually done separately. Here we show that jointly modelling the antenna gains and RFI has significant benefits when the RFI follows precise trajectories, such as for satellites. One surprising benefit is improved calibration solutions, by leveraging the RFI signal itself. We present tabascal (TrAjectory BAsed RFI Subtraction and CALibration), a new algorithm that jointly models the RFI and calibration parameters in visibilities. We test tabascal on simulated MeerKAT calibration observations contaminated by satellite-based RFI. We obtain gain estimates that are both unbiased and up to an order of magnitude better constrained compared to uncontaminated data. When combined with an ad hoc RFI subtraction scheme, tabascal solutions can be further applied to an adjacent target observation: 5 minutes of calibration data results in an image with about a third the noise achieved when using flagging alone. The recovered flux distribution of RFI subtracted data was on par with uncontaminated data. In contrast, RFI flagging alone resulted in a higher detection threshold and consistent underestimation of source fluxes. For a mean RFI amplitude of 17 Jy, using RFI subtraction leads to less than 1% loss of data compared to 75% data loss from an ideal $3\sigma$ flagging algorithm, a very significant increase in data available for science analysis. Although we have examined the case of satellite RFI, tabascal should work for any RFI moving on parameterizable trajectories, relative to the phase centre, such as planes and/or objects fixed to the ground.</description>

      <title>TABASCAL II: Removing Multi-Satellite Interference from Point-Source Radio Astronomy Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the first TABASCAL paper we showed how to calibrate in the presence of Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) sources by simultaneously isolating the trajectories and signals of the RFI sources. Here we show that we can accurately remove RFI from simulated MeerKAT radio interferometry target data, for a single frequency channel, corrupted by up to 9 simultaneous satellites with average RFI amplitudes varying from weak to very strong (1 - 1000 Jy). Additionally, TABASCAL also manages to leverage the RFI signal-to-noise to phase calibrate the recovered astronomical signal. TABASCAL effectively performs a suitably phased up fringe filter for each RFI source which allows essentially perfect removal of RFI across all strengths. As a result, TABASCAL reaches image noises equivalent to the uncorrupted, no-RFI, case. Consequently, point-source science with TABASCAL almost matches the no-RFI case with near perfect completeness for all RFI amplitudes. In contrast the completeness of AOFlagger and idealised 3$\sigma$ flagging drops below 40% for strong RFI amplitudes where recovered flux errors are $\sim$10x-100x worse than those from TABASCAL. Finally we highlight that TABASCAL works for both static and varying astronomical sources.</description>

      <title>Searching For Superheavy Decaying Particles With Ultra-High-Energy Neutrino Observatories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If there exist unstable but long-lived relics of the early universe, their decays could produce detectable fluxes of gamma rays and neutrinos. In this paper, we point out that the decays of superheavy particles, $m_{\chi} \gtrsim 10^{10} \, \text{GeV}$,would produce an enhanced flux of ultra-high-energy neutrinos through the processes of muon and pion pair production in the resulting electromagnetic cascades. These processes transfer energy from electromagnetic decay products into neutrinos, relaxing the constraints that can be derived from gamma-ray observations, and increasing the sensitivity of high-energy neutrino telescopes to superheavy particle decays. Taking this into account, we derive new constraints on long-lived superheavy relics from the IceCube Neutrino Observatory, and from the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope. We find that IceCube-Gen2, and other next generation neutrino telescopes, will provide unprecedented sensitivity to the decays of superheavy dark matter particles and other long-lived relics.</description>

      <title>Filtered cogenesis of PBH dark matter and baryons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel cogenesis of baryon and dark matter (DM) in the Universe by utilising a first-order phase transition (FOPT) in the dark sector containing an asymmetric Dirac fermion $\chi$. Due to the mass difference of $\chi$ across the bubble walls, it is energetically favourable for $\chi$ to get trapped in the false vacuum leading to the formation of Fermi-ball, which can self-collapse to form primordial black hole (PBH) if $\chi$ has a sufficiently large Yukawa interaction. While such PBH formed out of false vacuum collapse can give rise to the DM in the Universe, a tiny amount of asymmetric $\chi$ leaking into the true vacuum through the bubble walls can transfer the dark asymmetry into the visible sector via decay. The same mass difference of $\chi$ across the two minima which decides the amount of trapping or filtering of $\chi$, also allows $\chi$ decay into visible sector in the true minima while keeping it stable in the false vacuum. Our filtered cogenesis scenario can be probed via FOPT generated stochastic gravitational waves (GW) at near future detectors in addition to the well-known detection aspects of asteroid mass PBH constituting DM in the Universe.</description>

      <title>Bubble wall velocity for first-order QCD phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although the QCD phase transition is a crossover in the standard model, nonstandard effects such as a large lepton asymmetry are known to make it first order, with possible applications to gravitational wave production. This process is sensitive to the speed of the bubble walls during the phase transition, which is difficult to compute from first principles. We take advantage of recent progress on wall speed determinations to provide a simple estimate which constrains the wall speed to be significantly lower than what has been used in previous literature. This in turn strongly suppresses the production of gravitational waves, to a level that is just out of reach of the most sensitive projected experiment for this signal, $\mu$Ares.</description>

      <title>Late-time cosmic acceleration from quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We deepen the analysis of the cosmological acceleration produced by quantum gravity dynamics in the formalism of group field theory condensate cosmology, treated at the coarse-grained level via a phenomenological model, in the language of hydrodynamics on minisuperspace. Specifically, we conduct a detailed analysis of the late-time evolution, which shows a phantom-like phase followed by an asymptotic De Sitter expansion. We argue that the model indicates a recent occurrence of the phantom crossing and we extract a more precise expression for the effective cosmological constant, linking its value to other parameters in the model and to the scale of the quantum bounce in the early universe evolution. Additionally, we show how the phantom phase produced by our quantum gravity dynamics increases the inferred value of the current Hubble parameter based on observed data, indicating a possible quantum gravity mechanism for alleviating the Hubble tension. Our results represent a concrete example of how quantum gravity can provide an explanation for large-scale cosmological puzzles, in an emergent spacetime scenario.</description>

      <title>Where to search for supermassive binary black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supermassive binary black holes (SMBBHs) are the anticipated byproducts of galaxy mergers and play a pivotal role in shaping galaxy evolution, gravitational wave emissions, and accretion physics. Despite their theoretical prevalence, direct observational evidence for SMBBHs remains elusive, with only a handful of candidates identified to date. This paper explores optimal strategies and key environments for locating SMBBHs, focusing on observational signatures in the broad Balmer lines. We present a preliminary analysis on a flux-limited sample of sources belonging to an evolved spectral type along the quasar main sequence, and we discuss the spectroscopic clues indicative of binary activity and highlight the critical role of time-domain spectroscopic surveys in uncovering periodic variability linked to binary systems.</description>

      <title>Intermediate Coupling Regime in Dilatonic $f(R,T)$ Inflationary Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present work we study cosmology in dilatonic $f(R,T)$ gravity to address the inflationary phase of the early Universe. As usual, in dilatonic gravity the scalar potential assumes the exponential form. However, this potential is not good enough to be in accord with the Planck 2018 data. More strikingly, the generalized $\beta$-exponential cannot take this into account either. It is just the presence of the dilatonic sector, in the intermediate coupling regime, that can help the theory to be in full accord with the observational data.</description>

      <title>More accurate slow-roll approximations for inflation in scalar-tensor theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose new versions of the slow-roll approximation for inflationary models with nonminimally coupled scalar fields. We derive more precise expressions for the standard slow-roll parameters as functions of the scalar field. To verify the accuracy of the proposed approximations, we consider inflationary models with the induced gravity term and the fourth-order monomial potential. For specific values of the model parameters, this model is the well-known Higgs-driven inflationary model. We investigate the inflationary dynamics in the Jordan frame and come to the conclusion that the proposed versions of the slow-roll approximation are not only more accurate at the end of inflation, but also give essentially more precise estimations for the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ and of the amplitude of scalar perturbations $A_s$.</description>

      <title>QZO: A Catalog of 5 Million Quasars from the Zwicky Transient Facility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning methods are well established in the classification of quasars (QSOs). However, the advent of light curve observations adds a great amount of complexity to the problem. Our goal is to use the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) to create a catalog of QSOs. We process the ZTF DR20 light curves with a transformer artificial neural network and combine the Pan-STARRS (PS), AllWISE, and Gaia surveys with extreme gradient boosting. Using ZTF g-band data with at least 100 observational epochs per light curve, we obtain 97% F1 score for QSOs. We find that with 3 day median cadence, a survey time span of at least 900 days is required to achieve 90% QSO F1 score. However, one can obtain the same score with a survey time span of 1800 days and the median cadence prolonged to 12 days. We find that ZTF classification is superior to the PS static bands, and on par with WISE and Gaia measurements. Additionally, we find that the light curves provide the most important features for QSO classification in the ZTF dataset. We robustly classify objects fainter than the $5\sigma$ SNR limit at $g=20.8$ by requiring $g &lt; \mathrm{n_{obs}} / 80 + 20.375$. For this sample, we run inference with added WISE observations, and find 4,849,574 objects classified as QSOs. For 33% of QZO objects, with available WISE data, we publish redshifts with estimated error $\Delta z/(1 + z) = 0.14$.</description>

      <title>Bayesian distances for quantifying tensions in cosmological inference and the surprise statistic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19100v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tensions between cosmological parameters derived through different channels can be a genuine signature of new physics that $\Lambda$CDM as the standard model is not able to reproduce, in particular in the missing consistency between parameter estimates from measurements the early and late Universe. Or, they could be caused by yet to be understood systematics in the measurements as a more mundane explanation. Commonly, cosmological tensions are stated in terms of mismatches of the posterior parameter distributions, often assuming Gaussian statistics. More importantly, though, would be a quantification if two data sets are consistent to each other before combining them into a joint measurement, ideally isolating hints at individual data points that have a strong influence in generating the tension. For this purpose, we start with statistical divergences applied to posterior distributions following from different data sets and develop the theory of a Fisher metric between two data sets, in analogy to the Fisher metric for different parameter choices. As a topical example, we consider the tension in the Hubble-Lema\^itre constant $H_0$ from supernova and measurements of the cosmic microwave background, derive a ranking of data points in order of their influence on the tension on $H_0$. For this particular example, we compute Bayesian distance measures and show that in the light of CMB data, supernovae are commonly too bright, whereas the low-$\ell$ CMB spectrum is too high, in agreement with intuition about the parameter sensitivity.</description>

      <title>KiDS-SBI: Simulation-based inference analysis of KiDS-1000 cosmic shear</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15402v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a simulation-based inference (SBI) cosmological analysis of cosmic shear two-point statistics from the fourth weak gravitational lensing data release of the ESO Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS-1000). KiDS-SBI efficiently performs non-Limber projection of the matter power spectrum via Levin's method, and constructs log-normal random matter fields on the curved sky for arbitrary cosmologies, including effective prescriptions for intrinsic alignments and baryonic feedback. The forward model samples realistic galaxy positions and shapes based on the observational characteristics, incorporating shear measurement and redshift calibration uncertainties, as well as angular anisotropies due to variations in depth and point-spread function. To enable direct comparison with standard inference, we limit our analysis to pseudo-angular power spectra. The SBI is based on sequential neural likelihood estimation to infer the posterior distribution of spatially-flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmological parameters from 18,000 realisations. We infer a mean marginal of the growth of structure parameter $S_{8} \equiv \sigma_8 (\Omega_\mathrm{m} / 0.3)^{0.5} = 0.731\pm 0.033$ ($68 \%$). We present a measure of goodness-of-fit for SBI and determine that the forward model fits the data well with a probability-to-exceed of $0.42$. For fixed cosmology, the learnt likelihood is approximately Gaussian, while constraints widen compared to a Gaussian likelihood analysis due to cosmology dependence in the covariance. Neglecting variable depth and anisotropies in the point spread function in the model can cause $S_{8}$ to be overestimated by ${\sim}5\%$. Our results are in agreement with previous analysis of KiDS-1000 and reinforce a $2.9 \sigma$ tension with constraints from cosmic microwave background measurements. This work highlights the importance of forward-modelling systematic effects in upcoming galaxy surveys.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08476v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As one of the fundamental unknowns of our Universe, the mass of dark matter remains to be a topic of great interest. We consider the possibility of a time-variation of the dark matter mass. We study the cosmological constraints on a model where the dark matter mass transitions from zero to a finite value in the early Universe. In this model, the matter power spectrum exhibits power suppression below a certain scale that depends on the epoch of transition, and the angular power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background shows a distinctive phase shift and power suppression at small scales. We use the latest cosmic microwave background data and the $S_8$ priors from weak lensing data to place a lower limit on the transition redshift. We also find that the data from the ACT show a mild preference for the mass-varying dark matter model over $\Lambda$CDM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08919v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Like many areas of astrophysics and cosmology, the Vera C. Rubin Observatory will be transformational for almost all the applications of strong lensing, thanks to the dramatic increase in the number of known strong lenses by two orders of magnitude or more and the readily available time-domain data for the lenses with transient sources. In this article, we provide an overview of the forecasted number of discovered lenses of different types and describe the primary science cases these large lens samples will enable. We provide an updated forecast on the joint constraint for the dark energy equation-of-state parameters, $w_0$ and $w_a$, from combining all strong lensing probes of dark energy. We update the previous forecast from the Rubin Observatory Dark Energy Science Collaboration's Science Review Document by adding two new crucial strong lensing samples: lensed Type Ia supernovae and single-deflector lenses with measured stellar kinematics. Finally, we describe the current and near-future activities and collaborative efforts within the strong lensing community in preparation for the arrival of the first real dataset from Rubin in early 2026.</description>

      <title>2D watershed void clustering for probing the cosmic large-scale structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04898v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cosmic void has been proven to be an effective cosmological probe of the large-scale structure (LSS). However, since voids are usually identified in spectroscopic galaxy surveys, they are generally limited to low number density and redshift. We propose to utilize the clustering of two-dimensional (2D) voids identified using Voronoi tessellation and watershed algorithm without any shape assumption to explore the LSS. We generate mock galaxy and void catalogs for the next-generation Stage IV photometric surveys in $z = 0.8-2.0$ from simulations, develop the 2D void identification method, and construct the theoretical model to fit the 2D watershed void and galaxy angular power spectra. We find that our method can accurately extract the cosmological information, and the constraint accuracies of some cosmological parameters from the 2D watershed void clustering are even comparable to the galaxy angular clustering case, which can be further improved by as large as $\sim30\%$ in the void and galaxy joint constraints. This indicates that the 2D void clustering is a good complement to galaxy angular clustering measurements, especially for the forthcoming Stage IV surveys that detect high-redshift universe.</description>

      <title>BICEP/Keck XVIII: Measurement of BICEP3 polarization angles and consequences for constraining cosmic birefringence and inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12089v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use a custom-made calibrator to measure individual detectors' polarization angles of BICEP3, a small aperture telescope observing the cosmic microwave background (CMB) at 95GHz from the South Pole. We describe our calibration strategy and the statistical and systematic uncertainties associated with the measurement. We reach an unprecedented precision for such measurement on a CMB experiment, with a repeatability for each detector pair of $0.02\deg$. We show that the relative angles measured using this method are in excellent agreement with those extracted from CMB data. Because the absolute measurement is currently limited by a systematic uncertainty, we do not derive cosmic birefringence constraints from BICEP3 data in this work. Rather, we forecast the sensitivity of BICEP3 sky maps for such analysis. We investigate the relative contributions of instrument noise, lensing, and dust, as well as astrophysical and instrumental systematics. We also explore the constraining power of different angle estimators, depending on analysis choices. We establish that the BICEP3 2-year dataset (2017--2018) has an on-sky sensitivity to the cosmic birefringence angle of $\sigma = 0.078\deg$, which could be improved to $\sigma = 0.055\deg$ by adding all of the existing BICEP3 data (through 2023). Furthermore, we emphasize the possibility of using the BICEP3 sky patch as a polarization calibration source for CMB experiments, which with the present data could reach a precision of $0.035\deg$. Finally, in the context of inflation searches, we investigate the impact of detector-to-detector variations in polarization angles as they may bias the tensor-to-scalar ratio r. We show that while the effect is expected to remain subdominant to other sources of systematic uncertainty, it can be reliably calibrated using polarization angle measurements such as the ones we present in this paper.</description>

      <title>A halo model approach for mock catalogs of time-variable strong gravitational lenses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07509v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time delays in both galaxy- and cluster-scale strong gravitational lenses have recently attracted a lot of attention in the context of the Hubble tension. Future wide-field cadenced surveys, such as the LSST, are anticipated to discover strong lenses across various scales. We generate mock catalogs of strongly lensed QSOs and SNe on galaxy-, group-, and cluster-scales based on a halo model that incorporates dark matter halos, galaxies, and subhalos. For the upcoming LSST survey, we predict that approximately 3500 lensed QSOs and 200 lensed SNe with resolved multiple images will be discovered. Among these, about 80 lensed QSOs and 10 lensed SNe will have maximum image separations larger than 10 arcsec, which roughly correspond to cluster-scale strong lensing. We find that adopting the Chabrier stellar IMF instead of the fiducial Salpeter IMF reduces the predicted number of strong lenses approximately by half, while the distributions of lens and source redshifts and image separations are not significantly changed. In addition to mock catalogs of multiple-image lens systems, we create mock catalogs of highly magnified systems, including both multiple-image and single-image systems. We find that such highly magnified systems are typically produced by massive galaxies, but non-negligible fraction of them are located in the outskirt of galaxy groups and clusters. Furthermore, we compare subsamples of our mock catalogs with lensed QSO samples constructed from the SDSS and Gaia to find that our mock catalogs with the fiducial Salpeter IMF reproduce the observation quite well. In contrast, our mock catalogs with the Chabrier IMF predict a significantly smaller number of lensed QSOs compared with observations, which adds evidence that the stellar IMF of massive galaxies is Salpeter-like. Our python code SL-Hammocks as well as the mock catalogs are made available online. (abridged)</description>

Abstract: Peculiar velocities are the motions of galaxies due to the gravitational influence of large-scale structure, and thus are an important cosmological probe of the underlying matter density field. In recent years the number of surveys designed to measure peculiar velocities has increased, to the point that it is plausible that we will have completely mapped out the peculiar velocity field in the local universe within the next decade. Such an abundance of data will enable us to place precise constraints on the growth rate of large-scale structure which in turn will inform us about the true nature of the laws of gravity and the standard cosmological model. In this chapter, the physics governing the generation of peculiar velocities, the methods of measuring them, and the statistical tools used to extract cosmological information from them are described. It will also cover a swathe of current and future surveys dedicated to collecting peculiar velocities, what their aims are, and what these datasets may mean for the future of cosmological analyses.</description>

      <title>Can tensor-scalar induced GWs dominate PTA observations ?</title>

Abstract: Observational constraints on small-scale primordial gravitational waves are considerably weaker than those on large scales. We focus on scenarios with significant primordial gravitational waves and curvature perturbations on small scales, studying the energy density spectrum of the second-order TSIGW. By leveraging current data from CMB, BAO, and PTA, combined with the SNR analysis of LISA, we can investigate how tensor-scalar induced gravitational waves affect observations on various scales, thus constraining the parameter space for primordial gravitational waves and curvature perturbations. The Bayes factor analysis suggests that TSIGW+PGW might be more likely to dominate current PTA observations compared to SMBHB.</description>

      <title>Dark energy and lensing anomaly in Planck CMB data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04641v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the impact of the lensing anomaly in Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) data on the nature of dark energy (DE). We constrain the state equation ($w_0,w_a$) of DE with the lensing scaling parameter $A_L=1$ and varying $A_L$, using the Planck PR3 and two updated Planck PR4 likelihoods, CamSpec and HiLLiPoP respectively, combined with DESI baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) and Pantheon+ supernova data. As expected, when $A_L$ is allowed to vary, the evolving DE is not preferred due to the degeneracy between $w_0,w_a$ and $A_L$. In particular, we also consider replacing DESI BAO data with pre-DESI BAO in our analysis, and observe that DESI BAO appears to exacerbate the lensing anomaly, which is caused by the smaller matter density $\Omega_m$ it prefers, however, this effect can be offset by the shifts in $w_0$ and $w_a$ preferring the evolving DE. Our work indicates that the lensing anomaly in Planck data is worth carefully reconsidering when new cosmological survey data is combined with CMB.</description>

      <title>CSST Large Scale Structure Analysis Pipeline: III. Emission-line Redshift Measurement for Slitless Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11536v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The China Space Station Telescope (CSST) is a forthcoming space-based optical telescope designed to co-orbit with the Chinese Space Station. With a planned slitless spectroscopic survey spanning a broad wavelength range of $255-1000$nm and an average spectral resolution exceeding 200, the CSST holds significant potential for cosmic large-scale structure analysis. In this study, we focus on redshift determinations from slitless spectra through emission line analysis within the CSST framework. Our tailored redshift measurement process involves identifying emission lines in one-dimensional slitless spectra, aligning observed wavelengths with their rest-frame counterparts from prominent galaxy emissions, and calculating wavelength shifts to determine redshifts accurately. To validate our redshift measurement algorithm, we leverage simulated spectra generated by the CSST emulator for slitless spectroscopy. The outcomes demonstrate a remarkable redshift completeness exceeding 95 per cent for emission line galaxies (ELGs), alongside a purity surpassing 85 per cent. The redshift uncertainty remains impressively below than $\sim 0.001$. Notably, when concentrating on galaxies with more than three matched emission lines, the completeness of ELGs and the purity of measurable galaxies can reach 98 per cent and 97 per cent, respectively. Furthermore, we explore the influence of parameters like magnitude, spectral signal-to-noise ratio, and redshift on redshift completeness and purity. The discussion also delves into redshift degeneracies stemming from emission-line matching confusion. Our developed redshift measurement process will be applied to extensive simulated datasets and forthcoming CSST slitless spectroscopic observations for further cosmological and extragalactic analyses.</description>

      <title>Nuclear Recoil Calibration at Sub-keV Energies in LUX and Its Impact on Dark Matter Search Sensitivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.05859v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dual-phase xenon time projection chamber (TPC) detectors offer heightened sensitivities for dark matter detection across a spectrum of particle masses. To broaden their capability to low-mass dark matter interactions, we investigated the light and charge responses of liquid xenon (LXe) to sub-keV nuclear recoils. Using neutron events from a pulsed Adelphi Deuterium-Deuterium neutron generator, an in situ calibration was conducted on the LUX detector. We demonstrate direct measurements of light and charge yields down to 0.45 keV and 0.27 keV, respectively, both approaching single quanta production, the physical limit of LXe detectors. These results hold significant implications for the future of dual-phase xenon TPCs in detecting low-mass dark matter via nuclear recoils.</description>

      <title>Bubbletrons: Ultrahigh-Energy Particle Collisions and Heavy Dark Matter at Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.15555v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We initiate the study of `bubbletrons', by which we mean ultra-high-energy collisions of the particle shells that generically form at the walls of relativistic bubbles in cosmological first-order phase transitions (PT). As an application, we calculate the maximal dark matter mass $M_{DM}$ that bubbletrons can produce in a $U(1)$ gauge PT, finding $M_{DM} \sim 10^5/10^{11}/10^{15}$ GeV for PT scales $v_\phi \sim 10^{-2}/10^3/10^9$ GeV. Bubbletrons realise a novel link between ultra-high-energy phenomena and gravitational waves (GW) sourced at the PT, from nanohertz to megahertz frequencies.</description>

      <title>NeutralUniverseMachine: How Filaments and Dark Matter Halo Influence the Galaxy Cold Gas Content</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08539v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Aims. We aim to investigate the influence of the distance to filaments and dark-matter haloes on galaxy cold-gas content in the empirical model NeutralUniverseMachine (NUM) and the hydrodynamical simulation IllustrisTNG. Methods. We used DisPerSE to identify cosmic web structures and calculate the distance of galaxies to filaments for both observations and models. We show the results of the HI and H2 mass functions, HI- and H2-halo-mass relations, HI- and H2-stellar-mass relations for galaxies in the NUM model and IllustrisTNG with different distances to filaments and compare them with observational measurements. We also show the evolution of HI and H2 mass densities at different distances to filament bins. Results. We find that how filaments affect the HI gas is generally less significant compared to the halo environment. There is a weak trend in the observations at z=0 that low-mass haloes lying closer to the filaments tend to have reduced HI masses. However, this trend reverses for massive haloes with log(Mvir/Msun) &gt; 12.5. This behaviour is accurately reproduced in the NUM model due to the dependence of HI gas on the halo formation time, but it does not appear in IllustrisTNG. The influence of filaments on the HI gas becomes slightly weaker at higher redshifts and is only significant for galaxies that reside in massive haloes in the NUM model. Filaments have almost no impact on the H2-stellar-mass relation in both models, confirming that H2 is primarily determined by the galaxy stellar mass and star formation rate.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the Pre-Big Bang scenario from a cosmological interpretation of the NANOGrav data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01734v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss a recently proposed fit of the 15-year data set obtained from the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav) in terms of a relic stochastic background of primordial gravitons, produced in the context of the string cosmology pre-big bang scenario. We show that such interpretation cannot be reconciled with a phenomenologically viable minimal version of such scenario, while it can be allowed if one considers an equally viable but generalised, non-minimal version of pre-big bang evolution. Maintaining the $S$-duality symmetry throughout the high-curvature string phase is possible although somewhat disfavoured. The implications of this non-minimal scenario for the power spectrum of curvature perturbations are also briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from supercooled phase transitions in conformal Majoron models of neutrino mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02645v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study supercooled first-order phase transitions above the QCD scale in a wide class of conformal Majoron-like U(1)' models that explain the totality of active neutrino oscillation data and produce a detectable stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) at LIGO, LISA and ET. We place constraints on the U(1)' breaking scale and gauge coupling using current LIGO-Virgo-Kagra data. We find that strong supercooling can be ruled out in large regions of parameter space if a SGWB is not detected by these experiments. A null signal at LIGO and ET will disfavor a type-I seesaw scale above $10^{14}$ GeV, while a positive signal is a signature of heavy right-handed neutrinos. On the other hand, LISA will be sensitive to seesaw scales as low as a TeV, and could detect a SGWB even if the right-handed neutrinos are decoupled.</description>
