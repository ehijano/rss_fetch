      <title>Observation of Magnomechanics at Low Temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cavity magnomechanics combines strong coupling between magnons in a dielectric material and microwave cavity photons with long-lived mechanical resonances. Forming a triple resonance condition, this hybrid quantum system promises many advantages in quantum technologies, yet has never been studied at the cryogenic temperatures required to reveal such quantum properties. We report the first observation of magnomechanics at cryogenic temperatures down to 9 K. The experiment was conducted using a YIG sphere inside a microwave cavity, where we measured both the thermomechanical motion and the temperature-dependence of the magnon linewidth.</description>

      <title>Liouville Fock state lattices and potential simulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Liouville Fock state lattices (LFSLs) as a framework for visualizing open quantum systems through matrix representations of the Lindblad master equation (LME). By vectorizing the LME, the state evolves in a doubled Hilbert space, naturally forming a synthetic lattice. Unlike the unitary evolution of pure states, LFSL states exhibit nontrivial dynamics due to the non-Hermitian Liouvillian, featuring population drifts, sources, and sinks--paralleling stochastic classical lattices. We explore these "classical simulators" in both the Fock representation and alternative positive semidefinite representations, which more closely resemble classical probability distributions. We further demonstrate how infinite steady state manifolds can derive from frustration in the LFSL.</description>

      <title>Interplay between inversion and translation symmetries in trigonal PtBi$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The trigonal Weyl semimetal PtBi$_2$ presents an intriguing superconducting phase, previously reported to be confined to its topological Fermi arcs within a certain temperature range. This observation highlights the importance of a thorough understanding of its normal phase, particularly the roles that spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and inversion-symmetry breaking play in shaping its band structure. Our density-functional theory calculations reveal that the semimetallic nature of trigonal PtBi$_2$ can be interpreted as stemming from a noncentrosymmetric crystal distortion of a parent structure, that drives a metal to semimetal transition. This distortion breaks inversion symmetry and, crucially, reduces translational symmetry. Due to its interplay with translational symmetry, inversion-symmetry breaking emerges as the dominant energy scale producing substantial asymmetries ($\sim$ 0.6\,eV) in certain short-range hopping amplitudes, superseding the effects of SOC, whose primary role is to define the characteristics of the low-energy nodal structure. This also applies to the formation of the Weyl nodes closest to the Fermi energy, which are found to exist even in the absence of SOC as a result of the orbital physics associated with the reduced translational symmetry.</description>

      <title>Cracking Down on Fracture to Functionalise Damage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we propose a novel relationship between topology and damage propagation in Maxwell lattices that redefines fracture as a functional design feature rather than mere degradation. We demonstrate that topologically protected modes, inherently robust against perturbations, localise along lattice discontinuities and govern the mechanical response. By precisely engineering the microstructure, we direct these modes to control stress distributions and trigger predictable, controlled damage. Our findings -- validated through comprehensive numerical simulations and experiments -- advance our understanding of nontrivial mechanical responses in Maxwell lattices and establish a clear framework for designing materials with improved fracture energy. This work paves the way for further exploration of topology-driven phenomena in mechanical systems and promises a new direction in the design of robust materials.</description>

      <title>Observables in non-Hermitian systems: A methodological comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05411v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite acute interest in the dynamics of non-Hermitian systems, there is a lack of consensus in the mathematical formulation of non-Hermitian quantum mechanics in the community. Different methodologies are used in the literature to study non-Hermitian dynamics. This ranges from consistent frameworks like biorthogonal quantum mechanics and metric approach characterized by modified inner products, to normalization by time-dependent norms inspired by open quantum systems. In this work, we systematically explore the similarities and differences among these various methods. Utilizing illustrative models with exact solutions, we demonstrate that these methods produce not only quantitatively different results but also distinct physical interpretations. For dissipative systems where non-Hermiticity arises as an approximation, we find that simply dividing by the norm in the $\mathcal{PT}$-broken regime closely aligns with the full master equation solutions. In contrast, for quantum systems where non-Hermiticity can be engineered exactly, incorporating metric dynamics is crucial for the probabilistic interpretation of quantum mechanics, necessitating the generalizations of similarity transformations and unitarity to non-Hermitian systems. This study lays the groundwork for further exploration of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, potentially leveraging generalized transformations for novel physical phenomena.</description>
