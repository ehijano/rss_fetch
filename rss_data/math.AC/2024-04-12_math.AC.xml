      <title>Betti cones over fibre products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a fibre product of standard graded algebras over a field. We study the structure of syzygies of finitely generated graded $R$-modules. As an application of this, we show that the existence of an $R$-module of finite regularity and infinite projective dimension forces $R$ to be Koszul. We also look at the extremal rays of the Betti cone of finitely generated graded $R$-modules, and show that when $\operatorname{depth}(R)=1$, they are spanned by the Betti tables of pure $R$-modules if and only if $R$ is Cohen-Macaulay with minimal multiplicity.</description>

      <title>BCM-thresholds of hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we use big Cohen-Macaulay algebras to define a characteristic free analog of the $F$-thresholds, which we call BCM-thresholds, in the case of principal ideals. We prove that, similarly to the case of the $F$-thresholds, the set of BCM-thresholds and the set of BCM-jumping numbers agree. We also relate some BCM-thresholds to splittings of maps from the ring to a big Cohen-Macaulay algebra.</description>

      <title>A solution to Itoh's conjecture for integral closure filtration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(A,\mathfrak{m})$ be an analytically unramified Cohen-Macaulay local ring of dimension $d \geq 3$ and let $\mathfrak{a}$ be an $\mathfrak{m}$-primary ideal in $A$. If $I$ is an ideal in $A$ then let $I^*$ be the integral closure of $I$ in $A$. Let $G_{\mathfrak{a}}(A)^* = \bigoplus_{n\geq 0 }(\mathfrak{a}^n)^*/(\mathfrak{a}^{n+1})^*$ be the associated graded ring of the integral closure filtration of $\mathfrak{a}$. Itoh conjectured in 1992 that if third Hilbert coefficient of $G_{\mathfrak{a}}(A)^*$ , i.e., $e_3^{\mathfrak{a}^*}(A) = 0$ and $A$ is Gorenstein then
  $G_{\mathfrak{a}}(A)^*$ is Cohen-Macaulay. In this paper we prove Itoh's conjecture (more generally for analytically unramified Cohen-Macaulay local rings).</description>

      <title>Obstructions to semiorthogonal decompositions for singular projective varieties II: Representation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that odd-dimensional projective varieties with tilting objects and only ADE-singularities are nodal, i.e. they only have $A_1$-singularities. This is a very special case of more general obstructions to the existence of semiorthogonal decompositions for projective Gorenstein varieties. More precisely, for many isolated hypersurface singularities, we show that Kuznetsov-Shinder's categorical absorptions of singularities cannot contain tilting objects. The key idea is to compare singularity categories of projective varieties to singularity categories of finite-dimensional associative Gorenstein algebras. The former often contain special generators, called cluster-tilting objects, which typically have loops and $2$-cycles in their quivers. In contrast, quivers of cluster-tilting objects in the latter categories, can never have loops or $2$-cycles.</description>

      <title>Matroidal polynomials, their singularities, and applications to Feynman diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a matroid or flag of matroids we introduce several broad classes of polynomials satisfying Deletion-Contraction identities, and study their singularities.
  There are three main families of polynomials captured by our approach: matroidal polynomials on a matroid (including matroid basis polynomials, configuration polynomials, Tutte polynomials); flag matroidal polynomials on a flag matroid; and Feynman integrands. The last class includes under general kinematics the inhomogeneous Feynman diagram polynomials which naturally arise in the Lee--Pomeransky form of the Feynman integral attached to a Feynman diagram.
  Assuming that the primary underlying matroid is connected and of positive rank (and in the flag case, has rank at least two), we show: a) in positive characteristic, homogeneous matroidal polynomials are strongly $F$-regular; b) over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero, the associated jet schemes of (flag) matroidal polynomials as well as those of Feynman integrands are irreducible. Consequently, all these polynomials have rational singularities (or are smooth).</description>

      <title>The general Arason-Pfister Hauptsatz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.03784v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present we develop a fragment of the theory of superfields, polynomials and Marshall's quotient in order to obtain for general special groups, a proof of the Arason-Pfister Hauptsatz (APH): "if $\phi \neq \emptyset$ is an anisotropic form and $\phi \in I^n(F)$ then $dim (\phi) \geq 2^n$". In the process, we also obtain an alternative proof of APH for reduced special groups that avoid the uses of the invariants developed in \cite{dickmann2000special}. The applications of the full Arason-Pfister Hauptsatz leads to interesting properties of graded rings associated to special groups/hyperfields.
  \textbf{Keywords:} Arason-Pfister Hauptsatz; hyperfields; special groups; Milnor K-theory; graded rings.</description>

      <title>The Total Rank Conjecture in Characteristic Two</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.09771v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Total Rank Conjecture is a coarser version of the Buchsbaum-Eisenbud-Horrocks conjecture which, loosely stated, predicts that modules with large annihilators must also have ``large'' syzygies. This conjecture was proved by the second author for rings of odd characteristic by taking advantage of the Adams operations on the category of perfect complexes with finite length homology. In this paper, we prove a stronger form of the Total Rank Conjecture for rings of characteristic two. This result may be seen as evidence that the Generalized Total Rank Conjecture (which is known to be false in odd characteristic) actually holds in characteristic two. We also formulate a meaningful extension of the Total Rank Conjecture over non Cohen-Macaulay rings and prove that this conjecture holds for any ring containing a field (independent of characteristic).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.14596v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let A be a commutative unital ring and a an ideal in it. We define and study a-reduced complexes and a-coreduced complexes in both the category of chain complexes of A-modules as well as in the derived category of A-modules. We show that these two types of complexes give rise to variants of the well known Greenlees-May duality and the Matlis-Greenlees-May equivalence in the aforementioned categories.</description>

      <title>Surprising occurrences of order structures in mathematics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.01468v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Order and symmetry are main structural principles in mathematics. We give five examples where on the face of it order is not apparent, but deeper investigations reveal that they are governed by order structures. These examples are finite topologies, associative algebras, subgroups of matrix groups, ideals in polynomial rings, and classes of bipartite graphs.</description>

      <title>On the integrality of \'etale extensions of polynomial rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02219v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by a valuation theorem, recently obtained by Rangachev, we study the \'etale extensions $A\subset B$ of polynomial rings over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero, such that the integral closure $\overline{A}$ is a primary $\overline{A}$-submodule of $B$. We prove that in this case $\overline{A}$ has infinite cyclic divisor class group, where the generator is a prime divisor equal to the complement of $\textrm{Spec}(B)$ in $\textrm{Spec}(\overline{A})$. Moreover, this prime divisor coincides with the ramification divisor of the finite extension $A\subset \overline{A}$. In this situation we carry out Wright's geometric approach for two-dimensional non-integral \'etale extensions. It follows from the work of Miyanishi that $\textrm{Spec}(\overline{A})$ is a smooth affine surface. We show that $\textrm{Spec}(\overline{A})$ is an $\mathbb{A}^{1}$-bundle over $\mathbb{P}^{1}$, more precisely a Danilov-Gizatullin surface of index three. Based on Wright's analysis of which of these affine surfaces can factorize an \'etale morphism of the complex affine plane and his description of its affine coordinate rings, we prove that under the strong assumption that $\overline{A}$ is always a primary $\overline{A}$-submodule of $B$, any two-dimensional complex \'etale extension is integral.</description>
