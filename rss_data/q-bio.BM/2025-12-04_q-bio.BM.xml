      <title>Unlocking hidden biomolecular conformational landscapes in diffusion models at inference time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The function of biomolecules such as proteins depends on their ability to interconvert between a wide range of structures or "conformations." Researchers have endeavored for decades to develop computational methods to predict the distribution of conformations, which is far harder to determine experimentally than a static folded structure. We present ConforMix, an inference-time algorithm that enhances sampling of conformational distributions using a combination of classifier guidance, filtering, and free energy estimation. Our approach upgrades diffusion models -- whether trained for static structure prediction or conformational generation -- to enable more efficient discovery of conformational variability without requiring prior knowledge of major degrees of freedom. ConforMix is orthogonal to improvements in model pretraining and would benefit even a hypothetical model that perfectly reproduced the Boltzmann distribution. Remarkably, when applied to a diffusion model trained for static structure prediction, ConforMix captures structural changes including domain motion, cryptic pocket flexibility, and transporter cycling, while avoiding unphysical states. Case studies of biologically critical proteins demonstrate the scalability, accuracy, and utility of this method.</description>

      <title>DeepBioisostere: Discovering Bioisosteres with Deep Learning for a Fine Control of Multiple Molecular Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02706v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optimizing molecular properties while preserving biological activity is a central challenge in drug design. Bioisosteric replacement, which substitutes a molecular fragment with a chemically or biologically analogous moiety, offers a powerful strategy for fine-tuning properties without disrupting target binding. However, existing in silico approaches often rely on expert-defined modification sites or suffer from modulating multiple molecular properties simultaneously. Here, we present DeepBioisostere, a deep generative model that performs end-to-end bioisosteric replacement by autonomously selecting and substituting molecular fragments to satisfy multiple target properties. The model captures complex relationships across the molecular graph, enabling the optimization of sophisticated properties such as drug-likeness and synthetic accessibility. By learning from experimental bio-assay data, DeepBioisostere proposes replacements that maintain biological activities, even generating potential bioisosteres beyond the training data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the model in computational hit-to-lead optimization scenarios, highlighting its potential to accelerate rational molecular design without relying on expert heuristics or pre-established substitution rules.</description>

      <title>ConfRover: Simultaneous Modeling of Protein Conformation and Dynamics via Autoregression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17478v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding protein dynamics is critical for elucidating their biological functions. The increasing availability of molecular dynamics (MD) data enables the training of deep generative models to efficiently explore the conformational space of proteins. However, existing approaches either fail to explicitly capture the temporal dependencies between conformations or do not support direct generation of time-independent samples. To address these limitations, we introduce ConfRover, an autoregressive model that simultaneously learns protein conformation and dynamics from MD trajectories, supporting both time-dependent and time-independent sampling. At the core of our model is a modular architecture comprising: (i) an encoding layer, adapted from protein folding models, that embeds protein-specific information and conformation at each time frame into a latent space; (ii) a temporal module, a sequence model that captures conformational dynamics across frames; and (iii) an SE(3) diffusion model as the structure decoder, generating conformations in continuous space. Experiments on ATLAS, a large-scale protein MD dataset of diverse structures, demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in learning conformational dynamics and supporting a wide range of downstream tasks. ConfRover is the first model to sample both protein conformations and trajectories within a single framework, offering a novel and flexible approach for learning from protein MD data.
