      <title>Latent-space metrics for Complex-Valued VAE out-of-distribution detection under radar clutter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate complex-valued Variational AutoEncoders (CVAE) for radar Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) detection in complex radar environments. We proposed several detection metrics: the reconstruction error of CVAE (CVAE-MSE), the latent-based scores (Mahalanobis, Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD)), and compared their performance against the classical ANMF-Tyler detector (ANMF-FP). The performance of all these detectors is analyzed on synthetic and experimental radar data, showing the advantages and the weaknesses of each detector.</description>

      <title>White-Box Modeling of V2X Link Performance Using Stabilized Symbolic Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable modeling of block error rate in vehicle-to-everything wireless networks is critical for designing robust communication systems under dynamic mobility and diverse channel conditions. Traditional machine learning approaches, such as deep neural networks, achieve high predictive accuracy but lack interpretability and impose significant computational costs, limiting their applicability in real-time, resource-constrained environments. In this work, we propose a stabilized symbolic regression framework to derive compact, analytically interpretable expressions for block error rate prediction. Trained on realistic vehicle-to-everything simulation data, the symbolic regression framework for vehicle-to-everything model accurately captures nonlinear dependencies on key system parameters, including signal-to-noise ratio, relative velocity, modulation and coding schemes, number of demodulation reference signal symbols, and environmental factors (line of sight/non-line of sight). Our final symbolic expression comprises only 158 nodes, enabling ultra-fast inference suitable for embedded deployment. On the test set, the symbolic regression framework for vehicle-to-everything model achieves a coefficient of determination $R^2 = 0.8684$ and mean squared error $= 2.08 \times 10^{-2}$ in the original block error rate domain, outperforming conventional fixed-form regressions and offering comparable accuracy to neural networks while remaining fully interpretable. Overall, the proposed Stabilized Symbolic Regression Framework for V2X combines predictive performance, physical fidelity, and computational efficiency thus providing a powerful tool for real-time V2X communication system design, adaptive resource allocation, and rapid scenario evaluation.</description>

      <title>Joint Classification and Regression Deep Learning Model for Universal Phase-based Ranging in Multiple Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase-Based Ranging (PBR) offers several advantages for estimating distances between wirelessly connected devices, including high accuracy over large distances and the removal of the need for antenna arrays at each transceiver. This study investigates the use of Neural Network (NN)-based models for accurate PBR in three distinct environments: Openfield, Office, and Near Buildings, comparing their performance with established non-NN methods. A novel 2NN Model is proposed, integrating two neural networks: one to classify the environment and another to predict distances. Performance was evaluated over 20 trials for each method and dataset using root mean square error (RMSE) and maximum prediction error.
  Results show that the 2NN Model consistently outperformed other methods, frequently ranking among the top methods in minimizing both RMSE and maximum error. In addition, the 2NN Model achieved the best average RMSE and the lowest maximum error. To assess the effect of environment misclassification, filtered versions of the NN models were evaluated by omitting misclassified measurements prior to RMSE calculation. Although unsuitable for production use, the filtered models revealed that misclassifications in the 2NN Model had a significant impact. Its filtered variant achieved the lowest RMSE and maximum error across all datasets, and ranked first in the frequency of attaining the lowest maximum error over 20 trials.
  Overall, the findings show that NN models deliver robust, high-accuracy ranging across diverse environments, outperforming non-NN methods and reinforcing their potential as universal PBR solutions when trained on comprehensive distance datasets.</description>

      <title>AI/ML based Joint Source and Channel Coding for HARQ-ACK Payload</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Channel coding from 2G to 5G has assumed the inputs bits at the physical layer to be uniformly distributed. However, hybrid automatic repeat request acknowledgement (HARQ-ACK) bits transmitted in the uplink are inherently non-uniformly distributed. For such sources, significant performance gains could be obtained by employing joint source channel coding, aided by deep learning-based techniques. In this paper, we learn a transformer-based encoder using a novel "free-lunch" training algorithm and propose per-codeword power shaping to exploit the source prior at the encoder whilst being robust to small changes in the HARQ-ACK distribution. Furthermore, any HARQ-ACK decoder has to achieve a low negative acknowledgement (NACK) error rate to avoid radio link failures resulting from multiple NACK errors. We develop an extension of the Neyman-Pearson test to a coded bit system with multiple information bits to achieve Unequal Error Protection of NACK over ACK bits at the decoder. Finally, we apply the proposed encoder and decoder designs to a 5G New Radio (NR) compliant uplink setup under a fading channel, describing the optimal receiver design and a low complexity coherent approximation to it. Our results demonstrate 3-6 dB reduction in the average transmit power required to achieve the target error rates compared to the NR baseline, while also achieving a 2-3 dB reduction in the maximum transmit power, thus providing for significant coverage gains and power savings.</description>

      <title>Cross-Modal Semantic Communication for Heterogeneous Collaborative Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collaborative perception, an emerging paradigm in autonomous driving, has been introduced to mitigate the limitations of single-vehicle systems, such as limited sensor range and occlusion. To improve the robustness of inter-vehicle data sharing, semantic communication has recently further been integrated into collaborative perception systems to enhance overall performance. However, practical deployment of such systems is challenged by the heterogeneity of sensors across different connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs). This diversity in perceptual data complicates the design of a unified communication framework and impedes the effective fusion of shared information. To address this challenge, we propose a novel cross-modal semantic communication (CMSC) framework to facilitate effective collaboration among CAVs with disparate sensor configurations. Specifically, the framework first transforms heterogeneous perceptual features from different sensor modalities into a unified and standardized semantic space. Subsequently, encoding, transmission, and decoding are performed within this semantic space, enabling seamless and effective information fusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CMSC achieves significantly stronger perception performance than existing methods, particularly in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes.</description>

      <title>Redefining Radar Segmentation: Simultaneous Static-Moving Segmentation and Ego-Motion Estimation using Radar Point Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional radar segmentation research has typically focused on learning category labels for different moving objects. Although fundamental differences between radar and optical sensors lead to differences in the reliability of predicting accurate and consistent category labels, a review of common radar perception tasks in automotive reveals that determining whether an object is moving or static is a prerequisite for most tasks. To fill this gap, this study proposes a neural network based solution that can simultaneously segment static and moving objects from radar point clouds. Furthermore, since the measured radial velocity of static objects is correlated with the motion of the radar, this approach can also estimate the instantaneous 2D velocity of the moving platform or vehicle (ego motion). However, despite performing dual tasks, the proposed method employs very simple yet effective building blocks for feature extraction: multi layer perceptrons (MLPs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). In addition to being the first of its kind in the literature, the proposed method also demonstrates the feasibility of extracting the information required for the dual task directly from unprocessed point clouds, without the need for cloud aggregation, Doppler compensation, motion compensation, or any other intermediate signal processing steps. To measure its performance, this study introduces a set of novel evaluation metrics and tests the proposed method using a challenging real world radar dataset, RadarScenes. The results show that the proposed method not only performs well on the dual tasks, but also has broad application potential in other radar perception tasks.</description>

      <title>Sparse MIMO-OFDM Channel Estimation via RKHS Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a method for channel estimation in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) wireless communication systems. The method exploits the band-sparsity of wireless channels in the delay-beamspace domain by solving a regularized optimization problem in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). A suitable representer theorem allows us to transform the infinite-dimensional optimization problem into a finite-dimensional one, which we then approximate with a low-dimensional surrogate. We solve the resulting optimization problem using a forward-backward splitting (FBS)-based algorithm. By exploiting the problem's modulation structure, we achieve a computational complexity per iteration that is quasi-linear in the number of unknown variables. We also propose a data-driven deep-unfolding based extension to improve the performance at a reduced number of iterations. We evaluate our channel estimators on ray-traced channels generated with SionnaRT. The results show that our methods significantly outperform linear methods such as linear minimum mean squared error (LMMSE) channel estimation based on aggregate channel statistics, both in terms of raw estimation accuracy as well as in downstream performance.</description>

      <title>Joint Bit-Partitioning and Modulation Design for Digital AirComp</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For digital over-the-air computation, the ChannelComp framework has recently been proposed to design digital modulations to compute any arbitrary function over a multiple access channel. To reduce modulation design complexity while increasing computation reliability, this paper integrates a bit-partitioning procedure into ChannelComp. The key process is to partition the input bit sequence into several groups, map each group to a single modulation symbol and transmit the encoded symbol sequence across multiple time slots. With the objective to maximize a worst-case constellation distance, we develop two bit-partitioning methods. In uniform bit-partitioning, bits are evenly distributed across groups and modulation is designed via a max-min optimization, which is handled by a CCCP that solves a sequence of second-order cone programming subproblems. In importance-adaptive bit-partitioning (IABP), the bit allocation is adapted to the significance of individual bit positions, and the modulation and partitioning are jointly optimized. To keep the overall complexity manageable, simulated annealing is employed in the outer loop to update the partitioning, while a CCCP-based solver is used in the inner loop for modulation design. Numerical results show that both methods provide robust computation in noisy channels, and IABP achieves up to a 5 dB reduction in computation error compared to Sequential Modulation for AirComp, especially for product computation.</description>

      <title>Optimal Waveform Design for Continuous Aperture Array (CAPA)-aided ISAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel continuous-aperture-array (CAPA)-aided integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) framework is proposed. Specifically, an optimal continuous ISAC waveform is designed to form a directive beampattern for multi-target sensing while suppressing the multi-user interference (MUI). To achieve the goal of optimal waveform design, the directional beampattern of CAPA is first derived based on Green's function, whereafter a reference sensing waveform is obtained through wavenumber-domain optimization. Based on the reference sensing waveform, a weighted functional programming on the tradeoff between sensing beampattern mismatch and MUI is formulated. To solve the resulting problem, an optimal CAPA-ISAC waveform structure is analytically derived using a Lagrangian-transformation and calculus-of-variations method, where the Lagrangian multiplier associated with the optimal waveform structure is determined via Bisection search. The obtained optimal waveform reveals that it is concurrently affected by the reference sensing waveform, the channel correlations and the channel-symbol correlations. Finally, numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed system and waveform design, demonstrating that CAPA can achieve significant performance gains against the ISAC designs based on conventional spatially discrete array in both sensing accuracy and communication reliability.</description>

      <title>Rectified Flow for Vision-Aided mmWave V2I Beam Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a flow matching (FM) framework based on rectified flow for vision-aided beam prediction in vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) links. Instead of modeling discrete beam index sequences, the method learns a continuous latent flow governed by an ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based vector field, enabling smooth beam trajectories and fast sampling. A terminal flow constraint enforces global consistency under finite-step integration, stabilizing long-term prediction. The resulting FM-based model significantly improves top-K accuracy over RNN and LSTM baselines, approaches the performance of large language model-based approaches, and achieves inference speedups on the order of 10 x and 10^4 x on identical GPU and CPU deployments, respectively.</description>

Abstract: This paper derives second-order statistics for diversity-combining techniques over Log-mu fading channels. Closed-form expressions for the level crossing rate (LCR) and average fading duration (AFD) are derived for pure selection combining (PSC), while exact multidimensional integral expressions are obtained for equal gain combining (EGC) and maximal ratio combining (MRC). The analysis considers M unbalanced, independent, and non-identically distributed (i.n.i.d.) Log-mu fading channels. Monte Carlo simulations are conducted to validate the theoretical results, demonstrating excellent agreement and confirming the accuracy of the proposed expressions.</description>

      <title>Next-Generation MIMO Transceivers for Integrated Sensing and Communications: Unique Security Vulnerabilities and Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communications (ISAC), which is recognized as a key enabler for sixth generation (6G), has brought new opportunities for intelligent, sustainable, and connected wireless networks. Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) transceiver technology lies at the core of this paradigm, providing the degrees of freedom required for simultaneous data transmission and accurate radar sensing. The tight integration of sensing and communication introduces unique security vulnerabilities that extend beyond conventional physical-layer security (PLS). In particular, high-power transmissions directed at sensing targets may empower adversarial eavesdroppers, whereas passive interception of ISAC echoes can reveal sensitive information such as target locations and mobility patterns. This article presents an overview of recent advances in MIMO ISAC transceiver design, considering transmitter perspectives, receiver architectures, and full-duplex implementations. We examine MIMO transceiver designs under unique security threats specific to ISAC and highlight emerging countermeasures, including secure signaling design, interference exploitation, and transceiver optimization under adversarial conditions. Finally, we discuss challenges and research opportunities for developing secure ISAC systems in next-generation wireless networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Access to quality education remains unequal, particularly in rural areas where Internet connectivity is limited or nonexistent. This paper introduces a framework for a digital learning platform that uses Delay Tolerant Networking (DTN) to extend educational opportunities to underserved communities. Unlike conventional models that rely on continuous Internet access, DTN offers an affordable and sustainable solution by leveraging existing transportation infrastructure. Beyond its technical contributions, the framework addresses ethical imperatives by promoting educational equity and digital inclusion. We present a prototype tested on a university campus, demonstrating the feasibility of DTN for educational delivery. By addressing the digital divide, this framework aligns with global goals of inclusive education and sustainable development.</description>

      <title>Digital Twin-Assisted High-Precision Massive MIMO Localization in Urban Canyons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-precision wireless localization in urban canyons is challenged by noisy measurements and severe non-line-of-sight (NLOS) propagation. This paper proposes a robust three-stage algorithm synergizing a digital twin (DT) model with the random sample consensus (RANSAC) algorithm to overcome these limitations. The method leverages the DT for geometric path association and employs RANSAC to identify reliable line-of-sight (LOS) and single-bounce NLOS paths while rejecting multi-bounce outliers. A final optimization on the resulting inlier set estimates the user's position and clock bias. Simulations validate that by effectively turning NLOS paths into valuable geometric information via the DT, the approach enables accurate localization, reduces reliance on direct LOS, and significantly lowers system deployment costs, making it suitable for practical deployment.</description>

      <title>Time-Domain Linear Model-based Framework for Passive Acoustic Mapping of Cavitation Activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Passive acoustic mapping enables the spatial mapping and temporal monitoring of cavitation activity, playing a crucial role in therapeutic ultrasound applications. Most conventional beamforming methods, whether implemented in the time or frequency domains, suffer from limited axial resolution due to the absence of a reference emission onset time. While frequency-domain methods, the most efficient of which are based on the cross-spectral matrix, require long signals for accurate estimation, time-domain methods typically achieve lower spatial resolution. To address these limitations, we propose a linear model-based beamforming framework fully formulated in the time domain. The linear forward model relates a discretized spatiotemporal distribution of cavitation activity to the temporal signals recorded by a probe, explicitly accounting for time-of-flight delays dictated by the acquisition geometry. This model is then inverted using regularization techniques that exploit prior knowledge of cavitation activity in both spatial and temporal domains. Experimental results show that the proposed framework achieves enhanced or competitive cavitation map quality while using only 20\% of the data typically required by frequency-domain methods. This highlights the substantial gain in data efficiency and the flexibility of our spatiotemporal regularization to adapt to diverse passive cavitation scenarios, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques.</description>

      <title>Near-Field Multipath MIMO Channels: Modeling Reflectors and Exploiting NLOS Paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Near-field (NF) communications is receiving renewed interest in the context of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems involving large physical apertures with respect to the signal wavelength. While line-of-sight (LOS) links are typically expected to dominate in NF scenarios, the impact of non-LOS (NLOS) components at both in centimeter- and millimeter-wave frequencies may be in general non-negligible. Moreover, although weaker than the LOS path, NLOS links may be essential for achieving multiplexing gains in MIMO systems. The commonly used NF channel models for NLOS links in the literature are based on the point scattering assumption, which is not valid for large reflectors such as walls, ceilings, and the ground. In this paper, we develop a generalized statistical NF MIMO channel model that extends the widely adopted point scattering framework to account for imperfect reflections from large surfaces. This model is then leveraged to investigate how the physical characteristics of these reflectors influence the resulting NF MIMO channel. In addition, using the proposed channel model, we analytically demonstrate for a multi-user scenario that, even when users are located within the NF regime, relying solely on LOS NF links may be insufficient to achieve multiplexing gains, thus exploiting NLOS links becomes essential. Our simulation results validate the accuracy of the proposed model and show that, in many practical settings, the contribution of NLOS components is non-negligible and must be carefully accounted for in the system design.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Dominant-Interferer Approximation for SINR Coverage in Poisson Cellular Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate radio propagation and interference modeling is essential for the design and analysis of modern cellular networks. Stochastic geometry offers a rigorous framework by treating base station locations as a Poisson point process and enabling coverage characterization through spatial averaging, but its expressions often involve nested integrals and special functions that limit general applicability. Probabilistic interference models seek closed-form characterizations through moment-based approximations, yet these expressions remain tractable only for restricted parameter choices and become unwieldy when interference moments lack closed-form representations. This work introduces a hybrid approximation framework that addresses these challenges by combining Monte Carlo sampling of a small set of dominant interferers with a Laplace functional representation of the residual far-field interference. The resulting dominant-plus-tail structure provides a modular, numerically stable, and path-loss-agnostic estimator suitable for both noise-limited and interference-limited regimes. We further derive theoretical error bounds that decrease with the number of dominant interferers and validate the approach against established stochastic geometry and probabilistic modeling benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Joint Satellite Power Consumption and Handover Optimization for LEO Constellations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In satellite constellation-based communication systems, continuous user coverage requires frequent handoffs due to the dynamic topology induced by the Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites. Each handoff between a satellite and ground users introduces additional signaling and power consumption, which can become a significant burden as the size of the constellation continues to increase. This work focuses on the optimization of the total transmission rate in a LEO-to-user system, by jointly considering the total transmitted power, user-satellite associations, and power consumption, the latter being handled through a penalty on handoff events. We consider a system where LEO satellites serve users located in remote areas with no terrestrial connectivity, and formulate the power allocation problem as a mixed-integer concave linear program (MICP) subject to power and association constraints. Our approach can be solved with off-the-shelf solvers and is benchmarked against a naive baseline where users associate to their closest visible satellite. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in controlling the handoff frequency while maintaining high user throughput. These performance gains highlight the effectiveness of our handover-aware optimization strategy, which ensures that user rates improve significantly, by about 40%, without incurring a disproportionate rise in the handoff frequency.</description>

      <title>Towards Edge General Intelligence: Knowledge Distillation for Mobile Agentic AI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Edge General Intelligence (EGI) represents a paradigm shift in mobile edge computing, where intelligent agents operate autonomously in dynamic, resource-constrained environments. However, the deployment of advanced agentic AI models on mobile and edge devices faces significant challenges due to limited computation, energy, and storage resources. To address these constraints, this survey investigates the integration of Knowledge Distillation (KD) into EGI, positioning KD as a key enabler for efficient, communication-aware, and scalable intelligence at the wireless edge. In particular, we emphasize KD techniques specifically designed for wireless communication and mobile networking, such as channel-aware self-distillation, cross-model Channel State Information (CSI) feedback distillation, and robust modulation/classification distillation. Furthermore, we review novel architectures natively suited for KD and edge deployment, such as Mamba, RWKV (Receptance, Weight, Key, Value) and Cross-Architecture distillation, which enhance generalization capabilities. Subsequently, we examine diverse applications in which KD-driven architectures enable EGI across vision, speech, and multimodal tasks. Finally, we highlight the key challenges and future directions for KD in EGI. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive reference for researchers exploring KD-driven frameworks for mobile agentic AI in the era of EGI.</description>

      <title>CSI Prediction Frameworks for Enhanced 5G Link Adaptation: Performance-Complexity Trade-offs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate and timely channel state information (CSI) is fundamental for efficient link adaptation. However, challenges such as channel aging, user mobility, and feedback delays significantly impact the performance of adaptive modulation and coding (AMC). This paper proposes and evaluates two CSI prediction frameworks applicable to both time division duplexing (TDD) and frequency division duplexing (FDD) systems. The proposed methods operate in the effective signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) domain to reduce complexity while preserving predictive accuracy. A comparative analysis is conducted between a classical Wiener filter and state-of-the-art deep learning frameworks based on gated recurrent units (GRUs), long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, and a delayed deep neural network (DNN). The evaluation considers the accuracy of the prediction in terms of mean squared error (MSE), the performance of the system, and the complexity of the implementation regarding floating point operations (FLOPs). Furthermore, we investigate the generalizability of both approaches under various propagation conditions. The simulation results show that the Wiener filter performs close to GRU in terms of MSE and throughput with lower computational complexity, provided that the second-order statistics of the channel are available. However, the GRU model exhibits enhanced generalization across different channel scenarios. These findings suggest that while learningbased solutions are well-suited for TDD systems where the base station (BS) handles the computation, the lower complexity of classical methods makes them a preferable choice for FDD setups, where prediction occurs at the power-constrained user equipment (UE).</description>

      <title>An Active Dry-Contact Continuous EEG Monitoring System for Seizure Detection Applications in Clinical Neurophysiology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23338v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Objective: Young children and infants, especially newborns, are highly susceptible to seizures, which, if undetected and untreated, can lead to severe long-term neurological consequences. Early detection typically requires continuous electroencephalography (cEEG) monitoring in hospital settings, involving costly equipment and highly trained specialists. This study presents a low-cost, active dry-contact electrode-based, adjustable electroencephalography (EEG) headset, combined with an explainable deep learning model for seizure detection from reduced-montage EEG, and a multimodal artifact removal algorithm to enhance signal quality. Methods: EEG signals were acquired via active electrodes and processed through a custom-designed analog front end for filtering and digitization. The adjustable headset was fabricated using three-dimensional printing and laser cutting to accommodate varying head sizes. The deep learning model was trained to detect neonatal seizures in real time, and a dedicated multimodal algorithm was implemented for artifact removal while preserving seizure-relevant information. System performance was evaluated in a representative clinical setting on a pediatric patient with absence seizures, with simultaneous recordings obtained from the proposed device and a commercial wet-electrode cEEG system for comparison. Results: Signals from the proposed system exhibited a correlation coefficient exceeding 0.8 with those from the commercial device. Signal-to-noise ratio analysis indicated noise mitigation performance comparable to the commercial system. The deep learning model achieved accuracy and recall improvements of 2.76% and 16.33%, respectively, over state-of-the-art approaches. The artifact removal algorithm effectively identified and eliminated noise while preserving seizure-related EEG features.</description>

      <title>Multi-Symbol Digital AirComp via Modulation Design and Power Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08670v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, over-the-air computation (AirComp) leverages the superposition property of wireless channels to enable efficient function computation over a multiple access channel (MAC). However, existing digital AirComp methods either rely on single-symbol modulation, which limits flexibility and robustness, or on multi-symbol extensions that suffer from high complexity or approximation errors. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new multi-symbol modulation framework, termed sequential modulation for AirComp (SeMAC), which encodes each input into a sequence of symbols with distinct constellation diagrams across multiple time slots. This approach increases design flexibility and robustness against channel noise. Specifically, the modulation design is formulated as a non-convex optimization problem and efficiently solved through a successive convex approximation (SCA) combined with stochastic subgradient descent (SSD). For fixed modulation formats, we further develop SeMAC with power adaptation (SeMAC-PA) to adjusts transmit power and phase while preserving the modulation structure. Notably, numerical results show that SeMAC improves computation accuracy by up to 14 dB compared to the existing methods for computing nonlinear functions such as the product function.</description>

      <title>Time-Frequency Mode Decomposition: A Morphological Segmentation Framework for Signal Analysis and Its Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11919v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While time-frequency analysis provides rich representations of multicomponent signals, current decomposition methods often overlook the morphological structure where components manifest as distinct regions. This study introduces time-frequency mode decomposition (TFMD), a novel framework that formulates signal decomposition as a generalized morphological segmentation problem within the continuous phase space. TFMD establishes an operator-theoretic framework utilizing the short-time Fourier transform as a canonical tight frame. The methodology employs unsupervised k-means clustering to identify high-energy pixels, followed by connected component labeling to establish core regions. A novel iterative competitive dilation algorithm is then applied to expand these core regions to recover the full support of each mode and define its specific time-frequency mask for mode reconstruction. This approach automatically determines the number of components without prior specification while strictly enforcing mutual exclusivity between modes. Comprehensive numerical investigations demonstrate TFMD's superior reconstruction fidelity, noise robustness, and computational efficiency compared to benchmark methods. TFMD achieves the lowest individual mode errors across diverse non-stationary signals and secures the second-best runtime. Practical validation through wind turbine vibration analysis confirms TFMD's ability to isolate both dominant fundamental frequencies and weaker harmonic components across discrete operational states, overcoming limitations of mode splitting and mixing issues observed in benchmark methods.</description>

      <title>Lightweight Gradient Descent Optimization for Mitigating Hardware Imperfections in RIS Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15544v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ongoing discussions about the future of wireless communications are reaching a turning point as standardization activities for the sixth generation of mobile networks (6G) become more mature. New technologies must now face renewed scrutiny by the industry and academia in order to be ready for deployment in the near future. Recently, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) gained attention as a promising solution for improving the propagation conditions of signal transmission in general. The RIS is a planar array of tunable resonant elements designed to dynamically and precisely manipulate the reflection of incident electromagnetic waves. However, the physical structure of the RIS and its components may be subject to practical limitations and imperfections. It is imperative that the hardware imperfections (HWIs) associated with the RIS be analyzed, so that it remains a feasible technology from a practical standpoint. Moreover, solutions for mitigating the HWIs must be considered, as is discussed in this work. More specifically, we introduce a gradient descent optimization for mitigating HWIs in RIS-aided wideband communication systems. Numerical results show that the proposed optimization is able to compensate for HWIs such as the phase-shift noise (PSN) and RIS surface deformations.</description>

      <title>Rotatable Antenna Aided Mixed Near-Field and Far-Field Communications in the Upper Mid-Band: Interference Analysis and Joint Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04865v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose to leverage rotatable antennas (RAs) for improving the communication performance in mixed near-field and far-field communication systems by exploiting a new spatial degree-of-freedom (DoF) offered by antenna rotation to mitigate complex near-field interference and mixed-field interference. Specifically, we investigate a modular RA-enabled mixed-field downlink communication system, where a base station (BS) consisting of multiple RA subarrays communicates with multiple near-field users in the presence of several legacy far-field users. We formulate an optimization problem to maximize the sum-rate of the near-field users by jointly optimizing the power allocation and rotation angles of all subarrays at the BS. To gain useful insights into the effect of RAs on mixed-field communications, we first analyze a special case where all subarrays share the same rotation angle and obtain closed-form expressions for the rotation-aware normalized near-field interference and the rotation-aware normalized mixed-field interference using the Fresnel integrals. We then analytically reveal that array rotation effectively suppresses both interference types, thereby significantly enhancing mixed-field communication performance. For the general case involving subarray-wise rotation, we propose an efficient double-layer algorithm to obtain a high-quality solution, where the inner layer optimizes power allocation using the successive convex approximation (SCA) technique, while the outer layer determines the rotation angles of all subarrays via particle swarm optimization (PSO). Finally, numerical results highlight the significant performance gains achieved by RAs over conventional fixed-antenna systems and demonstrate the effectiveness of our developed joint design compared to benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>AnyPPG: An ECG-Guided PPG Foundation Model Trained on Over 100,000 Hours of Recordings for Holistic Health Profiling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01747v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background: Photoplethysmography (PPG) offers a noninvasive and accessible modality for health monitoring beyond clinical settings. However, existing studies are limited by the scale and diversity of labeled data, constraining model accuracy, generalizability, and the exploration of broader applications. This study investigates the potential of PPG for holistic health profiling through the integration of foundation model techniques.
  Methods: We present AnyPPG, a PPG foundation model pretrained on large-scale, multi-source synchronized PPG-ECG data. By aligning PPG and ECG representations within a shared space, AnyPPG learns physiologically meaningful features from unlabeled signals. Its capability was further evaluated across a diverse set of downstream tasks, encompassing both conventional physiological analysis and comprehensive multi-organ disease diagnosis.
  Results: Across eleven physiological analysis tasks spanning six independent datasets, AnyPPG achieved state-of-the-art performance, with average improvements of 12.8% in regression and 9.1% in classification tasks over the next-best model. In multi-organ disease diagnosis, AnyPPG demonstrated broad cross-system diagnostic potential. Among 1,014 ICD-10 three-digit disease categories, 13 achieved an AUC above 0.8 and 137 exceeded 0.7. Beyond strong performance in cardiovascular diseases such as heart failure, valvular disorders, and hypertension, AnyPPG also showed substantial diagnostic value for non-cardiovascular conditions, exemplified by Parkinson's disease (AUC = 0.78) and chronic kidney disease (AUC = 0.74).
  Conclusions: AnyPPG demonstrates that a PPG foundation model trained through physiological alignment with ECG can produce accurate and robust signal representations. Building on this capability, it underscores the potential of PPG as a modality for comprehensive assessment of systemic and multi-organ health.</description>

      <title>BeamCKM: A Framework of Channel Knowledge Map Construction for Multi-Antenna Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18376v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The channel knowledge map (CKM) enables efficient construction of high-fidelity mapping between spatial environments and channel parameters via electromagnetic information analysis. Nevertheless, existing studies are largely confined to single-antenna systems, failing to offer dedicated guidance for multi-antenna communication scenarios. To address the inherent conflict between traditional real-value pathloss map and multi-degree-of-freedom (DoF) coherent beamforming in B5G/6G systems, this paper proposes a novel concept of BeamCKM and CKMTransUNet architecture. The CKMTransUNet approach combines a UNet backbone for multi-scale feature extraction with a vision transformer (ViT) module to capture global dependencies among encoded linear vectors, utilizing a composite loss function to characterize the beam propagation characteristics. Furthermore, based on the CKMTransUNet backbone, this paper presents a methodology named M3ChanNet. It leverages the multi-modal learning technique and cross-attention mechanisms to extract intrinsic side information from environmental profiles and real-time multi-beam observations, thereby further improving the map construction accuracy. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) interpolation methods and deep learning (DL) approaches, delivering superior performance even when environmental contours are inaccurate. For reproducibility, the code is publicly accessible at https://github.com/github-whh/BeamCKM.</description>

      <title>FMPlug: Plug-In Foundation Flow-Matching Priors for Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00721v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present FMPlug, a novel plug-in framework that enhances foundation flow-matching (FM) priors for solving ill-posed inverse problems. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on domain-specific or untrained priors, FMPlug smartly leverages two simple but powerful insights: the similarity between observed and desired objects and the Gaussianity of generative flows. By introducing a time-adaptive warm-up strategy and sharp Gaussianity regularization, FMPlug unlocks the true potential of domain-agnostic foundation models. Our method beats state-of-the-art methods that use foundation FM priors by significant margins, on image super-resolution and Gaussian deblurring.</description>

      <title>Scalable FPGA Framework for Real-Time Denoising in High-Throughput Imaging: A DRAM-Optimized Pipeline using High-Level Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14917v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-throughput imaging workflows, such as Parallel Rapid Imaging with Spectroscopic Mapping (PRISM), generate data at rates that exceed conventional real-time processing capabilities. We present a scalable FPGA-based preprocessing pipeline for real-time denoising, implemented via High-Level Synthesis (HLS) and optimized for DRAM-backed buffering. Our architecture performs frame subtraction and averaging directly on streamed image data, minimizing latency through burst-mode AXI4 interfaces. The resulting kernel operates below the inter-frame interval, enabling inline denoising and reducing dataset size for downstream CPU/GPU analysis. Validated under PRISM-scale acquisition, this modular FPGA framework offers a practical solution for latency-sensitive imaging workflows in spectroscopy and microscopy.</description>

      <title>Design of A Low-Latency and Parallelizable SVD Dataflow Architecture on FPGA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12461v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Singular value decomposition (SVD) is widely used for dimensionality reduction and noise suppression, and it plays a pivotal role in numerous scientific and engineering applications. As the dimensions of the matrix grow rapidly, the computational cost increases significantly, posing a serious challenge to the efficiency of data analysis and signal processing systems, especially in time-sensitive scenarios involving large-scale datasets. Although various dedicated hardware architectures have been proposed to accelerate the computation of intensive SVD, many of these designs suffer from limited scalability and high consumption of on-chip memory resources. Moreover, they typically overlook the computational and data transfer challenges associated with SVD, making them unsuitable for real-time processing of large-scale data stream matrices in embedded systems. In this paper, we propose a Data Stream-Based SVD processing algorithm (DSB Jacobi), which significantly reduces on-chip BRAM usage while improving computational speed, offering a practical solution for real-time SVD computation of large-scale data streams. Compared to previous works, our experimental results indicate that the proposed method reduces on-chip RAM consumption by 41.5 percent and improves computational efficiency by a factor of 23.</description>
