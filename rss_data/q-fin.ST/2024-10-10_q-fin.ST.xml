      <title>SARF: Enhancing Stock Market Prediction with Sentiment-Augmented Random Forest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stock trend forecasting, a challenging problem in the financial domain, involves ex-tensive data and related indicators. Relying solely on empirical analysis often yields unsustainable and ineffective results. Machine learning researchers have demonstrated that the application of random forest algorithm can enhance predictions in this context, playing a crucial auxiliary role in forecasting stock trends. This study introduces a new approach to stock market prediction by integrating sentiment analysis using FinGPT generative AI model with the traditional Random Forest model. The proposed technique aims to optimize the accuracy of stock price forecasts by leveraging the nuanced understanding of financial sentiments provided by FinGPT. We present a new methodology called "Sentiment-Augmented Random Forest" (SARF), which in-corporates sentiment features into the Random Forest framework. Our experiments demonstrate that SARF outperforms conventional Random Forest and LSTM models with an average accuracy improvement of 9.23% and lower prediction errors in pre-dicting stock market movements.</description>

      <title>Cyber Risk Taxonomies: Statistical Analysis of Cybersecurity Risk Classifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cyber risk classifications are widely used in the modeling of cyber event distributions, yet their effectiveness in out of sample forecasting performance remains underexplored. In this paper, we analyse the most commonly used classifications and argue in favour of switching the attention from goodness-of-fit and in-sample predictive performance, to focusing on the out-of sample forecasting performance. We use a rolling window analysis, to compare cyber risk distribution forecasts via threshold weighted scoring functions. Our results indicate that business motivated cyber risk classifications appear to be too restrictive and not flexible enough to capture the heterogeneity of cyber risk events. We investigate how dynamic and impact-based cyber risk classifiers seem to be better suited in forecasting future cyber risk losses than the other considered classifications. These findings suggest that cyber risk types provide limited forecasting ability concerning cyber event severity distribution, and cyber insurance ratemakers should utilize cyber risk types only when modeling the cyber event frequency distribution. Our study offers valuable insights for decision-makers and policymakers alike, contributing to the advancement of scientific knowledge in the field of cyber risk management.</description>

      <title>Efficient Asymmetric Causality Tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03137v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Asymmetric causality tests are increasingly gaining popularity in different scientific fields. This approach corresponds better to reality since logical reasons behind asymmetric behavior exist and need to be considered in empirical investigations. Hatemi-J (2012) introduced the asymmetric causality tests via partial cumulative sums for positive and negative components of the variables operating within the vector autoregressive (VAR) model. However, since the residuals across the equations in the VAR model are not independent, the ordinary least squares method for estimating the parameters is not efficient. Additionally, asymmetric causality tests mean having different causal parameters (i.e., for positive or negative components), thus, it is crucial to assess not only if these causal parameters are individually statistically significant, but also if their difference is statistically significant. Consequently, tests of difference between estimated causal parameters should explicitly be conducted, which are neglected in the existing literature. The purpose of the current paper is to deal with these issues explicitly. An application is provided, and ten different hypotheses pertinent to the asymmetric causal interaction between two largest financial markets worldwide are efficiently tested within a multivariate setting.</description>
