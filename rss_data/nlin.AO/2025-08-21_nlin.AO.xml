      <title>Synaptic bundle theory for spike-driven sensor-motor system: More than eight independent synaptic bundles collapse reward-STDP learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neuronal spikes directly drive muscles and endow animals with agile movements, but applying the spike-based control signals to actuators in artificial sensor-motor systems inevitably causes a collapse of learning. We developed a system that can vary \emph{the number of independent synaptic bundles} in sensor-to-motor connections. This paper demonstrates the following four findings: (i) Learning collapses once the number of motor neurons or the number of independent synaptic bundles exceeds a critical limit. (ii) The probability of learning failure is increased by a smaller number of motor neurons, while (iii) if learning succeeds, a smaller number of motor neurons leads to faster learning. (iv) The number of weight updates that move in the opposite direction of the optimal weight can quantitatively explain these results. The functions of spikes remain largely unknown. Identifying the parameter range in which learning systems using spikes can be constructed will make it possible to study the functions of spikes that were previously inaccessible due to the difficulty of learning.</description>

      <title>Adversarial control of synchronization in complex oscillator networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02403v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates adversarial attacks, a concept from deep learning, designed to control synchronization dynamics through strategically crafted weak perturbations. We propose a gradient-based optimization method that identifies small phase perturbations to dramatically enhance or suppress collective synchronization in Kuramoto oscillator networks. Our approach formulates synchronization control as an adversarial optimization problem, computing gradients of the order parameter with respect to oscillator phases to determine optimal perturbation directions. Results demonstrate that extremely small phase perturbations applied to network oscillators can achieve significant synchronization control across diverse network architectures. Our analysis reveals that synchronization enhancement is achievable across various network sizes, while synchronization suppression becomes particularly effective in larger networks, with effectiveness scaling favorably with network size. The method is systematically validated on canonical model networks including scale-free and small-world topologies, and real-world networks representing power grids and brain connectivity patterns. This adversarial framework represents a novel paradigm for synchronization management by introducing deep learning concepts to networked dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>A ubiquitous transfer function links interacting elements to emerging property of complex systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03347v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the field of complex systems, self-organization magnifies the compounding effects of element interactions by propagating, modifying, and enhancing functionality, ultimately leading to emergent system properties. The intricacies of self-organization make unveiling the elusive link between element interactions and emergent system properties akin to finding the proverbial Holy Grail. In the search for identifying a method to predict system-level properties, we used an inductive approach to bypass the self-organization. By observing drug interactions within biological complex system, system property, efficacy, emerged as a smooth response surface in the multi-dimensional space of drug-system interactions, which can be represented by the Complex System Response (CSR) function. This CSR function has been successfully validated across diverse disease models in cell lines, animals, and clinical trials. Notably, the CSR function reveals that biological complex systems exhibit second-order non-linearity. In this study, we generalized the CSR function to physical complex systems, linking maximum compressive yielding stress to impactful manufacturing parameters of the Selective Laser Melting (SLM) process. Remarkably though anticipated, the CSR function reveals the connection between the macroscale system property (compressive yielding stress) and the microstructure during self-organizing process. In addition, the second-order non-linear CSR functions ensure a single global optimum in complex systems.</description>

      <title>Binary Decision Process in Pre-Evacuation Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08284v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In crowd evacuation the time interval before decisive movement towards a safe place is defined as the pre-evacuation phase, and it has crucial impact on the total time required for safe egress. This process mainly refers to situation awareness and response to an external stressors, e.g., fire alarm. Due to the complexity of human cognitive process, simulation is used to study this important time interval. In this paper a binary decision process is formulated to simulate pre-evacuation time of many evacuees in a given social context. The model combines classic opinion dynamics with binary phase transition to describe how group pre-evacuation time emerges from individual interaction. The model parameters are quantitatively meaningful to human factors research within socio-psychological background, e.g., whether an individual is stubborn or open-minded, or what kind of the social topology exists among the individuals and how it matters in aggregating individuals into social groups. The modeling framework also describes collective motion of many evacuees in a planar space, and the resulting multi-agent system is partly similar to Vicsek model, and it is meaningful to explore complex crowd behavior in social context.</description>
