      <title>Large quadrupole deformation in $^{20}$Ne challenges rotor model and modern theory: urging for $\alpha$ clusters in nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spectroscopic quadrupole moment of the first excited state, $Q_{_S}(2^{+}_{1})$, at 1.634 MeV in $^{20}$Ne was determined from sensitive reorientation-effect Coulomb-excitation measurements using a heavy target and safe energies well below the Coulomb barrier. Particle-$\gamma$ coincidence measurements were collected at iThemba LABS with a digital data-acquisition system using the {\sc AFRODITE} array coupled to an annular, doubled-sided silicon detector. A precise value of $Q_{_S}(2^{+}_{1})=-0.22(2)$ eb was determined at backward angles in agreement with the only safe-energy measurement prior to this work, $Q_{_S}(2^{+}_{1})=-0.23(8)$ eb. This result adopts 1$\hbar\omega$ shell-model calculations of the nuclear dipole polarizability of the 2$^+_1$ state that contributes to the effective quadrupole interaction and determination of $Q_{_S}(2^{+}_{1})$. It disagrees, however, with the ideal rotor model for axially-symmetric nuclei by almost $3\sigma$. Larger discrepancies are computed by modern state-of-the-art calculations performed in this and prior work, including {\it ab initio} shell model with chiral effective interactions and the multi-reference relativistic energy density functional ({\sc MR-EDF}) model. The intrinsic nucleon density of the 2$^+_1$ state in $^{20}$Ne calculated with the {\sc MR-EDF} model illustrates the presence of $\alpha$ clustering, which explains the largest discrepancy with the rotor model found in the nuclear chart and motivates the explicit inclusion of $\alpha$ clustering for full convergence of $E2$ collective properties.</description>

      <title>Neutron skin thickness for $^{208}$Pb from total cross sections of neutron scattering at 14.137 MeV and neutron skin thickness for $^{48}$Ca, O, N, C isotopes from reaction and interaction cross sections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foster {\it et al.} measured total neutron cross sections $\sigma_{\rm T}$ of n+$^{208}$Pb scattering at $E_{\rm lab}= 14.137$~MeV. We tested the Kyushu (chira)l $g$-matrix folding model for reaction cross sections $\sigma_{\rm R}$ on p+$^{208}$Pb scattering in $20 \lsim E_{\rm lab} \lsim 180$MeV and found that our folding model is reliable. As for $^{12}$C+$^{12}$C scattering, we tested the Kyushu $g$-matrix folding model and found that the folding model is reliable for $\sigma_{\rm R}$ in $30 \lsim E_{\rm lab} \lsim 100 $~MeV/u and $250 \lsim E_{\rm lab} \lsim 400 $MeV/u. Ozawa {\it et al.} accumulated the measured values of interaction cross sections $\sigma_{\rm I}$ and the extracted matter radii $r_{\rm m}$ from $^{4}$He to $^{32}$Mg. Bagchi {\it et al.} determined proton radii $r_{\rm p}({\rm CC})$ for $^{14,15,17 \text{--} 22}$N by measuring the charge-changing (CC) cross sections, and found a signal of $^{22}$N being a halo nucleus. Kanungo {\it et al.} measured the CC cross sections and extracted $r_{\rm p}({\rm CC})$ for $^{12\text{--} 19}$C. Kaur {\it et al.} made a similar measurement and determined $r_{\rm p}({\rm CC})$ for $^{16,18 \text{--} 24}$O. Our 1st aim is to extract neutron skin thickness $r_{\rm skin}^{208}$ from the $\sigma_{\rm T}$ of n+$^{208}$Pb scattering at $E_{\rm lab} =14.137$MeV. Our 2nd aim is to test the Kyushu $g$-matrix folding model for $^{4}$He+$^{208}$Pb scattering in $30 \lsim E_{\rm lab} \lsim 180$MeV. 0ur 3rd aim is to find stable nuclei having nuclei having large $r_{\rm skin}$. We extract $r_{\rm skin}^{208}=0.309 \pm 0.057$~fm from the $\sigma_{\rm T}$. We find that $r_{\rm skin}= 0.267 \pm 0.056$~fm for $^{14}$N and $r_{\rm skin}= 0.197 \pm 0.067$~fm for $^{17}$O. The value $r_{\rm skin}^{208}=0.309 \pm 0.057$~fm agrees with $r_{\rm skin}^{208}({\rm PREX2})$.</description>

      <title>Measurement of enhanced electric dipole transition strengths at high spin in $^{100}$Ru: Possible observation of octupole deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The majority of atomic nuclei have deformed shapes and nearly all these shapes are symmetric with respect to reflection. There are only a few reflection asymmetric pear-shaped nuclei that have been found in actinide and lanthanide regions, which have static octupole deformation. These nuclei possess an intrinsic electric dipole moment due to the shift between the center of charge and the center of mass. This manifests in the enhancement of the electric dipole transition rates. In this article, we report on the measurement of the lifetimes of the high spin levels of the two alternate parity bands in $^{100}$Ru through the Doppler Shift Attenuation Method. The estimated electric dipole transition rates have been compared with the calculated transition rates using the triaxial projected shell model without octupole deformation, and are found to be an order of magnitude enhanced. Thus, the observation of seven inter-leaved electric dipole transitions with enhanced rates establish $^{100}$Ru as possibly the first octupole deformed nucleus reported in the A $\approx$ 100 mass region.</description>

      <title>Recent results on heavy flavours and quarkonia from ALICE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heavy-flavour hadrons, containing at least one charm or beauty quark, are excellent probes of the deconfined medium created in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions, known as quark-gluon plasma. Results in smaller collision systems, such as proton-proton and p-Pb collisions, besides representing an important baseline for interpreting heavy-ion measurements, are crucial to test perturbative QCD calculations and hadronisation mechanisms in the absence of hot medium effects, as well as to search for commonalities with heavy-ion systems. Recently, measurements in proton-proton and p-Pb collisions have revealed unforeseen features with respect to the expectations based on previous results from ${\rm e}^{+}{\rm e}^{-}$ and ep collisions, showing that fragmentation fractions of heavy quarks are not universal. In this contribution, an overview of the most recent ALICE heavy-flavour measurements, along with the comparison to available calculations, will be discussed.</description>

      <title>Direct correlation between the near-proton-emission threshold resonance in $^{11}$B and the branching ratio of beta-delayed proton emission from $^{11}$Be</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background: Beta-delayed proton emission from neutron halo nuclei $^{11}$Be represents a rare decay process. The existence of the narrow resonance near the proton-emission threshold in $^{11}$B explains its unexpectedly high probability. However, the accurate value of the branching ratio remains challenging to determine. Purpose: We aim to provide a microscopic potential model to determine the branching ratio for beta-delayed proton emission from $^{11}$Be. We focus on quantifying the influence of the narrow resonance near the proton emission threshold on the result of the branching ratio. Method: We employ the Skyrme Hartree-Fock calculation within the potential model to obtain the branching ratio. We derive the single-particle potentials for the halo neutron and the emitting proton from the Skyrme Hartree-Fock calculation with minimal adjustment. As the resonance position is tightly linked to the potential depth, we can demonstrate quantitatively how variations in its location impact the outcome. Result: Slight variations in the resonance position significantly impact the branching ratio, with the upper limit reaching the order of $10^{-5}$. Conclusion: Experimental determination of the resonance energy, particularly whether it lies below $200$ keV, is crucial for determining the value of the branching ratio.</description>

      <title>A proposal for verifying the alpha-cluster structure at the forthcoming Electron-Ion Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is widely accepted that the various internal structures of an excited nucleus can lead to different topological configurations of nuclear fragments during fragmentation. However, these internal structures may transition from one configuration to another with varying probabilities. Utilizing a partitioning method based on equal (or unequal) probabilities -- without incorporating the alpha-cluster ($\alpha$-cluster) model -- allows for the derivation of diverse topological configurations of nuclear fragments resulting from fragmentation. Subsequently, we predict the multiplicity distribution of nuclear fragments for specific excited nuclei, such as $^9$Be$^*$, $^{12}$C$^*$, and $^{16}$O$^*$, which can be produced in electron-nucleus ($eA$) collisions at the forthcoming Electron-Ion Collider (EIC). According to the $\alpha$-cluster model, an $\alpha$-cluster structure should take precedence among different internal structures; this may result in deviations in the multiplicity distributions of nuclear fragments with charge $Z=2$, compared to those predicted by the partitioning methods. The findings presented herein could serve as a reference for validating the existence of $\alpha$-cluster structures.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Estimation of Elliptic Flow Coefficient and Impact Parameter in Heavy-Ion Collisions using CNN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A deep learning based method with Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithm is developed for simultaneous determination of the Elliptic Flow coefficient ($v_{2}$) and the Impact Parameter in Heavy-Ion Collisions at relativistic energies. The proposed CNN is trained on Pb$-$Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV with minimum biased events simulated with the AMPT event generator. A total of twelve models were built on different input and output combinations and their performances were evaluated. The predictions of the CNN models were compared to the estimations of the simulated and experimental data. The deep learning model seems to preserve the centrality and $p_{T}$ dependence of $v_{2}$ at the LHC energy together with predicting successfully the impact parameter with low margins of error. This is the first time a CNN is built to predict both $v_{2}$ and the impact parameter simultaneously in heavy-ion system.</description>

      <title>Quadrupole-hexadecapole correlations in neutron-rich samarium and gadolinium isotopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an extensive study of quadrupole-hexadecapole correlation effects in even-even Sm and Gd isotopes with neutron number $N=88-106$. The calculations are performed in the framework of the Gogny energy density functional (EDF) with the D1S parametrization and the $sdg$ interacting boson model (IBM). The quadrupole-hexadecapole constrained self-consistent mean-field potential energy surface is mapped onto the expectation value of the $sdg$-boson Hamiltonian. This procedure determines the parameters of the $sdg$-IBM Hamiltonian microscopically. Calculated excitation energies and transition strengths are compared to the ones obtained with a simpler $sd$-IBM, as well as with the experimental data. The Gogny-EDF mapped $sdg$-IBM reproduces spectroscopic properties of the studied nuclei as reasonably as in the case of the previous $sdg$-boson mapping calculations that were based on the relativistic EDF, indicating that the axial quadrupole-hexadecapole method is sound regardless of whether relativistic or nonrelativistic EDF is employed. The mapped $sdg$-IBM improves some of the results in lighter Sm and Gd isotopes compared to the mapped $sd$-IBM, implying the existence of significant hexadecapole correlations in those nuclei. For those nuclei with $N \geq 94$, hexadecapole effects are minor, and the only significant difference between the two boson models can be found in the description of $E0$ monopole transitions.</description>

      <title>$\Lambda NN$ input to neutron stars from hypernuclear data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work is a sequel to our two 2023 publications [PLB 837 137669, NPA 1039 122725] where fitting 14 1$s_\Lambda$ and 1$p_\Lambda$ single-particle binding energies in hypernuclei across the periodic table led to a well-defined $\Lambda$-nucleus optical potential. The potential consists of a Pauli modified linear-density ($\Lambda N$) and a quadratic-density ($\Lambda NN$) terms. The present work reports on extending the above analysis to 21 $\Lambda$ single-particle data points input by including 1$d_\Lambda$ and 1$f_\Lambda$ states in medium-weight and heavy hypernuclei. The upgraded results for the $\Lambda N$ and $\Lambda NN$ potential depths at nuclear-matter density $\rho_0=0.17$~fm$^{-3}$, $D^{(2)}_\Lambda=-37.5\mp 0.7$~MeV and $D^{(3)}_\Lambda=+9.8\pm 1.2$~MeV together with the total depth $D_\Lambda=-27.7\pm 0.5$~MeV, agree within errors with the earlier results. The $\Lambda$ hypernuclear overbinding associated with the $\Lambda N$-induced potential depth $D^{(2)}_\Lambda$ agrees quantitatively with a recent combined analysis of low-energy $\Lambda p$ scattering data and correlation functions [PLB 850 (2024) 138550]. These results, particularly the size of the repulsive $D^{(3)}_\Lambda$, provide an essential input towards resolving the 'hyperon puzzle' in the core of neutron stars. We also show that a key property of our $\Lambda NN$-induced potential term, i.e. a need to suppress the quadratic-density $\Lambda NN$ term involving an excess neutron and a $N=Z$ core nucleon, can be tested in the forthcoming JLab E12-15-008 experiment.</description>

      <title>An introduction to relativistic spin hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin polarization and spin transport are common phenomena in many quantum systems. Relativistic spin hydrodynamics provides an effective low-energy framework to describe these processes in quantum many-body systems. The fundamental symmetry underlying relativistic spin hydrodynamics is angular momentum conservation, which naturally leads to inter-conversion between spin and orbital angular momenta. This inter-conversion is a key feature of relativistic spin hydrodynamics, closely related to entropy production and introducing ambiguity in the construction of constitutive relations. In this article, we present a pedagogical introduction to relativistic spin hydrodynamics. We demonstrate how to derive the constitutive relations by applying local thermodynamic laws and explore several distinctive aspects of spin hydrodynamics. These include the pseudo-gauge ambiguity, the behavior of the system in the presence of strong vorticity, and the challenges of modeling the freeze-out of spin in heavy-ion collisions. We also outline some future prospects for spin hydrodynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this Letter, we study the collinear limit of the Energy-Energy Correlator (EEC) in single-inclusive jet production in proton-proton ($pp$) and proton-nucleus ($pA$) collisions. We introduce a non-perturbative model that allows us to describe the EEC in the entire angular region of the current experiments. Our results for $pp$ collisions show excellent agreement with CMS and ALICE data over a wide range of jet transverse momenta. For $pA$ collisions, we include modifications from the nuclear medium, and our predictions align well with the trends observed in recent ALICE measurements.</description>

      <title>Novel Application of Neutrinos to Evaluate U.S. Nuclear Weapons Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is a growing realization that neutrinos can be used as a diagnostic tool to better understand the inner workings of a nuclear weapon. Robust estimates demonstrate that an Inverse Beta Decay (IBD) neutrino scintillation detector built at the Nevada Test Site of 1000-ton active target mass at a standoff distance of 500 m would detect thousands of neutrino events per kTe of nuclear yield. This would provide less than 4% statistical error on measured neutrino rate and 5% error on neutrino energy. Extrapolating this to an error on the test device explosive yield requires knowledge from evaluated nuclear databases, non-equilibrium fission rates, and assumptions on internal neutron fluxes. Initial calculations demonstrate that prompt neutrino rates from a short pulse of Pu-239 fission is about a factor of two less than that from a steady state assumption. As well, there are significant energy spectral differences as a function of time after the pulse that needs to be considered. In the absence of nuclear weapons testing, many of the technical and theoretical challenges of a full nuclear test could be mitigated with a low cost smaller scale 20 ton fiducial mass IBD demonstration detector placed near a TRIGA pulsed reactor. The short duty cycle and repeatability of pulses would provide critical real environment testing and the measured neutrino rate as a function of time data would provide unique constraints on fission databases and equilibrium assumptions.</description>

      <title>Comparing effective temperatures in standard, Tsallis, and q-dual statistics from transverse momentum spectra of identified light charged hadrons produced in gold--gold collisions at RHIC energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19266v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the transverse momentum ($p_T$) spectra of identified light charged hadrons produced in gold--gold (Au+Au) collisions across various centrality classes at center-of-mass energies per nucleon pair, $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$, ranging from 7.7 to 200 GeV, as measured by the STAR Collaboration at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The analysis employs standard (Bose-Einstein/Fermi-Dirac), Tsallis, and q-dual statistics to fit the same $p_T$ spectra and derive distinct effective temperatures: $T_{\text{Standard}}$, $T_{\text{Tsallis}}$, and $T_{\text{q-dual}}$. In most instances, there exists an approximately linear relationship or positive correlation between $T_{\text{Tsallis}}$ and $T_{\text{Standard}}$, as well as between $T_{\text{q-dual}}$ and $T_{\text{Standard}}$, when considering $T_{\text{Standard}}$ as a baseline. However, while both $T_{\text{Tsallis}}$ and $T_{\text{q-dual}}$ increase from semi-central to central Au+Au collisions at 62.4 GeV and 200 GeV, where QGP is expected, changes in $T_{\text{Standard}}$ occur more gradually. This work suggests that $T_{\text{Standard}}$ is better suited for characterizing phase transitions between hadronic matter and QGP compared to $T_{\text{Tsallis}}$ or $T_{\text{q-dual}}$, primarily due to the considerations related to entropy index in the Tsallis and q-dual statistics.</description>

      <title>Exploring the flow harmonic correlations via multi-particle symmetric and asymmetric cumulants in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02245v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study multi-particle azimuthal correlations in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV. We use initial conditions obtained from a Monte-Carlo Glauber model and evolve them within a viscous relativistic hydrodynamics framework that eventually gives way to a transport model in the late hadronic stage of the evolution. We compute the multi-particle symmetric and asymmetric cumulants and present the results for their sensitivity to the shear and bulk viscosities during the hydrodynamic evolution. We also check their sensitivity to resonance decay and hadronic interactions. We demonstrate that while some of these observables are more sensitive to transport properties than traditional flow observables, others are less sensitive, making them suitable for studying different stages of the evolution.</description>

      <title>An alternative way to decipher the nature of the doubly charmed tetraquark $T_{cc}(3875)^+$: its antiparticle $T_{{\bar c}{\bar c}}(3875)^-$ photoproduction off nuclei near threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00360v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the inclusive photoproduction of $T_{{\bar c}{\bar c}}(3875)^-$ mesons (which are the antiparticles of the doubly charmed tetraquarks $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ discovered recently by the LHCb Collaboration) from nuclei in the near-threshold energy region within the nuclear spectral function approach by considering incoherent direct (${\gamma}p(n) \to D^+(D^0){T_{{\bar c}{\bar c}}(3875)^-}\Lambda^+_c$) photon--nucleon $T_{{\bar c}{\bar c}}(3875)^-$ creation processes as well as five possible different scenarios for their internal structure with the main goal of clarifying the possibility to decipher this structure (and, hence, that of $T_{cc}(3875)^+$) in photoproduction via integral and differential observables. We calculate the absolute and relative excitation functions for $T_{{\bar c}{\bar c}}(3875)^-$ production off $^{12}$C and $^{184}$W target nuclei at near-threshold photon beam energies of 30--38 GeV, the absolute differential cross sections for their production off these target nuclei at laboratory polar angles of 0$^{\circ}$--10$^{\circ}$ as well as the A and momentum dependences of the relative (transparency ratios) cross sections for $T_{{\bar c}{\bar c}}(3875)^-$ production at photon energy of 35 GeV within the adopted scenarios for the $T_{{\bar c}{\bar c}}(3875)^-$ meson intrinsic structure. We demonstrate that the absolute and relative observables considered show a certain sensitivity to these scenarios. Therefore, the measurement of such observables in future experiments at the proposed high-luminosity electron-ion colliders EIC and EicC in the US and China in the near-threshold energy region might shed light on the $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ internal structure.</description>
