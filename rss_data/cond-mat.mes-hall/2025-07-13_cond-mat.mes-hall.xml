      <title>Fractional Thouless pumping of solitons: a unique manifestation of bulk-edge correspondence of nonlinear eigenvalue problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent foundational studies have established the bulk-edge correspondence for nonlinear eigenvalue problems using auxiliary eigenvalues $\hat{H}\Psi=\omega S(\omega)\Psi$, spanning both linear [T. Isobe et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 132, 126601 (2024)] and nonlinear [Chenxi Bai and Zhaoxin Liang, Phys. Rev. A. 111, 042201 (2025)] Hamiltionians. This raises a fundamental question: Can eigenvalue nonlinearity generate observable physical phenomena absent in conventional approaches ($\hat{H}\Psi=E\Psi$)? In this work, we demonstrate the first uniquely nonlinear manifestation of this correspondence: fractional Thouless pumping of solitons. Through systematic investigation of nonlinear Thouless pumping in an extended Rice-Mele model with next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) couplings, we discover that the NNN parameters can induce fractional topological phases despite quantized topological invariants from conventional approaches. Crucially, these fractional phases are explained within the auxiliary eigenvalue framework, linking nonlinear spectral features directly to bulk-boundary correspondence. This work reveals novel phenomena emerging from the interplay between nonlinearity and NNN couplings, providing key insights for designing topological insulators and controlling quantum edge states in nonlinear regimes.</description>

      <title>Ultrasensitive Magnetometer based on Cusp Points of the Photon-Magnon Synchronization Mode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrasensitive magnetometers based on spin resonances have led to remarkable achievements. However, the gyromagnetic ratios of these spin resonances that determine the responsivity of magnetometers to weak magnetic fields are inherently constrained by the Land$\acute{e}$ g-factor of particles, such as the electron, with a constant gyromagnetic ratio of $\gamma_e=2\pi\times28$ GHz/T. Here, we demonstrate an ultrasensitive magnetometer based on the cusp point (CP) of photon-magnon synchronization modes (PMSMs). The PMSM's gyromagnetic ratio at the CP is enhanced to $37\gamma_e$ and further amplified to $236\gamma_e$ by utilizing the sixth-order oscillating mode of the PMSM. Moreover, the emission linewidth of the PMSM can be reduced to 0.06 Hz, resulting in excellent sensitivity to weak magnetic fields. These outstanding properties position our magnetometer to potentially achieve superior sensitivity to conventional magnetometers. Our work introduces a cost-effective prototype for the next generation of magnetometry, and may advance scientific research and technologies that rely on ultrasensitive magnetic field detection.</description>

      <title>Quantum theory of nonlinear electromagnetic response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the investigation of nonlinear electromagnetic responses has received significant attention due to its potential for elucidating the quantum properties of matter. Although remarkable progress has been achieved in developing quantum theories of nonlinear responses to electric field, a comprehensive quantum theory framework that systematically addresses nonlinear responses to both electric and magnetic fields has yet to be thoroughly discussed. Here, we present a systematic quantum theory of nonlinear electromagnetic response using the Matsubara Green's function approach, which explicitly incorporates the wave vector dependence of external electromagnetic fields. We provide diagrammatic representation and reveal the general properties of transport coefficients. We apply our theory to second-order responses, deriving the nonlinear Hall effects and magneto-nonlinear Hall effects in both time-reversal symmetric and time-reversal breaking systems. These effects stem from diverse quantum geometric sources. Additionally, we analyze the contributions arising from the Zeeman interaction. Our work presents a unified quantum theory of nonlinear electromagnetic response, paving the way for further exploration of novel phenomena in this field.</description>

      <title>Electric and spin current vortices in altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets constitute a class of collinear magnets with momentum-dependent spin splitting and vanishing net magnetization. Direct observation of the characteristic altermagnetic spin splitting, however, remains challenging. Indirect signatures can be obtained via transport studies, which so far have only considered homogeneous fields driving currents. We propose to leverage nonuniform electric fields and spin density gradients to probe the shape and the spin polarization of altermagnetic Fermi surfaces via transport measurements. By using both a semiclassical Boltzmann approach and a lattice Keldysh formalism, we show that altermagnets excite swirling electric and spin currents whose profiles depend on the relative orientation of altermagnetic lobes with respect to the sample boundaries. These currents can be measured via magnetometry techniques. Unlike previous proposals considering the hydrodynamic regime of transport, swirling currents are observed even in the Ohmic regime and rely exclusively on the altermagnetic spin splitting, with no swirls observed in ferromagnets. The electric and spin current vortices predicted here provide a unique altermagnetic signature in an experimentally accessible setup.</description>

      <title>Phonon mode splitting and phonon anomaly in multiband electron systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the topological consequences of coupling chiral fermions to local, dispersionless phonons. This interaction induces a splitting of the phonon spectrum into three bands: a flat band and two bands with linear dispersion, all of which are degenerate at a nodal point located at zero wavevector. The flat band exhibits vanishing Berry curvature, while the linearly dispersing bands carry nontrivial topological features. Their Berry curvature fields assume a hedgehog-like structure in momentum space, analogous to monopole configurations, and reflect the chirality of the underlying fermionic system. Moreover, the effective phonon response reveals a phonon parity anomaly, observable as a discontinuity in the phonon current. This anomaly originates from the singularities of the fermion Green's function and signals the transfer of topological information from fermions to phonons. Our results demonstrate that phonon currents provide a direct probe of electronic chirality and topological structures. The framework offers a foundation for extending topological concepts to interacting bosonic systems and may guide the engineering of phononic materials with tunable geometric and topological properties.</description>

      <title>Exciting terahertz magnons with amplitude modulated light: spin pumping, squeezed states, symmetry breaking and pattern formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how amplitude modulated, coherent high-frequency drives can be used to access otherwise difficult to reach collective resonances and off-resonantly induce parametric instabilities. In particular, we demonstrate that difficult to access antiferromagnetic resonances in the THz range can be parametrically excited with signals at optical frequencies via a mechanism that we call Modulated Floquet Parametric Driving (MFPD). We study spin pumping and the formation of entangled, two-mode squeezed magnon pairs in anisotropic antiferromagnets under MFPD. Furthermore, we show that MFPD induces transitions to symmetry breaking steady-states in which dynamical spin patterns are formed by resonant magnon pairs.</description>

      <title>Off-resonant light-induced topological phase transition and thermoelectric transport in semi-Dirac materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that a semi-Dirac (SD) system with an inversion symmetry breaking mass exhibits a topological phase transition when irradiated with off-resonant light. Using Floquet theory, we derive the band structure, Chern numbers, phase diagram, and we show that as the light intensity is swept at fixed mass, the SD system undergoes normal-Chern-normal insulator transition. Along the phase boundaries we observe single semi-Dirac-cone (SSDC) semimetal states in which one SD cone is gapless and the other gapped. The nontrivial Berry curvature distribution $\Omega(\mathbf{k}) \neq -\Omega ( - \mathbf{k} )$ generates an orbital magnetization $M$ and anomalous Nernst ($\alpha_{xy}$) and thermal Hall ($\kappa_{xy}$) conductivities. We show that $M$ remains constant as the Fermi level $E_F$ scans the insulating gap, but it changes linearly with it in the Chern insulator (CI) phase, as expected. In the normal insulator phase, we find that $\alpha_{xy}$ exhibits a dip-peak profile which is reversed in the CI phase. We also find that switching the light's circular polarization from left to right induces a sign change in $M$, $\alpha_{xy}$, and $\kappa_{xy}$, regardless of the topological phase, thereby allowing us to reverse the direction of flow of the transverse charge and heat currents. Further, we evaluate the components of the charge ($\sigma_{aa}$), thermoelectric ($\alpha_{aa}$), and thermal ($\kappa_{aa}$) conductivity tensors ($a=x, y$) and examine the effect of light on them. With a linear dispersion along the $y$-direction, we find that $\alpha_{yy}$ and $\kappa_{yy}$ are significantly larger than $\alpha_{xx}$ and $\kappa_{xx}$, respectively, due to the much larger squared Dirac velocity $v_y^2$ compared to $v_x^2$.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric optimization and quantum-to-classical crossover in gate-controlled two-dimensional semiconducting nanojunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the thermoelectric performance of 2D nanojunctions with gate tunable architectures and varying channel lengths from 3 to 12 nm using a combination of first principles simulations, including density functional theory, DFT with nonequilibrium Greens function formalism (nanoDCAL), and nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. Our study reveals a gate, temperature, and length dependent transition from quantum to classical in electron transport, transitioning from quantum tunneling in short junctions to thermionic emission in longer ones. We observe nontrivial dependencies of the thermoelectric figure of merit on the Seebeck coefficient, electrical conductivities, and thermal conductivities as a result of this crossover and gate controlling. We identify that maximizing ZT requires tuning the chemical potential just outside the band gap, where the system lies at the transition between insulating and conducting regimes. While extremely large Seebeck coefficients are observed in the insulating state, they do not yield high ZT due to suppressed electrical conductivity and dominant phononic thermal transport. The optimal ZT larger than 2.3 is achieved in the shortest 3 nm junction at 500 K, where quantum tunneling and thermionic emission coexist. These findings offer fundamental insights into transport mechanisms in 2D semiconducting nanojunctions and present design principles for high efficiency nanoscale thermoelectric devices.</description>

      <title>Validity of perturbation theory in calculations of magnetocrystalline anisotropy in Co-based layered systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Validity of second-order perturbation theory (PT) is examined for magnetocrystalline anisotropy (MCA) energy in Co films with enhanced spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and Co/Pt bilayers. Comparison with accurate results obtained with the force theorem (FT) reveals significant discrepancies in the dependence of the MCA energy on the Co thickness. For systems with strong SOC, the PT fails to correctly describe the oscillations of the MCA energy, largely overestimating their amplitude and even failing (for Co/Pt bilayers) to reproduce their specific periodicity. These failures specifically concern the dominating oscillations with the 2-monolayer period which arise from pairs of quantum well (QW) minority-spin d states in the Co layer, degenerate at the centre of the Brillouin zone (BZ). A simplified model of such states demonstrates that the large discrepancies between PT and FT predictions arise from the breakdown of the PT in a region around the BZ centre where the energy spacing between states within each pair is small compared to the SOC strength. The oscillation amplitude of the MCA energy calculated with the FT is limited by the finite energy spacing between consecutive QW pairs, whereas this amplitude grows quadratically with the SOC strength in the PT calculations. Furthermore, for weak and moderate SOC strengths, the accuracy of the PT diminishes with increasing the ratio of the SOC constant to temperature. This explains why the PT overestimates the amplitude of MCA energy oscillations at low temperatures, even for the Co film with a relatively weak nominal SOC. For the Co/Pt bilayer, the strong temperature dependence of the oscillation amplitude in the PT approach leads to the MCA energies markedly different at low and zero temperatures, of opposite sign and several times larger in magnitude, compared to the FT results.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-based theory of Dirac fermions on two-dimensional hyperbolic crystals: Coupling to the spin connection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discrete fermionic and bosonic models for hyperbolic lattices have attracted significant attention across a range of fields since the experimental realization of hyperbolic lattices in metamaterial platforms, sparking the development of hyperbolic crystallography. However, a fundamental and experimentally consequential aspect remains unaddressed: fermions propagating in curved space inherently couple to the underlying geometry via the spin connection, as required by general covariance - a feature not yet incorporated in studies of hyperbolic crystals. Here, we introduce a symmetry-based framework for Dirac fermions on two-dimensional hyperbolic lattices, explicitly incorporating spin-curvature coupling via a discrete spin connection. Starting from the continuous symmetries of the Poincar\'e disk, we classify the irreducible representations and construct a symmetry-adapted basis, establishing a direct correspondence to the continuum Dirac theory. We show that this continuum theory predicts a finite density of states at zero energy for any finite curvature in $D-$dimensional hyperbolic space with $2\leq D \leq 4$, suggesting enhanced susceptibility of Dirac fermions to interaction-driven instabilities at weak coupling. We then derive explicit forms of discrete translational and rotational symmetries for lattices characterized by Schl\"afli symbols $\{p,q\}$, and explicitly construct the discrete spin connection, represented as hopping phases, via parallel transport. Our results pave the way for experimental realization of spin-curvature effects in metamaterial platforms and systematic numerical studies of correlated Dirac phases in hyperbolic geometries.</description>

      <title>Modulation of energy and angular momentum radiation of two-dimensional altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the energy and angular momentum radiation of altermagnets under Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC) and external magnetic fields. Using an effective low-energy Hamiltonian, we derive electronic energy bands and calculate optical conductivity via the Kubo formula. Results show that RSOC strength, altermagnet interactions strength, and Neel vector direction notably affect the optical conductivity of altermagnet metals. Energy radiation is highly sensitive to Rashba spin-orbit coupling, with a saturation effect beyond a particular value, and its peak emission rate is lower than that of graphene due to reduced conductivity. Different from usual semi-conductor, semi-metal or Dirac materials, eg. graphene or silicene, altermagnets generate angular momentum radiation with specific Rashba spin-orbit coupling and altermagnet interaction strength. Angular momentum radiation is minimally reactive to Rashba spin-orbit coupling at low altermagnet interactions strength values but exhibits drastic oscillations between extreme values as altermagnet interactions strength reaches a critical point, showing high sensitivity. These findings suggest that adjusting these parameters can tailor altermagnet applications in spintronics and quantum technologies, potentially leading to innovative devices with customized radiation attributes.</description>

      <title>Quantum register based on double quantum dots in semiconductor nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An implementation of a universal solid-state quantum register based on electron space states in field-defined double quantum dots (DQD possesses one electron in two adjacent tunnel bound dots) in an ultrathin semiconductor nanowire is discussed. To some extent, the structure resembles that of a field-effect transistor with multiple controlling electrodes (gates). Scalability is audible and it opens up a possibility of large-scale quantum computer fabricated by advanced silicon technology. Moreover, the structure could be developed into an ensemble quantum register where instead of single nanowire an array of them with common controlling electrodes and contacts is fabricated. This ensemble register is much more resistant against environment noise caused by phonons and stray charges due to averaging and compensation. It is crucial that an individual qubit consists of two DQDs. The basic states of that qubit correspond to symmetric state of one DQD and antisymmetric state of another, and vice versa. Then the quantum information can be encoded and processed without charge transfer between dots. The probability to find an electron in a dot constantly equals 1/2 thus the Coulomb interaction between DQDs is also constant. Although the Coulomb interaction is incessant, the strength of its action depends on mutual states of interacting DQDs (in-resonance or off-resonance). Therefore, a quantum algorithm could be effectuated via manipulation solely with steady and pulse gate potentials that reminds an operation of a digital integrated circuit. The final read-out of the register is performed after decoding into charge states of DQDs and a transmission of current through the wire.</description>

      <title>Hydrogen toggling between Yoshimori spin spirals and elliptical Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya skyrmions in Fe on Ir(110)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Skyrmions are particle-like spin textures that arise from spin spiral states in the presence of an external magnetic field. These spirals can originate from either frustrated Heisenberg exchange interactions or the interplay between exchange interactions and the relativistic Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, leading to atomic- and mesoscale textures, respectively. However, the conversion of exchange-stabilized spin spirals into skyrmions typically requires magnetic fields that exceed practical laboratory limits. Here, we demonstrate a strategy leveraging hydrogen adsorption to expand the range of magnetic films capable of hosting stable or metastable skyrmions. In a structurally open and anisotropic system of two pseudomorphic Fe layers on Ir(110), spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy combined with ab initio calculations reveals that a right-handed, exchange-stabilized N\'eel-type spin spiral propagating along the [$\overline{1}10$] direction with a $1.3$~nm period transitions upon hydrogen adsorption to a Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya type spiral with a sevenfold longer period of $8.5$~nm. This transition enables elliptical skyrmions to form at moderate magnetic fields. Hydrogenation thus provides a non-volatile mechanism to toggle between distinct magnetic states, offering a versatile platform for controlling spin textures.</description>

Abstract: In ferromagnets, magnons have only one chirality; while in common antiferromagnets, bands with opposite chiralities are degenerate across the Brillouin zone. Recent studies have shown that it is possible to observe non-degenerate bands of opposite chiralities in altermagnetic materials. Here we take the S = 1 Shastry-Sutherland model, which shows the collinear N\'eel (I) phase, and investigate the magnon band structure showing alternate chirality-splitting and the resulting transport properties. In magnon bands, we find a notable feature of the chirality-split magnon bands, and the split is opposite along two different directions in the Brillouin zone. We also calculate the spin and thermal conductivities using Kubo formalism. Our calculations show robust spin Seebeck and spin Nernst effects due to the alternating chirality split across the Brillouin zone, without any external magnetic field and spin-orbit coupling.</description>

      <title>Probing electron spin dynamics in single telecom InAs(P)/InP quantum dots using the Hanle effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spins of carriers confined in quantum dots (QDs) are promising candidates for qubits due to their relatively long spin relaxation times. However, the electron spin dephasing, primarily driven by hyperfine interactions with nuclear spins, can limit their coherence. Here, we report the first Hanle effect demonstration in single InAs(P)/InP QDs emitting in the telecom C-band leading to experimental determination of electron spin dephasing time. Using polarization-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy, we identified excitonic complexes and confirmed the presence of a negatively charged trion, exhibiting a degree of circular polarization (DOCP) of $-36\%$ under quasi--resonant excitation. From the analysis of Hanle linewidth and employing a previously reported value of the electron $g$-factor, we extracted an electron spin dephasing time of $T_2^{\ast} = 1.59 \pm 0.49~\mathrm{ns}$. Despite the large indium nuclear spin, the obtained $T_2^{\ast}$ is comparable to values reported for GaAs-based QDs, which we attribute to the larger volume of the InAs(P)/InP QDs. These findings confirm the potential of InP-based telecom QDs for use in spin-photon interfaces.</description>

      <title>Distinct Lifetimes for $X$ and $Z$ Loop Measurements in a Majorana Tetron Device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a hardware realization and measurements of a tetron qubit device in a superconductor-semiconductor heterostructure. The device architecture contains two parallel superconducting nanowires, which support four Majorana zero modes (MZMs) when tuned into the topological phase, and a trivial superconducting backbone. Two distinct readout interferometers are formed by connecting the superconducting structure to a series of quantum dots. We perform single-shot interferometric measurements of the fermion parity for the two loops, designed to implement Pauli-$X$ and $Z$ measurements of the tetron. Performing repeated single-shot measurements yields two widely separated time scales $\tau_X = 14.5\pm 0.3 \, \mathrm{\mu s}$ and $\tau_Z = 12.4\pm 0.4\, \mathrm{ms}$ for parity switches observed in the $X$ and $Z$ measurement loops, which we attribute to intra-wire parity switches and external quasiparticle poisoning, respectively. We estimate assignment errors of $\mathrm{err}^X_a=16\%$ and $\mathrm{err}^Z_a=0.5\%$ for $X$ and $Z$ measurement-based operations, respectively.</description>

      <title>Improving Transmon Qubit Performance with Fluorine-based Surface Treatments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reducing materials and processing-induced decoherence is critical to the development of utility-scale quantum processors based on superconducting qubits. Here we report on the impact of two fluorine-based wet etches, which we use to treat the silicon surface underneath the Josephson junctions (JJs) of fixed-frequency transmon qubits made with aluminum base metallization. Using several materials analysis techniques, we demonstrate that these surface treatments can remove germanium residue introduced by our JJ fabrication with no other changes to the overall process flow. These surface treatments result in significantly improved energy relaxation times for the highest performing process, with median $T_1=334~\mu$s, corresponding to quality factor $Q=6.6\times10^6$. This result suggests that the metal-substrate interface directly underneath the JJs was a major contributor to microwave loss in these transmon qubit circuits prior to integration of these surface treatments. Furthermore, this work illustrates how materials analysis can be used in conjunction with quantum device performance metrics to improve performance in superconducting qubits.</description>

      <title>Sensitive infrared surface photovoltage in quasi-equilibrium in a layered semiconductor at low-intensity low-temperature condition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Benefit to layer-dependent bandgap, van der Waals materials with surface photovoltaic effect (SPV) enable photodetection over a tunable wavelength range with low power consumption. However, sensitive SPV in the infrared region, especially in a quasi-steady illumination condition, is still elusive in layered semiconductors. Here, using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we report a sensitive SPV in quasi-equilibrium in NbSi0.5Te2, with photoresponsivity up to 2.4*10^6 V/(W*cm^(-2)) at low intensity low temperature condition (LILT). The sensitive SPV is further confirmed by observing the Dember effect, where the photogenerated carrier density is high enough and diffusion currents suppress SPV. Temperature-dependent measurements indicate that intrinsic carriers freezing at low temperature leads to the ultrahigh photoresponse, while a small amount of photon-generated carriers in quasi-equilibrium dominate the system. Our work not only provides a promising layered semiconductor for Infrared optoelectronic devices with strong infrared SPV at LILT, which has application potential in fields such as quantum information and deep-space exploration, but also paves a novel way to enhance light-matter interaction effect by freezing bulk carriers.</description>

      <title>Observation of quasi-steady dark excitons and gap phase in a doped semiconductor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exciton plays an important role in optics and optics-related behaviors and leads to novel correlated phases like charge order, exciton insulator, and exciton-polariton condensation. Dark exciton shows distinct properties from bright one. However, it cannot be directly detected by conventional optic measurements. The electronic modulation effect of dark excitons in quasi-equilibrium distribution, critical for electronic devices in working status, is still elusive. Here, using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we report creating, detecting, and controlling dark excitons in the quasi-equilibrium distribution in a doped semiconductor SnSe2. Surprisingly, we observe an excitonic gap phase, with a conduction band opening an anisotropic gap. Our results broaden the scope of dark excitons, extending their studies from the picosecond timescale in the ultrafast photoemission process to conditions occurring under quasi-equilibrium. We reveal the light-matter interaction in the engineering of electronic structures and provide a new way to realize the excitonic gap phase in semiconductors with large band gaps.</description>

      <title>Emergent Softening and Stiffening Dictate Transport of Active Filaments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active semiflexible filaments are crucial in various biophysical processes, yet insights into their single-filament behavior have predominantly relied on theory and simulations, owing to the scarcity of controllable synthetic systems. Here, we present an experimental platform of active semiflexible filaments composed of dielectric colloidal particles, activated by an alternating electric field that induces contractile or extensile electrohydrodynamic (EHD) flows. Our experiments reveal that contractile flow generating filaments undergo softening, significantly expanding the range of accessible conformations, whereas filaments composed of extensile flow monomers exhibit active stiffening. By independently tuning filament elasticity and activity, we demonstrate that the competition between elastic restoring forces and emergent hydrodynamic interactions along the filament governs conformational dynamics. Crucially, we discover that the timescale of conformational dynamics directly governs transport behavior: enhanced fluctuations promote diffusion while stiffening facilitates directed propulsion of nonlinear filaments. Together, our direct visualization studies elucidate the links between inherent filament properties, microscopic activity, and emergent transport while establishing a versatile experimental platform of synthetic filamentous active matter.</description>

      <title>Time correlations from steady-state expectation values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recovering properties of correlation functions is typically challenging. On one hand, experimentally, it requires measurements with a temporal resolution finer than the system's dynamics. On the other hand, analytical or numerical analysis requires solving the system evolution. Here, we use recent results of quantum metrology with continuous measurements to derive general lower bounds on the relaxation and second-order correlation times that are both easy to calculate and measure. These bounds are based solely on steady-state expectation values and their derivatives with respect to a control parameter, and can be readily extended to the autocorrelation of arbitrary observables. We validate our method on two examples of critical quantum systems: a critical driven-dissipative resonator, where the bound matches analytical results for the dynamics, and the infinite-range Ising model, where only the steady state is solvable and thus the bound provides information beyond the reach of existing analytical approaches. Our results can be applied to experimentally characterize ultrafast systems, and to theoretically analyze many-body models with dynamics that are analytically or numerically hard.</description>

      <title>Free phases of Majorana fermions: Tenfold ways compared</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a mathematically rigorous classification of symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases of neutral free fermions. Our approach utilizes Karoubi triples with negative squares, thought of as polarizations. We prove that neutral free fermion SPT phases protected by a symmetry algebra $A$ are classified by the real $K$-theory group $K_2(A^{op})$, and demonstrate how our classification reproduces known results in the presence of charge. Our formalism also allows for symmetries described by groups, potentially with time-reversal, using the formalism of fermionic groups and their fermionic group $C^*$-algebras. Our classification extends to positive spatial dimensions and includes weak phases using the crystalline equivalence principle. Our approach clarifies and unifies various existing tenfold way classifications by establishing their equivalence through Morita equivalences of symmetry algebras. We expect our classification to be the natural domain for the free-to-interacting map proposed by Freed and Hopkins.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we develop the theory for 2D-to-2D tunneling spectroscopy aided by magnetic or quantum-order excitations, and apply it to the description of van-der-Waals heterostructures of graphene/ultrathin $\alpha-{\rm RuCl}_3$. We study the behavior of both the differential conductance and the inelastic electron tunneling spectrum (IETS) of these heterostructures. The IETS in particular exhibits features, such as the gap of continuum spinon excitations and Majorana bound states, whose energies scale {\it cubicly} with the applied magnetic field. Such scaling, which exists for a relatively wide range of fields, is at odds with the linear one exhibited by conventional magnons and can be used to prove the existence of Kitaev quantum spin liquids.</description>

      <title>Probing the dichotomy between Yu-Shiba-Rusinov and Majorana bound states via conductance, quantum noise and $\Delta_T$ noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16717v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate charge and spin conductance, charge and spin quantum noise, along with charge and spin $\Delta_T$ noise, as diagnostic tools to distinguish Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) states from Majorana-bound states (MBS) in a one-dimensional metal/spin-flipper/metal/insulator/superconductor junction. YSR states arise from magnetic impurities acting as spin-flippers within a trivial s-wave superconducting gap, while MBS emerge in topological superconductors, often leading to ambiguity in experiments where magnetic impurities mimic zero-energy MBS signatures. By replacing the trivial superconductor with a topological one exhibiting triplet pairing (e.g., chiral p or spinless p-wave nanowires), we identify robust and distinguishing features of YSR and MBS states. Our analysis demonstrates that combined measurements of both charge and spin conductance, charge and spin quantum noise, and their $\Delta_T$ noise counterparts offer unique and reliable signatures to differentiate YSR states from genuine MBS, thereby reducing false-positive interpretations in topological superconductivity experiments.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the precision of currents in a generic multi-terminal quantum-transport setting. Employing scattering theory, we show that the precision of the currents is limited by a function of the particle-current noise that can be interpreted as the activity in the classical limit. We thereby establish a kinetic uncertainty relation for quantum transport. In the full quantum limit, we find precision bounds in which we modify the activity constraints depending on whether the system is fermionic or bosonic. We expect these bounds to be guidelines for any transport process aiming at high precision.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19477v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semiconductor quantum dots are an attractive platform for the realisation of quantum processors. To achieve long-range coupling between them, quantum dots have been integrated into microwave cavities. However, it has been shown that their coherence is then reduced compared to their cavity-free implementations. Here, we manipulate the quantum states of a suspended carbon nanotube double quantum dot with ferromagnetic contacts embedded in a microwave cavity. By performing quantum manipulations via the cavity photons, we demonstrate coherence times of the order of $1.3\mu s$, two orders of magnitude larger than those measured so far in any carbon quantum circuit and one order of magnitude larger than silicon-based quantum dots in comparable environment. This holds promise for carbon as a host material for spin qubits in circuit quantum electrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Non-Markovian effects in long-range polariton-mediated energy transfer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00503v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intramolecular energy transfer driven by near-field effects plays an important role in applications ranging from biophysics and chemistry to nano-optics and quantum communications. Advances in strong light-matter coupling in molecular systems have opened new possibilities to control energy transfer. In particular, long-distance energy transfer between molecules has been reported as the result of their mutual coupling to cavity photon modes, and the formation of hybrid polariton states. In addition to strong coupling to light, molecular systems also show strong interactions between electronic and vibrational modes. The latter can act as a reservoir for energy to facilitate off-resonant transitions, and thus energy relaxation between polaritonic states at different energies. However, the non-Markovian nature of those modes makes it challenging to accurately simulate these effects. Here we capture them via process tensor matrix product operator (PT-MPO) methods, to describe exactly the vibrational environment of the molecules combined with a mean-field treatment of the light-matter interaction. In particular, we study the emission dynamics of a system consisting of two spatially separated layers of different species of molecules coupled to a common photon mode, and show that the strength of coupling to the vibrational bath plays a crucial role in governing the dynamics of the energy of the emitted light; at strong vibrational coupling this dynamics shows strongly non-Markovian effects, eventually leading to polaron formation. Our results shed light on polaritonic long-range energy transfer, and provide further understanding of the role of vibrational modes of relevance to the growing field of molecular polaritonics.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic moir\'e band flattening in twisted bilayers of M-valley MXenes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19613v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Experimental studies on moir\'e materials have predominantly focused on twisted hexagonal lattice with low-energy states near the $\Gamma$- or K-points, where the electronic dispersion is typically isotropic. In contrast, we introduce a class of semiconducting transition metal carbides (MXenes) $M_2$C$T_2$ ($M$ = Ti, Zr, Hf, Sc, Y; $T$ = O, F, Cl) as a new platform for M-valley moir\'e materials, which exhibit pronounced anisotropic properties. Using Ti$_2$CO$_2$ and Zr$_2$CO$_2$ as representative examples, we perform large-scale \emph{ab initio} calculations and demonstrate that their AB-stacked twisted homobilayer hosts three threefold rotational-symmetry-related M-valleys with time-reversal symmetry. These systems show striking anisotropic band flattening in the conduction band minimum. To elucidate the underlying physics, we construct a simplified moir\'e Hamiltonian that captures the essential features of the band structure, revealing the origins of anisotropic flattening through the mechanisms of band folding and interlayer tunneling. Our findings expand the current landscape of moir\'e materials, establishing valley- and spin-degenerate, two-dimensional arrays of quasi-one-dimensional systems as promising platforms for exploring many interesting correlated electronic phases.</description>

      <title>Mitigating disorder and optimizing topological indicators with vision-transformer-based neural networks in Majorana nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12121v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Disorder remains a major obstacle to realizing topological Majorana zero modes (MZMs) in superconductor-semiconductor nanowires, and we show how deep learning can be used to recover topological MZMs mitigating disorder even when the pre-mitigation situation manifests no apparent topology. The disorder potential, as well as the scattering invariant ($T_V$) normally used to classify a device as topologically non-trivial are not directly measurable experimentally. Additionally, the conventional signatures of MZMs have proved insufficient due to their being accidentally replicated by disorder-induced trivial states. Recent advances in machine learning provide a novel method to solve these problems, allowing the underlying topology, suppressed by disorder, to be recovered using effective mitigation procedures. In this work, we leverage a vision transformer neural network trained on conductance measurements along with a CMA-ES optimization framework to dynamically tune gate voltages mitigating disorder effects. Unlike prior efforts that relied on indirect cost functions, our method directly optimizes $T_V$ alongside additional local density of states-based topological indicators. Using a lightweight neural network variant, we demonstrate that even highly disordered nanowires initially lacking any topologically non-trivial regions can be transformed into robust topological devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06853v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We calculate the shift current response in twisted double bilayer graphenes (TDBG) by applying the perturbative approach to the effective continuum Hamiltonian. We have performed a systematic study of the shift current in AB-AB and AB-BA stacked TDBG, where we have investigated the dependence of the signal on the twist angle, the vertical bias voltage and the Fermi level. The numerical analyses demonstrate that the signal is greatly enhanced as the twist angle is reduced. Notably, we also found that there is a systematic sign reversal of the signal in the two stacking configurations below the charge neutrality point for large bias voltages. We qualitatively explain the origin of this sign reversal by studying the shift current response in AB-stacked bilayer graphene.</description>

      <title>Cusplike feature in Hall resistivity of a uniaxial ferromagnet in nonorthogonal Hall geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07163v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent magnetotransport studies on uniaxial ferromagnets have reported a cusplike feature in Hall resistivity when the magnetic field is tilted away from the conventional orthogonal direction of the Hall measurement. This feature has often been attributed to the topological Hall effect arising from a non-coplanar spin structure. In this article, we have studied the uniaxial ferromagnet SmMn$_2$Ge$_2$ to demonstrate that this feature is rather a consequence of the nonorthogonal geometry of the Hall measurement and is expected to appear whenever the magnetic field is applied away from the easy axis of magnetization, nonorthogonal to the sample plane. The Hall resistivity, exhibiting this feature, scales with the orthogonal component of the magnetization, indicating that the observed feature is simply a manifestation of the anomalous Hall effect. We explain the origin of this feature based on the evolution of ferromagnetic domains under a nonorthogonal external magnetic field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03279v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using multiscale modelling we investigate layer-breathing phonons in MX$_2$ bilayers (M=Mo,W; X=S,Se) containing dislocations specific for lattice-relaxed moir\'e superlattices. The dislocations, forming in the bilayers with parallel and antiparallel alignment of layers, bring about spatial modulation of the interlayer distance, generating effective potentials that promote the emergence of one-dimensional quasi-bound bands of layer-breathing modes inside perfect dislocations. For parallel MX$_2$ bilayers, perfect dislocations host multiple quasi-bound bands, with frequencies above the layer-breathing mode in rhombohedral-stacked domains. In contrast, antiparallel bilayers exhibit only a single quasi-bound band arising for orientations close to the edge-dislocation type, having frequencies above the layer-breathing mode in 2H-stacked domains.</description>

      <title>Superradiance Enhanced Light-Matter Interaction in Spatially Ordered Shape and Volume Controlled Single Quantum Dots: Enabling On-Chip Photonic Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06792v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: On-chip photonic networks require adequately spatially ordered matter-photon interconversion qubit sources with emission figures-of-merit exceeding the requirements that would enable the desired functional response of the network. The mesa-top single quantum dots (MTSQDs) have recently been demonstrated to meet these requirements. The substrate-encoded size-reducing epitaxy (SESRE) approach underpinning the realization of these unique quantum emitters allows control on the shape, size, and strain (lattice-matched or mismatched) of these epitaxial single quantum dots. We have exploited this unique feature of the MTSQDs to reproducibly create arrays of quantum dots that exhibit single photon superradiance, a characteristic of the SESRE-enabled delicate balance between the confinement pontential volume, depth, the resulting exciton binding energy, and the degree of confinement of the center of mass (CM) motion of the exciton. Scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) studies reveal the structural (atomic scale) and chemical (nm scale) nature of the material region defining the notion of the shape and volume (here large) of the electron confinement region (i.e. the QD). In the exciton's weake CM confinement regime, owing to its coherent sampling of the large volume, enhancement of the MTSQD oscillator strength to ~30 is demonstrated. Theoretical modelling with input from the STEM finding provide corroboration for single photon superradiance causing enhancement of the oscillator strength by ~2.5 to 3. Our findings allow fabricating and studying interconnected networks enabled by the unique matter qubit-light qubit interconversion units that can be realized for lattice matched and mismatched material combinations covering UV to midinfrared wavelength range.</description>

      <title>Dissipation and Interaction-Controlled Non-Hermitian Skin Effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12451v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian skin effects (NHSEs) have recently been extensively studied at the single-particle level. When many-body interactions become dominant, novel non-Hermitian phenomena can emerge. In this work, we propose an experimentally accessible mechanism to induce and control NHSEs in interacting and reciprocal dissipative systems. We consider both 1D and 2D Bose-Hubbard lattices subject to staggered two-particle loss combined with synthetic magnetic flux and long-range hopping. When the two-particle loss is small, the bound eigenstates (e.g., doublons and triplons) are all localized at the same boundary due to the interplay between the magnetic flux and staggered two-particle loss. In contrast, for strong two-particle loss, the skin-mode localization direction of the bound particles is unexpectedly reversed. This reversal stems from the combined effect of the staggered two-particle loss, synthetic magnetic flux, and long-range hopping, through which virtual second-order and third-order hopping processes induce effectively strong nonreciprocal hopping of doublons. Our results open up a new avenue for exploring novel non-Hermitian phenomena in many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Giant enhancement of exciton diffusion near an electronic Mott insulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18357v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bose-Fermi mixtures naturally appear in various physical systems. In semiconductor heterostructures, such mixtures can be realized, with bosons as excitons and fermions as dopant charges. However, the complexity of these hybrid systems challenges the comprehension of the mechanisms that determine physical properties such as mobility. In this study, we investigate interlayer exciton diffusion in an H-stacked WSe$_2$/WS$_2$ heterobilayer. Our measurements are performed in the ultra-low exciton density regime at low temperatures to examine how the presence of charges affects exciton mobility. Remarkably, for charge doping near the Mott insulator phase, we observe a giant enhancement of exciton diffusion of three orders of magnitude compared to charge neutrality. We attribute this observation to mobile valence holes, which experience a suppressed moir\'e potential due to the electronic charge order in the conduction band, and recombine with any conduction electron in a non-monogamous manner. This new mechanism emerges for sufficiently large fillings in the vicinity of correlated generalized Wigner crystal and Mott insulating states. Our results demonstrate the potential to characterize correlated electron states through exciton diffusion and provide insights into the rich interplay of bosons and fermions in semiconductor heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Versatile Control of Nonlinear Topological States in Non-Hermitian Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10398v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) and nonlinearity can both delocalize topological modes (TMs) from the interface. However, the NHSE requires precise parameter tuning, while nonlinearity in Hermitian systems results in partial delocalization with limited mode capacity. To overcome these limitations, we propose a non-Hermitian nonlinear topological interface model that integrates Hermitian and non-Hermitian lattices with nonreciprocal hopping and nonlinearity. This system enables the complete delocalization of TMs across the entire lattice without fine-tuning, while allowing precise control over the wavefunction profile and spatial distribution through the intrinsic configuration and intensity of the nonlinearity. Using the spectral localizer, we demonstrate the topological protection and robustness of these extended non-Hermitian TMs against disorder. Furthermore, we show that under external pumping, localized excitations evolve into predefined profiles and generate long-range patterns, an effect unattainable in Hermitian systems. These findings reveal how the interplay of nonlinearity and NHSE shapes topological states, paving the way for compact topological devices.</description>

Abstract: In optical diffraction, the phase difference between sources in a grating or multi-slit mask is determined by the angle to the imaging screen, yielding the familiar multi-lobed diffraction image. Here, we realize a similar phenomenon in a superconductor-semiconductor hybrid circuit configured to allow Andreev scattering from multiple parallel scatterers. Phase differences between scatterers are set by tapping off of a remote superconducting meander. We investigate arrays with two, three, four, and ten Andreev scatterers, examining local and nonlocal diffraction patterns, finding good agreement with a theory of multiple Andreev scattering, not to be confused with multiple Andreev reflection. Adding current-carrying taps to the meander allows individual phase control.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16580v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments have provided compelling and renewed interest in phonon hydrodynamics. At variance with ordinary diffusive heat transport, this regime is primarily governed by momentum-conserving phonon collisions. At the mesoscopic scale it can be described by the viscous heat equations (VHE), that resemble the Navier-Stokes equations (NSE) in the laminar regime. Here, we show that the VHE can be separated and recast as modified biharmonic equations in the velocity potential and stream function$-$solvable analytically. These two can be merged into a complex potential defining the flow streamlines, and give rise to two distinct temperature contributions, ultimately related to thermal compressibility and vorticity. The irrotational and incompressible limits of the phonon VHE are analyzed, showing how the latter mirrors the NSE for the electron fluid. This work also extends to the electron compressible regime that arises when drift velocities can be higher than plasmonic velocities. Finally, by examining thermal flow within a 2D graphite strip device, we explore the boundary conditions and transport coefficients needed to observe thermal vortices and negative thermal resistance, or heat backflow from cooler to warmer regions. This work provides novel analytical tools to design hydrodynamic phonon flow, highlights its generalization for electron hydrodynamics, and promotes additional avenues to explore experimentally such fascinating phenomena.</description>
