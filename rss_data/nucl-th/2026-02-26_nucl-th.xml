      <title>Isotope-Resolved Ba and Xe Yields in Actinide Fission and Correlated Heavy--Light Fragment Systematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Isotope-resolved post-neutron fission yields in the Ba and Xe chains are calculated and benchmarked against evaluated reference data, with emphasis on element-resolved isotopic chains $Y(N_f)$ at fixed fragment charge $Z$ and on the consistency of heavy--light fragment correlations. Calculations are performed within a four-dimensional (4D) Langevin framework employing Fourier-over-Spheroid shape parametrization. The benchmark covers spontaneous fission of selected Cm and Cf isotopes (including $^{244,246}$Cm and $^{250}$Cf) as well as neutron-induced fission at thermal and 14-MeV energies for representative actinides in the Th--Pu region (including $^{229}$Th, $^{235}$U, $^{239}$Pu, and $^{249}$Cf). The dominant neutron-number maxima are reproduced for a large fraction of the isotopic chains considered, indicating that the mean charge partition and the average neutron content of the main fission channels are described consistently. A systematic residual discrepancy is observed in the isotopic widths: the calculated yields often fall off too rapidly on the distribution tails, producing distributions that are narrower than the evaluated data, most notably for heavy-fragment chains.</description>

      <title>Ab initio calculations of nuclear charge radii across and beyond ${}^{132}$Sn: Putting chiral EFT nuclear interactions to the test</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Charge radii are investigated along the Tin isotopic chain via ab initio Bogoliubov coupled cluster calculations at the singles and doubles level. In addition to the reproduction of absolute radii, the parabolic behavior of isotopic shifts between the N = 50 and N = 82 magic numbers and the kink through ${}^{132}$Sn are shown to provide stringent tests for state-of-the-art chiral effective field theory ($\chi$EFT) inter-nucleon interactions. Indeed, none of the employed fine-tuned interactions can capture all such key characteristics. Eventually, the pronounced sensitivity of the results to the employed Hamiltonian beyond ${}^{132}$Sn provides a unique playground to pin down critical attributes of $\chi$EFT inter-nucleon interactions in the future. This calls for measuring isotopic shifts both towards ${}^{100}$Sn and beyond ${}^{134}$Sn, as well as for performing high-accuracy ab initio calculations of mean-square radii in heavy open-shell nuclei by adding both triples corrections to the many-body wave function and the two-body charge density correction to the operator</description>

      <title>Lorentz-boosted diffusion: initial value formulation and exact solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well known that the diffusion equation, when treated as a stand-alone partial differential equation, exhibits exponential instabilities in boosted frames, which render the corresponding initial-value problem ill-posed. Recently, however, it was shown that Fick-type diffusion arises as the exact hydrodynamic sector of relativistic Fokker-Planck kinetic theory. In this work, we exploit this kinetic embedding to formulate a modified initial-value problem for one-dimensional Lorentz-boosted diffusion. We show that the resulting dynamics are well posed both forward and backward in time, provided the boosted density profiles admit a kinetic-theory realization. Such profiles form a space of band-limited functions, within which the evolution can be expressed as a discrete superposition of spatially sampled initial data, weighted by a Shannon-Whittaker-type Green function defined on the full Minkowski plane. The Green function is obtained in closed analytic form.</description>

      <title>Collapse of Magnetized White Dwarfs as site of Heavy Element Formation and Kilonova Signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first end-to-end calculation connecting the accretion-induced collapse (AIC) of a magnetized, rapidly rotating white dwarf to observable kilonova signatures, combining 2D general-relativistic neutrino-magnetohydrodynamic simulations, followed by radiation hydrodynamics with in-situ nuclear network and 2D Monte Carlo radiative transfer with spatially resolved heating rates. Unlike all previous unmagnetized AIC models - which predicted proton-rich, $^{56}$Ni-dominated ejecta - strong magnetic fields eject ${\sim 0.2 M_\odot}$ of neutron-rich material $(\langle Y_e \rangle \sim 0.24)$ on dynamical timescales, before neutrino irradiation can raise the electron fraction, enabling strong $r$-process nucleosynthesis up to and beyond the third peak. The resulting kilonova is lanthanide-rich $(X_{\rm lan} \approx 6\%)$ and dominated by near-infrared emission. We compute synthetic light curves in the LSST and JWST bands and find striking agreement, without parameter tuning, between the observations of AT 2023vfi/GRB 230307A and our broadband light curves for polar viewing angles. These results establish magnetized AIC as a viable channel for heavy $r$-process element production and a compelling progenitor candidate for long-duration gamma-ray bursts with kilonova signatures.</description>

      <title>Shock-induced chiral magnetic effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weak-interaction-mediated chiral imbalance generation in idealized massless electrons during core-collapse supernovae was once proposed to be the source of strong magnetic fields found in neutron stars. The effect goes by the name of chiral plasma instability (CPI). However, it was found that a finite electron mass damps out this process, inactivating the instability and preventing magnetic field growth. In this work we show that the instability can survive in the presence of abrupt density and temperature perturbation that drives the system sufficiently far out of weak equilibrium. As an example, we work with such perturbations generated by shockwaves which are common during both core collapse as well as neutron star mergers. We find that the chiral imbalance resulting from shock waves, under the right conditions of density and temperature, can sustain the chiral plasma instability despite the damping from the electron mass. Additionally, in an already magnetized medium, the chiral magnetic effect resulting from shock wave density and temperature perturbation can generate substantial ohmic heating. Our results imply that shockwaves during core-collapse supernovae and merging neutron stars can act as a source of strong heating in a magnetized medium as well as CPI.</description>

      <title>Phase diagram of the single-flavor Gross--Neveu--Wilson model from the Grassmann corner transfer matrix renormalization group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the phase structure of the single-flavor Gross--Neveu model with Wilson fermions using the Grassmann corner transfer matrix renormalization group (CTMRG). The path integral is formulated as a two-dimensional Grassmann tensor network and approximately contracted by the Grassmann CTMRG algorithm. We investigate the phase diagram by varying the fermion mass and the four-fermion coupling, using the pseudoscalar condensate as an order parameter for the $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ parity symmetry breaking phase. The universality classes of the phase boundaries are identified through the central charge $c$ obtained via scaling analysis of the entanglement entropy. Furthermore, we extract the quantity related to the entanglement spectrum from the converged CTMRG environments, allowing us to distinguish the topological insulator phase and the trivial phase. The resulting phase structure suggests that the Aoki phase is separated from the other phases by critical lines characterized by $c=1/2$, while the critical lines with $c=1$ separate the topological insulating and trivial phases. Our numerical results also indicate that the Aoki phase does not persist in the strong-coupling regime for the single-flavor theory.</description>

      <title>A Consistent Holographic Analysis of Anomaly-induced Charge Transport in the D3/D7 Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a scheme to correctly incorporate the contribution of the chiral anomaly in the D3/D7 model to calculate chiral transport phenomena. To ensure the D7-brane wraps S^5 appropriately and the Wess-Zumino term is switched on, we allow the D7-brane to rotate in the compactified extra directions and perform the analysis accordingly. To demonstrate that this calculation procedure works well, we specifically compute the magnetoresistance in the D3/D7 model. We find that a finite axial chemical potential is realized and the negative magnetoresistance is enhanced by the anomaly contribution.</description>

      <title>Trade-offs in Gauss's law error correction for lattice gauge theory quantum simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gauss's law-based quantum error correction (GLQEC) offers a promising approach to reducing qubit overhead in lattice gauge theory simulations by leveraging built-in symmetries. For applications of GLQEC to 1+1D lattice quantum electrodynamics (QED), we identify two significant trade-offs. First, we prove via dimension-counting arguments that GLQEC requires periodic electric fields, thereby constraining the design space for lattice QED simulations. Second, we numerically compare GLQEC with a universal quantum error correction (UQEC) code, specifically the $d=3$ bitflip repetition code, and find that while GLQEC can achieve lower logical error rates in single-round error correction, it exhibits faster decoherence to the steady-state mixed ensemble under multiple rounds. The mixing speed penalty is manifest in observables of interest for both memory experiments and Hamiltonian evolution. We identify a mixing speed threshold, $p_{th}=0.277(2)$, above which using GLQEC exhibits even faster decoherence than without error correction. Our results highlight fundamental limitations of symmetry-based error correction schemes and inform corresponding constraints on formulations of lattice gauge theories compatible with error-robust quantum simulation techniques.</description>

      <title>Two-pion exchange nucleon-nucleon potentials with Roper resonance excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18664v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent paper arXiv:2602.11815 [nucl-th], we calculate in these notes the spectral functions (i.e. imaginary parts) of the NN-potentials as they arise from $2\pi$-exchange with single and double Roper resonance excitation. In contrast to the full one-loop calculation, the spectral functions of the isoscalar and isovector central and tensor potentials can be given in simple analytical form. The pertinent momentum-space potentials $V_C(q), W_C(q), V_T(q), W_T(q)$ are obtained via subtracted dispersion relations. This representation allows also to include a regulator function, that tames high-momentum components of the chiral $2\pi$-exchange. The calculation is extended to $2\pi$-exchange with combined $\Delta(1232)$-isobar and Roper resonance excitation.</description>

      <title>Holographic Bjorken flow of a hot and dense fluid in the vicinity of a critical point</title>

      <description>arXiv:1805.00882v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we use the gauge/gravity duality to perform the first systematic study of the onset of hydrodynamic behavior in a hot and dense far-from-equilibrium strongly coupled relativistic fluid with a critical point. By employing a top-down holographic construction that stems from string theory, we numerically obtain the full nonlinear evolution of the far-from-equilibrium system undergoing a Bjorken expansion and address the following question: how does hydrodynamic behavior emerge in the vicinity of a critical point in the phase diagram? For the top-down holographic system analyzed in the present work, we find that the approach to hydrodynamics is strongly affected by the presence of the critical point: the closer the ratio between the chemical potential and the temperature is to its critical value, the longer it takes for the system to be well described by the equations of viscous hydrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Emergence of kaonium as a sharp resonance in photon-photon to meson-meson cross-sections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04392v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate the binding energies of the hypothetical mesonic atom, $K^+ K^-$ (kaonium), using the $K^+ K^- \to K^+ K^-$ elastic scattering amplitude. Our findings are in line with previously reported results, which involve solving an eigenvalue equation of the Kudryavtsev-Popov type. Using chiral perturbation theory, we show that kaonium manifests itself as a sharp resonance around 992 MeV accompanying $f_0 (980)$ or $a_0 (980)$ in cross-sections for processes $\gamma \gamma \to \pi^0 \pi^0$ or $\gamma \gamma \to \pi^0 \eta$. The latter process is particularly striking: the peak at the kaonium resonance energy is highly pronounced, with the ratio of the cross-sections $\sigma (\gamma \gamma \to \pi^0 \eta) / \sigma (\gamma \gamma \to \pi^0 \pi^0) \approx 9$. Due to the short lifetime of kaonium ($\sim 10^{-18}$ s) and its small decay width ($\sim 0.4$ keV), direct detection of this exotic atom poses a significant challenge and requires high experimental resolution. However, we show that once the formation of kaonium is considered in the cross-section, a better fit to the available experimental data is obtained.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17754v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform a unified description of the experimental data of the $\pi^+\pi^-$ invariant mass spectra of $B_s^0 \to \psi(2S) \pi^+\pi^-$, the $\pi^+\pi^-$ and $K^+ K^-$ invariant mass spectra of $B_s^0 \to X(3872) \pi^+\pi^- (K^+ K^-)$, and the ratio of branch fractions $\mathcal{B}[B_s^0 \to X(3872)(K^+K^-)_{{\rm non-}\phi}]/ \mathcal{B}[B_s^0 \to X(3872)\pi^+ \pi^-)$. The strong final state interactions between the two pseudoscalars are taken into account using a parametrization fulfilling unitarity and analyticity. We find that there is universality in the coupling constants for $B_s^0 \to \psi(2S) \pi^+\pi^-$ and $B_s^0 \to J/\psi \pi^+\pi^-$ processes. While the couplings of $B_s^0 \to X(3872) \pi^+\pi^-$ are about half of magnitude smaller than the couplings of $B_s^0 \to \psi(2S) \pi^+\pi^-$, which indicates that the $X(3872)$ is different from a pure charmonium state. Furthermore, we find that the $f_0(1500)$ plays an important role in the $B_s^0 \to \psi(2S) \pi^+\pi^-$ and the $B_s^0 \to X(3872) \pi^+\pi^- (K^+ K^-)$ processes, though the phase space of $B_s^0 \to X(3872) f_0(1500)$ is small. Also we predict the ratio of branch fractions $\mathcal{B}[B_s^0 \to \psi(2S)(K^+K^-)_{{\rm non-}\phi}]/ \mathcal{B}[B_s^0 \to \psi(2S)\pi^+ \pi^-]$ and the $K^+ K^-$ invariant mass distribution of $B_s^0 \to \psi(2S)K^+K^-$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.19821v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We reformulate the treatment of density-dependent chemical potential shifts appearing in excluded-volume implementations of the hadron resonance gas model. An auxiliary classical representation is constructed in which a common energy shift is determined by preserving the scalar number density, ensuring thermodynamic consistency. Hadron radii are parametrized through a liquid-drop inspired mass-radius relation with two parameters: the pion radius and a scaling exponent. The resulting framework reproduces lattice QCD results for lower-order conserved-charge susceptibilities at zero chemical potentials with only two adjustable parameters.</description>
