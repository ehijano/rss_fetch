      <title>Graphical small cancellation and hyperfiniteness of boundary actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study actions of (infinitely presented) graphical small cancellation groups on the Gromov boundaries of their coned-off Cayley graphs. We show that a class of graphical small cancellation groups, including (infinitely presented) classical small cancellation groups, admit hyperfinite boundary actions, more precisely, the orbit equivalence relation that they induce on the boundaries of the coned-off Cayley graphs is hyperfinite.</description>

      <title>Rings on quotient divisible abelian groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper is devoted to the study of absolute ideals of groups in the class $\mathcal{QD}1$, which consists of all quotient divisible abelian groups of torsion-free rank 1. A ring is called an $AI$-ring (respectively, an $RF$-ring) if it has no ideals except absolute ideals (respectively, fully invariant subgroups) of its additive group. An abelian group is called an $RAI$-group (respectively, an $RFI$-group) if there exists at least one $AI$-ring (respectively, $FI$-ring) on it. If every absolute ideal of an abelian group is a fully invariant subgroup, then this group is called an $afi$-group.
  It is shown that every group in $\mathcal{QD}1$ is an $RAI$-group, an $RFI$-group, and an $afi$-group. Thus, Problem 93 of L. Fuchs' monograph \emph{``Infinite Abelian Groups, Vol. II, New York-London: Academic Press, 1973''} is resolved within the class $\mathcal{QD}1$. For any group in $\mathcal{QD}1$, all rings on it that are $AI$-rings are described. Furthermore, the set of all $AI$-rings on $G \in \mathcal{QD}1$ coincides with the set of all $FI$-rings on $G$. In addition, the principal absolute ideals of groups in $\mathcal{QD}1$ are described.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show some sufficient conditions for a finitely presented group $G = A \rtimes Q$, with $A$ and $Q$ abelian and the Krull dimension of $A$ equals to $2$ to be not self-similar. This is in contrast to the case of the Krull dimension of $A$ equals to $1$ considered by Kochloukova and Sidki in 2020.</description>

Abstract: We are generalizing in two non-trivial ways the recently defined perspective Abelian groups to the so-called IC-groups and TP-groups, respectively, and obtain numerous results in these two directions that can be viewed as improvements on their rather more complicated structures and properties.</description>

      <title>On a class of involutive Yang-Baxter groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A group is called an involutive Yang-Baxter group (IYB-group) if it is isomorphic to the permutation group of an involutive, non-degenerate set-theoretic solution of the Yang-Baxter equation. This paper investigates finite soluble groups whose Sylow subgroups have nilpotency class at most two, addressing Ced\'{o} and Okni\'{n}ski's question~\cite{CedoOkninski2025} of whether such groups are IYB-groups. We establish that a finite soluble group with Sylow subgroups of class at most two is an IYB-group if its nilpotent residual is $\Q_8$-free. We also prove that a finite soluble group with Sylow subgroups of class at most two and Sylow $2$-subgroups isomorphic to $Q_8$ is an IYB-group.</description>

      <title>On the $\ell^2$-Betti numbers and algebraic fibring of the (outer) automorphism group of a right-angled Artin group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the first $\ell^2$-Betti number of the automorphism and outer automorphism groups of arbitrary right-angled Artin groups (RAAGs), providing a complete characterization of when it is non-zero. In addition, we determine all $\ell^2$-Betti numbers of the outer automorphism group in the case where the defining graph is disconnected and the associated RAAG is not isomorphic to a free group. We also analyse the algebraic fibring of the pure symmetric automorphism groups $\mathrm{PSA}(A_\Gamma)$ and $\mathrm{PSO}(A_\Gamma)$ and the virtual algebraic fibring of $\mathrm{Out}(A_\Gamma)$ in the case when $A_\Gamma$ admits no non-inner partial conjugation. In the transvection-free case, we show that $\beta_1^{(2)}(\mathrm{Out}(A_\Gamma)) = 0$ if and only if $\mathrm{Out}(A_\Gamma)$ virtually fibres.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an exposition of the Auinger-Steinberg proof of the Ribes-Zalesski\u{i} product theorem for pro-V topologies, where V is a pseudovariety of groups closed under extensions with abelian kernel. This proof is self-contained and is accessible to those acquainted with coverings of graphs, and as such, it provides an easy entry point to various other deep theorems for which the product theorem is formally equivalent to.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper is an overview of recent results on algebraic structures (semigroups, groupoids, algebras, inverse semigroups, and groups) associated with objects with a rich set of partial symmetries. We discuss etale groupoids and inverse semigroups, Steinberg algebras, C*-algebras, topological full groups etc.. In particular, we describe in detail the main definitions and constructions related to contracting self-similar inverse semigroups. They are illustrated by several examples, including the semigroup generated by the golden mean rotation and the tiling semigroup of the Penrose tiling.</description>

      <title>Understanding the well-rounded deformation retraction of Teichm\"uller space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In [10] it was shown that there is a mapping class group-equivariant deformation retraction of the Teichm\"uller space of a closed surface onto a CW complex with dimension equal to the virtual cohomological dimension of the mapping class group. This paper studies the image of this deformation retraction and shows that when the analogy with the well-rounded deformation retraction of $SL(n,\mathbb{Z})$ is defined correctly via a notion of duality, this deformation retraction is analogous to the well-rounded deformation retractions of [2], [24] and [26]. In the process, an elementary necessary condition is derived for a cycle in the geometric realisation of Harvey's curve complex to represent a nontrivial homology class.</description>

      <title>Ergodic cocycles in hyperbolic and Hadamard spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider discrete random dynamical systems induced by a non-elementary group action on a non-proper hyperbolic space. We prove that if the system is ergodic and satisfies the ``asymptotic past and future independence condition'' as defined by Bader and Furman, the associated ergodic cocycle converges to the Gromov boundary almost surely. If the cocycle has finite first moment, we show that its drift is positive. Using hyperbolic models introduced by Petyt-Spriano-Zalloum, we prove analogous statements for groups acting on Hadamard spaces with a pair of contracting elements.</description>

      <title>The twisted coarse Baum--Connes conjecture and relative hyperbolic groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a notion of stable coarse algebras for metric spaces with bounded geometry, and formulate the twisted coarse Baum--Connes conjecture with respect to stable coarse algebras. We prove permanence properties of this conjecture under coarse equivalences, unions and subspaces.
  As an application, we study higher index theory for a group $G$ that is hyperbolic relative to a finite family of subgroups $\{H_1, H_2, \dots, H_N\}$. We prove that $G$ satisfies the twisted coarse Baum--Connes conjecture with respect to any stable coarse algebra if and only if each subgroup $H_i$ does.</description>

Abstract: We study the parameterized complexity of the following factorization problem: given elements $a,a_1, \ldots, a_m$ of a monoid and a parameter $k$, can $a$ be written as the product of at most (or exactly) $k$ elements from $a_1, \ldots, a_m$. Several new upper bounds and fpt-equivalences with more restricted problems (subset sum and knapsack) are shown. Finally, some new upper bounds for variants of the parameterized change-making problems are shown.</description>

Abstract: Let $G$ be a permutation group on the finite set $\Omega$. We prove various results about partitions of $\Omega$ whose stabilizers have good properties. In particular, in every solvable permutation group there is a set-stabilizer whose orbits have length at most $6$, which is best possible and answers two questions of Babai. Every solvable maximal subgroup of any almost simple group has derived length at most $10$, which is best possible. In every primitive group with solvable stabilizer, there are two points whose stabilizer has derived length bounded by an absolute constant.</description>

      <title>A completeness criterion for the common divisor graph on $p$-regular class sizes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09083v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite $p$-separable group, for some fixed prime $p$. Let $\Gamma_p(G)$ be the common divisor graph built on the set of sizes of $p$-regular conjugacy classes of $G$: this is the simple undirected graph whose vertices are the class sizes of those non-central elements of $G$ such that $p$ does not divide their order, and two distinct vertices are adjacent if and only if they are not coprime. In this note we prove that if $\Gamma_p(G)$ is a $k$-regular graph with $k\geq 1$, then it is a complete graph with $k+1$ vertices. We also pose a conjecture regarding the order of products of $p$-regular elements with coprime conjugacy class sizes, whose validity would enable to drop the $p$-separability hypothesis.</description>

      <title>On zero-divisors and units in group rings of torsion-free CAT$(0)$ groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07646v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses two of Kaplansky's conjectures concerning group rings $K[G]$, where $K$ is a field and $G$ is a torsion-free group: the zero-divisor conjecture, which asserts that $K[G]$ has no non-trivial zero-divisors, and the unit conjecture, which asserts that $K[G]$ has no non-trivial units. While the zero-divisor conjecture still remains open, the unit conjecture was disproven by Gardam in 2021. The search for more counterexamples remains an open problem.
  Let $m$ and $n$ be the cardinality of support of two non-trivial elements $\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{F}_2[G]$, respectively. We address these conjectures by introducing a process called \text{left alignment} and recursively constructing the taikos of size $(m,n)$ which would yield counterexamples to both conjectures over the field $\mathbb{F}_2$ if they satisfy conditions $\mathsf{T}_1-\mathsf{T}_4$ given in \cite{Mineyev2024}. We also present a computer-search method that can be utilized to search for counterexamples of a certain geometry by significantly pruning the search space. We prove that a class of CAT(0) groups with certain geometry cannot be counterexamples to these conjectures. Moreover, we prove that for $ 1\le m \le 5$ and $n$ any positive integer, there are no counterexamples to the conjectures such that the associated oriented product structures are of type $(m,n)$. With the aid of computer, we prove that, in fact, there are no such counterexamples of the length combination $(m,n)$ where $1\le m \le 13$ and $1\le n \le 13$.</description>

      <title>On commensurators of free groups and free pro-p groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04120v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the commensurators of free groups and free pro-$p$ groups, as well as certain subgroups of these. We prove that the commensurator $Comm(F)$ of a non-abelian free group of finite rank $F$ is not virtually simple, answering a question of Lubotzky. On the other hand, we exhibit a family of easy-to-define finitely generated subgroups of $Comm(F)$ and show that some groups in this family are simple.
  For a prime $p$, we also consider the p-commensurator $Comm_p(F)$, which is the commensurator of $F$ viewed as a group with pro-$p$ topology. By contrast with $Comm(F)$, we prove that $Comm_p(F)$ has a simple subgroup of index at most 2. Further, while the isomorphism class of $Comm(F)$ does not depend on the rank of $F$, we prove that the isomorphism class of $Comm_p(F)$ depends on the rank of $F$ and determine the exact dependency.
  If $\mathbf F$ is the pro-$p$ completion of $F$ (which is a free pro-$p$ group), $Comm(\mathbf F)$ is a totally disconnected locally compact (tdlc) group containing $\mathbf F$ as an open subgroup. We use $Comm_p(F)$ to construct an abstractly simple subgroup of $Comm(\mathbf F)$ containing $\mathbf F$ as well as a family of non-discrete tdlc groups which are compactly generated and simple.</description>

      <title>An explicit algorithm for the Higman Embedding Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04347v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an algorithm which for any recursive group $G$, given by its effectively enumerable generators and recursively enumerable relations, outputs an explicit embedding of $G$ into a finitely presented group directly written by its generators and defining relations. This is the explicit analogue of the remarkable Higman Embedding Theorem stating that a finitely generated group $G$ is embeddable into a finitely presented group if and only if $G$ is recursive. The constructed finitely presented group can even be chosen to be $2$-generator. This algorithm has already been applied, for example, to the additive group of rational numbers $\mathbb Q$, which is recursive. The question on explicit embedding of $\mathbb Q$ into a finitely presented group was mentioned in the literature by Johnson, De la Harpe, Bridson and others. The suggested method can be used to solve the problem of embeddings for some other recursive groups, also. The embedding algorithm is built using conventional free constructions and their modifications, including free products with amalgamation, HNN-extensions, and certain auxiliary $*$-constructions. We also analyze the steps of original Higman embedding to indicate which of its parts are or are not explicit.</description>

      <title>Rigidity for graph product von Neumann algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03662v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish rigidity theorems for graph product von Neumann algebras $M_\Gamma=*_{v,\Gamma}M_v$ associated to finite simple graphs $\Gamma$ and families of tracial von Neumann algebras $(M_v)_{v\in\Gamma}$. We consider the following three broad classes of vertex algebras: diffuse, diffuse amenable, and II$_1$ factors. In each of these three regimes, we exhibit a large class of graphs $\Gamma,\Lambda$ for which the following holds: any isomorphism $\theta$ between $M_\Gamma$ and $N_\Lambda$ ensures the existence of a graph isomorphism $\alpha:\Gamma\to\Lambda$, and tight relations between $\theta(M_v)$ and $N_{\alpha(v)}$ for every vertex $v\in\Gamma$, ranging from strong intertwining in both directions (in the sense of Popa), to unitary conjugacy in some cases.
  Our results lead to a wide range of applications to the classification of graph product von Neumann algebras and the calculation of their symmetry groups. First, we obtain general classification theorems for von Neumann algebras of right-angled Artin groups and of graph products of ICC groups. We also provide a new family of II$_1$ factors with trivial fundamental group, including all graph products of II$_1$ factors over graphs with girth at least $5$ and no vertices of degree $0$ or $1$. Finally, we compute the outer automorphism group of certain graph products of II$_1$ factors.</description>

      <title>Submonoids of Infinite Symmetric Inverse Monoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04200v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this thesis we study the subsemigroup structure of the symmetric inverse monoid $I_X$, the inverse semigroup of bijections between subsets of the set $X$, when $X$ is an infinite set. We explore three different approaches to this task. First, we classify the maximal subsemigroups of $I_X$ containing certain subgroups of the symmetric group on $X$. The subgroups in question are the symmetric group itself, the pointwise stabiliser of a finite non-empty subset of $X$, the stabiliser of an ultrafilter on $X$, and the stabiliser of a finite partition of $X$. Next, we study subsemigroups of $I_X$ which are closed in semigroup topologies on $I_X$ introduced by Elliot et al. in 2023. We discover that the closed subsemigroups in these topologies that contain all the idempotents of $I_X$ coincide exactly with semigroups of partial endomorphisms and partial automorphisms of relational structures defined on $X$. Furthermore, we show that if a relational structure $R$ on a countable set $X$ only contains a finite number of relations, then there exists a finite subset $U$ of $I_X$ such that the union of the partial automorphisms of $R$ together with $U$ generates all of $I_X$. Finally, we study the subsemigroup structure of $I_X$ under a preorder introduced by George Bergman and Saharon Shelah in 2006 for the symmetric group. Extending the preorder to $I_X$, if $S_1$ and $S_2$ are subsemigroups of $I_X$, we say that $S_1 \preccurlyeq S_2$ if there exists a finite subset $U$ of $I_X$ such that $S_1$ is contained in the semigroup generated by the union of $S_2$ and $U$. We classify certain types of subsemigroups of $I_X$ according the Bergman-Shelah preorder, and we formulate a conjecture analogous to the main result by Bergman and Shelah.</description>
