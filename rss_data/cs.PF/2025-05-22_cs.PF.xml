      <title>A Methodology to Evaluate Strategies Predicting Rankings on Unseen Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frequently, multiple entities (methods, algorithms, procedures, solutions, etc.) can be developed for a common task and applied across various domains that differ in the distribution of scenarios encountered. For example, in computer vision, the input data provided to image analysis methods depend on the type of sensor used, its location, and the scene content. However, a crucial difficulty remains: can we predict which entities will perform best in a new domain based on assessments on known domains, without having to carry out new and costly evaluations? This paper presents an original methodology to address this question, in a leave-one-domain-out fashion, for various application-specific preferences. We illustrate its use with 30 strategies to predict the rankings of 40 entities (unsupervised background subtraction methods) on 53 domains (videos).</description>

      <title>Extracting Practical, Actionable Energy Insights from Supercomputer Telemetry and Logs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As supercomputers grow in size and complexity, power efficiency has become a critical challenge, particularly in understanding GPU power consumption within modern HPC workloads. This work addresses this challenge by presenting a data co-analysis approach using system data collected from the Polaris supercomputer at Argonne National Laboratory. We focus on GPU utilization and power demands, navigating the complexities of large-scale, heterogeneous datasets. Our approach, which incorporates data preprocessing, post-processing, and statistical methods, condenses the data volume by 94% while preserving essential insights. Through this analysis, we uncover key opportunities for power optimization, such as reducing high idle power costs, applying power strategies at the job-level, and aligning GPU power allocation with workload demands. Our findings provide actionable insights for energy-efficient computing and offer a practical, reproducible approach for applying existing research to optimize system performance.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Gap: Physical PCI Device Integration Into SystemC-TLM Virtual Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In today's technology-driven world, early-stage software development and testing are crucial. Virtual Platforms (VPs) have become indispensable tools for this purpose as they serve as a platform to execute and debug the unmodified target software at an early design stage. With the increasing complexity of software, especially in areas like Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications, VPs need to provide high simulation speed to ensure the target software executes within a reasonable time. Hybrid simulation, which combines virtual models with real hardware, can improve the performance of VPs. This paper introduces a novel approach for integrating real Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) devices into SystemC-TLM-2.0-based VPs. The embedded PCI devices enable high performance, easy integration, and allow introspection for analysis and optimization. To illustrate the practical application of our approach, we present a case study where we integrate Google Coral's Edge Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) into an ARM-based VP. The integration allows efficient execution of AI workloads, accelerating simulation speeds by up to 480x while eliminating the need for complex virtual device models. Beyond accelerating AI-workload execution, our framework enables driver development, regression testing across architectures, and device communication analysis. Our findings demonstrate that embedding PCI devices into SystemC simulations significantly enhances</description>

      <title>BurstGPT: A Real-world Workload Dataset to Optimize LLM Serving Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17644v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Serving systems for Large Language Models (LLMs) are often optimized to improve quality of service (QoS) and throughput. However, due to the lack of open-source LLM serving workloads, these systems are frequently evaluated under unrealistic workload assumptions. Consequently, performance may degrade when systems are deployed in real-world scenarios. This work presents BurstGPT, an LLM serving workload with 10.31 million traces from regional Azure OpenAI GPT services over 213 days. BurstGPT captures LLM serving characteristics from user, model and system perspectives: (1) User request concurrency: burstiness variations of requests in Azure OpenAI GPT services, revealing diversified concurrency patterns in different services and model types. (2) User conversation patterns: counts and intervals within conversations for service optimizations. (3) Model response lengths: auto-regressive serving processes of GPT models, showing statistical relations between requests and their responses. (4) System response failures: failures of conversation and API services, showing intensive resource needs and limited availability of LLM services in Azure. The details of the characteristics can serve multiple purposes in LLM serving optimizations, such as system evaluation and trace provisioning. In our demo evaluation with BurstGPT, frequent variations in BurstGPT reveal declines in efficiency, stability, or reliability in realistic LLM serving. We identify that the generalization of KV cache management, scheduling and disaggregation optimizations can be improved under realistic workload evaluations. BurstGPT is publicly available now at https://github.com/HPMLL/BurstGPT and is widely used to develop prototypes of LLM serving frameworks in the industry.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Asynchronous Federated Learning: A~Delicate Trade-Off Between Model-Parameter Staleness and Update Frequency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08206v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Synchronous federated learning (FL) scales poorly with the number of clients due to the straggler effect. Algorithms like FedAsync and GeneralizedFedAsync address this limitation by enabling asynchronous communication between clients and the central server. In this work, we rely on stochastic modeling and analysis to better understand the impact of design choices in asynchronous FL algorithms, such as the concurrency level and routing probabilities, and we leverage this knowledge to optimize loss. Compared to most existing studies, we account for the joint impact of heterogeneous and variable service speeds and heterogeneous datasets at the clients. We characterize in particular a fundamental trade-off for optimizing asynchronous FL: minimizing gradient estimation errors by avoiding model parameter staleness, while also speeding up the system by increasing the throughput of model updates. Our two main contributions can be summarized as follows. First, we prove a discrete variant of Little's law to derive a closed-form expression for relative delay, a metric that quantifies staleness. This allows us to efficiently minimize the average loss per model update, which has been the gold standard in literature to date. Second, we observe that naively optimizing this metric leads us to slow down the system drastically by overemphazing staleness at the detriment of throughput. This motivates us to introduce an alternative metric that also takes system speed into account, for which we derive a tractable upper-bound that can be minimized numerically. Extensive numerical results show that these optimizations enhance accuracy by 10% to 30%.</description>

      <title>Energy-Efficient Transformer Inference: Optimization Strategies for Time Series Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16627v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The increasing computational demands of transformer models in time series classification necessitate effective optimization strategies for energy-efficient deployment. Our study presents a systematic investigation of optimization techniques, focusing on structured pruning and quantization methods for transformer architectures. Through extensive experimentation on three distinct datasets (RefrigerationDevices, ElectricDevices, and PLAID), we quantitatively evaluate model performance and energy efficiency across different transformer configurations. Our experimental results demonstrate that static quantization reduces energy consumption by 29.14% while maintaining classification performance, and L1 pruning achieves a 63% improvement in inference speed with minimal accuracy degradation. Our findings provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of optimization strategies for transformer-based time series classification, establishing a foundation for efficient model deployment in resource-constrained environments.</description>
