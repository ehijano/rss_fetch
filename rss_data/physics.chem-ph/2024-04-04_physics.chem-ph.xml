      <title>A coarse-grained description of anharmonic lattice environments affecting the quantum dynamics of charge carriers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lattice softness has a significant impact on charge carrier dynamics in condensed matter systems, contributing to the emergence of various properties and functions. Examples include the remarkable carrier lifetimes and defect tolerances of hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites. Recent studies suggest the contribution of quartic anharmonicity of the lattice vibrations. The quartic anharmonicity can be discussed with a double-well potential, and the transition between the two minima can be coarse-grained as a two-state jump stochastic process. Such a stochastic approach is typically employed to describe dynamic fluctuations introduced into a system by two-state transitions in the surroundings. To investigate charge transport in materials, however, it is crucial to describe not only the fluctuations but also the dynamic lattice distortion associated with charge transport. Therefore, there is a need for a theory to describe the charge carrier dynamics proceeding alongside the lattice distortion dynamics. In this study, we present a theory that describes quantum dynamics under the influence of an environment with two stable states, termed a bistable environment. The theory describes the effects of fluctuations and dissipation induced from the bistable environment in a reasonable manner, and the effects exhibit a different temperature dependence than the widely employed Gaussian environment. The physical implication of this temperature dependence is provided in terms of the environmental dynamics. The results of this study are expected to provide a step forward in describing charge carrier dynamics in materials with lattice softness and pronounced lattice anharmonicity, e.g., hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites. Moreover, these findings represent an advancement in our understanding of and capacity to predict and control the physical properties and functions of these materials.</description>

      <title>Selecting High-Dimensional Representations of Physical Systems by Reweighted Diffusion Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constructing reduced representations of high-dimensional systems is a fundamental problem in physical chemistry. Many unsupervised machine learning methods can automatically find such low-dimensional representations. However, an often overlooked problem is what high-dimensional representation should be used to describe systems before dimensionality reduction. Here, we address this issue using a recently developed method called reweighted diffusion map [J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2022, 18, 7179-7192]. We show how high-dimensional representations can be quantitatively selected by exploring the spectral decomposition of Markov transition matrices built from data obtained from standard or enhanced sampling atomistic simulations. We demonstrate the performance of the method in several high-dimensional examples.</description>

      <title>Revealing kinetically tuned atomic pathways for interfacial strain relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strain at interfaces may profoundly impact the microstructure and properties of materials; thus, it is a major consideration when designing and engineering materials. Dislocation formation is a commonly known mechanism to release mismatch strain at solid-solid interfaces. However, it is still unclear about how materials accommodate interfacial strain under drastically accelerated structural transformation kinetics, since it is extremely challenging to directly observe the atomic structure evolution of fast-propagating interfaces. Utilizing liquid phase transmission electron microscopy (TEM), we have achieved atomic-scale imaging of hydrogen-induced phase transformations of palladium nanocrystals with different transformation speeds. Our observation reveals that the fast phase transformation occurs with an expanded interface of mixed $\alpha$- and $\beta$-$\mathrm{PdH}_x$ phases, and tilting of (020) planes to accommodate mismatch strain. In contrast, slow phase transformations lead to sharp interfaces with slipping misfit dislocations. Our kinetic Monte Carlo simulations show that fast phase transformation pushes the system far-from-equilibrium, generically roughening the interface; however, a smooth boundary minimizes strain near-equilibrium. Unveiling the atomic pathways of transformations from near-equilibrium to far-from-equilibrium, which was previously possible only computationally, this work holds significant implications for engineering microstructure of materials through modulating solid-solid transformations in a wide range of kinetics.</description>

      <title>On a conjecture concerning the Fisher--Widom line and the line of vanishing excess isothermal compressibility in simple fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the statistical mechanics approach to liquid-state theory, understanding the role of the intermolecular potential in determining thermodynamic and structural properties is crucial. The Fisher--Widom (FW) line, which separates regions in the temperature vs density plane where the decay of the total correlation function is monotonic or oscillatory, provides insights into the dominance of the attractive or repulsive part of the interactions. Stopper et al. have recently conjectured [J. Chem. Phys. \textbf{151}, 014501 (2019)] that the line of vanishing excess isothermal compressibility approximates the FW line in simple fluids. Here, we investigate this conjecture using the Jagla potential and also explore the line of vanishing excess pressure. We employ theoretical approximations and Monte Carlo simulations to study one-dimensional and three-dimensional systems. While exact results for the one-dimensional case do not support the conjecture, our Monte Carlo simulations for the three-dimensional fluid validate it. Our findings not only contribute to the understanding of the relationship between the three transition lines but also provide valuable insights into the thermodynamic and structural behaviour of simple fluids.</description>

      <title>GPU acceleration of ab initio simulations of large-scale identical particles based on path integral molecular dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) and path integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) provide the golden standard for the ab initio simulations of identical particles. In this work, we achieved significant GPU acceleration based on PIMD, which is equivalent to PIMC in the ab initio simulations, and developed an open-source PIMD code repository that does not rely on any other third party library. Numerical experiments show that for a system of 1600 interacting identical bosons in a harmonic trap, using a single GPU and a single CPU, it only takes two hours to achieve satisfactory simulation accuracy. With the increase of the number of identical particles, the advantage of GPU acceleration over CPU becomes more obvious, making it possible to simulate tens of thousands of identical particles from first principles using a single GPU. For example, for a system of 10000 non-interacting bosons, numerical experiments show that it takes 23 hours to obtain a simulation that is highly consistent with the exact results. Our study shows that GPU acceleration can lay a solid foundation for the wide application of PIMD simulations for extremely large-scale identical particle quantum systems with more than 10,000 particles. Numerical experiments show that a 24GB GPU can simulate up to 40000 identical particles from first principles, and the GPU acceleration leads to a roughly linear relationship between the computation time and the number of identical particles. In addition, we have also successfully implemented simulations for fictitious identical particle thermodynamics using GPU to overcome the Fermion sign problem, which makes it promising to efficiently and accurately simulate tens of thousands of fermions based on GPU.</description>

      <title>Anti-Coulomb interaction between charges in a dielectric medium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The free energy of ion solvation can be decomposed into enthalpic and entropic contributions. This helps to understand the connection between the dielectric properties and the underlying forces. We present a simple linear-response model of screened charge interactions that provides an alternative understanding of solvation barriers. Moreover, it explains the ``anti-Coulomb'' interactions (attraction between like-charged ions and repulsion between opposite-charged ions) observed in both simulations and experiments. We show that this is a universal behavior associated to the non-local response function of any dielectric or metallic system.</description>

      <title>Study of complex nitrogen and oxygen-bearing molecules towards the high-mass protostar IRAS 18089$-$1732</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The observation of oxygen (O)- and nitrogen (N)-bearing molecules gives an idea about the complex prebiotic chemistry in the interstellar medium (ISM). In this article, we present the identification of the rotational emission lines of N-bearing molecules ethyl cyanide (C$_{2}$H$_{5}$CN), cyanoacetylene (HC$_{3}$N), and O-bearing molecules methyl formate (CH$_{3}$OCHO) towards high-mass protostar IRAS 18089$-$1732 using the Atacama Compact Array (ACA). We also detected the emission lines of both N- and O-bearing molecule formamide (NH$_{2}$CHO) in the envelope of IRAS 18089$-$1732. We have detected the $v$ = 0 and 1 states rotational emission lines of CH$_{3}$OCHO. We also detected the two vibrationally excited states of HC$_{3}$N ($v$7 = 1 and $v$7 = 2). The estimated fractional abundances of C$_{2}$H$_{5}$CN, HC$_{3}$N ($v$7 = 1), HC$_{3}$N ($v$7 = 2), and NH$_{2}$CHO towards the IRAS 18089$-$1732 are (1.40$\pm$0.5)$\times$10$^{-10}$, (7.5$\pm$0.7)$\times$10$^{-11}$, (3.1$\pm$0.4)$\times$10$^{-11}$, and (6.25$\pm$0.82)$\times$10$^{-11}$. Similarly, the estimated fractional abundances of CH$_{3}$OCHO ($v$ = 0) and CH$_{3}$OCHO ($v$ = 1) are (1.90$\pm$0.9)$\times$10$^{-9}$ and (8.90$\pm$0.8)$\times$10$^{-10}$, respectively. We also created the integrated emission maps of the detected molecules, and the observed molecules may have originated from the extended envelope of the protostar. We show that C$_{2}$H$_{5}$CN and HC$_{3}$N are most probably formed via the subsequential hydrogenation of the CH$_{2}$CHCN and the reaction between C$_{2}$H$_{2}$ and CN on the grain surface of IRAS 18089$-$1732. We found that NH$_{2}$CHO is probably produced due to the reaction between NH$_{2}$ and H$_{2}$CO in the gas phase. Similarly, CH$_{3}$OCHO is possibly created via the reaction between radical CH$_{3}$O and radical HCO on the grain surface of IRAS 18089$-$1732.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Processes for Finite Size Extrapolation of Many-Body Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.10334v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Key to being able to accurately model the properties of realistic materials is being able to predict their properties in the thermodynamic limit. Nevertheless, because most many-body electronic structure methods scale as a high-order polynomial, or even exponentially, with system size, directly simulating large systems in their thermodynamic limit rapidly becomes computationally intractable. As a result, researchers typically estimate the properties of large systems that approach the thermodynamic limit by extrapolating the properties of smaller, computationally-accessible systems based on relatively simple scaling expressions. In this work, we employ Gaussian processes to more accurately and efficiently extrapolate many-body simulations to their thermodynamic limit. We train our Gaussian processes on Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (SOAP) descriptors to extrapolate the energies of one-dimensional hydrogen chains obtained using two high-accuracy many-body methods: Coupled Cluster theory and Auxiliary Field Quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC). In so doing, we show that Gaussian processes trained on relatively short, 10-30-atom chains can predict the energies of both homogeneous and inhomogeneous hydrogen chains in their thermodynamic limit with sub-milliHartree accuracy. Unlike standard scaling expressions, our GPR-based approach is highly generalizable given representative training data and is not dependent on systems' geometries or dimensionality. This work highlights the potential for machine learning to correct for the finite size effects that routinely complicate the interpretation of finite size many-body simulations.</description>

      <title>Reweighted Manifold Learning of Collective Variables from Enhanced Sampling Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.14554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.14554v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Enhanced sampling methods are indispensable in computational physics and chemistry, where atomistic simulations cannot exhaustively sample the high-dimensional configuration space of dynamical systems due to the sampling problem. A class of such enhanced sampling methods works by identifying a few slow degrees of freedom, termed collective variables (CVs), and enhancing the sampling along these CVs. Selecting CVs to analyze and drive the sampling is not trivial and often relies on physical and chemical intuition. Despite routinely circumventing this issue using manifold learning to estimate CVs directly from standard simulations, such methods cannot provide mappings to a low-dimensional manifold from enhanced sampling simulations as the geometry and density of the learned manifold are biased. Here, we address this crucial issue and provide a general reweighting framework based on anisotropic diffusion maps for manifold learning that takes into account that the learning data set is sampled from a biased probability distribution. We consider manifold learning methods based on constructing a Markov chain describing transition probabilities between high-dimensional samples. We show that our framework reverts the biasing effect yielding CVs that correctly describe the equilibrium density. This advancement enables the construction of low-dimensional CVs using manifold learning directly from data generated by enhanced sampling simulations. We call our framework reweighted manifold learning. We show that it can be used in many manifold learning techniques on data from both standard and enhanced sampling simulations.</description>

      <title>A MASH simulation of the photoexcited dynamics of cyclobutanone</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10410v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In response to a community prediction challenge, we simulate the nonadiabatic dynamics of cyclobutanone using the mapping approach to surface hopping (MASH). We consider the first 500 fs of relaxation following photo-excitation to the S2 state and predict the corresponding time-resolved electron-diffraction signal that will be measured by the planned experiment. 397 ab-initio trajectories were obtained on the fly with state-averaged complete active space self-consistent field (SA-CASSCF) using a (12,11) active space. To obtain an estimate of the potential systematic error 198 of the trajectories were calculated using an aug-cc-pVDZ basis set and 199 with a 6-31+G* basis set. MASH is a recently proposed independent trajectory method for simulating nonadiabatic dynamics, originally derived for two-state problems. As there are three relevant electronic states in this system, we used a newly developed multi-state generalisation of MASH for the simulation: the uncoupled spheres multi-state MASH method (unSMASH). This study therefore serves both as an investigation of the photo-dissociation dynamics of cyclobutanone, and also as a demonstration of the applicability of unSMASH to ab-initio simulations. In line with previous experimental studies, we observe that the simulated dynamics is dominated by three sets of dissociation products, C3H6+CO, C2H4+C2H2O and C2H4+CH2+CO, and we interpret our predicted electron-diffraction signal in terms of the key features of the associated dissociation pathways.</description>

      <title>Flat bands and unconventional superconductivity in a simple model of metal-organic frameworks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.10673v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The superconducting metal-organic framework Cu-BHT forms a kagome lattice with metals at the vertices and ligands along the bonds. This bipartite motif is common in reticular materials. We show that a tight-binding model on this lattice yields partially occupied interference-induced flat bands at half-filling with large gaps between them and all other bands. Long-range hopping induces curvature in the bands but leaves them flatter and more isolated than those in twisted bilayer graphene. The slave boson theory of the t-J model on this lattice shows highly unconventional superconductivity including an f -wave singlet phase. Thus, framework materials provide an ideal lattice-driven approach to strongly correlated phenomena in flat bands at high electronic densities.</description>

Abstract: We develop algebraic geometry for coupled cluster (CC) theory of quantum many-body systems. The high-dimensional eigenvalue problems that encode the electronic Schr\"odinger equation are approximated by a hierarchy of polynomial systems at various levels of truncation. The exponential parametrization of the eigenstates gives rise to truncation varieties. These generalize Grassmannians in their Pl\"ucker embedding. We explain how to derive Hamiltonians, we offer a detailed study of truncation varieties and their CC degrees, and we present the state of the art in solving the CC equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01511v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The complexity of biological systems and processes, spanning molecular to macroscopic scales, necessitates the use of multiscale simulations to get a comprehensive understanding. Quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are crucial for capturing processes beyond the reach of classical MD simulations. The advent of exascale computing offers unprecedented opportunities for scientific exploration, not least within life sciences, where simulations are essential to unravel intricate molecular mechanisms underlying biological processes. However, leveraging the immense computational power of exascale computing requires innovative algorithms and software designs. In this context, we discuss the current status and future prospects of multiscale biomolecular simulations on exascale supercomputers with a focus on QM/MM MD. We highlight our own efforts in developing a versatile and high-performance multiscale simulation framework with the aim of efficient utilization of state-of-the-art supercomputers. We showcase its application in uncovering complex biological mechanisms and its potential for leveraging exascale computing.</description>
