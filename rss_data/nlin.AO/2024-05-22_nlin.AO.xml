      <title>Stochastic Reservoir Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reservoir computing is a form of machine learning that utilizes nonlinear dynamical systems to perform complex tasks in a cost-effective manner when compared to typical neural networks. Many recent advancements in reservoir computing, in particular quantum reservoir computing, make use of reservoirs that are inherently stochastic. However, the theoretical justification for using these systems has not yet been well established. In this paper, we investigate the universality of stochastic reservoir computers, in which we use a stochastic system for reservoir computing using the probabilities of each reservoir state as the readout instead of the states themselves. In stochastic reservoir computing, the number of distinct states of the entire reservoir computer can potentially scale exponentially with the size of the reservoir hardware, offering the advantage of compact device size. We prove that classes of stochastic echo state networks, and therefore the class of all stochastic reservoir computers, are universal approximating classes. We also investigate the performance of two practical examples of stochastic reservoir computers in classification and chaotic time series prediction. While shot noise is a limiting factor in the performance of stochastic reservoir computing, we show significantly improved performance compared to a deterministic reservoir computer with similar hardware in cases where the effects of noise are small.</description>

      <title>Explosive synchronization in coupled stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the effect of network topology on the collective dynamics of an oscillator ensemble. Specifically, we explore explosive synchronization in a system of interacting star networks. Explosive synchronization is characterized by an abrupt transition from an incoherent state to a coherent state. In this study, we couple multiple star networks through their hubs and study the emergent dynamics as a function of coupling strength. The dynamics of each node satisfies the equation of a Kuramoto oscillator. We observe that for a small inter-star coupling strength, the hysteresis width between the forward and backward transition point is minimal, which increases with an increase in the inter-star coupling strength. This observation is independent of the size of the network. Further, we find that the backward transition point is independent of the number of stars coupled together and the inter-star coupling strength, which is also verified using the Watanabe and Strogatz (WS) theory.</description>

      <title>Metacognitive particles, mental action and the sense of agency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper articulates metacognition using the language of statistical physics and Bayesian mechanics. Metacognitive beliefs, defined as beliefs about beliefs, find a natural description within this formalism, which allows us to define the dynamics of 'metacognitive particles', i.e., systems possessing metacognitive beliefs. We further unpack this typology of metacognitive systems by distinguishing passive and active metacognitive particles, where active particles are endowed with the capacity for mental actions that update the parameters of other beliefs. We provide arguments for the necessity of this architecture in the emergence of a subjective sense of agency and the experience of being separate from the environment. The motivation is to pave the way towards a mathematical and physical understanding of cognition -- and higher forms thereof -- furthering the study and formalization of cognitive science in the language of mathematical physics.</description>

      <title>Frenetic steering: nonequilibrium-enabled navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.09227v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explain the steering of slow degrees of freedom by coupling them to driven components for which the time-symmetric reactivities are manipulated. We present the strategy and main principle that make that sort of navigation feasible. For illustration, nonlinear limit cycles (as in the van der Pol oscillator) and strange attractors (as in the Lorenz dynamics) are seen to emerge when the driving in the nonequilibrium medium is kept fixed while the frenesy is tuned to produce the required forces. We imagine that such frenetic steering is available in Life as well, allowing selection of the appropriate biological functioning.</description>
