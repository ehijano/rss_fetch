      <title>Intrinsic Maximum Light Absorption in Laser-Field-Driven Growth of Highly Ordered Silicon Nanowire Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide direct experimental evidence for a state-selection principle in a far-from-equilibrium system. Using the laser-driven growth of silicon nanowires as a uniquely clean and quantifiable platform, we show that a long-range ordered array emerges as the system spontaneously selects the periodicity that maximizes its collective light absorption. This establishes a direct, measurable link between a maximum dissipation/absorption principle and emergent structural order. Our results thus offer a concrete test for models of non-equilibrium self-organization.</description>

      <title>Near-field radiative heat transfer in the dual nanoscale regime between polaritonic membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The enhancement and attenuation of near-field radiative heat transfer between polaritonic SiC, SiN and SiO2 subwavelength membranes is analyzed. Fluctuational electrodynamics simulations combined with a modal analysis show that all membranes support corner and edge modes, which can induce a large 5.1-fold enhancement for SiC and a 2.1-fold attenuation for SiO2 of the heat transfer coefficient with respect to that between infinite surfaces. The enhancement or attenuation is directly related to material losses which reduce the density of available electromagnetic states between the membranes.</description>

      <title>Deterministic nanofabrication of quantum dot-circular Bragg grating resonators with high process yield using in-situ electron beam lithography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The controlled integration of quantum dots (QDs) as single-photon emitters into quantum light sources is essential for the implementation of large-scale quantum networks. In this study, we employ the deterministic in-situ electron-beam lithography (iEBL) nanotechnology platform to integrate individual QDs with high accuracy and process yield into circular Bragg grating (CBG) resonators. Notably, CBG devices comprising just 3 to 4 rings exhibit photon extraction efficiencies comparable to those of structures with more rings. This facilitates faster fabrication, reduces the device footprint, and enables compatibility with electrical contacting. To demonstrate the scalability of this process, we present results of 95 optically active QD-CBG devices fabricated across two lithography sessions. These devices exhibit bright, narrow-linewidth single-photon emission with excellent optical quality. To evaluate QD placement accuracy, we apply a powerful characterization technique that combines cathodoluminescence (CL) mapping and scanning electron microscopy. Statistical analysis of these devices reveals that our iEBL approach enables high alignment accuracy and a process yield of over &gt;90% across various CBG geometries. Our findings highlight a reliable route toward the scalable fabrication of high-performance QD-based single-photon sources for use in photonic quantum technology applications.</description>

      <title>Emergent nonlocal interactions induced by quantized gauge fields in topological systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study fermionic and bosonic systems coupled to a real or synthetic static gauge field that is quantized, so the field itself is a quantum degree of freedom and can exist in coherent superposition. A natural example is electrons on a quantum ring encircling a quantized magnetic flux (QMF) generated by a superconducting current. We show that coupling to a common QMF gives rise to an emergent interaction between particles with no classical analog, as it is topological and nonlocal (independent of interparticle distance). Moreover, the interaction persists even when the particles lie in a nominally field-free region, with the vector potential mediating the interaction. We analyze several one- and two-dimensional model systems, encompassing both real and synthetic gauge fields. These systems exhibit unusual behavior, including strong nonlinearities, non-integer Chern numbers, and quantum phase transitions. Furthermore, synthetic gauge fields offer high tunability and can reach field strengths that are difficult to realize with real magnetic fields, enabling engineered nonlinearities and interaction profiles.</description>

      <title>High harmonic generation light source with polarization selectivity and sub-100-$\mu$m beam size for time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-quality ultrafast light sources are critical for developing advanced time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (TrARPES). While the application of high harmonic generation (HHG) light sources in TrARPES has increased significantly over the past decade, the optimization of the HHG probe beam size and selective control of the light polarization, which are important for TrARPES measurements, have been rarely explored. In this work, we report the implementation of high-quality HHG probe source with an optimum beam size down to 57 $\mu$m $\times$ 90 $\mu$m and selective light polarization control, together with mid-infrared (MIR) pumping source for TrARPES measurements using a 10 kHz amplifier laser. The selective polarization control of the HHG probe source allows to enhance bands with different orbital contributions or symmetries, as demonstrated by experimental data measured on a few representative transition metal dichalcogenide materials (TMDCs) as well as topological insulator Bi$_2$Se$_3$. Furthermore, by combining the HHG probe source with MIR pumping at 2 $\mu$m wavelength, TrARPES on a bilayer graphene shows a time resolution of 140 fs, allowing to distinguish two different relaxation processes in graphene. Such high-quality HHG probe source together with the MIR pumping expands the capability of TrARPES in revealing the ultrafast dynamics and light-induced emerging phenomena in quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Switchable axionic magnetoelectric effect via spin-flop transition in topological antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ material family has emerged as a key platform for exploring magnetic topological phases, most notably exemplified by the experimental realization of the axion insulator state. While spin dynamics are known to significantly influence the axion state, a profound understanding of their interplay remains elusive. In this work, we employ an antiferromagnetic spin-chain model to demonstrate that an external magnetic field induces extrinsic perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. We find that an in-plane field stabilizes the antiferromagnetic order, whereas an out-of-plane field destabilizes it and triggers spin-flop transitions. Remarkably, near the surface spin-flop transition in even-layer MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ films, the axion insulator state undergoes a sharp switching behavior accompanied by distinct magnetoelectric responses. Furthermore, we propose that this switchable axionic magnetoelectric effect can be utilized to convert alternating magnetic field signals into measurable square-wave magneto-optical outputs, thereby realizing an axionic analog of a zero-crossing detector. Our findings could open a pathway toward potential applications of axion insulators in next-generation spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>New perspective on symmetry breaking in an antiferromagnetic chain: Spin-selective transport and NDR phenomenon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The primary requirement for achieving spin-selective electron transfer in a nanojunction possessing a magnetic system with zero net magnetization is to break the symmetry between the up and down spin sub-Hamiltonians. Circumventing the available approaches, in the present work, we put forward a new mechanism for symmetry breaking by introducing a bias drop along the functional element. To demonstrate this, we consider a magnetic chain with antiparallel alignment of neighboring magnetic moments. The junction is modeled within a tight-binding framework, and spin-dependent transmission probabilities are evaluated using wave-guide theory. The corresponding current components are obtained through the Landauer-B\"{u}ttiker formalism. Selective spin currents, exhibiting a high degree of spin polarization, are obtained over a wide bias region. Moreover, the bias-dependent transmission profile exhibits negative differential resistance (NDR), another important aspect of our study. We examine the results under three different potential profiles, one linear and two non-linear, and in each case, we observe a favorable response. This work may offer a new route for designing efficient spintronic devices based on bias-controlled magnetic systems with vanishing net magnetization.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Accelerated First-Principles Quantum Transport Simulations at Nonequilibrium State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The non-equilibrium Green's function method combined with density functional theory (NEGF-DFT) provides a rigorous framework for simulating nanoscale electronic transport, but its computational cost scales steeply with system size. Recent artificial intelligence (AI) approaches have sought to accelerate such simulations, yet most rely on conventional machine learning, lack atomic resolution, struggle to extrapolate to larger systems, and cannot predict multiple properties simultaneously. Here we introduce DeepQT, a deep-learning framework that integrates graph neural networks with transformer architectures to enable multi-property predictions of electronic structure and transport without manual feature engineering. By learning key intermediate quantities of NEGF-DFT, the equilibrium Hamiltonian and the non-equilibrium total potential difference, DeepQT reconstructs Hamiltonians under both equilibrium and bias conditions, yielding accurate transport predictions. Leveraging the principle of electronic nearsightedness, DeepQT generalizes from small training systems to much larger ones with high fidelity. Benchmarks on graphene, MoS2, and silicon diodes with varied defects and dopants show that DeepQT achieves first-principles accuracy while reducing computational cost by orders of magnitude. This scalable, transferable framework advances AI-assisted quantum transport, offering a powerful tool for next-generation nanoelectronic device design.</description>

      <title>Quantum spin-tensor Hall effect protected by pseudo time-reversal symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The celebrated family of the Hall effect plays a fundamental role in modern physics. Starting from the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) and the quantum AHE (QAHE) with broken time-reversal symmetry (TRS) to their spinful generalizations, including spin Hall effect (SHE) and quantum SHE (QSHE) protected by TRS, they reveal rich transport and topological phenomena. However, in larger-spin $S$ ($S&gt;1/2$) systems, besides charge current and spin current, there arise higher-rank spin-tensor currents. Recent work has uncovered an interesting spin-tensor Hall effect with spin-tensor currents in these larger-spin systems. Taking a step further, this work discovers a new class of topological states of matter dubbed \textit{quantum spin-tensor Hall} (QSTH) insulators with broken TRS, and their nontrivial topology is protected by a unique \textit{pseudo-TRS}. Most strikingly, QSTH insulators exhibit a quantized rank-2 spin-tensor Hall conductivity, whereas both charge (rank-0) and spin (rank-1) conductivities vanish. We also fully characterize their topological properties and highlight the physical interpretations via the underlying connections to QSHE. Our work enriches the family of the famous Hall effects and sheds light on the intriguing topological state of matter in larger-spin systems. It further offers new avenues toward spin-tensor-tronics and low-power atomtronics.</description>

      <title>Real space decay of flat band projectors from compact localized states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flatbands (FB) with compact localized eigenstates (CLS) fall into three main categories, controlled by the algebraic properties of the CLS set: orthogonal, linearly independent, linearly dependent (singular). A CLS parametrization allows us to continuously tune a linearly independent FB into a limiting orthogonal or a linearly dependent (singular) one. We derive the asymptotic real space decay of the flat band projectors for each category. The linearly independent FB is characterized by an exponentially decaying projector and a corresponding localization length $\xi$, all dressed by an algebraic prefactor. In the orthogonal limit, the localization length is $\xi=0$, and the projector is compact. The singular FB limit corresponds to $\xi \rightarrow \infty$ with an emerging power law decay of the projector. We obtain analytical estimates for the localization length and the algebraic power law exponents depending on the dimension of the lattice and the number of bands involved. Numerical results are in excellent agreement with the analytics. Our results are of relevance for the understanding of the details of the FB quantum metric discussed in the context of FB superconductivity, the impact of disorder, and the response to local driving.</description>

      <title>Interplay of spin orbit interaction and Andreev reflection in proximized quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a hybrid device, consisting of two quantum dots proximized by a BCS superconductor and coupled to two external normal electrodes. Assuming charge tunneling between quantum dots through the spin-flip processes, we study the molecular Andreev bound states appearing in the proximized quantum dots. We show that the spin-orbit coupling induces four quasiparticle states. For the appropriate set of model parameters, two of these internal quasiparticles merge, forming the zero-energy state. Under such circumstances, we obtain fully spin-polarized versions of the Majorana quasiparticles, localized on different quantum dots. This situation occurs solely when the spin-orbit interaction is equally strong to the magnitude of crossed Andreev reflections, i.e. in the sweet spot. Otherwise, these processes are competitive, as indicated in expectation values of the corresponding order parameters. We analyze signatures of such competition manifested under the nonequilibrium conditions, for various configurations of bias voltage. In particular, for the symmetric bias voltage between the normal electrodes and the Cooper pair splitter bias configuration we reveal duality in the transport properties. Charge transport through the zero-energy state at the sweet spot is contributed by perfectly entangled electrons with an (almost) ideal transmission. Transport studies would thus enable empirical detection of the molecular quasiparticle states and the efficiency of dissipation processes caused by the external normal electrodes.</description>

      <title>Geometry-Driven Charge and Spin Transport in $\beta12$ Borophene Quantum Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Theoretical research has been conducted to study how geometry affects charge and spin transport in $\beta\mathrm{12}$ borophene quantum dots, which are confined systems. The study examined two distinct central regions, which included a circular disc and a regular hexagonal area that connected to semi-infinite zigzag and armchair borophene nanoribbon leads. The system was described by a five-band tight-binding Hamiltonian parameterized using first-principles data, and the transport properties were calculated within the non-equilibrium Green's function framework. Spin resolved transmissions and spin polarization were computed for a range of lead widths and proximity-induced exchange field strengths. The analysis revealed distinct transport characteristics determined by geometry and edge configuration: armchair-connected structures exhibited broader and more stable fully spin-polarized windows compared with zigzag-connected counterparts. Furthermore, critical lead-width thresholds ($\approx 1.01$ nm for zigzag and $\approx 0.87$ nm for armchair) and a moderate exchange field above which complete spin filtering occurs were identified. The results highlight the strong influence of edge termination and confinement geometry on transport properties and provide useful design guidelines for developing borophene-based nanoscale spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Attaining the Ground State of Kagome Artificial Spin Ice via Ultrafast Site-Specific Laser Annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial spin ices (ASIs) provide a versatile platform to explore magnetic frustration and emergent phenomena. However, in kagome ASI, experimental access to the ground state remains elusive due to dynamical freezing. Here, we demonstrate a deterministic and rewritable approach to attain the ground state using ultrafast, site-selective laser annealing. By engineering sublattice-dependent optical absorption through selective capping of the nanomagnets with Cr or utilizing different nanomagnet thicknesses, we achieve selective partial demagnetization of one sublattice under a sub-coercive magnetic field, driving the system into the ground state in a single switching step. Magnetic force microscopy reveals nearly perfect long-range ordering, while heat-transfer simulations confirm the sublattice-selective excitation mechanism. This work establishes an ultrafast method to attain the kagome ASI ground state, which does not require a modification of the geometry of the ASI or the materials used for the individual nanomagnets. Beyond ground-state writing, this site-selective activation provides an important tool for controlling the magnetic states, which is important for applications such as reconfigurable magnonic crystals, neuromorphic computing and programmable nanomagnetic logic.</description>

      <title>N\'eel-Vector-Orientation Induced Intrinsic Half-Metallicity in Two-Dimensional Altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets combine zero net magnetization with giant spin splitting, enabling spin-polarized transport without strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC). Deterministically selecting the conducting spin channel, however, requires breaking the 90 degree rotation and time-reversal antisymmetry (C4zT). Using standard axial vector transformation rules as preliminaries, we show that in monolayer Ta2TeSeO this can be achieved naturally and tuned in a symmetry efficient way by rotating the Neel vector. Without considering the Neel vector, Ta2TeSeO has one pair of mirror protected spin polarized Weyl points in each spin channel. Aligning the Neel vector along the crystallographic x or y direction breaks the mirror symmetry Mx or My, inducing selective mirror symmetry breaking that keeps one spin sector gapless and opens a gap in the opposite spin, yielding fully spin polarized transport. The C2z symmetry breaking makes the preserved two Weyl points inequivalent, turning the half semimetal into a half metallic state. The same orientation selective symmetry reduction applies to lattice vibrations, implying phonon chirality splitting. Owing to the near degenerate in plane anisotropy, reversible zero moment switching is achievable with minute in plane strain or weak magnetic fields, and the lattice coupling suggests control by circularly polarized light. The mechanism extends to other two dimensional decorated Lieb altermagnets lacking horizontal mirror Mz, providing a general low power route to spin filtering and logic.</description>

      <title>Technical Review of spin-based computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-based computing is emerging as a powerful approach for energy-efficient and high-performance solutions to future data processing hardware. Spintronic devices function by electrically manipulating the collective dynamics of the electron spin, that is inherently non-volatile, nonlinear and fast-operating, and can couple to other degrees of freedom such as photonic and phononic systems. This review explores key advances in integrating magnetic and spintronic elements into computational architectures, ranging from fundamental components like radio-frequency neurons/synapses and spintronic probabilistic-bits to broader frameworks such as reservoir computing and magnetic Ising machines. We discuss hardware-specific and task-dependent metrics to evaluate the computing performance of spin-based components and associate them with physical properties. Finally, we discuss challenges and future opportunities, highlighting the potential of spin-based computing in next-generation technologies.</description>

      <title>Giant thermal modulation via a semiconductor-superconductor photonic field-effect heat transistor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17683v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a groundbreaking demonstration of thermal modulation in a field-effect-controllable semiconductor-superconductor hybrid structure, wherein the heating mechanism is exclusively radiative. The architecture comprises two reservoirs separated by $\sim 1$ mm and interconnected via a completely non-galvanic electrical circuit, enabling the transfer of black-body radiation from the hot to the cold reservoir. Our device utilizes a superconducting Josephson field-effect transistor to achieve magnetic-field-free gate-tunable regulation of heat currents within the circuit. While prior studies have indicated the potential for electrostatic modulation of thermal transport properties, our framework demonstrates a temperature modulation of up to $\sim 45$ mK, exceeding prior findings by more than an order of magnitude. Furthermore, it proves a thermal transimpedance of $\sim 20$ mK/V at a bath temperature of $30$ mK. The development of such systems holds substantial promise for advancing heat management and routing in quantum chips and radiation sensors, as it enables precise nonlocal control of heat flow towards a designated structure, even when the heat source is distant and non-galvanically coupled.</description>

      <title>Modified Langevin noise formalism for multiple quantum emitters in dispersive electromagnetic environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The control of interactions among quantum emitters through nanophotonic structures offers significant potential for quantum technologies. However, a rigorous theoretical description of the interaction of multiple quantum emitters with complex dispersive dielectric objects remains highly challenging. Here we introduce an approach based on the modified Langevin noise formalism that unveils the roles of both the noise polarization currents of the dielectrics and the vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field scattered by the dielectrics. This extends Refs. \cite{miano_quantum_2025}, \cite{miano_spectral_2025} to the general case of an arbitrary number of emitters. The proposed approach allows us to describe the dynamics of the quantum emitters for arbitrary initial quantum states of the electromagnetic environment consisting of two independent bosonic reservoirs, a medium-assisted reservoir and a scattering-assisted reservoir, each characterized by its own spectral density matrix. Understanding how these reservoirs shape emitter dynamics is crucial to understanding light-matter interactions in complex electromagnetic environments and to enhancing intrinsic emitter properties in structured environments.</description>

      <title>Electrical properties of PbS films doped with iodine by chemical bath deposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the results of measurements of bulk current-voltage (I-V) characteristics and local surface I-V characteristics by atomic force microscopy (AFM) of iodine-doped PbS films. It is established that bulk I-V curves of both undoped and iodine-doped PbS films demonstrate a linear (ohmic) U(I) dependence. The tipe of local surface I-V characteristics is ohmic at the concentration range of the dopant 0&lt;[NH4I]&lt;=0.10 M and becomes rectifying at [NH4I]&gt;=0.15 M, which is determined by a decrease in the size and a change in the shape of the film grains, as well as a decrease in the surface roughness of the film. An increase in the iodine content in the PbS(I) films leads to nonlinear dependences of the microscopic characteristics and photoelectric parameters of the PbS(I) films. A sharp decrease in the diffusion coefficient, the beginning of an increase in the charge carrier lifetime, a maximum in voltage sensitivity and specific detectability are observed in the PbS(I) film chemically deposited from a reaction mixture containing [NH4I] = 0.15 M. This indicates that the optimalconcentration of iodine in the film is 2.7 at.%.</description>

      <title>Hydrogenated Aluminum Doped Zinc Oxide as Highly Transparent and Passivating Indium-Free Recombination Junction for TOPCon-Based Bottom Cell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tandem solar cells offer a promising alternative to exceed the efficiency limits of single-junction silicon photovoltaics, yet they require high-performance recombination junctions that are transparent, passivating, and electrically efficient. Indium tin oxide (ITO), which is conventionally used as a recombination junction material, faces challenges related to indium scarcity and sputter-induced damage. This work investigates hydrogenated aluminum-doped zinc oxide (AZO:H) deposited by spatial atomic layer deposition (s-ALD) as a viable indiumfree alternative for TOPCon-based bottom cells. The deposited AZO:H films demonstrate excellent transparency, exceeding 90% in the 380-1200 nm wavelength range. When applied to n-TOPCon surfaces with an AlOx capping layer, the stack achieves an outstanding passivation quality, indicated by implied open-circuit voltage (iVoc) values up to 734 mV after annealing. The AlOx capping layer proved crucial for enhancing thermal stability by preventing hydrogen effusion at higher temperatures. While the contact resistivity was high for the 20 nm thick films tested, the combination of superior optical and passivation properties establishes spatial ALD-deposited AZO:H as a highly promising material for creating efficient and indiumfree recombination junctions in next-generation tandem solar cells.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal Andreev transport through a quantum dot in a magnetic field: Interplay between Kondo, Zeeman, and Cooper-pair correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11434v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the nonlocal magnetotransport through a strongly correlated quantum dot, connected to multiple terminals consisting of two normal and one superconducting (SC) leads. Specifically, we present a comprehensive view on the interplay between the crossed Andreev reflection (CAR), the Kondo effect, and the Zeeman splitting at zero temperature in the large SC gap limit. The ground state of this network shows an interesting variety, which varies continuously with the system parameters, such as the coupling strength $\Gamma_S^{}$ between the SC lead and the quantum dot, the Coulomb repulsion $U$, the impurity level $\varepsilon_d^{}$, and the magnetic field $b$. We show, using the many-body optical theorem which is derived from the Fermi-liquid theory, that the nonlocal conductance is determined by the transmission rate of the Cooper pairs $\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{CP}}^{} = \frac{1}{4} \sin^2 \Theta\, \sin^2 \bigl(\delta_{\uparrow}+ \delta_{\downarrow})$ and that of the Bogoliubov particles $\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{BG}}^{}= \frac{1}{2}\sum_{\sigma} \sin^2 \delta_{\sigma}^{}$. Here, $\delta_\sigma^{}$ is the phase shift of the renormalized Bogoliubov particles, and $\Theta \equiv \cot^{-1} (\xi_d^{}/ \Gamma_S^{})$ is the Bogoliubov-rotation angle in the Nambu pseudo spin space, with $\xi_d^{} =\varepsilon_d^{}+U/2$. It is also demonstrated, using Wilson's numerical renormalization group approach, that the CAR is enhanced in the crossover region between the Kondo regime and the SC-proximity-dominated regime at zero magnetic field. The magnetic fields induce another crossover between the Zeeman-dominated regime and the SC-dominated regime. We find that the CAR is enhanced and becomes less sensitive to magnetic fields in the SC-dominated regime close to the crossover region spreading over the angular range of $\pi/4 \lesssim \Theta \lesssim 3\pi/4$.</description>

      <title>Double-quantum-dot Andreev molecules: Phase diagrams and critical evaluation of effective models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20043v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work systematically investigates the phase diagram of a parallel double-quantum-dot Andreev molecule, where the two quantum dots are coupled to a common superconducting lead. Using the numerical renormalization group method, we map out the evolution of the ground state across a wide parameter space of level detunings, size of the superconducting gap, lead couplings, and inter-dot coupling strength. The intricate phase diagrams feature singlet, doublet, and a relatively uncommon triplet ground states, with the latter being a distinct signature of strong lead-mediated interactions between the quantum dots. We benchmark the applicability of simplified effective models, including the atomic limit and zero-bandwidth approximations, in capturing the complex behavior of this parallel configuration. Our analysis reveals severe limitations of these models, underscoring the necessity for maximal caution when extrapolating beyond their tested validity. In particular, all effective models except for the extended version of the zero-bandwidth approximation failed in reproducing the triplet ground state and made several false predictions. These findings provide crucial insights for interpreting experimental observations and designing superconducting devices based on quantum-dot architectures.</description>

      <title>On the difference between thermalization in open and isolated quantum systems: a case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11932v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thermalization of isolated and open quantum systems has been studied extensively. However, being the subject of investigation by different scientific communities and being analysed using different mathematical tools, the connection between the isolated (IQS) and open (OQS) approaches to thermalization has remained opaque. Here we demonstrate that the fundamental difference between the two paradigms is the order in which the long time and the thermodynamic limits are taken. This difference implies that they describe physics on widely different time and length scales. Our analysis is carried out numerically for the case of a double quantum dot (DQD) coupled to a fermionic lead, also known as the interacting resonant level model in quantum impurity physics. We show how both OQS and IQS thermalization can be explored in this model on equal footing, allowing a fair comparison between the two. We find that while the quadratically coupled (free) DQD experiences no isolated thermalization, it of course does experience open thermalization. For the non-linearly interacting DQD coupled to a fermionic lead, the many-body interaction in the DQD breaks the integrability of the whole system. We find that this system shows strong evidence of both OQS and IQS thermalization in the same dynamics, but at widely different time scales, consistent with reversing the order of the long time and the thermodynamic limits.</description>

      <title>Universal Reconstruction of Complex Magnetic Profiles with Minimum Prior Assumptions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18882v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding intricate magnetic structures in materials is essential for advancing materials science, spintronics, and geology. Recent developments of quantum-enabled magnetometers, such as nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond, have enabled direct imaging of magnetic field distributions across a wide range of magnetic profiles. However, reconstructing the magnetization from an experimentally measured magnetic field map is a complex inverse problem, further complicated by measurement noise, finite spatial resolution, and variations in sample-to-sensor distance. In this work, we present a novel and efficient GPU-accelerated method for reconstructing spatially varying magnetization density from measured magnetic fields with minimal prior assumptions. We validate our method by simulating diverse magnetic structures under realistic experimental conditions, including multi-domain ferromagnetism and magnetic spin textures such as skyrmion, anti-skyrmion, and meron. Experimentally, we reconstruct the magnetization of a micrometer-scale Apollo lunar mare basalt (sample 10003,184) and a nanometer-scale twisted double-trilayer CrI3. The basalt exhibits soft ferromagnetic domains consistent with previous paleomagnetic studies, whereas the CrI3 system reveals a well-defined hexagonal magnetic Moire superlattice. Our approach provides a versatile and universal tool for investigating complex magnetization profiles, paving the way for future quantum sensing experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02429v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-Abelian gauge symmetries are cornerstones of modern theoretical physics, underlying fundamental interactions and the geometric structure of quantum mechanics. However, their potential to control quantum coherence, entangle- ment, and transport in engineered quantum systems remains to a large extent unexplored. In this work, we propose utilizing non-Abelian Thouless pumping to realize one-dimensional discrete-time quantum walks on topological lattices char- acterized by degenerate flat bands. Through carefully designed pumping cycles, we implement different classes of holonomic coin and shift operators. This frame- work allows for the construction of quantum walks that encode the topological and geometric properties of the underlying system. Remarkably, the resulting evolution exhibits parity symmetry breaking and gives rise to a dynamical pro- cess governed by a Weyl-like equation, highlighting the deep connection between parity and time-reversal symmetry breaking in the system.</description>

Abstract: We study the quasiparticle spectrum of a hybrid system, comprising a correlated (Anderson-type) quantum dot coupled to a topological superconducting nanowire hosting the Majorana boundarymodes. From the exact solution of the low-energy effective Hamiltonian, we uncover a subtle interplay between Coulomb repulsion and the Majorana mode. Our analytical expressions show that the spectral weight of the leaking Majorana mode is sensitive to both the quantum dot energy level and the repulsive potential. We compare our results with estimations by L.S. Ricco et al. Phys. Rev. B 99, 155159 (2019) obtained for the same hybrid structure using the Hubbard-type decoupling scheme, and analytically quantify the spectral weight of the zero-energy (topological) mode coexisting with the finite-energy (trivial) states of the quantum dot. We also show that empirical verification of these spectral weights could be feasible through spin-polarized Andreev spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Majorana edge modes in one-dimensional Kitaev chain with staggered $p$-wave superconducting pairing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07436v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new type of one-dimensional Kitaev chain with staggered $p$-wave superconducting pairing. We find three physical regimes in this model by tuning the $p$-wave pairing and the chemical potential of the system. In the topologically nontrivial phase, there are two Majorana zero modes localized at the opposite ends of the lattice, which are characterized and protected by nonzero topological invariants. More interestingly, we also find a regime where the system can hold four unprotected nonzero-energy edge modes in the trivial phase, which is analogous to a weak topological phase. The third regime is also trivial but holds no edge modes. The emergence of zero- and nonzero-energy edge modes in the system are analyzed by transforming the lattice model into a ladder consisting of Majorana fermions, where the competition between the intra- and inter-leg couplings leads to different phases. We further investigate the properties of edge modes under the influences of dissipation, which is represented by introducing a imaginary part in the chemical potential. Our work unveils the exotic properties induced by the staggered $p$-wave pairing and provides a new platform for further exploration of Majorana edge modes.</description>

Abstract: The interplay between band topology and material nonlinearity gives rise to a variety of novel phenomena, such as topological solitons and nonlinearity-induced topological phase transitions. However, most previous studies fall within the Hermitian regime, leaving the impact of nonlinearity on non-Hermitian topology seldom explored. Here, we investigate the effects of nonlinearity on the non-Hermitian skin effect, a well-known non-Hermitian phenomenon induced by the point-gap topology unique to non-Hermitian systems. Interestingly, we discover a nonlinearity-induced point-gap topological phase transition accompanied by a reversal of the skin mode localization, which is distinct from previous nonlinearity-induced line-gap topological phases. This phenomenon is experimentally demonstrated in a nonlinear microwave metamaterial, where electromagnetic waves are localized around one end of the sample under a low-intensity pump, whereas at a high-intensity pump, the waves are localized around the other end. Our results open a new route towards nonlinear topological physics in non-Hermitian systems and are promising for reconfigurable topological wave manipulation.</description>

      <title>Magnon Correlation Enables Spin Injection, Dephasing, and Transport in Canted Antiferromagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09465v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thermal and electrical injection and transport of magnon spins in magnetic insulators is conventionally understood by the non-equilibrium population of magnons. However, this view is challenged by several recent experiments in noncollinear antiferromagnets, which urge a thorough theoretical investigation at the fundamental level. We find that the magnon spin in antiferromagnets is described by a matrix, so even when the diagonal terms -- spins carried by population -- vanish, the off-diagonal correlations transmit magnon spins. Our quantum theory shows that a net spin-flip of electrons in adjacent conductors creates quantum coherence between magnon states, which transports magnon spins in canted antiferromagnets, even without a definite phase difference between magnon modes in the incoherent process. It reveals that the pumped magnon correlation is not conserved due to an intrinsic spin torque, which causes dephasing and strong spatial spin oscillations during transport; both are enhanced by magnetic fields. Spin transfer to proximity conductors can cause extrinsic dephasing, which suppresses spin oscillations and thereby gates spin transport.</description>

      <title>Higher-order Topological States in Chiral Split Magnons of Honeycomb Altermagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22996v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically explore higher-order topological magnons in collinear altermagnets, encompassing a dimensional hierarchy ranging from localized corner modes to propagating hinge excitations. By employing antiferromagnetic interlayer coupling in bosonic Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) Hamiltonian, our work reveals anisotropic surface states and spatially distributed hinge modes propagating along facet intersections. We track the adiabatic evolution of Wannier centers to identify the bulk-polarization with second-order topological magnon insulator (SOTMI), where various magnon spectra demonstrate symmetry-protected band structure beyond conventional topology. Leveraging the stability and propagative properties of hinge modes, these unconventional magnons demonstrate manipulability in atomic-scale modifications of termination. Our study integrate altermagnetism with higher-order topology, which advance magnon-based quantum computing processing energy-efficient integrated architectures and information transfer.</description>

      <title>Non-universal Thermal Hall Responses in Fractional Quantum Hall Droplets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14058v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analytically compute the thermal Hall conductance (THC) of fractional quantum Hall droplets under realistic conditions that go beyond the idealized linear edge theory with conformal symmetry. Specifically, we consider finite-size effects at low temperature, nonzero self-energies of quasiholes, and general edge dispersions. We derive measurable corrections in THC that are consistent with the experimental observables. Although the quantized THC is commonly regarded as a topological invariant that is independent of edge confinement, our results show that this quantization remains robust only for arbitrary edge dispersion in the thermodynamic limit. Furthermore, the THC contributed by Abelian modes can become extremely sensitive to finite-size effects and irregular confining potentials in any realistic experimental system. In contrast, non-Abelian modes show robust THC signatures under perturbations, indicating an intrinsic stability of non-Abelian anyons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15708v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a theoretical study of terahertz radiation-induced transitions between attractive and repulsive Fermi polaron states in monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenides. Going beyond the simple few-particle trion picture, we develop a many-body description that explicitly accounts for correlations with the Fermi sea of resident charge carriers. We calculate the rate of the direct optical conversion process which has a threshold where the terahertz photon energy equals to the Fermi polaron binding energy. This process features a characteristic frequency dependence near the threshold, due to final-state electron-exciton scattering related to the trion correlation with the Fermi sea hole. Furthermore, we demonstrate that intense terahertz pulses can significantly heat the electron gas via Drude absorption enabling an additional, indirect conversion mechanism through collisions between hot electrons and polarons, which exhibits a strong exponential dependence on the electron temperature. Our results reveal the important role of many-body correlations and thermal effects in the terahertz-driven dynamics of excitonic complexes in two-dimensional semiconductors.</description>

      <title>Giant and robust Josephson diode effect in multiband topological nanowires</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05772v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically predict the giant and robust Josephson diode effect in quasi-one-dimensional topological Majorana nanowires in the regime with multiple subbands, which is expected to be relevant for the real experiment. In the multiband regime, the Majorana bound states and conventional Andreev bound states can naturally coexist, and respectively contribute to the fractional and conventional parts in the Josephson effect, with the former/latter having 4$\pi$/2$\pi$-periodicity. We show that the interplay between the two types of bound modes can produce a robust and giant diode effect in the deep topological phase regime. Notably, we unveil a novel spin parity exchange mechanism, occurring only in the multiband regime, which leads to a robust high efficiency plateau of the giant diode effect. This effect is a nontrivial consequence of the balanced Fermi moment shifts of the multiple subbands in tuning the external magnetic field. Our finding highlights the subband engineering as a powerful tool to optimize the Josephson diode effect realistically and provides a new feasible signature to identify topological phase regime in superconducting nanowires.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14216v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Higher-order topological superconductivity typically depends on spin-orbit interaction, and often necessitates well designed sample structures, nodal superconducting pairings or complex magnetic order. In this work, we propose a model that incorporates a Zeeman field, antiferromagnetic order, and $s$-wave superconducting pairing, all without the need for spin-orbit interaction. In a two-dimensional system, we realize a second-order topological superconductor by utilizing a staggered flux, provided that the Zeeman field is oriented perpendicular to the magnetic order moments. In three-dimensional systems, we achieve second- and third-order topological superconductors in theory, through stacking the two-dimensional second-order topological superconductor.</description>

      <title>Atomic relaxation and flat bands in strain-engineered transition metal dichalcogenide bilayer moir\'{e} systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2108.01112v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strain-induced lattice mismatch leads to moir\'{e} patterns in homobilayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). We investigate the structural and electronic properties of such strained moir\'{e} patterns in TMD homobilayers. The moir\'{e} patterns in strained TMDs consist of several stacking domains which are separated by tensile solitons. Relaxation of these systems distributes the strain unevenly in the moir\'{e} superlattice, with the maximum strain energy concentrating at the highest energy stackings. The order parameter distribution shows the formation of aster topological defects at the same sites. In contrast, twisted TMDs host shear solitons at the domain walls, and the order parameter distribution in these systems shows the formation of vortex defects. The strained moir\'{e} systems also show the emergence of several well-separated flat bands at both the valence and conduction band edges, and we observe a significant reduction in the band gap. The flat bands in these strained moir\'{e} superlattices provide platforms for studying the Hubbard model on a triangular lattice as well as the ionic Hubbard model on a honeycomb lattice. Furthermore, we study the localization of the wave functions corresponding to these flat bands. The wave functions localize at different stackings compared to twisted TMDs, and our results are in excellent agreement with spectroscopic experiments.</description>

      <title>Multiphoton Spectroscopy of a Dynamical Axion Insulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.00064v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The unusual magnetoelectric transport present in Weyl semimetals and 3D topological insula- tors can be compactly understood as manifestations of a background axion field, which itself is determined by the microscopic band structure. In the presence of correlations, an additional axion quasiparticle may emerge as the collective excitations on top of the mean background field. Such modes couple nonlinearly to electric and magnetic fields, giving rise to a dynamical magnetoelectric response. However, unambiguous identification of this collective axion mode is challenging due to its inherent nonlinear dynamics. Here, we propose an all-optical protocol that utilizes a pump-probe setup for verifying and characterizing the transient dynamics of axion fields in three-dimensional insulator systems. In particular, we show that nonlinear Raman processes induce dynamical oscillations of the axion field that depend on the geometry of the incident electromagnetic fields. These oscillations manifest in the polarization and magnetization of the material, hence, can be subsequently measured using time-resolved Kerr rotation spectroscopy. Our results open a pathway towards using multi-photon and quantum pair spectroscopies to identify new correlated phases of quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Fluxoid valve effect in full-shell nanowire Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16989v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new type of supercurrent valve based on full-shell nanowires. These hybrid wires consist of a semiconductor core fully wrapped in a thin superconductor shell and subjected to an axial magnetic field. Due to the tubular shape of the shell, the superconductor phase acquires an integer number $n$ of $2\pi$ twists or \textit{fluxoids} that increases in steps with applied flux. By connecting two such hybrid wires, forming a Josephson junction (JJ), a flux-modulated supercurrent develops. If the two superconducting sections of the JJ have different radii $R_1$ and $R_2$, they can develop equal or different fluxoid numbers $n_1,n_2$ depending on the field. If $n_1\neq n_2$ the supercurrent is blocked, while it remains finite for $n_1=n_2$. This gives rise to a fluxoid valve effect controlled by the applied magnetic field or a gate voltage at the junction. We define a fluxoid-valve quality factor that is perfect for cylindrically symmetric systems and decreases as this symmetry is reduced. We further discuss the role of Majorana zero modes at the junction when the full-shell nanowires are in the topological superconducting regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16158v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reversible, all-electric control of symmetry-protected zero-dimensional modes has been a long-standing goal. In buckled honeycomb lattices, a perpendicular field couples to the staggered sublattice potential providing the required handle. We combine scanning tunneling microscopy and tight-binding theory to switch zero-dimensional topological end states reversibly on and off in ultranarrow germanene nanoribbons by tuning the electric field in the tunnel junction. Increasing the field switches off the end modes of topological two-hexagon wide ribbons, while the same field switches on zero-dimensional states in initially trivial three- and four-hexagon wide ribbons. This atomic scale platform realizes a proof-of-principle for a zero-dimensional topological field effect device, opening a path for ultrasmall memory, controllable qubits, and neuromorphic architectures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12776v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report a significant reduction of low-temperature damping losses in tensile-strained, ultrathin Y3Fe5O12 (YIG) films grown by pulsed laser deposition, exhibiting ultralow damping constants and tunable magnetic anisotropy. Comparative broadband FMR measurements show that tensile-strained YIG films on Gd3Sc2Ga3O12 (GSGG) retain low damping even at nanometer thicknesses and cryogenic temperatures (down to 2 K), outperforming relaxed films on Gd3Ga5O12. Based on static magnetometry measurements along with microstructural and compositional analyses, we attribute these enhanced dynamic properties to the suppression of interdiffusion across the YIG/GSGG interface, resulting from enhanced chemical stability and favorable growth kinetics by the presence of Sc. Our findings highlight the importance of chemical and kinetic factors in achieving few-nanometer-thick YIG film with negligible low-temperature damping dissipation and perpendicular magnetic anisotropy for cryogenic spintronic applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13489v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum form of the Poincar\'e recurrence theorem stipulates that a system with a time-independent Hamiltonian and discrete energy levels returns arbitrarily close to its initial state in a finite time. Qubit systems, being highly isolated from their dissipative surroundings, provide a possible experimental testbed for studying this theoretical construct. Here we investigate a $N$-qubit system, weakly coupled to its environment. We present quantitative analytical and numerical results on both the revival probability and time, and demonstrate that the system indeed returns arbitrarily close to its initial state in a time exponential in the number of qubits $N$. The revival times become astronomically large for systems with just a few tens of qubits. Given the lifetimes achievable in present-day superconducting multi-qubit systems, we propose a realistic experimental test of the theory and scaling of Poincar\'e revivals. Our study of quantum recurrence provides new insight into how thermalization emerges in isolated quantum systems.</description>

      <title>General Many-Body Perturbation Framework for Moir\'e Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19764v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Moir\'e superlattices host a rich variety of correlated topological states, including interaction-driven integer and fractional Chern insulators. A common approach to study interacting ground states at integer fillings is the Hartree-Fock mean-field method. However, this method neglects dynamical correlations, which often leads to an overestimation of spontaneous symmetry breaking and fails to provide quantitative descriptions of single-particle excitations. This work introduces a general many-body perturbation framework for moir\'e systems, combining all-band Hartree-Fock calculations with random phase approximation (RPA) correlation energies and $GW$ quasiparticle corrections. We apply this framework to hexagonal boron nitride aligned rhombohedral pentalayer graphene and magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene. We show that incorporating RPA correlation energy and $GW$ self-energy corrections yields phase diagrams and single-particle spectra that quantitatively align with experimental measurements. Our versatile framework provides a systematic beyond-mean-field approach applicable to generic moir\'e systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Squeezing-Induced Algebraic Non-Hermitian Skin Effects and Ultra Spectral Sensitivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10632v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The well-established non-Bloch band theory predicts exponential localization of skin-mode eigenstates in one-dimensional (1D) non-Hermitian systems. Recent studies, however, have uncovered anomalous algebraic localization in higher dimensions. Here, we extend these ideas to Hermitian bosonic quadratic Hamiltonians incorporating quantum squeezing, offering a genuine quantum framework to explore non-Hermitian phenomena without external reservoirs. We construct a two-dimensional (2D) bosonic lattice model with two-mode squeezing and study its spectral properties of bosonic excitation within the Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) formalism. We demonstrate an algebraic non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), characterized by quasi-long-range power-law localization of complex eigenstates. The system shows ultra spectral sensitivity to double infinitesimal on-site and long-range hopping impurities, while remaining insensitive to single impurities. Analytical treatment via the Green's function reveals that this sensitivity originates from the divergence of the nonlocal Green's function associated with the formation of nonlocal bound states between impurities. Our study establishes a framework for realizing novel higher-dimensional non-Hermitian physics in Hermitian bosonic platforms such as superconducting circuits, photonic lattices, and optomechanical arrays, with the demonstrated ultraspectral sensitivity enabling quantum sensing and amplification via bosonic squeezing.</description>

Abstract: Electron Wigner solids (WSs)1-12 provide an ideal system for understanding the competing effects of electron-electron and electron-disorder interactions, a central unsolved problem in condensed matter physics. Progress in this topic has been limited by a lack of single-defect-resolved experimental measurements as well as accurate theoretical tools to enable realistic experiment-theory comparison. Here we overcome these limitations by combining atomically-resolved scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) with quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulation of disordered 2D electron WSs. STM was used to image the electron density ($n_e$) dependent evolution of electron WSs in gate-tunable bilayer MoSe$_2$ devices with varying long-range ($n_\mathrm{LR}$) and short-range ($n_\mathrm{SR}$) disorder densities. These images were compared to QMC simulations using realistic disorder maps extracted from experiment, thus allowing the roles of different disorder types to be disentangled. We identify two distinct physical regimes for disordered electron WSs that depend on the magnitude of $n_\mathrm{SR}$. For $n_\mathrm{SR} \lesssim n_e$ the WS behavior is dominated by long-range disorder and features extensive mixed solid-liquid phases, a new type of re-entrant melting-crystallization, and prominent Friedel oscillations. In contrast, when $n_\mathrm{SR} \gg n_e$ these features are suppressed and a more robust amorphous WS phase emerges that persists to higher $n_e$, highlighting the importance of short-range disorder in this regime. Our work establishes a new framework for studying disordered quantum solids via a combined experimental-theoretical approach.</description>

      <title>Spin Readout in a 22 nm Node Integrated Circuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13674v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Constructing a quantum computer capable of broad and important applications is likely to require millions of addressable physical qubits, posing the challenge of large-scale integration of quantum systems with classical electronics. Fully depleted silicon-on-insulator CMOS technology has been used to develop a range of cryogenic electronic components for the control and readout of different qubit modalities interfaced on separate chips. However, recent measurements of quantum dots on this technology raise the tantalising prospect of realising control electronics and spin qubits on the same manufacturing platform, within a single integrated circuit (IC). Here, we demonstrate single-shot spin readout in addressable quantum dot devices within an IC fabricated using industry-standard 22 nm fully depleted silicon-on-insulator technology. We achieve spin-to-charge conversion via a ramped energy-selective measurement, detected using a radio-frequency single-electron transistor and addressed by on-chip cryogenic electronics. The observation of consistent readout visibilities exceeding 90% and millisecond spin relaxation times in two nominally identical devices within the addressable array supports the reproducibility of the unit cell. The successful observation of spin readout using this CMOS process marks a key step towards realising highly scalable and integrated spin qubits.</description>
