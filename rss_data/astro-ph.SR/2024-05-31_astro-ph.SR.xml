      <title>A New Catalog of 100,000 Variable \emph{TESS} A-F Stars Reveals a Correlation Between $\delta$ Scuti Pulsator Fraction and Stellar Rotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: {\delta} Scuti variables are found at the intersection of the classical instability strip and the main sequence on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. With space-based photometry providing millions of light-curves of A-F type stars, we can now probe the occurrence rate of {\delta} Scuti pulsations in detail. Using 30-min cadence light-curves from NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite's (TESS) first 26 sectors, we identify variability in 103,810 stars within 5-24 cycles per day down to a magnitude of $T=11.25$. We fit the period-luminosity relation of the fundamental radial mode for {\delta} Scuti stars in the Gaia $G$-band, allowing us to distinguish classical pulsators from contaminants for a subset of 39,367 stars. Out of this subset, over 15,918 are found on or above the expected period-luminosity relation. We derive an empirical red edge to the classical instability strip using Gaia photometry. The center where pulsator fraction peaks at 50-70%, combined with the red edge, agree well with previous work in the Kepler field. While many variable sources are found below the period-luminosity relation, over 85% of sources inside of the classical instability strip derived in this work are consistent with being {\delta} Scuti stars. The remaining 15% of variables within the instability strip are likely hybrid or {\gamma} Doradus pulsators. Finally, we discover strong evidence for a correlation between pulsator fraction and spectral line broadening from the Radial Velocity Spectrometer (RVS) aboard the Gaia spacecraft, confirming that rotation has a role in driving pulsations in {\delta} Scuti stars.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Disentangling for Spectroscopic Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A suite of spectroscopic surveys is producing vast sets of stellar spectra with the goal of advancing stellar physics and Galactic evolution by determining their basic physical properties. A substantial fraction of these stars are in binary systems, but almost all large-survey modeling pipelines treat them as single stars. For sets of multi-epoch spectra, spectral disentangling is a powerful technique to recover or constrain the individual components' spectra of a multiple system. So far, this approach has focused on small samples or individual objects, usually with high resolution ($R \gtrsim 10.000$) spectra and many epochs ($\gtrsim 8$). Here, we present a disentangling implementation that accounts for several aspects of few-epoch spectra from large surveys: that vast sample sizes require automatic determination of starting guesses; that some of the most extensive spectroscopic surveys have a resolution of only $\approx 2,000$; that few epochs preclude unique orbit fitting; that one needs effective regularisation of the disentangled solution to ensure resulting spectra are smooth. We describe the implementation of this code and show with simulated spectra how well spectral recovery can work for hot and cool stars at $R \approx 2000$. Moreover, we verify the code on two established binary systems, the ``Unicorn'' and ``Giraffe''. This code can serve to explore new regimes in survey disentangling in search of massive stars with massive dark companions, e.g. the $\gtrsim 200,000$ hot stars of the SDSS-V survey.</description>

      <title>Almost All Carbon/Oxygen White Dwarfs Can Support Double Detonations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Double detonations of sub-Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarfs (WDs) in unstably mass-transferring double WD binaries have become a leading contender to explain most, if not all, Type Ia supernovae. However, past theoretical studies of the explosion process have assumed relatively ad hoc initial conditions for the helium shells in which the double detonations begin. In this work, we construct realistic C/O WDs to use as the starting points for multidimensional double detonation simulations. We supplement these with simplified one-dimensional detonation calculations to gain a physical understanding of the conditions under which shell detonations can propagate successfully. We find that C/O WDs &lt;= 1.0 Msol, which make up the majority of C/O WDs, are born with structures that can support double detonations. More massive C/O WDs require ~1e-3 Msol of accretion before detonations can successfully propagate in their shells, but such accretion may be common in the double WD binaries that host massive WDs. Our findings strongly suggest that if the direct impact accretion stream reaches high enough temperatures and densities during mass transfer from one WD to another, the accreting WD will undergo a double detonation. Furthermore, if the companion is also a C/O WD &lt;= 1.0 Msol, it will undergo its own double detonation when impacted by the ejecta from the first explosion. Exceptions to this outcome may explain the newly discovered class of hypervelocity supernova survivors.</description>

      <title>Three-stage Acceleration of Solar Energetic Particles Detected by Parker Solar Probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) drive powerful shocks and thereby accelerate solar energetic particles (SEPs) as they propagate from the corona into interplanetary space. Here we present the processes of three-stage particle acceleration by a CME-driven shock detected by the in situ spacecraft--Parker Solar Probe (PSP) on 2022 August 27. The onset of SEPs is produced by a fast CME with a speed of 1284 km/s when it propagates to $\sim$2.85 Rs. The second stage of particle acceleration occurs when the fast CME catches up and interacts with a preceding slow one in interplanetary space at $\sim$40 Rs ($\sim$0.19 au). The CME interaction is accompanied by an intense interplanetary type II radio enhancement. Such direct measurement of particle acceleration during interplanetary CME interaction/radio enhancement is rarely recorded in previous studies. The third stage of energetic storm particles is associated with the CME-driven shock passage of the PSP at $\sim$0.38 au. Obviously, harder particle spectra are found in the latter two stages than the first one, which can arise from a stronger shock produced by the CME interaction and the enriched seed particles inside the preceding CME.</description>

      <title>VELOcities of CEpheids (VELOCE) II. Systematic Search for Spectroscopic Binary Cepheids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical Cepheids provide valuable insights into the evolution of stellar multiplicity among intermediate-mass stars. Here, we present a systematic investigation of single-lined spectroscopic binaries (SB1) based on high-precision velocities measured by the VELOcities of CEpheids (VELOCE) project. We detected 76 (29%) SB1 systems among the 258 Milky Way Cepheids in the first VELOCE data release, 32 (43%) of which were not previously known to be SB1 systems. We determined 30 precise and 3 tentative orbital solutions, 18 (53%) of which are reported for the first time. This large set of Cepheid orbits provides a detailed view of the eccentricity e and orbital period Porb distribution among evolved intermediate-mass stars, ranging from e=[0.0, 0.8] and Porb=[240, 9 000] d. Orbital motion on timescales exceeding the 11 yr VELOCE baseline was investigated using a template fitting technique applied to literature data. Particularly interesting objects include a) R Cru, the Cepheid with the shortest orbital period in the Milky Way (240 d), b) ASAS J103158-5814.7, a short-period overtone Cepheid exhibiting time-dependent pulsation amplitudes as well as orbital motion, c) 17 triple systems with outer visual companions, among other interesting objects. Most VELOCE Cepheids (21/23) that exhibit evidence for a companion based on Gaia proper motion anomaly are also spectroscopic binaries, whereas the remaining do not exhibit significant (&gt; 3-sigma) orbital RV variations. Gaia quality flags, notably the Renormalized Unit Weight Error (RUWE), do not allow to reliably identify Cepheid binaries, although statistically the average RUWE of SB1 Cepheids is slightly higher than that of non-SB1 Cepheids. Comparison with Gaia photometric amplitudes in G, Bp, and Rp also does not allow to identify spectroscopic binaries among the full VELOCE sample.</description>

      <title>The First Photometric Analysis of Two Low Mass Ratio Contact Binary Systems In TESS Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low mass-ratio (q) contact binary systems are progenitors of stellar mergers such as blue straggles (BS) or fast-rotating FK Com stars. In this study, we present the first light curve analysis of two newly identified low mass-ratio contact binary systems, TIC 55007847 and TIC 63597006, that are identified from TESS. Both stars are classified as A-subtype contact binaries. We obtained the precise orbit periods for the two objects by using the O-C method, i.e. P=0.6117108 d for TIC 55007847 and P=0.7008995 d for TIC 63597006, respectively, and found an obvious periodic signal in the O-C curve of TIC 63597006. We suggest that the periodic signal comes from a third body. We further use the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method with PHOEBE to derive the photometric solutions for the two binaries. The photometric solution for this object shows that the contribution of the third body is about 6%. Our analysis revealed that TIC 55007847 has an extremely low mass ratio of q=0.08. By calculating the ratio of spin angular momentum to the orbital angular momentum Js/Jo, we found that TIC 55007847 is very close to the instability threshold with Js/Jo = 0.31, indicating that it may merge into a single, fast-rotating star in the future. For TIC 63597006, q=0.14 and Js/Jo=0.15. This object is in a relatively stable evolutionary status at present.</description>

      <title>The backreaction of stellar wobbling on accretion discs of massive protostars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, it has been demonstrated that massive stars see their infant circumstellar medium shaped into a large, irradiated, gravitationally unstable accretion disc during their early formation phase. Such discs constitute the gas reservoir in which nascent high-mass stars gain substantial fraction of their mass by episodic accretion of dense gaseous circumstellar clumps. We aim to evaluate the effects of stellar motion, caused by the disc non-axisymmetric gravitational field, on the disc evolution and its spatial morphology. In particular, we analyze the disc propensity to gravitational instability and fragmentation, and also disc appearance on synthetic millimeter-band images pertinent to the alma facility. We employed three-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamical simulations of the surroundings of a young massive star in the non-inertial spherical coordinate system, adopting the highest spatial resolution to date and including the indirect star-disc gravitational potential caused by the asymmetries in the circumstellar disc. The resulting disc were postprocessed with the radiation transfer tool RADMC-3D and CASA softwear to obtain disc synthetic images. The redistribution of angular momentum in the system makes the disc smaller and rounder, reduces the number of circumstellar gaseous clumps formed via disc gravitational fragmentation, and prevents the ejection of gaseous clumps from the disc. The synthetic predictive images at millimeter wavelengths of the accretion disc including stellar wobbling are in better agreement with the observations of the surroundings of massive young stellar objects, namely, AFGL 4176 mm1, G17.64+0.16 and G353.273, than our numerical hydrodynamics simulations omitting this physical mechanism. Our work confirms that stellar wobbling is an essential ingredient to account for in numerical simulations of accretion discs of massive protostars.</description>

      <title>Multi-line study of the radial extent of SiO, CS, and SiS in AGB envelopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spatial distribution of molecules in AGB circumstellar envelopes is regulated by different processes. In the outer layers all molecules are destroyed due to the interaction with interstellar ultraviolet photons. Here we aim to characterize in a coherent and uniform way the radial extent of three molecules (SiO, CS, and SiS) in envelopes around AGB stars of O- and C-rich character, and to study their dependence with mass loss rate. To that purpose, we used the Yebes 40m and IRAM 30m telescopes to observe 7 M-type and 7 C-type AGB envelopes covering a wide range of mass loss rates (1e-7 - 1e-5 Msun/yr) in lines of SiO, CS, and SiS spanning a range of upper level energies of 2-130 K. We carried out excitation and radiative transfer calculations over a wide parameter space to characterize the molecular abundance and radial extent. A chi2 analysis indicates that the abundance is well constrained while the radial extent is more difficult to constrain. The radial extent increases with increasing envelope density, in agreement with previous observational findings. At high envelope densities, Mdot/vexp &gt; 1e-6 (Msun/yr)/(km/s), the radial extent of SiO, CS, and SiS are similar, while at low envelope densities, Mdot/vexp &lt; 1e-7 (Msun/yr)/(km/s), the radial extent differ among the three molecules, in agreement with theoretical expectations based on destruction due to photodissociation. At low envelope densities we find a sequence of increasing radial extent, SiS -&gt; CS -&gt; SiO. We also find a tentative dependence of the radial extent with the chemical type (O- or C-rich) of the star for SiO and CS. Interferometric observations and further investigation of the photodissociation of SiO, CS, and SiS should allow to clarify the situation on the relative photodissociation radius of SiO, CS, and SiS in AGB envelopes and the dependence with envelope density and C/O ratio.</description>

      <title>Mass Cycle and Dynamics of a Virtual Quiescent Prominence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mass cycle of solar prominences or filaments is still not completely understood. Researchers agree that these dense structures form by coronal in-situ condensations and plasma siphoning from the underlying chromosphere. In the evaporation-condensation model siphoning arises due to evaporation of chromospheric plasma from localised footpoint heating but this is challenging to justify observationally. Here, we simulate the reconnection-condensation model at extreme-resolutions down to 20.8 km within a three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic coronal volume. We form a draining, quiescent prominence and associated coronal rain simultaneously. We show that thermal instability --acting as a trigger for local condensation formation-- by itself drives siphoning flows from the low-corona without the need of any localised heating. In addition, for the first time we demonstrate through a statistical analysis along more than 1000 magnetic field lines that cold condensations give rise to siphoning flows within magnetic threads. This siphoning arises from the strong pressure gradient along field lines induced by thermal instability. No correlation is found between siphoning flows and the prominence mass, making thermal instability the main in-situ mass collection mechanism. Our simulated prominence drains by gliding along strongly sheared, asymmetric, dipped magnetic arcades, and develops natural vertical fine-structure in an otherwise horizontal magnetic field due to the magnetic Rayleigh-Taylor instability. By synthesising our data, our model shows remarkable agreement with observations of quiescent prominences such as its dark coronal cavity in extreme-ultraviolet emission channels, fine-scale vertical structure and reconnection outflows which, for the first time, have been self-consistently obtained as the prominence evolves.</description>

      <title>Detection of extragalactic magnetic massive stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studies of the magnetic characteristics of massive stars have recently received significant attention because they are progenitors of highly magnetised compact objects. Stars initially more massive than about 8M_sun leave behind neutron stars and black holes by the end of their evolution. The merging of binary compact remnant systems produces astrophysical transients detectable by gravitational wave observatories. Studies of magnetic fields in massive stars with low metallicities are of particular interest because they provide important information on the role of magnetic fields in the star formation of the early Universe. While several detections of massive Galactic magnetic stars have been reported in the last few decades, the impact of a low-metallicity environment on the occurrence and strength of stellar magnetic fields has not yet been explored. Because of the similarity between Of?p stars in the Magellanic Clouds (MCs) and Galactic magnetic Of?p stars, which possess globally organised magnetic fields, we searched for magnetic fields in Of?p stars in the MCs. Additionally, we observed the massive contact binary Cl* NGC 346 SSN7 in the Small Magellanic Cloud to test the theoretical scenario that the origin of magnetic fields involves a merger event or a common envelope evolution. We obtained and analysed measurements of the magnetic field in four massive Of?p stars in the MCs and the binary Cl* NGC 346 SSN7 using the ESO/VLT FORS2 spectrograph in spectropolarimetric mode. We detected kilogauss-scale magnetic fields in two Of?p-type stars and in the contact binary Cl* NGC 346 SSN7. These results suggest that the impact of low metallicity on the occurrence and strength of magnetic fields in massive stars is low. However, because the explored stellar sample is very small, additional observations of massive stars in the MCs are necessary.</description>

      <title>Unveiling complex magnetic field configurations in red giant stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent measurements of magnetic field strength inside the radiative interior of red giant stars open the way towards the characterization of the geometry of stable large-scale magnetic fields. However, current measurements do not properly constrain the topology of magnetic fields due to degeneracies on the observed magnetic field signature on such $\ell=1$ mode frequencies. Efforts focused towards unambiguous detections of magnetic field configurations are now key to better understand angular momentum transport in stars. We investigate the detectability of complex magnetic field topologies inside the radiative interior of red giants. We focus on a field composed of a combination of a dipole and a quadrupole (quadrudipole), and on an offset field. We explore the potential of probing such magnetic field topologies from a combined measurement of magnetic signatures on $\ell=1$ and quadrupolar ($\ell=2$) mixed mode oscillation frequencies. We first derive the asymptotic theoretical formalism for computing the asymmetric signature in frequency pattern for $\ell=2$ modes due to a quadrudipole magnetic field. The degeneracy of the quadrudipole with a dipole is lifted when considering both $\ell=1$ and $\ell=2$ mode frequencies. In addition to the analytical derivation for the quadrudipole, we present the prospect for complex magnetic field inversions using magnetic sensitivity kernels from standard perturbation analysis for forward modeling. Using this method, we demonstrate that offset fields may be mistaken for weak and centered magnetic fields, resulting in underestimating magnetic field strength in stellar cores. We emphasize the need to characterize $\ell=2$ mixed-mode frequencies, (along with the currently characterized $\ell=1$ mixed modes), to unveil the higher-order components of the geometry of buried magnetic fields, and better constrain angular momentum transport inside stars.</description>

      <title>Filter Design for Estimation of Stellar Metallicity: Insights from Experiments with Gaia XP Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We search for an optimal filter design for the estimation of stellar metallicity, based on synthetic photometry from Gaia XP spectra convolved with a series of filter-transmission curves defined by different central wavelengths and bandwidths. Unlike previous designs based solely on maximizing metallicity sensitivity, we find that the optimal solution provides a balance between the sensitivity and uncertainty of the spectra. With this optimal filter design, the best precision of metallicity estimates for relatively bright ($G \sim 11.5$) stars is excellent, $\sigma_{\rm [Fe/H]} = 0.034$\,dex for FGK dwarf stars, superior to that obtained utilizing custom sensitivity-optimized filters (e.g., SkyMapper\,$v$). By selecting hundreds of high-probabability member stars of the open cluster M67, our analysis reveals that the intrinsic photometric-metallicity scatter of these cluster members is only 0.036\,dex, consistent with this level of precision. Our results clearly demonstrate that the internal precision of photometric-metallicity estimates can be extremely high, even providing the opportunity to perform chemical tagging for very large numbers of field stars in the Milky Way. This experiment shows that it is crucial to take into account uncertainty alongside the sensitivity when designing filters for measuring the stellar metallicity and other parameters.</description>

      <title>WIYN Open Cluster Study. XC. Barium Surface Abundances of Blue Straggler Stars in the Open Clusters NGC 7789 and M67</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate barium (Ba) abundances in blue straggler stars (BSSs) in two open clusters, NGC 7789 (1.6 Gyr) and M67 (4 Gyr), as signatures of asymptotic-giant-branch (AGB) mass transfer. We combine our findings with previous Ba abundance analyses in NGC 6819 (2.5 Gyr) and NGC 188 (7 Gyr). Out of 35 BSSs studied in NGC 7789, NGC 6819, and M67, 15 (43$\pm$11%) are Ba-enriched; no BSSs in NGC 188 are Ba-enriched. The Ba abundances of enriched BSSs show an anticorrelation with cluster age, ranging from an enrichment of [Ba/Fe]$\sim$+1.5 dex in NGC 7789 to [Ba/Fe]$\sim$+1.0 dex in M67. The Ba-enriched BSSs all lie in the same region of the HR diagram, irrespective of cluster age or distance from the main-sequence turnoff. Our data suggest a link between AGB donor mass and mass-transfer efficiency in BSSs, in that less massive AGB donors tend to undergo more conservative mass transfer. We find that 40$\pm$16% of the Ba-enriched BSSs are in longer-period spectroscopic binaries with orbital periods less than 5000 days. Those Ba-enriched BSSs that do not exhibit radial-velocity variability suggest AGB mass-transfer in wide binaries by either wind mass transfer or wind Roche-lobe overflow. Given the preponderance of long orbital periods in the BSSs of M67 and NGC 188 and the frequency of Ba enrichment in NGC 7789, NGC 6819, and M67, it may be that AGB mass transfer is the dominant mechanism of BSS formation in open clusters older than 1 Gyr.</description>

      <title>An Expanding Accretion Disk and a Warm Disk Wind As Seen In the Spectral Evolution of HBC 722</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of the post-outburst evolution of the FU Ori object HBC 722 in optical/near-infrared (NIR) photometry and spectroscopy. Using a modified viscous accretion disk model, we fit the outburst epoch SED to determine the physical parameters of the disk, including $\dot{M}_\mathrm{acc} = 10^{-4.0} \ M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, $R_\mathrm{inner} = 3.65 \ R_\odot$, $i = 79^\circ$, and a maximum disk temperature of $T_\mathrm{max} = 5700$ K. We then use a decade of optical/NIR spectra to demonstrate a changing accretion rate drives the visible-range photometric variation, while the NIR shows the outer radius of the active accretion disk expands outward as the outburst progresses. We also identify the major components of the disk system: a plane-parallel disk atmosphere in Keplerian rotation and a 2-part warm disk wind that is collimated near the star and wide-angle at larger radii. The wind is traced by classic wind lines, and appears as a narrow, low-velocity, deep absorption component in several atomic lines spanning the visible spectrum and in the CO 2.29$\mu$m band. We compare the wind lines to those computed from wind models for other FU Ori systems and rapidly accreting young stellar disks and find a 4000-6000 K wind can explain the observed line profiles. Fitting the progenitor spectrum, we find $M_* = 0.2 \ M_\odot$ and $\dot{M}_\mathrm{progenitor} = 7.8 \times 10^{-8} \ M_\odot \ \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$. Finally, we discuss HBC 722 relative to V960 Mon, another FU Ori object we have previously studied in detail.</description>

      <title>Supernova axions convert to gamma-rays in magnetic fields of progenitor stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has long been established that axions could have been produced through the Primakoff process within the nascent proto-neutron-star formed following the type II supernova SN1987A, escaped the star due to their weak interactions, and then converted to gamma-rays in the Galactic magnetic fields; the non-observation of a gamma-ray flash coincident with the neutrino burst leads to strong constraints on the axion-photon coupling for axion masses $m_a \lesssim 10^{-10}$ eV. In this work we use SN1987A to constrain, for the first time, higher mass axions, all the way to $m_a \sim 10^{-3}$ eV, by accounting for axion-photon conversion on the still-intact magnetic fields of the progenitor star. Moreover, we show that gamma-ray observations of the next Galactic supernova, leveraging the magnetic fields of the progenitor star, could detect quantum chromodynamics axions for masses above roughly $50$ $\mu$eV, depending on the supernova. We propose a new full-sky gamma-ray satellite constellation that we call the GALactic AXion Instrument for Supernova (GALAXIS) to search for such future signals along with related signals from extragalactic neutron star mergers.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the Fractional Relativistic Polytropic Gas Sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many stellar configurations, including white dwarfs, neutron stars, black holes, supermassive stars, and star clusters, rely on relativistic effects. The Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equation of the polytropic gas sphere is ultimately a hydrostatic equilibrium equation developed from the general relativity framework. In the modified Rieman Liouville (mRL) frame, we formulate the fractional TOV (FTOV) equations and introduce an analytical solution. Using power series expansions to solve the fractional TOV equations yields a limited physical range to the convergent power series solution. Therefore, the two techniques of Euler-Abel transformation and Pade approximation have been combined to improve the convergence of the obtained series solutions. For all possible values of the relativistic parameters (\sigma), we calculated twenty fractional gas models for the polytropic indexes n=0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2. Investigating the impacts of fractional and relativistic parameters on the models revealed fascinating phenomena; the two effects for n=0.5 are that the sphere's volume and mass decrease with increasing \sigma and the fractional parameter (\alpha). For n=1, the volume decreases when \sigma=0.1 and then increases when \sigma=0.2 and 0.3. The volume of the sphere reduces as both \sigma and \alpha increase for n=1.5 and n=2. We calculated the maximum mass and the corresponding minimum radius of the white dwarfs modeled with polytropic index n=3 and several fractional and relativistic parameter values. We obtained a mass limit for the white dwarfs somewhat near the Chandrasekhar limit for the integer models with small relativistic parameters (\alpha=1, \sigma=0.001). The situation is altered by lowering the fractional parameter; the mass limit increases to Mlimit=1.63348 M at \alpha=0.95 and \sigma=0.001.</description>

      <title>On Kinematic Measurements of Self-Gravity in Protoplanetary Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using controlled injection and recovery experiments, we devised an analysis prescription to assess the quality of dynamical measurements of protoplanetary disk gas masses based on resolved (CO) spectral line data, given observational limitations (resolution, sampling, noise), measurement bias, and ambiguities in the geometry and physical conditions. With sufficient data quality, this approach performed well for massive disks ($M_{\rm d}/M_\ast=0.1$): we inferred $M_{\rm d}$ posteriors that recovered the true values with little bias ($\lesssim$ 20%) and uncertainties within a factor of two (2$\sigma$). The gas surface density profiles for such cases are recovered with remarkable fidelity. Some experimentation indicates that this approach becomes insensitive when $M_{\rm d}/M_\ast\lesssim5$%, due primarily to degeneracies in the surface density profile parameters. Including multiple lines that probe different vertical layers, along with some improvements in the associated tools, might push that practical boundary down by another factor of $\sim$two in ideal scenarios. We also demonstrated this analysis approach using archival ALMA observations of the MWC 480 disk (\"Oberg et al. 2021): we measured $M_{\rm d}=0.13^{\: +0.04}_{\: -0.01} \: M_\odot$ (corresponding to $M_{\rm d}/M_\ast=7\pm1$%) and identified kinematic substructures consistent with surface density gaps around 65 and 135 au. Overall, this (and similar work) suggests that these dynamical measurements offer powerful new constraints with sufficient accuracy and precision to quantify gas masses and surface densities at the high end of the $M_{\rm d}/M_\ast$ distribution, and therefore can serve as key benchmarks for detailed thermo-chemical modeling. We address some prospects for improvements, and discuss various caveats and limitations to guide future work.</description>

      <title>SMA 200-400 GHz Survey for Dust Properties in the Icy Class II Disks in the Taurus Molecular Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new SMA survey of 47 Class II sources in the Taurus-Auriga region. Our observations made 12 independent samples of flux densities over the 200-400 GHz frequency range. We tightly constrained the spectral indices of most sources to a narrow range of $2.0\pm0.2$; only a handful of spatially resolved (e.g., diameter $&gt;$250 au) disks present larger spectral indices. The simplest interpretation for this result is that the (sub)millimeter luminosities of all of the observed target sources are dominated by very optically thick (e.g., $\tau\gtrsim$5) dust thermal emission. Some previous works that were based on the optically thin assumption thus might have underestimated optical depths by at least one order of magnitude. Assuming DSHARP dust opacities, this corresponds to underestimates of dust masses by a similar factor. Moreover, some population synthesis models show that to explain the observed, narrowly distributed spectral indices, the disks in our selected sample need to have very similar dust temperatures ($T_{\small{dust}}$). Given a specific assumption of median $T_{\small{dust}}$, the maximum grain sizes ($a_{\small{max}}$) can also be constrained, which is a few times smaller than 0.1 mm for $T_{\small{dust}}\sim$100 K and a few mm for $T_{\small{dust}}\sim$24 K. The results may indicate that dust grain growth outside the water snowline is limited by the bouncing/fragmentation barriers. In the Class II disks, the dust mass budget outside of the water snowline may be largely retained instead of being mostly consumed by planet formation. While Class II disks still possess sufficient dust masses to feed planet formation at a later time, it is unknown whether or not dust coagulation and planet formation can be efficient or natural outside of the water snowline.</description>

      <title>The HST Large Programme on omega Centauri -- VI. The radial gradient of the stellar populations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we present the analysis of Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations of the globular cluster Omega Centauri. Our analysis combines data obtained in this work with previously published HST data from an earlier article of this series and encompasses a broad portion of the cluster's radial extension. Our findings reveal a significant radial variation in the fraction of stars within the two most populous stellar populations showing that one of the main second-population groups (referred to as bMS) is more centrally concentrated than the first-population group (referred to as rMS). Additionally, we explore the spatial variations of the other less populous stellar populations (referred to as MSa and MSd) and find a qualitatively similar, but weaker, radial decrease in the fraction of stars in these populations at larger distances from the cluster centre. Only one of the populations identified (MSe) does not show any significant radial variation.</description>

      <title>Primary and secondary source of energy in the superluminous supernova 2018ibb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the pair-instability origin of superluminous supernova 2018ibb. As the base model, we use a non-rotating stellar model with an initial mass of 250 Msun at about 1/15 solar metallicity. We consider three versions of the model as input for radiative transfer simulations done with the STELLA and ARTIS codes: with 25 Msun of 56Ni, 34 Msun of 56Ni, and a chemically mixed case with 34 Msun of 56Ni. We present light curves and spectra in comparison to the observed data of SN 2018ibb, and conclude that the pair-instability supernova model with 34 Msun of 56Ni explains broad-band light curves reasonably well between -100 and 250 days around the peak. Our synthetic spectra have many similarities with the observed spectra. The luminosity excess in the light curves and the blue-flux excess in the spectra can be explained by an additional energy source, which may be interaction of the SN ejecta with circumstellar matter. We discuss possible mechanisms of the origin of the circumstellar matter being ejected in the decades before the pair-instability explosion.</description>

      <title>The key science drivers for the Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sub-mm and mm wavelengths provide a unique view of the Universe, from the gas and dust that fills and surrounds galaxies to the chromosphere of our own Sun. Current single-dish facilities have presented a tantalising view of the brightest (sub-)mm sources, and interferometers have provided the exquisite resolution necessary to analyse the details in small fields, but there are still many open questions that cannot be answered with current facilities: Where are all the baryons? How do structures interact with their environments? What does the time-varying (sub-)mm sky look like? In order to make major advances on these questions and others, what is needed now is a facility capable of rapidly mapping the sky spatially, spectrally, and temporally, which can only be done by a high throughput, single-dish observatory. An extensive design study for this new facility is currently being undertaken. In this paper, we focus on the key science drivers and the requirements they place on the observatory. As a 50m single dish telescope with a 1-2{\deg} field of view, the strength of the Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST) is in science where a large field of view, highly multiplexed instrumentation and sensitivity to faint large-scale structure is important. AtLAST aims to be a sustainable, upgradeable, multipurpose facility that will deliver orders of magnitude increases in sensitivity and mapping speeds over current and planned telescopes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Carbon-Nitrogen-Oxygen (CNO) cycle is fundamental to the process of hydrogen burning in stars, serving as a pivotal mechanism. At its core, the primary reaction involves the radiative capture of a proton by $^{12}$C, crucially influencing the isotopic ratio of $^{12}$C to $^{13}$C observed in celestial bodies, including our Solar System. We have addressed this reaction mechanism by extrapolating to low-energy cross sections and S-factors with the aid of astrophysical R-matrix. Our investigation aims to shed light on its implications for nuclear reaction rates, thus influencing the abundance ratio of $^{12}$C to $^{13}$C in the cosmic environment.</description>

      <title>Impacts of the $^{12}\rm{C}\left({\alpha},{\gamma}\right)^{16}\!\rm{O}$ reaction rate on $^{56}{\rm Ni}$ nucleosynthesis in pair-instability supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.01682v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nuclear reactions are key to our understanding of stellar evolution, particularly the $^{12}\rm{C}\left({\alpha},{\gamma}\right)^{16}\!\rm{O}$ rate, which is known to significantly influence the lower and upper ends of the black hole (BH) mass distribution due to pair-instability supernovae (PISNe). However, these reaction rates have not been sufficiently determined. We use the $\texttt{MESA}$ stellar evolution code to explore the impact of uncertainty in the $^{12}\rm{C}\left({\alpha},{\gamma}\right)^{16}\!\rm{O}$ rate on PISN explosions, focusing on nucleosynthesis and explosion energy by considering the high resolution of the initial mass. Our findings show that the mass of synthesized radioactive nickel ($^{56}{\rm Ni}$) and the explosion energy increase with $^{12}\rm{C}\left({\alpha},{\gamma}\right)^{16}\!\rm{O}$ rate for the same initial mass, except in the high-mass edge region. With a high (about twice the $\texttt{STARLIB}$ standard value) rate, the maximum amount of nickel produced falls below 70 $M_\odot$, while with a low rate (about half of the standard value) it increases up to 83.9 $M_\odot$. These results highlight that carbon "preheating" plays a crucial role in PISNe by determining core concentration when a star initiates expansion. Our results also suggest that the onset of the expansion, which means the end of compression, competes with collapse caused by helium photodisintegration, and the maximum mass that can lead to an explosion depends on the $^{12}\rm{C}\left({\alpha},{\gamma}\right)^{16}\!\rm{O}$ reaction rate.</description>

      <title>Embedded coherent structures from MHD to sub-ion scales in turbulent solar wind at 0.17 au</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.10478v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study intermittent coherent structures in solar wind magnetic turbulence from MHD to kinetic plasma scales using Parker Solar Probe data during its first perihelion (at 0.17 au), when the satellite was in the Alfv\'enic slow wind of 340 km/s. The coherent structures are energetic events localized in time and covering wide range of scales. We detect them using Morlet wavelets. For the first time, we apply a multi-scale analyses in physical space to study these structures. At MHD scales within the inertial range, times scales $\tau \in (1, 10^{2} )$ s, we find (i) current sheets including switchback boundaries and (ii) Alfv\'en vortices. Within these events, there are embedded structures at smaller scales: typically Alfv\'en vortices at ion scales, $\tau \in (0.08, 1)$ s, and a compressible vortices at sub-ion scales, $\tau \in (8,80)$ ms. The number of coherent structures grows toward smaller scales: we observe about $\sim 200$ events during 5 h time interval at MHD scales, $\sim 10^{3}$ events ai ion scales and $\sim 10^{4}$ events at sub-ion scales. In general, there are multiple structures of ion and sub-ion scales embedded within one MHD structure. There are also examples of ion and sub-ion scales structures outside of MHD structures. To quantify the relative importance of different type of structures, we do a statistical comparison of the observed structures with the expectations of models of the current sheets and vortices. This comparison is based on amplitude anisotropy of magnetic fluctuations within the structures. The results show the dominance of Alfv\'en vortices at all scales in contrast to the widespread view of dominance of current sheets. This means that Alfv\'en vortices are important building blocs of solar wind turbulence.</description>

Abstract: We reported a cyclic variation of $O-C$ diagram with a semi-amplitude of 0.0033 days and a period of 1.05 years for the pulsating eclipsing binary HZ Dra. The cyclic variation can be explained by the light travel-time effect via the presence of a close-in third body orbiting around HZ Dra in an elliptical orbit with a maximum semi-major axis of 0.92 au. Based on the W-D code, the contribution of the third light to the total system is determined to be 29 $\%$, which is in agreement with the estimated value. Our light curve modelling indicates an evolving hot and cool spot on the surface of the primary and secondary components, respectively. Their positions are roughly symmetrical to the inner Lagrangian point L1, which could be used to explain the variation in the O$^{'}$Connell effect. Our frequency analysis detects 1 radial p-mode, 7 non-radial p-modes and 1 non-radial g-mode. In addition, a total of 6 multiplets are identified, spaced by the orbital frequency, which can be explained as a tidally split mode caused by the equilibrium tides of the close binary system with a circular orbit. These pulsating features suggest that the primary of HZ Dra is a $\delta$ Scuti star, pulsating in both p- and g-mode and influenced by tidal forces.</description>

      <title>A Contact Binary Mis-Classified as an Ellipsoidal Variable: Complications for Detached Black Hole Searches</title>

Abstract: Identifying sources exhibiting ellipsoidal variability in large photometric surveys is becoming a promising method to search for candidate detached black holes in binaries. This technique aims to exploit the orbital-phase dependent modulation in optical photometry caused by the black hole distorting the shape of the luminous star to constrain the mass ratio of the binary. Without understanding if, or how much, contamination is present in the candidate black hole samples produced by this new technique it is hard to leverage them for black hole discovery. Here, we follow up one of the best candidates identified from Gaia Data Release 3, Gaia DR3 4042390512917208960, with a radial velocity campaign. Combined photometric and radial velocity modelling, along with spectral disentangling, suggests that the true mass ratio (mass of the unseen object divided by the mass of the luminous star) is an order of magnitude smaller than that inferred assuming the modulations arise from ellipsoidal variability. We therefore infer that this system is likely a contact binary, or on the boundary of both stars nearly filling their Roche lobes, however, further observations are required to confidently detect the secondary. We find that the well-known problem of discriminating between ellipsoidal and contact binary light curves results in a larger contamination from contact binaries than previously suggested. Until ellipsoidal variables can be reliably distinguished from contact binaries, samples of black hole candidates selected based on ellipsoidal variability are likely to be highly contaminated by contact binaries or similar systems.</description>

      <title>Gaia22dkvLb: A Microlensing Planet Potentially Accessible to Radial-Velocity Characterization</title>

Abstract: We report discovering an exoplanet from following up a microlensing event alerted by Gaia. The event Gaia22dkv is toward a disk source rather than the traditional bulge microlensing fields. Our primary analysis yields a Jovian planet with M_p = 0.59^{+0.15}_{-0.05} M_J at a projected orbital separation r_perp = 1.4^{+0.8}_{-0.3} AU, and the host is a ~1.1 M_sun turnoff star at ~1.3 kpc. At r'~14, the host is far brighter than any previously discovered microlensing planet host, opening up the opportunity of testing the microlensing model with radial velocity (RV) observations. RV data can be used to measure the planet's orbital period and eccentricity, and they also enable searching for inner planets of the microlensing cold Jupiter, as expected from the ''inner-outer correlation'' inferred from Kepler and RV discoveries. Furthermore, we show that Gaia astrometric microlensing will not only allow precise measurements of its angular Einstein radius theta_E, but also directly measure the microlens parallax vector and unambiguously break a geometric light-curve degeneracy, leading to definitive characterization of the lens system.</description>

      <title>Wide Binaries and Modified Gravity (MOG)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17130v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wide binary stars are used to test the modified gravity called Scalar-Tensor-Vector Gravity or MOG. This theory is based on the additional gravitational degrees of freedom, the scalar field $G=G_N(1+\alpha)$, where $G_N$ is Newton's constant, and the massive (spin-1 graviton) vector field $\phi_\mu$. The wide binaries have separations of 2-30 kAU. The MOG acceleration law, derived from the MOG field equations and equations of motion of a massive test particle for weak gravitational fields, depends on the enhanced gravitational constant $G=G_N(1+\alpha)$ and the effective running mass $\mu$. The magnitude of $\alpha$ depends on the physical length scale or averaging scale $\ell$ of the system. The modified MOG acceleration law for weak gravitational fields predicts that for the solar system and for the wide binary star systems gravitational dynamics follows Newton's law.</description>

      <title>The Population of Massive Stars in AGN Disks</title>

Abstract: Gravitational instability in the outskirts of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) disks lead to disk fragmentation and formation of super-massive (several 10^2Msun) stars with potentially long lifetimes. Alternatively, stars can be captured ex-situ and grow from gas accretion in the AGN disk. However, the number density distribution throughout the disk is limited by thermal feedback as their luminosities provide the dominant heating source. We derive equilibrium stellar surface density profiles under two limiting contexts: in the case where the stellar lifetimes are prolonged due to recycling of hydrogen rich disk gas, only the fraction of gas converted into heat is removed from the disk accretion flow. Alternatively, if stellar composition recycling is inefficient and stars can evolve off the main sequence, the disk accretion rate is quenched towards smaller radii resembling a classical star-burst disk, albeit the effective removal rate depends not only on the stellar lifetime, but also the mass of stellar remnants. For AGNs with central Supermassive Black Hole (SMBH) masses of \sim 10^6 to 10^8Msun accreting at \sim 0.1 Eddington efficiency, we estimate a total number of 10^3 to 10^5 coexisting massive stars and the rate of stellar mergers to be 10^-3 to 1 per year. We motivate the detailed study of interaction between a swarm of massive stars through hydro and N body simulations to provide better prescriptions of dynamical processes in AGN disks, and to constrain more accurate estimates of the stellar population.</description>

      <title>The effects of finite electron inertia on helicity-barrier-mediated turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09380v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the partitioning of turbulent energy between ions and electrons in weakly collisional plasmas is crucial for the accurate interpretation of observations and modelling of various astrophysical phenomena. Many such plasmas are "imbalanced", wherein the large-scale energy input is dominated by Alfv\'enic fluctuations propagating in a single direction. In this paper, we demonstrate that when strongly-magnetised plasma turbulence is imbalanced, nonlinear conservation laws imply the existence of a critical value of the electron plasma beta that separates two dramatically different types of turbulence in parameter space. For betas below the critical value, the free energy injected on the largest scales is able to undergo a familiar Kolmogorov-type cascade to small scales where it is dissipated, heating electrons. For betas above the critical value, the system forms a "helicity barrier" that prevents the cascade from proceeding past the ion Larmor radius, causing the majority of the injected free energy to be deposited into ion heating. Physically, the helicity barrier results from the inability of the system to adjust to the disparity between the perpendicular-wavenumber scalings of the free energy and generalised helicity below the ion Larmor radius; restoring finite electron inertia can annul, or even reverse, this disparity, giving rise to the aforementioned critical beta. We relate this physics to the "dynamic phase alignment" mechanism, and characterise various other important features of the helicity barrier, including the nature of the nonlinear wavenumber-space fluxes, dissipation rates, and energy spectra. The existence of such a critical beta has important implications for heating, as it suggests that the dominant recipient of the turbulent energy -- ions or electrons -- can depend sensitively on the characteristics of the plasma at large scales.</description>

      <title>Magnetized compressible turbulence with a fluctuation dynamo and Reynolds numbers over a million</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16626v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Supersonic magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence is a ubiquitous state for many astrophysical plasmas. However, even the basic statistics for this type of turbulence remains uncertain. We present results from supersonic MHD turbulence simulations at unparalleled resolutions, with plasma Reynolds numbers of over a million. In the kinetic energy spectrum we find a break between the scales that are dominated by kinetic energy, with spectral index $-2$, and those that become strongly magnetized, with spectral index $-3/2$. By analyzing the Helmholtz decomposed kinetic energy spectrum, we find that the compressible modes are not passively mixed through the cascade of the incompressible modes. At high magnetic Reynolds number, above $10^5$, we find a power law in the magnetic energy spectrum with spectral index $-9/5$. On the strongly magnetized, subsonic scales the plasma tends to self-organize into locally relaxed regions, where there is strong alignment between the current density, magnetic field, velocity field and vorticity field, depleting both the nonlinearities and magnetic terms in the MHD equations, which we attribute to plasma relaxation on scales where the magnetic fluctuations evolve on shorter timescales than the velocity fluctuations. This process constrains the cascade to inhomogenous, volume-poor, fractal surfaces between relaxed regions, which has significant repercussions for understanding the nature of magnetized turbulence in astrophysical plasmas and the saturation of the fluctuation dynamo.</description>
