      <title>Dissipativity-Based Distributed Control and Communication Topology Co-Design for Voltage Regulation and Current Sharing in DC Microgrids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel dissipativity-based distributed droop-free control approach for voltage regulation and current sharing in DC microgrids (MGs) comprised of an interconnected set of distributed generators (DGs), loads, and power lines. First, we describe the closed-loop DC MG as a networked system where the DGs and lines (i.e., subsystems) are interconnected via a static interconnection matrix. This interconnection matrix demonstrates how the inputs, outputs, and disturbances of DGs and lines are connected in a DC MG. Each DG has a local controller and a distributed global controller. To design the controller, we use the dissipativity properties of the subsystems and formulate a linear matrix inequality (LMI) problem. To support the feasibility of this problem, we identify a set of necessary local and global conditions that we then enforce in a specifically developed LMI-based controller design process. In contrast to existing DC MG control solutions, our approach proposes a unified framework for co-designing the distributed controller and communication topology. As the co-design process is LMI-based, it can be efficiently implemented and evaluated. The effectiveness of the proposed solution can be verified by simulating an islanded DC MG in a MATLAB/Simulink environment under different scenarios, such as load changes and topological constraint changes, and then comparing the performance with a recent droop control algorithm.</description>

      <title>Lessons learned from field demonstrations of model predictive control and reinforcement learning for residential and commercial HVAC: A review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A large body of simulation research suggests that model predictive control (MPC) and reinforcement learning (RL) for heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) in residential and commercial buildings could reduce energy costs, pollutant emissions, and strain on power grids. Despite this potential, neither MPC nor RL has seen widespread industry adoption. Field demonstrations could accelerate MPC and RL adoption by providing real-world data that support the business case for deployment. This paper reviews 24 field demonstrations of MPC and RL in residential buildings and 80 in commercial buildings. After presenting demographic information -- such as experiment scopes, locations, and durations -- this paper analyzes experiment protocols and their influence on performance estimates. We find that 71% of the reviewed field demonstrations use experiment protocols that may lead to unreliable performance estimates. Over the remaining 29% that we view as reliable, the weighted-average cost savings, weighted by experiment duration, are 16% in residential buildings and 13% in commercial buildings. While these savings are potentially attractive, making the business case for MPC and RL also requires characterizing the costs of deployment, operation, and maintenance. Only 13 of the 104 reviewed papers report these costs or discuss related challenges. Based on these observations, we recommend directions for future field research, including: Improving experiment protocols; reporting deployment, operation, and maintenance costs; designing algorithms and instrumentation to reduce these costs; controlling HVAC equipment alongside other distributed energy resources; and pursuing emerging objectives such as peak shaving, arbitraging wholesale energy prices, and providing power grid reliability services.</description>

      <title>ISC-POMDPs: Partially Observed Markov Decision Processes with Initial-State Dependent Costs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a class of partially observed Markov decision processes (POMDPs) with costs that can depend on both the value and (future) uncertainty associated with the initial state. These Initial-State Cost POMDPs (ISC-POMDPs) enable the specification of objectives relative to a priori unknown initial states, which is useful in applications such as robot navigation, controlled sensing, and active perception, that can involve controlling systems to revisit, remain near, or actively infer their initial states. By developing a recursive Bayesian fixed-point smoother to estimate the initial state that resembles the standard recursive Bayesian filter, we show that ISC-POMDPs can be treated as POMDPs with (potentially) belief-dependent costs. We demonstrate the utility of ISC-POMDPs, including their ability to select controls that resolve (future) uncertainty about (past) initial states, in simulation.</description>

      <title>Optimal and Robust Multivariable Reaching Time Sliding Mode Control Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses two minimum reaching time control problems within the context of finite stable systems. The well-known Variable Structure Control (VSC) and Unity Vector Control (UVC) strategies are analyzed, with the primary objective of designing optimal and robust state feedback gains that ensure minimum finite time convergence to the origin. This is achieved in the presence of convex bounded parameter uncertainty and norm-bounded exogenous disturbances. In both cases, the optimality conditions are expressed through Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs), which are solved efficiently within the framework of multivariable systems using existing numerical tools. The theoretical results are demonstrated with two practically motivated examples.</description>

      <title>Sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics with high accuracy and reliability under noisy conditions for applications to industrial systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) with control and exogenous inputs for highly accurate and reliable prediction and applies the proposed method to the diesel engine airpath systems which are known as a nonlinear complicated industrial system. Although SINDy is known as a powerful approach for the identification of nonlinear systems, some problems remain: there are few examples of application to industrial systems and multi-step predictions are not guaranteed due to noisy data and an increase of basis functions due to the extension of the coordinate such as time-delay embedding. To address the problems, we propose an improved SINDy based on ensemble learning, elite gathering, and classification techniques while keeping convex calculation. In the proposed method, library bagging is performed, and elites with an R-squared greater than 90% are gathered. Then, clustering is performed on the surviving elites because physically motivated basis functions are not always available and the elite models obtained do not always show the same trends. After the classification, discrete model candidates are obtained by taking the mean of each classified elite. Finally, the best model is selected. The simulation results show that the proposed method realizes multi-step prediction for the airpath system which is known as a complicated industrial system under noisy conditions.</description>

      <title>On reconstructing high derivatives of noisy time-series with confidence intervals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconstructing high derivatives of noisy measurements is an important step in many control, identification and diagnosis problems. In this paper, a heuristic is proposed to address this challenging issue. The framework is based on a dictionary of identified models indexed by the bandwidth, the noise level and the required degrees of derivation. Each model in the dictionary is identified via cross-validation using tailored learning data. It is also shown that the proposed approach provides heuristically defined confidence intervals on the resulting estimation. The performance of the framework is compared to the state-of-the-art available algorithms showing noticeably higher accuracy. Although the results are shown for up to the 4-th derivative, higher derivation orders can be used with comparable results.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of 3D Terrestrial and Aerial Spectrum Sharing with Massive MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Connecting aerial and terrestrial users with a single base station (BS) is increasingly challenging due to the rising number of aerial users like unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Traditional BSs, designed with down-tilted beams, focus mainly on ground users, but massive MIMO (mMIMO) systems can significantly enhance coverage in low-altitude airspace. This paper analyzes how a mMIMO BS serves both aerial and terrestrial users in a 3D spectrum-sharing scheme. Using Semi-orthogonal User Selection (SUS) and random scheduling, we assess the spectral efficiency and performance limits of these systems. Results reveal that mMIMO effectively supports more terrestrial users, influenced by channel characteristics and user scheduling strategies, providing key insights for future 3D aerial-terrestrial networks.</description>

      <title>Identification of Minimally Restrictive Assembly Sequences using Supervisory Control Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern assembly processes require flexibility and adaptability to handle increasing product variety and customization. Traditional assembly planning methods often prioritize finding an optimal assembly sequence, overlooking the requirements of contemporary manufacturing. This work uses Supervisory Control Theory to systematically generate all feasible assembly sequences while ensuring compliance with precedence and process constraints. By synthesizing a controllable, non-blocking, and minimally restrictive supervisor, the proposed method guarantees that only valid sequences are allowed, balancing flexibility and constraint enforcement. The obtained sequences can serve as a basis for further optimization or exception management, improving responsiveness to disruptions.</description>

      <title>Environment-Aware Scheduling of URLLC and Sensing Services for Smart Industries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of scheduling sensing and communication functionality in an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) enabled base station (BS) operating in an indoor factory (InF) environment. The BS is performing the task of detecting an AGV while managing downlink transmission of ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) data in a time-sharing manner. Scheduling fixed time slots for both sensing and communication is inefficient for the InF environment, as the instantaneous environmental changes necessitate a higher frequency of sensing operations to accurately detect the AGV. To address this issue, we propose an environment-aware scheduling scheme, in which we first formulate an optimization problem to maximize the probability of detection of AGV while considering the survival time constraint of URLLC data. Subsequently, utilizing the Nash bargaining theory, we propose an adaptive time-sharing scheme that assigns sensing duration in accordance with the environmental clutter density and distributes time to URLLC depending on the incoming traffic rate. Using our own Python-based discrete-event link-level simulator, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed scheme over the baseline scheme in terms of probability of detection and downlink latency.</description>

      <title>Community Energy Management System for Fast Frequency Response: A Hierarchical Control Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increase in renewable energy sources (RES) has reduced power system inertia, making frequency stabilization more challenging and highlighting the need for fast frequency response (FFR) resources. While building energy management systems (BEMS) equipped with distributed energy resources (DERs) can provide FFR, individual BEMS alone cannot fully meet demand. To address this, we propose a community energy management system (CEMS) operational model that minimizes energy costs and generates additional revenue, which is provided FFR through coordinated DERs and building loads under photovoltaic (PV) generation uncertainty. The model incorporates a hierarchical control framework with three levels: Level 1 allocates maximum FFR capacity, Level 2 employs scenario-based stochastic model predictive control (SMPC) to adjust DER operations and ensure FFR provision despite PV uncertainties, and Level 3 performs rapid load adjustments in response to frequency fluctuations detected by a frequency meter. Simulation results on a campus building cluster demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model, achieving a 10\% reduction in energy costs and a 24\% increase in FFR capacity, all while maintaining occupant comfort and enhancing frequency stabilization.</description>

      <title>A Risk-aware Bi-level Bidding Strategy for Virtual Power Plant with Power-to-Hydrogen System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a risk-aware bi-level bidding strategy for Virtual Power Plant (VPP) that integrates Power-to-Hydrogen (P2H) system, addressing the challenges posed by renewable energy variability and market volatility. By incorporating Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) within the bi-level optimization framework, the proposed strategy enables VPPs to mitigate financial risks associated with uncertain market conditions. The upper-level problem seeks to maximize revenue through optimal bidding, while the lower-level problem ensures market-clearing compliance. The integration of the P2H system allows surplus renewable energy to be stored as hydrogen, which is utilized as an energy carrier, thereby increasing market profitability and enhancing resilience against financial risks. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is validated through a modified IEEE 14 bus system, demonstrating that the inclusion of the P2H system and CVaR-based risk aversion enhances both revenue and financial hedging capability under volatile market conditions.This paper underscores the strategic role of hydrogen storage in VPP operations, contributing to supporting improved profitability and the efficacy of a risk-aware bidding strategy.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Decision Making for Enhancing Small-Signal Stability in Hybrid AC/DC Grids Through Converter Control Role Assignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid AC/DC transmission grids incorporate Modular Multilevel Converters functioning as Interconnecting Power Converters (IPCs). The control role assigned to each converter significantly influences grid dynamics. Traditionally, these converters operate with static control roles, but recent studies have proposed scheduling their roles based on day-ahead forecasts to enhance stability performance. However, in systems with high renewable energy penetration, forecast deviations can render scheduled control assignments suboptimal or even lead to instability. To address this challenge, this work proposes an online scheduling recalculation algorithm that dynamically adapts IPC control roles during system operation. The approach leverages a data-driven multi-criteria decision-making framework, integrating surrogate models of conventional small-signal stability analysis tools to enable a fast computation of system stability and stability performance indicators.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Decentralized Stability Certificates for Grid-Forming Converter Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a decentralized framework for guaranteeing the small-signal stability of future power systems with grid-forming converters. Our approach leverages dynamic loop-shifting techniques to compensate for the lack of passivity in the network dynamics and establishes decentralized parametric stability certificates, depending on the local device-level controls and incorporating the effects of the network dynamics. By following practical tuning rules, we are able to ensure plug-and-play operation without centralized coordination. Unlike prior works, our approach accommodates coupled frequency and voltage dynamics, incorporates network dynamics, and does not rely on specific network configurations or operating points, offering a general and scalable solution for the integration of power-electronics-based devices into future power systems. We validate our theoretical stability results through numerical case studies in a high-fidelity simulation model.</description>

      <title>Game Theory in Formula 1: Multi-agent Physical and Strategical Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an optimization framework for Formula 1 racing that integrates multi-agent interactions, aerodynamic wake effects, trajectory optimization, and energy management. By employing game-theoretic methods, we formulate the minimum lap time problem as either a Nash or a Stackelberg game. Exploiting their structural similarities, we compare symmetric and hierarchical strategies to analyze competitive racing dynamics and strategic dominance. Additionally, we introduce an algorithm to refine local Stackelberg solutions. Our findings underscore the importance of jointly optimizing physical interactions, energy management, and trajectory, highlighting their strong interdependence. We examine the impact of slipstreaming on trajectory selection in corners, straights, and high-speed sections, while also identifying optimal overtaking locations based on energy allocation strategies. By incorporating a physically accurate interaction model and accounting for the optimal responses of competing agents, our approach reveals characteristic strategic behaviors observed in real-world racing. The proposed methodology contributes towards realistic Formula 1 race strategy optimizations, with potential applications in motorsport engineering and autonomous racing.</description>

      <title>Generating Building-Level Heat Demand Time Series by Combining Occupancy Simulations and Thermal Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite various efforts, decarbonizing the heating sector remains a significant challenge. To tackle it by smart planning, the availability of highly resolved heating demand data is key. Several existing models provide heating demand only for specific applications. Typically, they either offer time series for a larger area or annual demand data on a building level, but not both simultaneously. Additionally, the diversity in heating demand across different buildings is often not considered. To address these limitations, this paper presents a novel method for generating temporally resolved heat demand time series at the building level using publicly available data. The approach integrates a thermal building model with stochastic occupancy simulations that account for variability in user behavior. As a result, the tool serves as a cost-effective resource for cross-sectoral energy system planning and policy development, particularly with a focus on the heating sector. The obtained data can be used to assess the impact of renovation and retrofitting strategies, or to analyze district heating expansion. To illustrate the potential applications of this approach, we conducted a case study in Puertollano (Spain), where we prepared a dataset of heating demand with hourly resolution for each of 9,298 residential buildings. This data was then used to compare two different pathways for the thermal renovation of these buildings. By relying on publicly available data, this method can be adapted and applied to various European regions, offering broad usability in energy system optimization and analysis of decarbonization strategies.</description>

      <title>Electricity Demand Forecasting in Future Grid States: A Digital Twin-Based Simulation Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Short-term forecasting of residential electricity demand is an important task for utilities. Yet, many small and medium-sized utilities still use simple forecasting approaches such as Synthesized Load Profiles, which treat residential households similarly and neither account for renewable energy installations nor novel large consumers (e.g., heat pumps, electric vehicles). The effectiveness of such "one-fits-all" approaches in future grid states--where decentral generation and sector coupling increases--are questionable. Our study challenges these forecasting practices and investigates whether Machine Learning (ML) approaches are suited to predict electricity demand in today's and in future grid states. We use real smart meter data from 3,511 households in Germany over 34 months. We extrapolate this data with future grid states (i.e., increased decentral generation and storage) based on a digital twin of a local energy system. Our results show that Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) approaches outperform SLPs as well as simple benchmark estimators with up to 68.5% lower Root Mean Squared Error for a day-ahead forecast, especially in future grid states. Nevertheless, all prediction approaches perform worse in future grid states. Our findings therefore reinforce the need (a) for utilities and grid operators to employ ML approaches instead of traditional demand prediction methods in future grid states and (b) to prepare current ML methods for future grid states.</description>

      <title>Safety Verification of Stochastic Systems under Signal Temporal Logic Specifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the verification problem of stochastic systems under signal temporal logic (STL) specifications. We propose a novel approach that enables the verification of the probabilistic satisfaction of STL specifications for nonlinear systems subject to both bounded deterministic disturbances and stochastic disturbances. Our method, referred to as the STL erosion strategy, reduces the probabilistic verification problem into a deterministic verification problem with a tighter STL specification. The degree of tightening is determined by leveraging recent results on bounding the deviation between the stochastic trajectory and the deterministic trajectory. Our approach can be seamlessly integrated with any existing deterministic STL verification algorithm. Numerical experiments are conducted to showcase the efficacy of our method.</description>

      <title>Extended Version: Non-Preemptive Scheduling of Flexible Loads in Smart Grids via Convex Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the scheduling of a large population of non-preemptive flexible electric loads, each of which has a flexible starting time but once started will follow a fixed load shape until completion. We first formulate the scheduling problem as a mixed-integer convex program (MICP), then propose an efficient polynomial time relaxation-adjustment-rounding algorithm for solving the problem. The key novelty of the proposed method lies in its adjustment step, which uses a graph-based algorithm to navigate within the set of optimal points of the convex relaxation while reducing the number of fractional entries in the solution. We establish mathematically that our algorithm yields solutions that are near optimal for a finite number of loads and with its sub-optimality independent of the number of loads. Consequently, the proposed method is asymptotically optimal in a per-load cost sense when the number of loads increases. Despite the gap between the MICP and its convex relaxation, we establish that the solution of the proposed algorithm can be decentralized by marginal prices of the convex relaxation. We also develop and analyze variants of the proposed algorithm for settings with uncertainty and with time-varying realistic load shapes. Finally, we numerically evaluate the proposed algorithm in a case study for the non-preemptive scheduling of electric vehicles charging loads.</description>

      <title>Neural Configuration-Space Barriers for Manipulation Planning and Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Planning and control for high-dimensional robot manipulators in cluttered, dynamic environments require both computational efficiency and robust safety guarantees. Inspired by recent advances in learning configuration-space distance functions (CDFs) as robot body representations, we propose a unified framework for motion planning and control that formulates safety constraints as CDF barriers. A CDF barrier approximates the local free configuration space, substantially reducing the number of collision-checking operations during motion planning. However, learning a CDF barrier with a neural network and relying on online sensor observations introduce uncertainties that must be considered during control synthesis. To address this, we develop a distributionally robust CDF barrier formulation for control that explicitly accounts for modeling errors and sensor noise without assuming a known underlying distribution. Simulations and hardware experiments on a 6-DoF xArm manipulator show that our neural CDF barrier formulation enables efficient planning and robust real-time safe control in cluttered and dynamic environments, relying only on onboard point-cloud observations.</description>

      <title>Security-Aware Sensor Fusion with MATE: the Multi-Agent Trust Estimator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lacking security awareness, sensor fusion in systems with multi-agent networks such as smart cities is vulnerable to attacks. To guard against recent threats, we design security-aware sensor fusion that is based on the estimates of distributions over trust. Trust estimation can be cast as a hidden Markov model, and we solve it by mapping sensor data to trust pseudomeasurements (PSMs) that recursively update trust posteriors in a Bayesian context. Trust then feeds sensor fusion to facilitate trust-weighted updates to situational awareness. Essential to security-awareness are a novel field of view estimator, logic to map sensor data into PSMs, and the derivation of efficient Bayesian updates. We evaluate security-aware fusion under attacks on agents using case studies and Monte Carlo simulation in the physics-based Unreal Engine simulator, CARLA. A mix of novel and classical security-relevant metrics show that our security-aware fusion enables building trustworthy situational awareness even in hostile conditions.</description>

      <title>Design, Dynamic Modeling and Control of a 2-DOF Robotic Wrist Actuated by Twisted and Coiled Actuators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robotic wrists play a pivotal role in the functionality of industrial manipulators and humanoid robots, facilitating manipulation and grasping tasks. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in integrating artificial muscle-driven actuators for robotic wrists, driven by advancements in technology offering high energy density, lightweight construction, and compact designs. However, in the study of robotic wrists driven by artificial muscles, dynamic model-based controllers are often overlooked, despite their critical importance for motion analysis and dynamic control of robots. This paper presents a novel design of a two-degree-of-freedom (2-DOF) robotic wrist driven by twisted and coiled actuators (TCA) utilizing a parallel mechanism with a 3RRRR configuration. The proposed robotic wrist is expected to feature lightweight structures and superior motion performance while mitigating friction issues. The Lagrangian dynamic model of the wrist is established, along with a nonlinear model predictive controller (NMPC) designed for trajectory tracking tasks. A prototype of the robotic wrist is developed, and extensive experiments are conducted to validate its superior motion performance and the proposed dynamic model. Subsequently, extensive comparative experiments between NMPC and PID controller were conducted under various operating conditions. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the dynamic model-based controller in the motion control of TCA-driven robotic wrists.</description>

      <title>Kinodynamic Model Predictive Control for Energy Efficient Locomotion of Legged Robots with Parallel Elasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a kinodynamic model predictive control (MPC) framework that exploits unidirectional parallel springs (UPS) to improve the energy efficiency of dynamic legged robots. The proposed method employs a hierarchical control structure, where the solution of MPC with simplified dynamic models is used to warm-start the kinodynamic MPC, which accounts for nonlinear centroidal dynamics and kinematic constraints. The proposed approach enables energy efficient dynamic hopping on legged robots by using UPS to reduce peak motor torques and energy consumption during stance phases. Simulation results demonstrated a 38.8% reduction in the cost of transport (CoT) for a monoped robot equipped with UPS during high-speed hopping. Additionally, preliminary hardware experiments show a 14.8% reduction in energy consumption. Video: https://youtu.be/AF11qMXJD48</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Propagation and Bayesian Fusion on Unimodular Lie Groups from a Parametric Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03425v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the problem of uncertainty propagation and Bayesian fusion on unimodular Lie groups. Starting from a stochastic differential equation (SDE) defined on Lie groups via Mckean-Gangolli injection, we first convert it to a parametric SDE in exponential coordinates. The coefficient transform method for the conversion is stated for both Ito's and Stratonovich's interpretation of the SDE. Then we derive a mean and covariance fitting formula for probability distributions on Lie groups defined by a concentrated distribution on the exponential coordinate. It is used to derive the mean and covariance propagation equations for the SDE defined by injection, which coincides with the result derived from a Fokker-Planck equation in previous work. We also propose a simple modification to the update step of Kalman filters using the fitting formula, which improves the fusion accuracy with moderate computation time.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Nonlinear Guidance Strategies for Guaranteed Pursuit-Evasion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06176v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the pursuit-evasion problem involving three agents -- a purser, an evader, and a defender. We develop cooperative guidance laws for the evader-defender team that guarantee that the defender intercepts the pursuer before it reaches the vicinity of the evader. Unlike heuristic methods, optimal control, differential game formulation, and recently proposed time-constrained guidance techniques, we propose a geometric solution to safeguard the evader from the pursuer's incoming threat. The proposed strategy is computationally efficient and expected to be scalable as the number of agents increases. Another alluring feature of the proposed strategy is that the evader-defender team does not require the knowledge of the pursuer's strategy and that the pursuer's interception is guaranteed from arbitrary initial engagement geometries. We further show that the necessary error variables for the evader-defender team vanish within a time that can be exactly prescribed prior to the three-body engagement. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed cooperative defense strategy via simulation in diverse engagement scenarios.</description>

      <title>Risk-Aware Autonomous Driving with Linear Temporal Logic Specifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09769v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Humans naturally balance the risks of different concerns while driving, including traffic rule violations, minor accidents, and fatalities. However, achieving the same behavior in autonomous systems remains an open problem. This paper extends a risk metric that has been verified in human-like driving studies to encompass more complex driving scenarios specified by linear temporal logic (LTL) that go beyond just collision risks. This extension incorporates the timing and severity of events into LTL specifications, thereby reflecting a human-like risk awareness. Without sacrificing expressivity for traffic rules, we adopt LTL specifications composed of safety and co-safety formulas, allowing the control synthesis problem to be reformulated as a reachability problem. By leveraging occupation measures, we formulate a linear programming (LP) problem for this LTL-based risk metric. Consequently, the synthesized policy balances different types of risks, including not only collision risks but also traffic rule violations. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated by three typical traffic scenarios in the Carla simulator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18862v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the challenge of safe control in decentralized multi-agent robotic settings, where agents use uncertain black-box models to predict other agents' trajectories. We use the recently proposed conformal decision theory to adapt the restrictiveness of control barrier functions-based safety constraints based on observed prediction errors. We use these constraints to synthesize controllers that balance between the objectives of safety and task accomplishment, despite the prediction errors. We provide an upper bound on the average over time of the value of a monotonic function of the difference between the safety constraint based on the predicted trajectories and the constraint based on the ground truth ones. We validate our theory through experimental results showing the performance of our controllers when navigating a robot in the multi-agent scenes in the Stanford Drone Dataset.</description>

      <title>Scalable control synthesis for stochastic systems via structural IMDP abstractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11803v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel abstraction-based framework for controller synthesis of nonlinear discrete-time stochastic systems. The focus is on probabilistic reach-avoid specifications. The framework is based on abstracting a stochastic system into a new class of robust Markov models, called orthogonally decoupled Interval Markov Decision Processes (odIMDPs). Specifically, an odIMDPs is a class of robust Markov processes, where the transition probabilities between each pair of states are uncertain and have the product form. We show that such a specific form in the transition probabilities allows one to build compositional abstractions of stochastic systems that, for each state, are only required to store the marginal probability bounds of the original system. This leads to improved memory complexity for our approach compared to commonly employed abstraction-based approaches. Furthermore, we show that an optimal control strategy for a odIMDPs can be computed by solving a set of linear problems. When the resulting strategy is mapped back to the original system, it is guaranteed to lead to reduced conservatism compared to existing approaches. To test our theoretical framework, we perform an extensive empirical comparison of our methods against Interval Markov Decision Process- and Markov Decision Process-based approaches on various benchmarks including 7D systems. Our empirical analysis shows that our approach substantially outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of both memory requirements and the conservatism of the results.</description>

      <title>A CAV-based perimeter-free regional traffic control strategy utilizing existing parking infrastructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04620v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel perimeter-free regional traffic management strategy for traffic networks under a connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV) environment. The proposed strategy requires CAVs, especially those with long remaining travel distances, to temporarily wait at nearby parking facilities when the network is congested. After a designated holding time, these CAVs are allowed to re-enter the network. Doing so helps reduce congestion and improve overall operational efficiency. Unlike traditional perimeter control approaches that restrict inflows to congested regions, the proposed holding strategy leverages existing parking infrastructure to temporarily hold vehicles in a way that partially avoids local queue accumulation issues. The proposed method can be easily integrated with existing signal control methods and retains the maximum stability property of the original traffic signal control methods. Simulation results show that the proposed strategy not only reduces travel time for vehicles that are not held, but can also reduce travel times for some of the held vehicles as well, which serves as another key merit of the proposed approach. Compared to the two benchmark perimeter control algorithms, the proposed strategy is more robust against demand patterns and generates stronger improvements in the operational efficiency. Importantly, since the proposed strategy requires existing parking infrastructure, its performance has been demonstrated under various configurations of parking locations and capacities. Particularly, it is demonstrated that the utilization of the parking facility consistently improves overall traffic efficiency, regardless of the facility's size. Lastly, the proposed strategy is shown to be beneficial in a partial CAV environment where only a subset of vehicles are available for holding.</description>

      <title>Performance-Barrier Event-Triggered PDE Control of Traffic Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00722v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For stabilizing stop-and-go oscillations in traffic flow by actuating a variable speed limit (VSL) at a downstream boundary of a freeway segment, we introduce event-triggered PDE backstepping designs employing the recent concept of performance-barrier event-triggered control (P-ETC). Our design is for linearized hyperbolic Aw-Rascle-Zhang (ARZ) PDEs governing traffic velocity and density. Compared to continuous feedback, ETC provides a piecewise-constant VSL commands-more likely to be obeyed by human drivers. Unlike the existing regular ETC (R-ETC), which enforces conservatively a strict decrease of a Lyapunov function, our performance-barrier (P-ETC) approach permits an increase, as long as the Lyapunov function remains below a performance barrier, resulting in fewer control updates than R-ETC. To relieve VSL from continuously monitoring the triggering function, we also develop periodic event-triggered (PETC) and self-triggered (STC) versions of both R-ETC and P-ETC. These are referred to as R/P-PETC and R/P-STC, respectively, and we show that they both guarantee Zeno-free behavior and exponential convergence in the spatial $L^2$ norm. With comparative simulations, we illustrate the benefits of the performance-barrier designs through traffic metrics (driver comfort, safety, travel time, fuel consumption). The proposed algorithms reduce discomfort nearly in half relative to driver behavior without VSL, while tripling the driver safety, measured by the average dwell time, relative to the R-ETC frequent-switching VSL schedule.</description>

      <title>Compression and Distillation of Data Quadruplets in Non-intrusive Reduced-order Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16683v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a quadrature-free, data-driven approach to balanced truncation for both continuous-time and discrete-time systems. The method non-intrusively constructs reduced-order models using available transfer function samples from the right half of the $s$-plane. It is highlighted that the proposed data-driven balanced truncation and existing quadrature-based balanced truncation algorithms share a common feature: both compress their respective data quadruplets to derive reduced-order models. Additionally, it is demonstrated that by using different compression strategies, these quadruplets can be utilized to develop three data-driven formulations of the IRKA. These formulations non-intrusively generate near-optimal reduced models using transfer function samples from the $j\omega$-axis or the right half of the $s$-plane, or impulse response samples. Notably, these IRKA formulations eliminate the necessity of computing new transfer function samples as IRKA iteratively updates the sampling points. The results are also extended to discrete-time systems. The efficacy of the proposed algorithms is validated through numerical examples, which show that the proposed data-driven approaches perform comparably to their intrusive counterparts.</description>

      <title>Memory-dependent abstractions of stochastic systems through the lens of transfer operators</title>

Abstract: With the increasing ubiquity of safety-critical autonomous systems operating in uncertain environments, there is a need for mathematical methods for formal verification of stochastic models. Towards formally verifying properties of stochastic systems, methods based on discrete, finite Markov approximations -- abstractions -- thereof have surged in recent years. These are found in contexts where: either a) one only has partial, discrete observations of the underlying continuous stochastic process, or b) the original system is too complex to analyze, so one partitions the continuous state-space of the original system to construct a handleable, finite-state model thereof. In both cases, the abstraction is an approximation of the discrete stochastic process that arises precisely from the discretization of the underlying continuous process. The fact that the abstraction is Markov and the discrete process is not (even though the original one is) leads to approximation errors. Towards accounting for non-Markovianity, we introduce memory-dependent abstractions for stochastic systems, capturing dynamics with memory effects. Our contribution is twofold. First, we provide a formalism for memory-dependent abstractions based on transfer operators. Second, we quantify the approximation error by upper bounding the total variation distance between the true continuous state distribution and its discrete approximation.</description>

      <title>Exploring Robustness of Image Recognition Models on Hardware Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.01697v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As the usage of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on resource-intensive and safety-critical tasks increases, a variety of Machine Learning (ML) compilers have been developed, enabling compatibility of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) with a variety of hardware acceleration devices. However, given that DNNs are widely utilized for challenging and demanding tasks, the behavior of these compilers must be verified. To this direction, we propose MutateNN, a tool that utilizes elements of both differential and mutation testing in order to examine the robustness of image recognition models when deployed on hardware accelerators with different capabilities, in the presence of faults in their target device code - introduced either by developers, or problems in their compilation process. We focus on the image recognition domain by applying mutation testing to 7 well-established DNN models, introducing 21 mutations of 6 different categories. We deployed our mutants on 4 different hardware acceleration devices of varying capabilities and observed that DNN models presented discrepancies of up to 90.3% in mutants related to conditional operators across devices. We also observed that mutations related to layer modification, arithmetic types and input affected severely the overall model performance (up to 99.8%) or led to model crashes, in a consistent manner across devices.</description>

      <title>Transformer-Based Fault-Tolerant Control for Fixed-Wing UAVs Using Knowledge Distillation and In-Context Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02975v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study presents a transformer-based approach for fault-tolerant control in fixed-wing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), designed to adapt in real time to dynamic changes caused by structural damage or actuator failures. Unlike traditional Flight Control Systems (FCSs) that rely on classical control theory and struggle under severe alterations in dynamics, our method directly maps outer-loop reference values -- altitude, heading, and airspeed -- into control commands using the in-context learning and attention mechanisms of transformers, thus bypassing inner-loop controllers and fault-detection layers. Employing a teacher-student knowledge distillation framework, the proposed approach trains a student agent with partial observations by transferring knowledge from a privileged expert agent with full observability, enabling robust performance across diverse failure scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our transformer-based controller outperforms industry-standard FCS and state-of-the-art reinforcement learning (RL) methods, maintaining high tracking accuracy and stability in nominal conditions and extreme failure cases, highlighting its potential for enhancing UAV operational safety and reliability.</description>

      <title>Personalized Hierarchical Split Federated Learning in Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06042v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extreme resource constraints make large-scale machine learning (ML) with distributed clients challenging in wireless networks. On the one hand, large-scale ML requires massive information exchange between clients and server(s). On the other hand, these clients have limited battery and computation powers that are often dedicated to operational computations. Split federated learning (SFL) is emerging as a potential solution to mitigate these challenges, by splitting the ML model into client-side and server-side model blocks, where only the client-side block is trained on the client device. However, practical applications require personalized models that are suitable for the client's personal task. Motivated by this, we propose a personalized hierarchical split federated learning (PHSFL) algorithm that is specially designed to achieve better personalization performance. More specially, owing to the fact that regardless of the severity of the statistical data distributions across the clients, many of the features have similar attributes, we only train the body part of the federated learning (FL) model while keeping the (randomly initialized) classifier frozen during the training phase. We first perform extensive theoretical analysis to understand the impact of model splitting and hierarchical model aggregations on the global model. Once the global model is trained, we fine-tune each client classifier to obtain the personalized models. Our empirical findings suggest that while the globally trained model with the untrained classifier performs quite similarly to other existing solutions, the fine-tuned models show significantly improved personalized performance.</description>

      <title>Wasserstein Adaptive Value Estimation for Actor-Critic Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10605v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present Wasserstein Adaptive Value Estimation for Actor-Critic (WAVE), an approach to enhance stability in deep reinforcement learning through adaptive Wasserstein regularization. Our method addresses the inherent instability of actor-critic algorithms by incorporating an adaptively weighted Wasserstein regularization term into the critic's loss function. We prove that WAVE achieves $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{k}\right)$ convergence rate for the critic's mean squared error and provide theoretical guarantees for stability through Wasserstein-based regularization. Using the Sinkhorn approximation for computational efficiency, our approach automatically adjusts the regularization based on the agent's performance. Theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate that WAVE achieves superior performance compared to standard actor-critic methods.</description>
