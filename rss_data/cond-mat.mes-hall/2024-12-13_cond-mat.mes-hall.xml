      <title>Electron transport in bilayer graphene nano constrictions patterned using AFM nanolithography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we report on low temperature transport measurements of encapsulated bilayer graphene nano constrictions fabricated employing electrode-free AFM-based local anodic oxidation (LAO) nanolithography. This technique allows for the creation of constrictions as narrow as 20 nm much smaller than previous studies. In wider constrictions, we observe bulk transport characteristics. However, as the constriction's width is reduced, a transport gap appears. Single quantum dot (QD) formation is observed within the narrowest constriction with addition energies exceeding 100 meV, which surpass previous experiments on patterned QDs. Our results suggest that transport through these narrow constrictions is governed by edge disorder combined with quantum confinement effects. Our findings introduce electrode-free AFM-LAO lithography as an easy and flexible method for creating nanostructures with tunable electronic properties without relying on patterning techniques such as e-beam lithography. The excellent control and reproducibility provided by this technique opens exciting opportunities for carbon-based quantum electronics and spintronics.</description>

      <title>Topologically-Protected Remnant Vortices in Confined Superfluid $^3$He</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetry breaking phase transitions from less to more ordered phases will typically produce topological defects in the ordered phase. Kibble-Zurek theory predicts that for any second-order phase transition, such as the early universe, the density of defects that form should be determined by the scaling law for the system coherence time and the phase transition quench time. We have performed measurements of fourth sound dissipation due to vortex mutual friction in thin channels of superfluid $^3$He where one spatial dimension is smaller than a characteristic length scale predicted by the Kibble-Zurek theory. Our measurements suggest that remnant vortices form after the normal to superfluid second-order phase transition, and that the density of vortices is correlated with the size of the channel, but crucially, is independent of quench time. We propose a modified picture of defect formation, where closely spaced walls prevent the ends of vortex lines from reconnecting into loops. This leads to a mean vortex separation set by the wall spacing, which can result in much higher defect densities than in bulk systems.</description>

      <title>Wrinkles in graphene suspended on flat substrates: structure and collapse under hydrostatic pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The method of molecular dynamics and molecular mechanics has been used to numerically simulate the formation of wrinkle systems during compression of a graphene sheet lying on a flat solid substrate. It is shown that under uniaxial compression the nanosheet can transition into several stable wrinkled states: the most energetically favorable one is a linear wrinkle of infinite length. Higher energy states include wrinkles of finite length aligned along the same line where their ends partially overlap. Under biaxial compression, the graphene nanosheet can contain one linear wrinkle or two linear non-intersecting or intersecting wrinkles corresponding to weak, medium and strong compression, respectively. There are several nanosheet states with intersecting wrinkles that differ in structure of intersection area. The effect of external hydrostatic pressure on the shape of wrinkles has been studied. It is shown that there is a critical pressure value at which the wrinkle either completely flattens (disappears) or collapses into a vertical two-layer fold (the first scenario is possible only with weak compression of the sheet).</description>

      <title>Quantized Toroidal Waves on Ferrotoroidal Magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic-ferroic ordering and magnetic-toroidal moments are essential concepts in molecular electronics and magnetics. The magnetic toroidal moment is critical in understanding new electronic states and their possible uses. This paper discusses the notion of toroidicity waves. In particular, we present a one-dimensional model of interconnected toroidicity leading to an organization principle around an emergent quantum particle, a carrier of toroidicity waves, dubbed the toroidon. We illustrate some functionalities that could be achieved once control over the toroidon is acquired. We show that a 1D dimerized and antiferromagnetic-like spin chain can display ferrotoroidicity and propose its description in terms of an effective quasi-1D spin chain, marking a crucial step towards further research on the phenomena and potential applications of ferrotoroids.</description>

      <title>Rules for dissipationless topotronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological systems hosting gapless boundary states have attracted huge attention as promising components for next-generation information processing, attributed to their capacity for dissipationless electronics. Nevertheless, recent theoretical and experimental inquiries have revealed the emergence of energy dissipation in precisely quantized electrical transport. Here, we present a criterion for the realization of truly no-dissipation design, characterized as $N_{in}=N_{tunl}+N_{bs}$, where $N_{in}$, $N_{tunl}$, and $N_{bs}$ represent the number of modes participating in injecting, tunneling, and backscattering processes, respectively. The key lies in matching the number of injecting, tunneling and backscattering modes, ensuring the equilibrium among all engaged modes inside the device. Among all the topological materials, we advocate for the indispensability of Chern insulators exhibiting higher Chern numbers to achieve functional devices and uphold the no-dissipation rule simultaneously. Furthermore, we design the topological current divider and collector, evading dissipation upon fulfilling the established criterion. Our work paves the path for developing the prospective topotronics.</description>

      <title>Observation of 1/3 fractional quantum Hall physics in balanced large angle twisted bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetotransport of conventional semiconductor based double layer systems with barrier suppressed interlayer tunneling has been a rewarding subject due to the emergence of an interlayer coherent state that behaves as an excitonic superfluid. Large angle twisted bilayer graphene offers unprecedented strong interlayer Coulomb interaction, since both layer thickness and layer spacing are of atomic scale and a barrier is no more needed as the twist induced momentum mismatch suppresses tunneling. The extra valley degree of freedom also adds richness. Here we report the observation of fractional quantum Hall physics at 1/3 total filling for balanced layer population in this system. Monte Carlo simulations support that the ground state is also an excitonic superfluid but the excitons are composed of fractional rather than elementary charges. The observed phase transitions with an applied displacement field at this and other fractional fillings are also addressed with simulations. They reveal ground states with different topology and symmetry properties.</description>

      <title>Extended XY model for spinor polariton simulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classic lattice XY model is one of the universal models of statistical mechanics appearing in a broad variety of optical and condensed matter systems. One of its possible realizations is a system of tunnel-coupled spinor polariton condensates, where phases of individual condensates play a role of the two-dimensional spins. We show that the account of the polarization degree of freedom of cavity polaritons adds a new twist to the problem, modifying in particular the structure of the ground state. We formulate the corresponding classical spin Hamiltonian, which couples phase and polarization dynamics, and consider several particular geometries, demonstrating the principal differences between the scalar and spinor cases. Possible analog of spin Meissner effect for coupled condensates is discussed.</description>

      <title>Size-Dependent Charging Energy Determines the Charge Transport in ZnO Quantum Dot Solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building up a solid-state material from quantum dots (QD), which are often referred to as artificial atoms, offers the potential to create new materials with unprecedented macroscopic properties. The investigation of the electronic properties of such QD assemblies has attracted attention due to the increasing applications of QD solids in both electronics and optoelectronics. In the past, charge transport in QD assemblies has been explained by a variety of mutually exclusive theories, with the Mott and Efros-Shklovskii variable range hopping models being most common. However, these theories fall short in explaining the anomalous exponents of the temperature-dependent conductivity observed in various QD materials. Here, we measure the temperature-dependent conductivity of semiconducting ZnO QDs under different UV illumination intensity. Regulating the UV intensity allows us to systematically change the effective diameter of the ZnO QDs without having to rely on cumbersome size control by synthesis. Instead, the UV level controls the width of the QD depletion shell and therefore the size distribution in the overall material. We observe exponents that systematically increase from {\alpha}=0.25 to {\alpha}=0.62 with increasing illumination intensity, which we interpret in terms of a charge transport being limited by the (size-dependent) charging energy of the QDs.</description>

      <title>Analytical model for the frequency behavior of two distinct modes in nano-constriction spin Hall nano-oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nano-constriction spin-Hall nano-oscillators (NC-SHNOs) have garnered considerable interest due to their potential use as efficient and adjustable nano-sized sources of microwave signals, with high-frequency tunability, adaptable design layout, and CMOS compatibility. In order to facilitate system- and circuit-level designs based on the NC-SHNOs, it is essential to have an analytical model capable of predicting the behavior of the NC-SHNO. In this paper, we introduce an analytical model to describe the frequency behavior of a single NC-SHNO in an in-plane magnetic field while considering the Oersted field. The model is divided into two regions based on the direct current value: the "linear-like" and "bullet" modes. Each region is characterized by distinct concepts and equations. The first region, the "linear-like mode," emerges from the nano-constriction edges and progresses toward the center of the active area of the NC-SHNO. In contrast, the second regime, the localized "bullet mode," exhibits negative nonlinearity, where increasing the current will lead to a decrease in frequency. The model's validity is confirmed through experimental data obtained from electrical RF measurements on a single 180nm wide NC-SHNO, and the model demonstrates excellent agreement with experimental data.</description>

      <title>Tailored 1D/2D Van der Waals Heterostructures for Unified Analog and Digital Electronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a sequential two-step vapor deposition process for growing mixed-dimensional van der Waals (vdW) materials, specifically Te nanowires (1D) and MoS$_2$ (2D), on a single SiO$_2$ wafer. Our growth technique offers a unique potential pathway to create large scale, high-quality, defect-free interfaces. The assembly of samples serves a twofold application: first, the as-prepared heterostructures (Te NW/MoS$_2$) provide insights into the atomically thin depletion region of a 1D/2D vdW diode, as revealed by electrical transport measurements and density functional theory-based quantum transport calculations. The charge transfer at the heterointerface is confirmed using Raman spectroscopy and Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM). We also observe modulation of the rectification ratio with varying applied gate voltage. Second, the non-hybrid regions on the substrate, consisting of the as-grown individual Te nanowires and MoS$_2$ microstructures, are utilized to fabricate separate p- and n-FETs, respectively. Furthermore, the ionic liquid gating helps to realize low-power CMOS inverter and all basic logic gate operations using a pair of n- and p- field-effect transistors (FETs) on Si/SiO$_2$ platform. This approach also demonstrates the potential for unifying diode and CMOS circuits on a single platform, opening opportunities for integrated analog and digital electronics.</description>

      <title>Influence of Functional Group on the Self Assembly of Diamondoids: A Molecular Dynamics Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the molecular-level self-assembly behavior of seven functionalized diamondoids, examining how diverse substituents influence structural organization, thermal stability, and aggregate morphology. Using a combination of density functional theory for initial geometry optimization and molecular dynamics simulations, we explored radial distribution functions, thermal fragmentation temperatures, and radii of gyration for each system. Our results reveal that hydrogen-bonding and polar functional groups (e.g., amino, hydroxy) foster well-defined, ordered assemblies, while bulkier or less interactive substituents (e.g., phenyl, methoxy) lead to more open, amorphous aggregates. Thermal stability strongly depends on substituent chemistry: complex, bulky groups or heteroatom-rich functionalities confer enhanced resistance to fragmentation at high temperatures, whereas simpler groups destabilize the assembly at lower temperatures. Radii of gyration further show that substituent size and polarity can fine-tune cluster compactness. These findings provide critical insights for designing diamondoid-based nanomaterials with tailored structural properties, thermal endurance, and functional performance in advanced technological applications.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Hall Effect in Two-dimensional Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetry is a cornerstone of condensed matter physics, fundamentally shaping the behavior of electronic systems and inducing the emergence of novel phenomena. The Hall effect, a key concept in this field, demonstrates how symmetry breaking, particularly of time-reversal symmetry, influences electronic transport properties. Recently, the nonlinear Hall effect has extended this understanding by generating a transverse voltage that modulates at twice the frequency of the driving alternating current without breaking time-reversal symmetry. This effect is closely tied to the symmetry and quantum geometric properties of materials, offering a new approach to probing the Berry curvature and quantum metric. Here, we provide a review of the theoretical insights and experimental advancements in the nonlinear Hall effect, particularly focusing on its realization in two-dimensional materials. We discuss the challenges still ahead, look at potential applications for devices, and explore how these ideas might apply to other nonlinear transport phenomena. By elucidating these aspects, this review aims to advance the understanding of nonlinear transport effects and their broader implications for future technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate mixed (50/50) clusters of parahydrogen and orthodeuterium at low temperature, by means of Quantum Monte Carlo simulations. Our results provide evidence of liquid-like behavior and partial isotopic separation in a cluster of 640 molecules, at temperature T=10 K. As the temperature is lowered below ~6 K, crystallization occurs, with no indication that the liquid phase is more resilient at low temperature in a mixed cluster. Isotopic separation is therefore predicted to take place at low temperature only through the slow process of molecular self-diffusion in a crystalline matrix.</description>

      <title>Strong negative magnetoresistance and hopping transport in graphenized nematic aerogels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transport properties of nematic aerogels, which consist of oriented mullite nanofibers coated with a graphene shell, were studied. It is shown that the magnetoresistance of this system is well approximated by two contributions - negative one, described by the formula for systems with weak localization , and positive contribution, linear in the field and unsaturated in large magnetic fields. The behavior of phase coherence length on temperature obtained from the analysis of the negative contribution indicates the main role of the electron-electron interaction in the destruction of phase coherence and, presumably, the transition at low temperatures from a two-dimensional weak localization regime to a one-dimensional one. The positive linear contribution to magnetoresistance is apparently due to the inhomogeneous distribution of the local carrier density in the conductive medium. It has also been established that the temperature dependence of the resistance for graphenized aerogels with a low carbon content, when the graphene coating is apparently incomplete, can be represented as the sum of two contributions, one of which is characteristic of weak localization, and the second is described by hopping mechanism corresponding to the Shklovskii-Efros law in the case of a granular conductive medium. For samples with a high carbon content, there is no second contribution.</description>

Abstract: We investigate a minimal model of a two-terminal Josephson junction with conventional superconducting (SC) leads and a pair of interconnected quantum dots in the presence of two Aharonov-Casher (AC) fluxes. The Andreev bound state spectrum features Weyl nodes within a three-dimensional synthetic Brillouin zone defined in the space of these AC fluxes and the SC phase difference. The aim is to determine the location and topological charge of these nodes by probing the Berry curvature on closed surfaces that may enclose them. This is achieved by adiabatically varying the superconducting phase difference and AC fluxes along a path on these surfaces and measuring the associated currents. We define the kinematic curvature as the cross product of a tangent vector along the path and the vector of these currents. In the adiabatic regime, the path-averaged kinematic curvature provides a quantized response equal to the topological charge enclosed by the surface, provided the path uniformly and densely covers it.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional orbital-obstructed insulators with higher-order band topology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Obstructed atomic phases, with their realizations in systems of diverse dimensionality, have recently arisen as one of the topological states with greatest potential to show higher-order phenomena. In this work we report a special type of obstruction, known as orbital-mediated atomic obstruction, in monolayers of materials with spatial symmetry described by the space group P-3m1. By means of a minimal tight-binding model and first-principles calculations, we show that this obstructed phase is related to the mismatch of the charge centers coming from the atomic limit with respect to the centers that are obtained from the reciprocal space description. Although we find atomic limits that correspond with occupied atomic sites, orbital-mediated atomic obstruction requires the presence of orbitals that have no support in real space. In order to demonstrate the nontrivial character of the obstruction, we confirm the presence of a filling anomaly for finite geometries that is directly associated with the bulk configuration, and discuss the role of the boundary states and their underlying mechanism. Several material examples are presented to illustrate the ubiquity of these nontrivial responses and, in turn, to discuss the differences related to the particular ground state configuration. In addition, we perform a survey of materials and elaborate a list of candidate systems which will host this obstructed phase in monolayer form.</description>

      <title>Blister Test to Measure the Out-of-Plane Shear Modulus of Few-Layer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We measure the out-of-plane shear modulus of few-layer graphene (FLG) by a blister test. During the test, we employed a monolayer molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) membrane stacked onto FLG wells to facilitate the separation of FLG from the silicon oxide (SiOx) substrate. Using the deflection profile of the blister, we determine an average shear modulus G of 0.97 +- 0.15 GPa, and a free energy model incorporating the interfacial shear force is developed to calculate the adhesion energy between FLG and SiOx substrate. The experimental protocol can be extended to other two-dimensional (2D) materials and layered structures (LS) made from other materials (WS2, hBN, etc.) to characterize their interlayer interactions. These results provide valuable insight into the mechanics of 2D nano devices which is important in designing more complex flexible electronic devices and nanoelectromechanical systems.</description>

      <title>Contact Resistance Optimization in MoS${_2}$ Field-Effect Transistors through Reverse Sputtering-Induced Structural Modifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional material (2DM)-based field-effect transistors (FETs), such as molybdenum disulfide (MoS${_2}$)-FETs, have gained significant attention for their potential for ultra-short channels, thereby extending Moore's law. However, MoS${_2}$-FETs are prone to the formation of Schottky barriers at the metal-MoS${_2}$ interface, resulting in high contact resistance (R${_c}$) and, consequently, reduced transistor currents in the ON-state. Our study explores the modification of MoS${_2}$ to induce the formation of conductive 1T-MoS${_2}$ at the metal-MoS${_2}$ interface via reverse sputtering. MoS${_2}$-FETs exposed to optimized reverse sputtering conditions in the contact area show R${_c}$ values reduced to less than 50% of their untreated counterparts. This reduction translates into improvements in other electrical characteristics, such as higher ON-state currents. Since reverse sputtering is a standard semiconductor process that enhances the electrical performance of MoS${_2}$-FETs, it has great potential for broader application scenarios in 2DM-based microelectronic devices and circuits.</description>

      <title>Anomalous hardening of spin waves in cobalt/molecular-semiconductor heterostructures reveals strongly anisotropic spinterface magnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interface between a ferromagnetic metal and an organic molecular semiconductor, commonly referred to as a spinterface, is an important component for advancing spintronic technologies. Hybridization of the ferromagnetic-metal surface d orbitals with the molecular-semiconductor p orbitals induces profound modifications not only in the interfacial molecular layer, but also in the surface ferromagnetic-metal atomic layer. These effects are particularly pronounced at low temperatures, manifesting as substantial modifications in the magnetic properties of thin-film magnetic-metal/organic heterostructures. Despite extensive research and interest, the magnetic-ordering and magnetic-properties of the spinterface remain poorly understood. Using ultrafast time-resolved magneto-optical spectroscopy, to investigate the magnetic dynamics in such heterostructures, we unveil the unique spinterface-magnetism and its universality for a broad variety of cobalt/molecular-semiconductor interfaces. In particular, our findings demonstrate the presence of highly anisotropic low-temperature superparamagnetism at the cobalt/molecular-semiconductor spinterface. This anisotropic interfacial superparamagnetism is likely driven by strong chemical modifications in the cobalt interfacial layer caused by the chemisorbed molecular layer. These results highlight the pivotal role of molecular chemisorption in tuning the magnetic properties at spinterfaces, paving the way for future spintronic applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Both linear and nonlinear self-accelerating valley Hall edge states are predicted in the composited inversion-symmetry-broken photonic graphene lattice with a domain wall. The linear one that is obtained by superimposing a finite-energy Airy envelope to the valley Hall edge state shows self-accelerating, non-diffracting and self-healing properties, with the accelerating trajectory not exactly a parabola. For the nonlinear one which exhibits well self-accelerating and non-diffracting properties that may turn over the moving direction of the valley Hall edge state, it is constructed by superimposing the self-trapped self-accelerating envelope that is obtained from the envelope equation to the valley Hall edge state. The nonlinear self-accelerating valley Hall edge state can circumvent sharp corners without back-scattering, but it is impossible to completely prohibit radiating into the bulk because the topological protection and the self-accelerating demand contrary length of the oscillating tail. The results exhibit the possibility on manipulating topological edge states via self-accelerating waves, and pave the way for the self-accelerating topological photonics.</description>

      <title>Formal justification of a continuum relaxation model for one-dimensional moir\'e materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mechanical relaxation in moir\'e materials is often modeled by a continuum model where linear elasticity is coupled to a stacking penalty known as the Generalized Stacking Fault Energy (GSFE). We review and compute minimizers of a one-dimensional version of this model, and then show how it can be formally derived from a natural atomistic model. Specifically, we show that the continuum model emerges in the limit $\epsilon \downarrow 0$ and $\delta \downarrow 0$ while holding the ratio $\eta := \frac{\epsilon^2}{\delta}$ fixed, where $\epsilon$ is the ratio of the monolayer lattice constant to the moir\'e lattice constant and $\delta$ is the ratio of the typical stacking energy to the monolayer stiffness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider chiral phase transition relevant for QCD matter at finite temperature but vanishing baryon density. Presumably, the chiral phase transition is of second order for two-flavor QCD in the chiral limit. Near the transition temperature, we apply the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism and construct a low energy effective field theory (EFT) for the system, in which fluctuations and dissipations are systematically captured. Dynamical variables involve chiral charge densities and order parameter. The EFT action is further confirmed within a modified AdS/QCD model using the holographic Schwinger-Keldysh technique. With suitable higher terms neglected, the stochastic equations derived from the EFT resemble those of model F in the Hohenberg-Halperin classification. Within the EFT, we briefly discuss spontaneous breaking of the chiral symmetry and the Goldstone modes.</description>

      <title>Detrimental 2$p$-3$d$ Hybridisation in Ni Nanosheets Supported on Strontium Dioxide for Catalytic H$_2$ Production, Necessitating Thickness Optimisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ accurate density functional theory calculations to examine the electronic structure of three Ni/SrO$_2$ nanostructures containing single-layer, bilayer and four-layer Ni nanosheets. The single Ni layer interacts strongly with the topmost oxygen layer at the Ni/SrO$_2$ interface, resulting in significant surface reconstruction and strong hybridisation between the O $2p$ and Ni $3d$ states. For the bilayer Ni, the layer facing the interface also strongly interacts with the O. However, the second layer retains its geometry. For the four-layer system, none of the Ni layers interacted strongly with O. According to the electronic population analysis, in the thinnest nanosheets, the strong hybridisation with oxygen pulls Ni's $3d$ states away from the Fermi level deeper into the valence band. In these cases, Ni's electronic population that is labile for catalysis in the vicinity of the Fermi level was as little as half of the bilayer nanosheet. Such reduction in the labile $3d$ population has a detrimental effect on Ni's catalytic performance in de-hydrogenating formic acid. Our results demonstrate that there is an optimum dimension for Ni nanoparticles below or above which the catalytic performance deteriorates. Consequently, reducing the Ni dimension to maximise the surface in the hope of better catalytic yield might not be the best strategy as detrimental $p$-$d$ hybridisation takes hold. Smaller might not always be better after all!</description>

      <title>Interplay between topology and electron-electron interactions in the moir\'{e} MoTe$_{\mathrm{2}}$/WSe$_{\mathrm{2}}$ heterobilayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study, the interplay between topology and electron-electron interactions in the moir\'{e} MoTe$_2$/WSe$_2$ heterobilayer. In our analysis we apply an effective two-band model with complex hoppings that incorporate the Ising-type spin-orbit coupling and lead to a non-trivial topology after the application of perpendicular electric field (displacement field). The model is supplemented by on-site and inter-site Coulomb repulsion terms and treated by both Hartree-Fock and Gutzwiller methods. According to our analysis, for the case of one hole per moir\'{e} unit cell, the system undergoes two phase transitions with increasing displacement field. The first one is from an in-plane 120$^\circ$ antiferromagnetic charge transfer insulator to a topological insulator. At the second transition, the system becomes topologically trivial and an out-of-plane ferromagnetic metallic phase becomes stable. In the topological region a spontaneous spin-polarization appears and the holes are distributed in both layers. Moreover, the hybridization of states from different layers and different valleys is allowed near the Fermi level. Those aspects are in qualitative agreement with the available experimental data. Additionally, we analyze the influence of the intersite Coulomb repulsion terms on the appearance of the topological phase as well as on the formation of the charge density wave state.</description>

      <title>Tomonaga-Luttinger Liquid parameters in Multi-wall Nanotubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL) theory is a canonical formalism used to describe one-dimensional (1D) metals, where the low energy physics is determined by collective bosonic excitations. In this work, we present a theoretical model to compute the parameters of Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL) in multi-wall nanotubes (MWNTs). MWNTs introduce additional complexity to the usual fermionic chains due to interactions and hybridization between their multiple coaxial shells. We consider a model in which conducting paths along the length of the MWNTs are randomly distributed among the shells. Since the valley degree of freedom remains a good quantum number, the TLL description in addition to spin and charge, contains also valley degree of freedom, hence four mode description applies. The values of all four TLL parameters are obtained for this model. A surprising outcome is that the compressibility of the holon mode becomes a universal quantity, while the parameters of neutral modes will depend on the details of inter-shell coupling. Finally, we propose experiments where our predictions can be tested.</description>

      <title>Crystal Symmetry Selected Pure Spin Photocurrent in Altermagnetic Insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The generation of time-reversal-odd spin-current in metallic altermagnets has attracted considerable interest in spintronics. However, producing pure spin-current in insulating materials remains both challenging and desirable, as insulating states are frequently found in antiferromagnets. Nonlinear photogalvanic effects offer a promising method for generating spin-current in insulators. We here revealed that spin and charge photocurrents in altermagnets are protected by spin point group symmetry. Unlike the photocurrents in parity-time symmetric materials, where spin-orbit coupling (SOC) induces a significant charge current, the spin-current in altermagnets can exist as a pure spin current along specific crystal directions regardless of SOC. We applied our predictions using first-principles calculations to several distinct materials, including wurtzite MnTe and multiferroic BiFeO3. Additionally, we elucidated the previously overlooked linear-inject-current mechanism in BiFeO3 induced by SOC, which may account for the enhanced bulk photovotaic effect in multiferroics.</description>

      <title>Quasi-symmetry Constrained Spin Ferromagnetism in Altermagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Altermagnets break time-reversal symmetry and their spin-orbit coupling (SOC) allow for an anomalous Hall effect (AHE) that depends on the direction of the N\'eel ordering vector. The AHE and the ferromagnetic spin moment share the same symmetry and hence are usually proportional. However, density functional theory (DFT) calculations find that the AHE exists with negligible ferromagnetic spin moment for some compounds, whereas it reaches sizable values for other altermagnets. By examining realistic minimal models for altermagnetism in which the DFT phenomenology is captured, we uncover a general SOC-enabled quasi-symmetry that provides a natural explanation for the amplitude of the ferromagnetic spin moment across the vast range of different altermagnetic materials. Additionally, we derive analytic expressions for the magnetic anisotropy energy, providing a simple means to identify the preferred N\'eel vector orientation for altermagnets.</description>

      <title>Splitting of nonequilibrium phase transitions in driven Ising models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs in various equilibrium and nonequilibrium systems, where phase transitions are typically marked by a single critical point that separates ordered and disordered regimes. We reveal a novel phenomenon in which the interplay between different temperatures and driving forces splits the order-disorder transition into two distinct transition points depending on which ordered state initially dominates. Crucially, these two emerging phases have distinct scaling behaviors and thermodynamic properties. To study this, we propose a minimal variant of the Ising model where spins are coupled to two thermal baths and subjected to two opposite driving forces associated to them. Our findings, robust both for all-to-all interactions (where exact solutions are possible) and nearest-neighbor couplings on a square lattice, uncover unique nonequilibrium behaviors and scaling laws for crucial thermodynamic quantities, such as efficiency, dissipation, power and its fluctuations, that are different between the two ordered phases. We also highlight that one of these emerging phases enables heat-engine operations that are less dissipative and show reduced fluctuations. In this setup, the system can also operate near maximum power and efficiency over a wide parameter range. Our results offer new insights into the relevance of phase transitions under nonequilibrium conditions.</description>

Abstract: Interface-induced superconductivity has recently been achieved by stacking a magnetic topological insulator layer on an antiferromagnetic FeTe layer. However, the mechanism driving this emergent superconductivity remains unclear. Here, we employ molecular beam epitaxy to grow a 1T-CrTe2 layer, a two-dimensional ferromagnet with Curie temperature up to room temperature, on a FeTe layer. These 1T-CrTe2/FeTe heterostructures show superconductivity with a critical temperature of ~12 K. Through magnetic force microscopy measurements, we observe the Meissner effect on the surface of the 1T-CrTe2 layer. Our electrical transport measurements reveal that the 1T-CrTe2/FeTe heterostructures exhibit nonreciprocal charge transport behavior, characterized by a large magneto-chiral anisotropy coefficient. The enhanced nonreciprocal charge transport in 1T-CrTe2/FeTe heterostructures provides a promising platform for exploring the magnetically controllable superconducting diode effect.</description>

      <title>From spontaneous to explicit symmetry breaking in a finite-sized system: Bosonic bound states of an impurity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The presence of a single attractive impurity in an ultracold repulsive bosonic system can drive a transition from a homogeneous to a localized state, as we here show for a one-dimensional ring system. In the few-body limit the localization of the bosons around the impurity, as seen in the pair correlations, is accompanied by low-lying modes that resemble finite-size precursors of Higgs-Anderson and Nambu-Goldstone-like modes. Tuning the impurity-boson mass ratio allows for the exploration of the transition from a spontaneous to an explicit breaking of the continuous rotational symmetry of the Hamiltonian. We compare the minimum of the Higgs-Anderson-like mode as a marker of the onset of localization in the few-body limit to mean-field predictions of binding. We find improved agreement between the few-body exact diagonalization results and mean-field predictions of binding with increasing boson-boson repulsion.</description>

      <title>Defect density of states of tin oxide and copper oxide p-type thin-film transistors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The complete subgap defect density of states (DoS) is measured using the ultrabroadband (0.15 to 3.5 eV) photoconduction response from p-type thin-film transistors (TFTs) of tin oxide, SnO, and copper oxide, Cu$_2$O. The TFT photoconduction spectra clearly resolve all bandgaps that further show the presence of interfacial and oxidized minority phases. In tin oxide, the SnO majority phase has a small 0.68 eV bandgap enabling ambipolar or p-mode TFT operation. By contrast, in copper oxide TFTs, an oxidized minority phase with a 1.4 eV bandgap corresponding to CuO greatly reduces the channel hole mobility at the charge accumulation region. Three distinct subgap DoS peaks are resolved for the copper oxide TFT and are best ascribed to copper vacancies, oxygen-on-copper antisites, and oxygen interstitials. For tin oxide TFTs, five subgap DoS peaks are observed and are similarly linked to tin vacancies, oxygen vacancies, and oxygen interstitials. Unipolar p-type TFT is achieved in tin oxide only when the conduction band-edge defect density peak ascribed to oxygen interstitials is large enough to suppress any n-mode conduction. Near the valence band edge in both active channel materials, the metal vacancy peak densities determine the hole concentrations, which further simulate the observed TFT threshold voltages.</description>

      <title>Omnidirectional shuttling to avoid valley excitations in Si/SiGe quantum wells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conveyor-mode shuttling is a key approach for implementing intermediate-range coupling between electron-spin qubits in quantum dots. Initial shuttling results are encouraging; however, long shuttling trajectories are guaranteed to encounter regions of low conduction-band valley energy splittings, due to the presence of random-alloy disorder in Si/SiGe quantum wells. Here, we theoretically explore two schemes for avoiding valley-state excitations at these valley minima, by allowing the electrons to detour around them. The multichannel shuttling scheme allows electrons to tunnel between parallel channels, while a two-dimensional (2D) shuttler provides full omnidirectional control. Through simulations, we estimate shuttling fidelities for these two schemes, obtaining a clear preference for the 2D shuttler. Based on these encouraging results, we propose a full qubit architecture based on 2D shuttling, which enables all-to-all connectivity within qubit plaquettes and high-fidelity communication between plaquettes.</description>

      <title>Axionic quantum criticality of generalized Weyl semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate a field theoretic description for $d$-dimensional interacting nodal semimetals, featuring dispersion that scales with the linear ($n$th) power of momentum along $d_L$ ($d_M$) mutually orthogonal directions around a few isolated points in the reciprocal space with $d_L+d_M=d$, and residing at the brink of isotropic insulation, described by $N_b$-component bosonic order parameter fields. The resulting renormalization group (RG) procedure, tailored to capture the associated quantum critical phenomena, is controlled by a `small' parameter $\epsilon=2-d_M$ and $1/N_f$, where $N_f$ is the number of identical fermion copies (flavor number). When applied to three-dimensional interacting general Weyl semimetals ($d_L=1$ and $d_M=2$), characterized by the Abelian monopole charge $n&gt;1$, living at the shore of the axionic insulation ($N_b=2$), a leading order RG analysis suggests Gaussian nature of the underlying quantum phase transition, around which the critical exponents assume mean-field values. A traditional field theoretic RG analysis yields same outcomes for simple Weyl semimetals ($n=1$, $d_L=3$, and $d_M=0$). Consequently, emergent marginal Fermi liquids showcase only logarithmic corrections to physical observables at intermediate scales of measurements.</description>

      <title>Strong Inter-valley Electron-Phonon Coupling in Magic-Angle Twisted Bilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.14903v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The unusual properties of superconductivity in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) have sparked enormous research interest. However, despite the dedication of intensive experimental efforts and the proposal of several possible pairing mechanisms, the origin of its superconductivity remains elusive. Here, utilizing angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with micrometer spatial resolution, we have revealed flat band replicas in superconducting MATBG, where MATBG is unaligned with its hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) substrate11. These replicas exhibit uniform energy spacing, approximately 150 +- 15 meV apart, indicative of strong electron-boson coupling. Strikingly, these replicas are absent in non-superconducting twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) systems, either when MATBG is aligned to hBN or when TBG deviates from the magic angle. Calculations suggest that the formation of these flat band replicas in superconducting MATBG are attributed to the strong coupling between flat band electrons and an optical phonon mode at the graphene K point, facilitated by inter-valley scattering. These findings, although do not necessarily put electron phonon coupling as the main driving force for the superconductivity in MATBG, unravel the unique electronic structure inherent in superconducting MATBG, thereby providing crucial information for understanding the unusual electronic landscape from which the superconductivity is derived.</description>

      <title>Influence of Dynamical Floquet Spectrum on the Plasmon Excitations and Exchange Energy of tilted monolayer 1T$^\prime$MoS$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16825v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is now well established that a high-frequency electromagnetic dressing field within the off-resonance regime significantly modifies the electronic transport and optical properties on Dirac materials. Here, using light with circular polarization, we investigate its effect on the energy spectrum of tilted monolayer 1T$^\prime$MoS$_2$ which acquires two energy gaps associated with up- and down- pseudospin. We can adjust its electronic properties over a wider range by varying these two band gaps in contrast with graphene. With the use of the Lindhard approach for the frequency-dependent polarizability propagator, we have developed a rigorous theoretical formalism for employing the Floquet energy spectrum for investigating the many-body effects on the plasmon excitations, their lifetimes due to Landau damping and the exchange energy of tilted monolayer 1T$^\prime$MoS$_2$ under normal incidence of electromagnetic radiation at arbitrary temperature. The dressed states at very low temperature corresponding to circular polarization suppress the response of the system to the external probe. This gives rise to the weak but long lived plasmon excitations at small wavenumber $q$ when compared to the plasmon spectrum in this regime in the absence of irradiation. However, $\sqrt{qT}$-dependent plasmons are restored at high temperatures. Our calculations have shown that the tilting, anisotropy, direct and indirect band gaps lead to a reduced exchange energy, which has some potential applications such as, tunability of exciton polariton and plasmon excitations.</description>

      <title>Characterization of individual charge fluctuators in Si/SiGe quantum dots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14541v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electron spins in silicon quantum dots are excellent qubits due to their long coherence times, scalability, and compatibility with advanced semiconductor technology. Although high gate fidelities can be achieved with spin qubits, charge noise in the semiconductor environment still hinders further improvements. Despite the importance of charge noise, key questions about the specific nature of the fluctuators that cause charge noise remain unanswered. Here, we probe individual two-level fluctuators (TLFs) in Si/SiGe quantum dots through simple quantum-dot transport measurements and analyses based on the Allan variance and factorial hidden Markov modeling. We find that the TLF switching times depend sensitively on gate voltages, decrease with temperature, and depend on the current through a nearby quantum dot. A model for the data of the primary TLF we study indicates that it may be a bistable charge dipole near the plunger gate electrode, heated by current through the sensor dot, and experiencing state transitions driven not by direct electron-phonon coupling but through some other mechanism such as coupling to electrons passing through the sensor dot.</description>

Abstract: Interlayer exchange coupling (IEC) between two magnetic layers sandwiched by a nonmagnetic spacer layer plays a critical role in shaping the magnetic properties of such heterostructures. The quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect has been realized in a structure composed of two magnetically doped topological insulator (TI) layers separated by an undoped TI layer. In this work, we employ molecular beam epitaxy to synthesize a series of magnetic TI sandwiches with varying thicknesses of the middle TI spacer layer. The well-quantized QAH effect is observed in all these samples, and the IEC modulates its critical behavior between the top and bottom magnetic TI layers. Near the plateau phase transition (PPT), thinner QAH samples exhibit a two-dimensional critical metal behavior with nearly temperature-independent longitudinal resistance. In contrast, thicker QAH samples behave as a three-dimensional insulator with reduced longitudinal resistance at higher temperatures. We employ a magnetic TI Hamiltonian with random magnetic domains to understand the IEC-induced critical-metal-to-insulator transition observed near QAH PPT.</description>

Abstract: Majorana bound states emerge in topological superconductors as zero-energy edge states exhibiting spatial nonlocality. Despite the enormous advances, the detection of Majorana bound states is still challenging mainly because topologically trivial Andreev bound states produce similar signatures. In this work we consider a topological superconductor with Majorana bound states coupled to quantum dots and investigate the dynamics of their quantum correlations with the aim to explore their entanglement properties. In particular, we characterize entanglement by using concurrence and discord, which are also complemented by the entanglement dynamics and return probability. We find that Majorana bound states at truly zero energy can transform an initially entangled system into its classical state, while they can create maximally entangled states at a finite energy overlap. Interestingly, we show that the system can generate a maximally entangled state between MBSs and a quantum dot by simply controlling the Majorana nonlocality. We demonstrate that these results hold in the scenarios when the initial state is either maximally entangled or separable, albeit in the latter maximally entangled states are achieved in the long time dynamics. Furthermore, we contrast our findings with those produced by a regular fermion and obtain very distinct entanglement signatures. Our work offers an alternative approach to characterize Majorana bound states, which can be also useful towards their utilization for quantum information tasks.</description>

Abstract: We present a technique for integrating ultraclean carbon nanotubes into superconducting circuits, aiming to realize Josephson junctions based on one-dimensional elementary quantum conductors. This technique primarily involves depositing the nanotube in the final step, thus preserving it from the inherent contaminations of nanofabrication and maintaining contact solely with superconducting electrodes and a crystalline hBN substrate. Through transport measurements performed in both the normal and superconducting states, we demonstrate that our method yields high-quality junctions with Josephson energies suitable for quantum device applications, such as carbon nanotube-based superconducting qubits.</description>

      <title>Current-induced spin polarisation in Rashba-Dresselhaus systems under different point groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05188v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-magnetic materials without inversion symmetry typically exhibit strong Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC), enabling the well-known Rashba Edelstein effect where an external electrical current induces transverse spin polarisation. In this study, we demonstrate that electrically induced spin polarisation in non-magnetic materials, for example, electronic systems within quantum-well geometries, can significantly be influenced by the system's point-group symmetries, such as $C_n$ and $C_{nv}$. These symmetries allow various linear and higher-order momentum, $k-$varying SOC Hamiltonian. Specifically, we show that surfaces having $C_{n}$ point-group symmetry, which permits specific linear and cubic Rashba and Dresselhaus SOC terms, can lead to both orthogonal and non-orthogonal spin polarisations with respect to the applied field. In contrast, surfaces with $C_{nv}$ symmetry exhibit only transverse spin polarisation, regardless of the linear and cubic SOC terms. We further find contrasting spin polarisation for cubic-in-$k$ SOC as compared to the linear-in-$k$ SOC when energy is varied, for example, through doping. Additionally, we show that the surfaces with $C_{n}$ symmetry may exhibit persistent spin current, depending on the relative strength between different momentum-dependent SOC terms. Our finding emphasizes the significance of crystal symmetry in understanding and manipulating induced spin polarisation in noncentrosymmetric materials, especially in surface/interface systems.</description>

      <title>Tailoring coherent charge transport in graphene by deterministic defect generation</title>

Abstract: Harnessing the wave-nature of charge carriers in solid state devices, electron optics investigates and exploits coherent phenomena, in analogy with optics and photonics. Typically, this requires complex electronic devices leveraging macroscopically coherent charge transport in two-dimensional electron gases and superconductors. Here, collective coherent effects are induced in a simple counterintuitive architecture by defect engineering. Deterministically introduced lattice defects in graphene enable the phase coherent charge transport by playing the role of potential barriers, instead of scattering centres as conventionally considered. Thus, graphene preserves its quasi-ballistic quantum transport and can support phase-matched charge carrier waves. Based on this approach, multiple electronic Fabry-P\`erot cavities are formed by creating periodically alternating defective and pristine nano-stripes through low energy electron-beam irradiation. Indeed, defective stripes behave as partially reflecting mirrors and resonantly confine the charge carrier waves within the pristine areas, giving rise to Fabry-P\`erot resonant modes. These modes experimentally manifest as sheet resistance oscillations, as also confirmed by Landauer-B\"uttiker simulations. Moreover, these coherent phenomena survive up to 30 K for both polarities of charge carriers, contrarily to traditional monopolar electrostatically created Fabry-P\`erot interferometers. Our study positions defective graphene as an innovative platform for coherent electronic devices, with potential applications in nano and quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Exact theory of edge diffraction and launching of transverse electric plasmons at two-dimensional junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20206v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An exact solution for electromagnetic wave diffraction at the junction of two-dimensional electron systems (2DES) is obtained and analyzed for electric field polarized along the edge. A special emphasis is paid to the metal-contacted and terminated edges. In the former case, electric field at the edge tends to zero; in the latter case, it tends to a finite value which is screened by 2d system in an anomalous fashion. For both types of edge and capacitive type of 2d conductivity, an incident wave excites transverse electric 2d plasmons. The amplitude of excited TE plasmons is maximized and becomes order of incident wave amplitude for capacitive impedance of 2DES order of free space impedance. For both large and small 2DES impedance, the amplitude of TE plasmons tends to zero according to the power laws which are explicitly derived.</description>

      <title>Robust surface Luttinger surfaces in topological band structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18820v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The standard paradigm of topological phases posits that two phases with identical symmetries are separated by a bulk phase transition, while symmetry breaking provides a path in parameter space that allows adiabatic connection between the phases. Typically, if symmetry is broken only at the boundary, topological surface states become gapped, and single-particle surface properties no longer distinguish between the two phases. In this work, we challenge this expectation. We demonstrate that the single-particle surface Green's function contains zeros, or "Luttinger surfaces," which maintain the same bulk-boundary correspondence as topological surface states. Remarkably, these Luttinger surfaces persist under symmetry-breaking perturbations that destroy the surface states. Moreover, we point out that low-energy and surface theories, often used synonymously in discussions of (gapped) topological matter, are actually different, with the difference captured by the Luttinger surfaces.</description>

      <title>Spin-polarized Specular Andreev Reflections in Altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07117v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show theoretically that specular Andreev reflection occurs stably at altermagnet--superconductor interfaces, which is a phenomenon that has previously been predicted only in a limited range of materials, such as Dirac/Weyl materials with fine-tuned chemical potentials. Furthermore, the characteristic spin-split bands of the altermagnet lead to a distinctive spin polarization in the specular Andreev reflections. By utilizing this feature, we propose a device that integrates the functions of both a Cooper pair splitter and a spin beam splitter, thereby creating energy-entangled electron pairs. The positive nonlocal conductance and the positive noise cross-correlation are unambiguous signatures of specular Andreev reflections in the proposed device.</description>

      <title>Microwave Hall measurements using a circularly polarized dielectric cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09662v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have developed a circularly polarized dielectric rutile (TiO$_2$) cavity with a high quality-factor that can generate circularly polarized microwaves from two orthogonal linearly polarized microwaves with a phase difference of $\pm \pi/2$ using a hybrid coupler. Using this cavity, we have established a new methodology to measure the microwave Hall conductivity of a small single crystal of metal in the skin-depth region. Based on the cavity perturbation technique, we have shown that all components of the surface impedance tensor can be extracted under the application of a magnetic field by comparing the right- and left-handed circularly polarized modes. To verify the validity of the developed method, we performed test measurements on tiny Bi single crystals at low temperatures. As a result, we have successfully obtained the surface impedance tensor components and confirmed that the characteristic field dependence of the ac Hall angle in the microwave region is consistent with the expectation from the dc transport measurements. These results demonstrate a significant improvement in sensitivity compared to previous methods. Thus, our developed technique allows more accurate microwave Hall measurements, opening the way for new approaches to explore novel topological quantum phenomena, such as time-reversal symmetry breaking in superconductors.</description>

      <title>Splitting of Girvin-MacDonald-Platzman density wave and the nature of chiral gravitons in fractional quantum Hall effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02730v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A fundamental manifestation of the nontrivial correlations of an incompressible fractional quantum Hall (FQH) state is that an electron added to it disintegrates into more elementary particles, namely fractionally-charged composite fermions (CFs). We show here that the Girvin-MacDonald-Platzman (GMP) density-wave excitation of the $\nu{=}n/(2pn{\pm }1)$ FQH states also splits into more elementary single CF excitons. In particular, the GMP graviton, which refers to the recently observed spin-2 neutral excitation in the vanishing wave vector limit [Liang {\it et al.}, Nature {\bf 628}, 78 (2024)], remains undivided for $\nu{=}n/(2n{\pm} 1)$ but splits into two gravitons at $\nu{=}n/(4n{\pm} 1)$ with $n{&gt;}1$. A detailed experimental confirmation of the many observable consequences of the splitting of the GMP mode should provide a unique window into the correlations underlying the FQH effect.</description>

      <title>Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya-type spin-spin interaction from mixed-parity superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07144v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interacting impurity spins adsorbed on surfaces have been suggested as basic components for applications in quantum computation and spintronics. Such spins usually prefer a parallel or antiparallel configuration, but weakly non-collinear alignments are possible due to the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) that arises in the presence of relativistic spin-orbit coupling. Here, we show that an effective Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya-type interaction (DMTI) can emerge purely from superconducting correlations without any spin-orbit interaction. We give an analytical proof and provide a numerical study which shows that DMTI arises in mixed-parity superconductors solely from the superconducting pairing. Moreover, we show that the same effect can be realized in Josephson junctions between s-wave and p-wave superconductors, where a phase bias toggles the DMTI entirely on and off. These results enable a way to engineer spin textures using superconducting order.</description>

      <title>Emergent spin and orbital angular momentum of light in twisted photonic bilayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01274v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the optical response of twisted photonic bilayers, photonic counterparts of van der Waals structures, is sensitive to both spin angular momentum (SAM) and orbital angular momentum (OAM) of light. A beam of unpolarized light with zero angular momentum acquires SAM in transmission and OAM in reflection. The developed analytical theory and numerical calculations show that the SAM and OAM arise from distinct microscopic mechanisms and depend differently on the interlayer distance. The predicted phenomena do not require light absorption and are caused by the photon-helicity-dependent light diffraction by the moir\'e pattern, which inevitably occurs in the twisted structure, and the SAM-OAM conversion processes. We also reveal strong SAM and OAM in the moir\'e-diffracted beams. Our findings uncover a profound connection between the emergent SAM and OAM in twisted photonic systems offering new possibilities for angular-momentum-resolved light-matter interactions.</description>

      <title>Correlated Structural and Optical Characterization of Hexagonal Boron Nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14408v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) plays a central role in nanoelectronics and nanophotonics. Moreover, hBN hosts room-temperature quantum emitters and optically addressable spins, making it promising for quantum sensing and quantum photonics. Despite many investigations of their optical properties, however, the emitters' chemical structure remains unclear, as does the role of contamination at surfaces and interfaces in forming the emitters or modifying their properties. We prepare hBN samples that are compatible with confocal photoluminescence (PL) microscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and atomic-force microscopy (AFM), and we use those techniques to quantitatively investigate correlations between fluorescent emission, flake morphology, and surface residue. We find that the microscopy techniques themselves induce changes in hBN's optical activity and residue morphology: PL measurements induce photobleaching, whereas TEM measurements alter surface residue and emission characteristics. We also study the effects of common treatments $\unicode{x2014}$ annealing and oxygen plasma cleaning $\unicode{x2014}$ on the structure and optical activity of hBN. The methods can be broadly applied to study two-dimensional materials, and the results illustrate the importance of correlative studies to elucidate structural factors that influence hBN's functionality as a host for quantum emitters and spin defects.</description>

      <title>Optomechanical systems with nonlinear interactions: photon blockade, collapse and revival of optical oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00908v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Closed-form expressions for the average amplitude of the optical field in optomechanical systems are obtained, in which, in addition to the linear interaction, quadratic and cubic interactions of the vibrational mode of the mechanical resonator with the mode of the optical resonator are considered. In the framework of the non-secular perturbation theory, using the Bogoliubov averaging method, it is shown that the effects of photon blockade, collapse and revival of optical oscillations in such systems can be realized. The main contribution to the formation of revivals is provided by the Kerr self-action of the optical mode and the cross-Kerr interaction of the fourth degree in optical and mechanical amplitudes. The cross-Kerr interactions of the sixth- and eighth-order in amplitudes destroy the regular structure of revivals. The influence of these cross-Kerr nonlinearities disappears with an increase in the decay rate of the optical mode and is also completely suppressed at zero temperature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04009v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spin and orbital are two basic degrees of freedom, which play significant roles in exploring exotic quantum phases in optical lattices with synthetic spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and high orbital bands, respectively. Here, we propose an orbital optical Raman lattice to study exotic high-orbital Bose condensates with Raman-induced SOC in a square lattice. We find that both the SOC and p-orbital interactions influence the condensed state of bosons. Their interplay results in two novel high-orbital many-body quantum phases: the uniform angular momentum superfluid phase, which features a global topological chiral orbital current, and the two-dimensional spin-orbital supersolid phase, which is characterized by the spin and orbital angular momentum density wave patterns. The former has topological Bogoliubov excitations characterized by a uniform Chern number, while the spin-orbital supersolid phase hosts topological excitations with opposite Chern numbers which respectively protect the chiral and antichiral edge modes in the neighboring supersolid clusters. Our findings may inspire a new avenue for exploring exotic SOC and high-orbital physics in optical lattices, and shall also advance the experimental progress of novel supersolids in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Quantum impurities in finite-temperature Bose gases: Detecting vortex proliferation across the BKT and BEC transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08546v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Detecting vortices in neutral superfluids represents an outstanding experimental challenge. Using stochastic classical-field methods, we theoretically show that a quantum impurity repulsively coupled to a weakly-interacting Bose gas at finite temperature carries direct spectroscopic signatures of vortex proliferation. In two dimensions, we find that a low-energy (attractive) branch in the excitation spectrum becomes prominent when the temperature is tuned across the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition. We explain this red-shifted resonance as originating from the binding of the impurity to vortices, where the bosons density (and hence, the repulsive Hartree energy) is reduced. This mechanism could be exploited to spectroscopically estimate the BKT transition in excitonic insulators. In contrast, in three dimensions, the impurity spectra reflect the presence of vortex rings well below the condensation temperature, and herald the presence of a thermal gas above the Bose-Einstein condensation transition. Importantly, we expect our results to have impact on the understanding of Bose-polaron formation at finite temperatures.</description>
