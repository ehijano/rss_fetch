      <title>Minimum Membership Geometric Set Cover in the Continuous Setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the minimum membership geometric set cover, i.e., MMGSC problem [SoCG, 2023] in the continuous setting. In this problem, the input consists of a set $P$ of $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^{2}$, and a geometric object $t$, the goal is to find a set $\mathcal{S}$ of translated copies of the geometric object $t$ that covers all the points in $P$ while minimizing $\mathsf{memb}(P, \mathcal{S})$, where $\mathsf{memb}(P, \mathcal{S})=\max_{p\in P}|\{s\in \mathcal{S}: p\in s\}|$.
  For unit squares, we present a simple $O(n\log n)$ time algorithm that outputs a $1$-membership cover. We show that the size of our solution is at most twice that of an optimal solution. We establish the NP-hardness on the problem of computing the minimum number of non-overlapping unit squares required to cover a given set of points. This algorithm also generalizes to fixed-sized hyperboxes in $d$-dimensional space, where an $1$-membership cover with size at most $2^{d-1}$ times the size of a minimum-sized $1$-membership cover is computed in $O(dn\log n)$ time. Additionally, we characterize a class of objects for which a $1$-membership cover always exists. For unit disks, we prove that a $2$-membership cover exists for any point set, and the size of the cover is at most $7$ times that of the optimal cover. For arbitrary convex polygons with $m$ vertices, we present an algorithm that outputs a $4$-membership cover in $O(n\log n + nm)$ time.</description>

      <title>Unfolding Boxes with Local Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of finding and enumerating polyominos that can be folded into multiple non-isomorphic boxes. While several computational approaches have been proposed, including SAT, randomized algorithms, and decision diagrams, none has been able to perform at scale. We argue that existing SAT encodings are hindered by the presence of global constraints (e.g., graph connectivity or acyclicity), which are generally hard to encode effectively and hard for solvers to reason about. In this work, we propose a new SAT-based approach that replaces these global constraints with simple local constraints that have substantially better propagation properties. Our approach dramatically improves the scalability of both computing and enumerating common box unfoldings: (i) while previous approaches could only find common unfoldings of two boxes up to area 88, ours easily scales beyond 150, and (ii) while previous approaches were only able to enumerate common unfoldings up to area 30, ours scales up to 60. This allows us to rule out 46, 54, and 58 as the smallest areas allowing a common unfolding of three boxes, thereby refuting a conjecture of Xu et al. (2017).</description>

      <title>Computing Diverse and Nice Triangulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We initiate the study of computing diverse triangulations to a given polygon. Given a simple $n$-gon $P$, an integer $ k \geq 2 $, a quality measure $\sigma$ on the set of triangulations of $P$ and a factor $ \alpha \geq 1 $, we formulate the Diverse and Nice Triangulations (DNT) problem that asks to compute $k$ \emph{distinct} triangulations $T_1,\dots,T_k$ of $P$ such that a) their diversity, $\sum_{i &lt; j} d(T_i,T_j) $, is as large as possible \emph{and} b) they are nice, i.e., $\sigma(T_i) \leq \alpha \sigma^* $ for all $1\leq i \leq k$. Here, $d$ denotes the symmetric difference of edge sets of two triangulations, and $\sigma^*$ denotes the best quality of triangulations of $P$, e.g., the minimum Euclidean length.
  As our main result, we provide a $\mathrm{poly}(n,k)$-time approximation algorithm for the DNT problem that returns a collection of $k$ distinct triangulations whose diversity is at least $1 - \Theta(1/k)$ of the optimal, and each triangulation satisfies the quality constraint. This is accomplished by studying \emph{bi-criteria triangulations} (BCT), which are triangulations that simultaneously optimize two criteria, a topic of independent interest. We complement our approximation algorithms by showing that the DNT problem and the BCT problem are NP-hard.
  Finally, for the version where diversity is defined as $\min_{i &lt; j} d(T_i,T_j) $, we show a reduction from the problem of computing optimal Hamming codes, and provide an $n^{O(k)}$-time $\tfrac12$-approximation algorithm. Note that this improves over the naive brutef-orce $2^{O(nk)}$ time bound for enumerating all $k$-tuples among the triangulations of a simple $n$-gon, whose total number can be the $(n-2)$-th Catalan number.</description>

      <title>Solving Euclidean Problems by Isotropic Initialization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many problems in Euclidean geometry, arising in computational design and fabrication, amount to a system of constraints, which is challenging to solve. We suggest a new general approach to the solution, which is to start with analogous problems in isotropic geometry. Isotropic geometry can be viewed as a structure-preserving simplification of Euclidean geometry. The solutions found in the isotropic case give insight and can initialize optimization algorithms to solve the original Euclidean problems. We illustrate this general approach with three examples: quad-mesh mechanisms, composite asymptotic-geodesic gridshells, and asymptotic gridshells with constant node angle.</description>

      <title>Automated Symmetric Constructions in Discrete Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a computational methodology for obtaining rotationally symmetric sets of points satisfying discrete geometric constraints, and demonstrate its applicability by discovering new solutions to some well-known problems in combinatorial geometry. Our approach takes the usage of SAT solvers in discrete geometry further by directly embedding rotational symmetry into the combinatorial encoding of geometric configurations. Then, to realize concrete point sets corresponding to abstract designs provided by a SAT solver, we introduce a novel local-search realizability solver, which shows excellent practical performance despite the intrinsic $\exists \mathbb{R}$-completeness of the problem. Leveraging this combined approach, we provide symmetric extremal solutions to the Erd\H{o}s-Szekeres problem, as well as a minimal odd-sized solution with 21 points for the everywhere-unbalanced-points problem, improving on the previously known 23-point configuration. The imposed symmetries yield more aesthetically appealing solutions, enhancing human interpretability, and simultaneously offer computational benefits by significantly reducing the number of variables required to encode discrete geometric problems.</description>

      <title>Reweighted Spectral Partitioning Works: Bounds for Special Graph Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spectral partitioning is a method that can be used to compute small sparse cuts or small edge-separators in a wide variety of graph classes, by computing the second-smallest eigenvalue (and eigenvector) of the Laplacian matrix. Upper bounds on this eigenvalue for certain graph classes imply that the method obtains small edge-separators for these classes, usually with a sub-optimal dependence on the maximum degree. In this work, we show that a related method, called reweighted spectral partitioning, guarantees near-optimal sparse vertex-cuts and vertex-separators in a wide variety of graph classes. In many cases, this involves little-to-no necessary dependence on maximum degree.
  We also obtain a new proof of the planar separator theorem, a strengthened eigenvalue bound for bounded-genus graphs, and a refined form of the recent Cheeger-style inequality for vertex expansion via a specialized dimension-reduction step.</description>

      <title>New aspects of quantum topological data analysis: Betti number estimation, and testing and tracking of homology and cohomology classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the application of quantum computation to topological data analysis (TDA) has received increasing attention. In particular, several quantum algorithms have been proposed for estimating (normalized) Betti numbers, a central challenge in TDA. However, it was recently proven that estimating Betti numbers is an NP-hard problem, revealing a complexity-theoretic limitation to achieving a generic quantum advantage for this task. Motivated by this limitation and inspired by previous progress, we explore broader quantum approaches to TDA. First, we consider scenarios in which a simplicial complex is specified in a more informative form, enabling alternative quantum algorithms to estimate Betti numbers and persistent Betti numbers. We then move beyond Betti numbers and study the problem of testing the homology class of a given cycle, as well as distinguishing between homology classes. We also introduce cohomological techniques for these problems, along with a quantum algorithm. We then discuss their potential use in the testing and tracking of homology classes, which can be useful for TDA applications. Our results show that, despite the hardness of general Betti number estimation, quantum algorithms can still offer speed-ups in structured settings.</description>

      <title>Vietoris--Rips Shadow for Euclidean Graph Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The shadow of an abstract simplicial complex $K$ with vertices in $\mathbb R^N$ is a subset of $\mathbb R^N$ defined as the union of the convex hulls of simplices of $K$. The Vietoris--Rips complex of a metric space $(S,d)$ at scale $\beta$ is an abstract simplicial complex whose each $k$-simplex corresponds to $(k+1)$ points of $S$ within diameter $\beta$. In case $S\subset\mathbb R^2$ and $d(a,b)=\|a-b\|$ standard Euclidean, the natural shadow projection of the Vietoris--Rips is already proved to be $1$-connected. We extend the result beyond the standard Euclidean distance on $S\subset\mathbb R^N$ to a family of path-based metrics $d^\varepsilon_{S}$. From the pairwise Euclidean distances of points of $S$, we introduce a family (parametrized by $\varepsilon$) of path-based Vietoris--Rips complexes $R^\varepsilon_\beta(S)$ for a scale $\beta&gt;0$. If $S\subset\mathbb R^2$ is Hausdorff-close to a planar Euclidean graph $G$, we provide quantitative bounds on scales $\beta,\varepsilon$ for the shadow projection map of the Vietoris--Rips of $(S,d^\varepsilon_{S})$ at scale $\beta$ to be $1$-connected. As a novel application, this paper first studies the homotopy-type recovery of $G\subset\mathbb R^N$ using the abstract Vietoris--Rips complex of a Hausdorff-close sample $S$ under the $d^\varepsilon_{S}$ metric. Then, our result on the $1$-connectivity of the shadow projection lends itself to providing also a geometrically close embedding for the reconstruction. Based on the length of the shortest loop and large-scale distortion of the embedding of $G$, we quantify the choice of a suitable sample density $\varepsilon$ and a scale $\beta$ at which the shadow of $R^\varepsilon_\beta(S)$ is homotopy-equivalent and Hausdorff-close to $G$.</description>

      <title>On Computing Vertex Connectivity of 1-Plane Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.06782v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The vertex connectivity of a graph $G$ is the size of the smallest set of vertices $S$ such that $G \setminus S$ is disconnected. For the class of planar graphs, the problem of vertex connectivity is well-studied, both from structural and algorithmic perspectives. Let $G$ be a plane embedded graph, and $\Lambda(G)$ be an auxiliary graph obtained by inserting a face vertex inside each face and connecting it to all vertices of $G$ incident with the face. If $S$ is a minimal vertex cut of $G$, then there exists a cycle of length $2|S|$ whose vertices alternate between vertices of $S$ and face vertices. This structure facilitates the designing of a linear-time algorithm to find minimum vertex cuts of planar graphs. In this paper, we attempt a similar approach for the class of 1-plane graphs -- these are graphs with a drawing on the plane where each edge is crossed at most once.
  We consider different classes of 1-plane graphs based on the subgraphs induced by the endpoints of crossings. For 1-plane graphs where the endpoints of every crossing induce the complete graph $K_4$, we show that the structure of minimum vertex cuts is identical to that in plane graphs, as mentioned above. For 1-plane graphs where the endpoints of every crossing induce at least three edges (i.e., one edge apart from the crossing pair of edges), we show that for any minimal vertex cut $S$, there exists a cycle of diameter $O(|S|)$ in $\Lambda(G)$ such that all vertices of $S$ are in the neighbourhood of the cycle. This structure enables us to design a linear time algorithm to compute the vertex connectivity of all such 1-plane graphs.</description>

      <title>A Framework for the Design of Efficient Diversification Algorithms to NP-Hard Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12261v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There has been considerable recent interest in computing a diverse collection of solutions to a given optimization problem, both in the AI and theory communities. Given a classical optimization problem $\Pi$ (e.g., spanning tree, minimum cuts, maximum matching, minimum vertex cover) with input size $n$ and an integer $k\geq 1$, the goal is to generate a collection of $k$ maximally diverse solutions to $\Pi$. This diverse-X paradigm not only allows the user to generate very different solutions, but also helps make systems more secure and robust by handling uncertainty, and achieve energy efficiency.
  For problems $\Pi$ in P (such as spanning tree and minimum cut), there are efficient $\text{poly}(n,k)$ approximation algorithms available for the diverse variants [Hanaka et al. AAAI 2021, 2022, 2023, Gao et al. LATIN 2022, de Berg et al. ISAAC 2023]. In contrast, only FPT algorithms are known for NP-hard problems such as vertex covers and independent sets [Baste et al. IJCAI 2020, Eiben et al. SODA 2024, Misra et al. ISAAC 2024, Austrin et al. ICALP 2025], but in the worst case, these algorithms run in time $\exp((kn)^c)$ for some $c&gt;0$. In this work, we address this gap and give $\text{poly}(n,k)$ or $f(k)\text{poly}(n)$ time approximation algorithms for diversification variants of several NP-hard problems such as knapsack, maximum weight independent sets (MWIS) and minimum vertex covers in planar graphs, geometric (rectangle) knapsack, enclosing points by polygon, and MWIS in unit-disk-graphs of points in convex position. Our results are achieved by developing a general framework and applying it to problems with textbook dynamic-programming algorithms to find one solution.</description>
