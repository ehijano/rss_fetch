      <title>An Analytical Model of Sorption-Induced Static Mode Nanomechanical Sensing for Multi-Component Analytes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanomechanical sensors and their arrays have attracted significant attention for detecting, distinguishing, and identifying target analytes, especially complex mixtures of odors. In the static mode operation, sensing signals are obtained by a concen-tration-dependent sorption-induced mechanical strain/stress. Understanding of the dynamic responses is crucial for develop-ing practical artificial olfaction; however, the analytical formulations are still limited to single-component analytes. Here, we derive an analytical model of viscoelastic material-based static mode nanomechanical sensing for multi-component analytes by extending the theoretical model via solving differential equations. The present model can reduce the dynamic responses to the multi-component target analytes observed in the experimental signal responses. Moreover, the use of optimized fitting parameters extracted from pure vapors with viscoelastic parameters allows us to predict the concentration of each analyte in the multi-component system.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A formula for the spectral distribution of intensity of radiation from a system of gap-separated undulators is derived. Due to the constructive addition of radiation fields formed in undulators, the line shape of the spontaneous radiation at zero angle is narrowed. According to Madey's theory, the gain is proportional to the derivative of the line shape of the spontaneous radiation, hence, it is enhanced.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Flux Trapping in and Fabrication of Large-Scale Superconductor Circuits Using AC-Biased Shift Registers With 108500 Josephson Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A variety of superconductor integrated circuits comprising six ac-powered SFQ shift registers with a total of 27078 bits and 108500 Josephson junctions (JJs) per 5 mm x 5 mm chip have been designed, fabricated, and tested to characterize flux trapping, fabrication process yield, and parameter spread. The six 4513-bit registers in the circuits have a common single-phase ac clock and individual input/output drivers enabling their parallel testing. We have investigated flux trapping in the circuits with various geometry, size, and distance between moats in two active ground planes (GPs), and containing up to three additional 'dummy' GPs, using multiple cooldowns through the critical temperature with various cooling rates and residual magnetic fields up to ~1.2 $\mu$T. For the slit-type and square moats arrayed along the sides of the register cells, we have found a negligible effect of flux sequestered in the moats on the operating margins of the registers, and negligible probability of detrimental flux trapping outside of the moats. Circuits with 0.3-$\mu$m-wide slit moats occupying &lt;2% of the circuit area were fully operational in 100% of cooldowns, supporting the viability of VLSI superconductor digital circuits. We have found a strong enhancement of flux trapping outside of the moats in circuits with closely spaced GPs and determined a critical distance, t$_c$=0.6 $\mu$m, between them. The presence of GPs spaced below t$_c$ rendered the circuits nonoperational in 100% of cooldowns. We have measured 30 chips with &gt;3M JJs and determined individual cell margins in 138 registers to characterize the fabrication-related parameter spread and detect fabrication defects and flux-trapping events. By finding outlier cells in the statistical distribution of the individual cell margins, we detected about one defect per million JJs, in most cases causing magnetic flux trapping in the affected cell.</description>

      <title>Optical computing using telecom device platform for nonlinear mapping to high-dimensional feature space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mapping input signals to a high-dimensional space is a critical concept in various computing paradigms. We propose using commercially available telecom devices developed for high-speed optical data transmission for computing through nonlinear mapping of optical signals into a high-dimensional space where linear processing can be applied. We manipulate the output feature dimension by applying temporal up-sampling (at the speed of commercially available telecom devices) of input signals and a well-established wave-division-multiplexing (WDM). This gives remarkable flexibility in the {\it dynamical phase masking} of the input signal. We demonstrate the general concept employing readily available photonic devices, including a semiconductor optical amplifier and nonlinear optical loop mirror (equivalent nonlinear Mach-Zender interferometer). We apply linear regression on the high-dimensional output states to solve forecasting and classification problems. We investigate how nonlinear mapping provided by these devices can be characterized in terms of the increased controlled separability and predictability of the output state.</description>

      <title>Simulating Pattern Recognition Using Non-volatile Synapses: MRAM, Ferroelectrics and Magnetic Skyrmions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This project explores the use of non-volatile synapses in neuromorphic computing for pattern recognition tasks through a comprehensive simulation-based approach. The main approach is through spintronic synapses, which leverage the electron's spin properties to achieve efficient data processing and storage. This offers a promising alternative to traditional electronic synapses which require constant power recharge to prevent data leakage. The goal is to develop and simulate a neural network model that incorporates spintronic synapses, examining their potential to perform complex pattern recognition tasks such as image and sound classification. By building a simulation environment, we will replicate various models, including spin transfer torque based MRAM, voltage controlled magnetic anisotropy based MRAM, ferroelectric field effect transistors, and skyrmion based nanotrack for synaptic devices, to evaluate their performance and compare results across different non-volatile implementations. The findings will highlight the effectiveness of spintronic synapses in creating low-power, high-performance neuromorphic hardware, providing valuable insights into their application for future energy-efficient artificial intelligence systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum imaging is an ever expanding research field, in which the aim is to exploit the quantum nature of light to enhance image reconstruction capabilities. Despite a number of successful demonstrations for quantum imaging, quantum microscopy still seems out of the range for practical applications, due to different physical and technical reasons. Here we propose an imaging method exploiting the quantum correlations of photon pairs and a scanning microscope to achieve fast, single mode quantum imaging. We first test our technique on a metal grating to estimate the resolution capabilities of our system. Moreover, we asses its potential in terms of the number of available independent pixels at full resolution compared to different quantum imaging approaches. Finally, we demonstrate scanning quantum microscopy of onion epithelial cells, paving the way towards scalable quantum microscopy for bio-physical applications. Our results, combined with the rapidly evolving photon-pair generation and detection technology towards the mid-infrared, could lead to an extension of quantum microscopy applications towards the mid-infrared, to access the molecular fingerprint region.</description>

      <title>Single-molecule Scale Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy using Nitrogen-Vacancy Centers in Diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-molecule technology stands as a powerful tool, enabling the characterization of intricate structural and dynamic information that would otherwise remain concealed within the averaged behaviors of numerous molecules. This technology finds extensive application across diverse fields including physics, chemistry, biology, and medicine. Quantum sensing, particularly leveraging nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers within diamond structures, presents a promising avenue for single-molecule magnetic resonance, offering prospects for sensing and imaging technology at the single-molecule level. Notably, while significant strides have been made in single-molecule scale magnetic resonance using NV centers over the past two decades, current approaches still exhibit limitations in magnetic sensitivity, spectral resolution, and spatial resolution. Particularly, the full reconstruction of three-dimensional positions of nuclear spins within single molecules remains an unattained goal. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the current state-of-the-art in single-molecule scale magnetic resonance, encompassing an analysis of various relevant techniques involving NV centers. Additionally, it explores the optimization of technical parameters associated with these methods. This detailed analysis serves as a foundation for the development of new technologies and the exploration of potential applications.</description>

      <title>Extreme-temperature single-particle heat engine</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Carnot famously showed that engine operation is chiefly characterised by the magnitude of the temperature ratio $T_\mathrm{h}/T_\mathrm{c}$ between its hot and cold reservoirs. While temperature ratios ranging between $1.3-2.8$ and $2-10$ are common in macroscopic commercial engines and engines operating in the microscopic regime, respectively, the quest is to test thermodynamics at its extremes. Here we present the hottest engine on earth, with temperature ratios as high as $110$. We achieve this by realising an underdamped single-particle engine using a charged microparticle that is electrically levitated under vacuum conditions. Noisy electric fields are used to synthesise reservoir temperatures in excess of $10^7$ K. As a result, giant fluctuations show up in all thermodynamic quantities of the engine, such as heat exchange and efficiency. Moreover, we find that the particle experiences an effective position dependent temperature, which gives rise to dynamics that drastically deviates from that of standard Brownian motion. We develop a theoretical model accounting for the effects of this multiplicative noise and find excellent agreement with the measured dynamics. The high level of control over the presented experimental platform opens the door to emulate the stochastic dynamics of cellular and biological processes, and provides thermodynamic insight required for the development of nanotechnologies.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional Rashba semiconductors and inversion-asymmetric topological insulators in monolayer Janus MAA'ZxZ'(4-x) family</title>

Abstract: The Rashba effect in Janus structures, accompanied by nontrivial topology, plays an important role in spintronics and even photovoltaic applications. However, less effort has been devoted to searching for the Rashba effect and inversion-asymmetric topological insulators, from the perspective of material design and establishing universal rules. Herein, through first-principles calculations, we systematically investigate the geometric stability and electronic structures of 135 kinds of Janus MAA'ZxZ'(4-x) family derived from two-dimensional MA2Z4 (M=Mg, Ga, Sr; A=Al, Ga; Z=S, Se, Te) monolayers, and design numerous Rashba semiconductors and inversion-asymmetric topological insulators. As the atomic number rises, the bandgaps of Janus MAA'ZxZ'(4-x) decrease continuously from 2.14 eV for MgAl2S3Se. The trend persists until the bandgap, when combined with strong spin-orbit coupling, shrinks to cause band inversion and reopen with nontrivial topology. Especially in specific Janus systems, pz orbitals near the Fermi level, in conjunction with band inversion, could create a hybrid spin texture with double Rashba splitting. Notably, the Rashba effect, nontrivial topological states and unique spin textures can be significantly tuned synchronously through small biaxial strain. Our work not only expands the diverse Janus MAA'ZxZ'(4-x) family with multifunctional application prospects but also reveals the designing rules of Rashba semiconductors and inversion-asymmetric topological insulators.</description>

Abstract: Controlling magnetic states by a small current is essential for the next-generation of energy-efficient spintronic devices. However, it invariably requires considerable energy to change a magnetic ground state of intrinsically quantum nature governed by fundamental Hamiltonian, once stabilized below a phase transition temperature. We report that surprisingly an in-plane current can tune the magnetic state of nm-thin van der Waals ferromagnet Fe3GeTe2 from a hard magnetic state to a soft magnetic state. It is the direct demonstration of the current-induced substantial reduction of the coercive field. This surprising finding is possible because the in-plane current produces a highly unusual type of gigantic spin-orbit torque for Fe3GeTe2. And we further demonstrate a working model of a new nonvolatile magnetic memory based on the principle of our discovery in Fe3GeTe2, controlled by a tiny current. Our findings open up a new window of exciting opportunities for magnetic van der Waals materials with potentially huge impacts on the future development of spintronic and magnetic memory.</description>

Abstract: Robust multi-level spin memory with the ability to write information electrically is a long-sought capability in spintronics, with great promise for applications. Here we achieve nonvolatile and highly energy-efficient magnetization switching in a single-material device formed of van-der-Waals topological ferromagnet Fe3GeTe2, whose magnetic information can be readily controlled by a tiny current. Furthermore, the switching current density and power dissipation are about 400 and 4000 times smaller than those of the existing spin-orbit-torque magnetic random access memory based on conventional magnet/heavy-metal systems. Most importantly, we also demonstrate multi-level states, switched by electrical current, which can dramatically enhance the information capacity density and reduce computing costs. Thus, our observations combine both high energy efficiency and large information capacity density in one device, showcasing the potential applications of the emerging field of van-der-Waals magnets in the field of spin memory and spintronics.</description>

      <title>Broken inversion symmetry in van der Waals topological ferromagnetic metal iron germanium telluride</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14384v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inversion symmetry breaking is critical for many quantum effects and fundamental for spin-orbit torque, which is crucial for next-generation spintronics. Recently, a novel type of gigantic intrinsic spin-orbit torque has been established in the topological van-der-Waals (vdW) magnet iron germanium telluride. However, it remains a puzzle because no clear evidence exists for interlayer inversion symmetry breaking. Here, we report the definitive evidence of broken inversion symmetry in iron germanium telluride directly measured by the second harmonic generation (SHG) technique. Our data show that the crystal symmetry reduces from centrosymmetric P63/mmc to noncentrosymmetric polar P3m1 space group, giving the three-fold SHG pattern with dominant out-of-plane polarization. Additionally, the SHG response evolves from an isotropic pattern to a sharp three-fold symmetry upon increasing Fe deficiency, mainly due to the transition from random defects to ordered Fe vacancies. Such SHG response is robust against temperature, ensuring unaltered crystalline symmetries above and below the ferromagnetic transition temperature. These findings add crucial new information to our understanding of this interesting vdW metal, iron germanium telluride: band topology, intrinsic spin-orbit torque and topological vdW polar metal states.</description>

Abstract: Perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) of magnets is paramount for electrically controlled spintronics due to their intrinsic potentials for higher memory density, scalability, thermal stability and endurance, surpassing an in-plane magnetic anisotropy (IMA). Nickel film is a long-lived fundamental element ferromagnet, yet its electrical transport behavior associated with magnetism has not been comprehensively studied, hindering corresponding spintronic applications exploiting nickel-based compounds. Here, we systematically investigate the highly versatile magnetism and corresponding transport behavior of nickel films. As the thickness reduces within the general thickness regime of a magnet layer for a memory device, the hardness of nickel films' ferromagnetic loop of anomalous Hall effect increases and then decreases, reflecting the magnetic transitions from IMA to PMA and back to IMA. Additionally, the square ferromagnetic loop changes from a hard to a soft one at rising temperatures, indicating a shift from PMA to IMA. Furthermore, we observe a butterfly magnetoresistance resulting from the anisotropic magnetoresistance effect, which evolves in conjunction with the thickness and temperature-dependent magnetic transformations as a complementary support. Our findings unveil the rich magnetic dynamics and most importantly settle down the most useful guiding information for current-driven spintronic applications based on nickel film: The hysteresis loop is squarest for the ~8 nm-thick nickel film, of highest hardness with Rxyr/Rxys~1 and minimum Hs-Hc, up to 125 K; otherwise, extra care should be taken for a different thickness or at a higher temperature.</description>

      <title>All van der Waals three-terminal SOT-MRAM realized by topological ferromagnet Fe3GeTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15020v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic van der Waals (vdW) materials have attracted massive attention because of their academic interest and application potential for the past few years. Its main advantage is the intrinsic two-dimensionality, enabling much smaller devices of novel concepts. One particular exciting direction lies in the current-driven spin-orbit torque (SOT). Here, we, for the first time, realize an all vdW three-terminal SOT memory, employing the unique physics principle of gigantic intrinsic SOT of Fe3GeTe2 (FGT) and the well-known industry-adopted tunnelling magnetoresistance (TMR) effect. We designed the device operation procedure and fabricated the FGT/h-BN/FGT vdW heterostructure as a proof of concept. This device exhibits a classical TMR effect and unambiguously demonstrates the conception by precise performance as expected: the magnetic information of the top-FGT is written by current-driven SOT and read out by TMR separately. The writing and reading current paths are physically decoupled, enhancing the design and optimization flexibility substantially and further strengthening the device's endurance naturally. Our work would prompt more expansive use of vdW magnets for spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Polarization-controlled non-Hermitian metasurfaces for ultra-sensitive terahertz sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00579v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems offer significant advantages in sensor design, especially at the exceptional points. However, the extreme sensitivity near these points poses great challenges due to fabrication errors and system noises, which degrade sensing performance. To address this, we introduce a novel approach leveraging the polarization degrees of freedom in non-Hermitian systems. In this work, we establish a direct relation between the incident polarization and the transmission phase of a coupled metasurface system and achieve the polarization-controlled phase singularity even post-fabrication. The incident polarization angle can be utilized as a sensing index, which enables indirect and accurate measurement. The theoretical approach is experimentally validated using a general design of THz non-Hermitian metasurface sensors. Our method enhances robustness and sensitivity, opening new avenues for practical applications in ultra-sensitive sensing.</description>

      <title>Machine-learning identified nitride quantum wells for enhanced red emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23591v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: III-nitride heterostructures are critical for achieving polychromatic micron-scale pixels in extended-reality and biomedical applications, however red emission remains challenging. Here, we address this challenge by systematically exploring their design space with machine learning. We surprisingly uncover that larger polarization fields globally correlate with higher wave-function overlaps for red emission. The key is the quantum-confined Stark effect, which enables a reduction in well width while avoiding the associated increase in In composition. We outline strategies for engineering polarization fields through the tuning of composition, strain, and interlayer and quantum-barrier thicknesses. Without polarization fields, efficient red emission would not be possible in nitride LEDs given the current challenges in nitride epitaxy. Our results show how polarization can improve light emission from polar semiconductor heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Magnetoelectric effect in van der Waals magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02070v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The magnetoelectric (ME) effect is a fundamental concept in modern condensed matter physics and represents the electrical control of magnetic polarisations or vice versa. Two-dimensional (2D) van-der-Waals (vdW) magnets have emerged as a new class of materials and exhibit novel ME effects with diverse manifestations. This review emphasizes some important recent discoveries unique to vdW magnets: multiferroicity on two dimensions, spin-charge correlation, atomic ME effect and current-induced intrinsic spin-orbit torque, and electrical gating control and magnetic control of their electronic properties. We also highlight the promising route of utilizing quantum magnetic hetero- or homo-structures to engineer the ME effect and corresponding spintronic and optoelectronic device applications. Due to the intrinsic two-dimensionality, vdW magnets with those ME effects are expected to form a new, exciting research direction.</description>
