      <title>Renovating Calculus through Interdisciplinary Partnerships Using the SUMMIT-P Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This review paper highlights research findings from the authors' participation in the SUMMIT-P project, which studied how to build and sustain multi-institutional interdisciplinary partnerships to design and implement curricular change in mathematics courses in the first two years of college, using the Curriculum Foundations Project (CFP) as a launchpad. The CFP interviewed partner discipline faculty to learn about the mathematical needs of their students and how they use mathematics in their courses. This paper summarizes research findings from the CFP and the SUMMIT-P project, and presents a detailed example of how these findings were implemented in the calculus sequence at Augsburg University to improve course focus, increase the relevance of course content, and provide opportunities for student to practice transference of the calculus to disciplinary contexts. This paper is based on the talk "Applied and Active Calculus Built Through Interdisciplinary Partnerships" presented at the 2022 AWM Research Symposium in the Session on "Research on the First Two Years of College Mathematics".</description>

      <title>A non-circular concept of number inspired by Gottlob Frege's definition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gottlob Frege ingeniously presented a purely logical definition of the concept of number. However, one can claim that his definition is, in some way, circular, as it relies on the concept of one-to-one relation. The concept of number only makes sense when it presents the property of projection/reflection or binding. When we consider a number as an abstraction of objects, whatever they may be, saying that a number that belongs to the concept F is the same as that which belongs to the concept G means there is a projection/reflection, or binding, between the objects in F and the objects in G. We present a definition based on both equivalent approaches. First, we introduce the definition based on the relations of projection and reflection; then, we present the definition based on the relation of binding.</description>
