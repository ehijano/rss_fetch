      <title>Extracting Spectral Diffusion in Two-Dimensional Coherent Spectra via the Projection Slice Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A robust and streamlined method is presented for efficiently extracting spectral diffusion from two-dimensional coherent spectra by employing the projection-slice theorem. The method is based on the optical Bloch equations for a single resonance that include a Frequency-Frequency Correlation Function (FFCF) in the time domain. Through the projection slice theorem (PST), analytical formulation of the diagonal and cross-diagonal projections of time-domain two-dimensional spectra are calculated that include the FFCF for arbitrary inhomogeneity. The time-domain projections are Fourier transformed to provide frequency domain slices that can be fit to slices of experimental spectra. Experimental data is used to validate our lineshape analysis and confirm the need for the inclusion of the FFCF for quantum wells that experience spectral diffusion.</description>

      <title>Exceptional Points in Hybrid-Plasmonic Quasiparticles for Ultracompact Modulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current progress in electro-optical modulation within silicon integrated photonics, driven by the unique capabilities of advanced functional materials, has led to significant improvements in device performance. However, inherent constraints in dimensionality and tunability still pose challenges for further innovation. In this work, we propose a strategy that exploits the principles of non-Hermitian physics--specifically, the concept of exceptional points (EPs)--to transcend these limitations and pave the way for the next generation of versatile, high-performance photonic devices. Our multilayer structure supports hybrid plasmonic waveguide modes that can manifest as various orders of quasiparticles. By judiciously setting spatial parameters, the system can be tuned to exhibit both weak and strong coupling regimes between the plasmonic and dielectric modes, leading to the controlled formation of EP degeneracies. Furthermore, the integration of low-loss phase-change materials (Sb2S3 and Sb2Se3) enables dynamic electrical tuning, resulting in pronounced modulation of propagation loss and transmission coefficients over sub-micron distances. This superior performance not only sets a new benchmark for device responsivity and compactness but also opens promising avenues for future research, including the incorporation of gain media for loss compensation at EPs and the exploration of alternative tunable materials for next-generation ultracompact photonic devices.</description>

      <title>Fully Programmable Plasmonic PT-Symmetric Dimer with Epsilon Near Zero and Phase-Change Materials for Integrated Photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As photonic systems progress toward enhanced miniaturization, dynamic reconfigurability, and improved energy efficiency, a central challenge endures: the accurate and independent control of optical losses and resonant properties on scalable, CMOS-compatible platforms. To address this challenge, we present a hybrid plasmonic dimer that functions in a non-Hermitian regime, capitalizing on the synergistic interplay between Epsilon Near Zero (ENZ) materials and phase-change materials (PCMs) to achieve superior reconfigurability through electrical modulation. Our approach harnesses non-Hermitian physics by precisely modulating the loss differential among coupled modes alongside their resonant frequencies, thereby steering the system to an Exceptional Point (EP) characterized by emergent phenomena and enhanced perturbation sensitivity. By integrating ENZ materials to control dissipation with PCMs to fine-tune resonant frequencies, our structure achieves robust programmability, delivering at least 16 distinct operational states for coupled resonators. This capability supports deep subwavelength confinement and transitions between EP and non-EP regimes, while the inherently low power consumption of ENZ materials and PCMs under deep-subwavelength confinement offers significant advantages even in high-dimensional configurations. We believe that this work outlines a significant route for next-generation programmable photonics, delivering subwavelength confinement, energy-efficient operation, and high-dimensional optical reconfigurability within an integrated, scalable, and manufacturable platform.</description>

      <title>Waveguide-Plasmon Polariton Quasiparticles with Exceptional Point Characteristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing complexity of integrated photonics necessitates compact, low-power devices that transcend traditional, material-centric design approaches. In this study, we harness non-Hermitian physics to uncover novel properties of coupled plasmonic waveguide modes exhibiting exceptional point (EP) degeneracy. Our hybrid plasmonic waveguide architecture, capable of supporting both strong and weak coupling regimes between plasmonic and dielectric waveguide modes, is precisely engineered to reach an EP where eigenmodes coalesce. This strategic tuning not only enhances the modal contrast between minimized-loss and highly dissipative states but also enables unprecedented control over device characteristics. Our findings introduce a new paradigm in integrated photonics, paving the way for ultracompact modulators and highly tunable on-chip communication systems with reduced power consumption.</description>

      <title>Gouy Phase-Related Effects in the Free-Space Optical Modulation of Free Electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modulating the free-electron wave function with light brings new opportunities to create attosecond electron pulse trains, to probe the quantum coherence of systems with significantly improved spatial resolution, and to generate classical and non-classical states of light with wide tunability. It is therefore crucial to efficiently generate free-electron wave functions that are suitable for these applications. In this study, we theoretically investigate an efficient free-space optical modulation of free electrons with two counter-propagating Gaussian beams. We find that the Gaussian beams' Gouy phase not only plays a crucial role in the interaction, but also enables straight-forward generation of valuable free-electron states, including comb-shape spectra with similar amplitudes, and states with high degree of coherence. We also discuss the feasibility of demonstrating these Gouy phase-related effects with chirped femto-second laser pulses. Our study establishes a theoretical foundation and physical intuition about the role of the Gouy phase. It can provide guidance to efficiently shape the free-electron wave function for a wide range of quantum applications.</description>

      <title>Ultra-stable lasers using hollow-core fibre</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-stable lasers are fundamental to a growing range of applications, including optical frequency metrology, fundamental physics and quantum sensing. Their outstanding performance is achieved by stabilizing their frequency to Ultra-Low Expansion (ULE) optical cavities. However, the complexity of fabrication and assembly of these systems - even for compact designs - has been limiting their widespread deployment. While micro-resonators and optical fibre delay lines offer alternatives, their performance is significantly limited by thermally-induced frequency drift. Here we demonstrate, for the first time to the best of our knowledge, a laser stabilised to a Hollow Core Fibre (HCF) achieving comparable performance to ULE cavity-stabilised lasers. We achieve a frequency instability of 4.6x10-15 at 1 s and a frequency drift of 88 mHz/s, reducible to 3.7 mHz/s with thermal correction. Furthermore, over 3-year characterization confirms the HCF's predictable long-term behaviour. These results and the simplicity of the HCF-based system pave the way to a high-performance and scalable solution for ultra-stable laser sources.</description>

      <title>Scalar computational primitives with perturbative phase interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe how weak phase modulations applied to classical coherent light in specially modified linear interferometers can be used to perform primitive computational tasks. Instead of encoding operations within a fixed unitary state, the operations are enacted by moving from one state to another. This harnesses the particular phase parametrization of an interferometer, allowing entirely linear optics to produce nonlinear operations such as division and powers. This is due to the nonlinear structure of the underlying phase parametrizations. The realized operations are approximate but can be made more accurate by decreasing the size of the input perturbations. For each operation, the inputs and outputs are changes in phase relative to a fixed bias point. The output phase is ultimately read out as a change in optical power.</description>

      <title>Commissioning of the TeraNet Optical Ground Station Network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: TeraNet is a new three-node OGS network that has been established in Western Australia. The network is built to support a broad range of space missions operating between LEO and the Moon, using both conventional and advanced optical technologies developed at UWA. It is designed to be spacecraft and mission agnostic, able to be adapted for compatibility with spacecraft using a variety of communication and timing protocols. The TN network comprises three ground station nodes, each of which are equipped to support direct-detection, bidirectional optical communication with LEO spacecraft. In addition, each node is focused on the development of a unique advanced optics technology. Specifically: -TN-1 is a 70cm aperture OGS located on the campus of UWA. It uses ultra-sensitive optical detectors and specialised modulation formats to maximise the information recovered from spacecraft at lunar distances. -TN-2 is a 70cm aperture OGS at the Yarragadee Geodetic Observatory 300km North of Perth. It is equipped with a commercial-grade adaptive optics system for efficient single-mode fibre coupling. This enables high-speed coherent communications and ultra-precise coherent timing and positioning between ground and space. -TN-3 is a 43cm aperture mobile OGS node built onto the back of a utility vehicle for rapid, tactical deployment anywhere in the world. It is setup for quantum communication and quantum-assured time transfer and can establish satellite communication links within ten minutes of arriving on site, day or night. In this paper, we report on the results and outcomes of the TN commissioning campaign, including optical communication links with on-orbit spacecraft, the performance of the TN-2 adaptive optics system, the rapid deployment capability of TN-3, remote network operations of all three nodes, and interoperability tests with other OGSs across Australia and New Zealand.</description>

      <title>Moire-enabled optical vortex with tunable topological charge in twisted bilayer photonic crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The orbital angular momentum (OAM) of light is a versatile degree of freedom with transformative impact across optical communication, imaging, and micromanipulation. These applications have motivated a growing demand for compact, reconfigurable vortex arrays with tunable topological charge, yet integrating these functionalities into nanophotonic platforms remains elusive. Among possible strategies to meet this challenge is exploiting the twist degree of freedom in layered structures, which enables both emerging moire physics and unprecedented reconfigurability of photonic and electronic properties. Here, we harness these capabilities in twisted bilayer moire photonic crystals (TBMPCs) to realize vortex array generation with tunable OAM, demonstrated both analytically and experimentally. Central to this advancement is a new class of quasi-bound state in the continuum: Bessel-type modes emerging from moire-induced interlayer coupling, which generate vortex beams with tailored spiral phase distributions. We experimentally demonstrate vortex beams spanning eight OAM orders, from -3 to 4, and achieve selective excitation of distinct topological charges at a fixed telecommunication wavelength by tuning the interlayer separation and twist angle. Furthermore, localized Bessel-type modes at AA stacking regions can be excited nonlocally across the moire superlattice, enabling vortex array generation. Our work offers new insights into moire physics and introduces an innovative approach for future multiplexing technology integrating OAM, wavelength, and spatial division.</description>

      <title>Femtosecond self-diffraction as a measure of the nonlinear response spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self diffraction is a four-wave mixing process proportional to the square modulus of third-order nonlinearity susceptibility $\chi^{(3)}$, which is related to the material's electronic and thermal properties. In this study, we investigate the wavelength dependence of the self-diffracted signal generated by a femtosecond pulsed laser in a dye solution to directly evaluate the electronic third-order nonlinear susceptibility spectrum. By accounting for absorption effects and phase matching conditions, we determine the $\vert\chi^{(3)}\vert$ for different concentrations. Experimental results complemented with theoretical predictions, show that in the low absorption and thin sample limits, the signal reproduce the $\vert\chi^{(3)}\vert$ spectral profile. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of measuring nonlinear susceptibility spectra arising solely from the bound-electronic response across a wide spectral range and for various compounds.</description>

      <title>Illuminating the lantern: coherent, spectro-polarimetric characterisation of a multimode converter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25330v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While photonic lanterns efficiently and uniquely map a set of input modes to single-mode outputs (or vice versa), the optical mode transfer matrix of any particular fabricated device cannot be constrained at the design stage due to manufacturing imperfections. Accurate knowledge of the mapping enables complex sensing or beam control applications that leverage multimode conversion. In this work, we present a characterisation system to directly measure the electric field from a photonic lantern using digital off-axis holography, following its evolution over a 73 nm range near 1550 nm and in two orthogonal, linear polarisations. We provide the first multi-wavelength, polarisation decomposed characterisation of the principal modes of a photonic lantern. Performance of our testbed is validated on a single-mode fibre then harnessed to characterise a 19-port, multicore fibre fed photonic lantern. We uncover the typical wavelength scale at which the modal mapping evolves and measure the relative dispersion in the device, finding significant differences with idealised simulations. In addition to detailing the system, we also share the empirical mode transfer matrices, enabling future work in astrophotonic design, computational imaging, device fabrication feedback loops and beam shaping.</description>

      <title>Radiative local density of states in three-dimensional photonic band-gap crystals to interpret time-resolved emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the spontaneous emission of light in three-dimensional (3D) photonic crystals through theoretical calculations and simulations. It is well known that spontaneous emission depends on the radiative local density of states (RLDOS). Photonic band-gap crystals radically modulate the RLDOS, thereby controlling spontaneous emission. We compare two different methods to calculate the RLDOS: the plane-wave expansion (PWE) method and the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method. The PWE method directly calculates the RLDOS of an infinite photonic crystal, whereas the FDTD method simulates the RLDOS through the power emitted by a dipole in a finite photonic crystal. We demonstrate that the methods yield similar frequency-dependent trends in the RLDOS, with relative differences of less than 12% that originate from the different boundary conditions. We employ the plane-wave expansion method to compute distributions of emission rates that are relevant to many optical experiments where quantum emitters are distributed within a crystal. Such distributions of emission rates enable us to compute and directly interpret the time-resolved decay as observed in experiments. We expect that our results promote the RLDOS to the realm of optical design and products.</description>

      <title>Momentum-resolved reflectivity of a 2D photonic crystal in the near-infrared</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) photonic crystals offer strong control over the propagation of light through their bands. Theoretical methods for computing the band structure in 2D are well-established and fast because 2D photonic crystals are homogeneous in the third dimension. Experimental verification is scarce, however, especially in the telecom range, because real photonic crystals and experimental methods inherently cannot be homogeneous in the third dimension. In this work, we report momentum-resolved reflectivity measurements on photonic crystals that are periodic in two dimensions and homogeneous over a thickness of 5 {\mu}m. Using Fourier spectroscopy, we carefully select wave vectors in the 2D plane of periodicity of the photonic crystal. Our experiments agree excellently with 2D band structure calculations and with 2D finite-difference time-domain simulations, confirming that our experimental methods truly pertain to nanophotonics in 2D. Our results provide a robust bridge between theory and experiment, and our techniques can be readily extended to other 2D structures, including those with functional defects.</description>

      <title>Design of Carrier-Depletion-based Modulators on Commercially Available SOI Substrates of Varying Device-Layer Thickness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compare modulator designs on thick-film and thin-film silicon-on-insulator (SOI) substrates based on the carrier-depletion effect. This effect exhibits a lower junction capacitance as compared to its injection counterparts, leading to a higher electro-optic bandwidth, although the effective refractive index change is low. In this work, commercially available standard SOI substrates with device layer thicknesses of 5 {\mu}m, 3 {\mu}m, and 0.22 {\mu}m are chosen for designing carrier-depletion-based phase shifters, which are then utilized for the design of Mach-Zehnder modulators (MZMs). These MZMs are tested for various on-off-keying (OOK) modulation bit rates employing non-return-to-zero (NRZ) pseudo-random binary signal (PRBS). For the comparison of given designs, we find that the thick-film MZMs, which can provide higher fabrication tolerance and high power handling capabilities, support maximum modulation speeds in the order of a few Gbps, whereas it can go up to 20 Gbps for thin-film MZMs.</description>

Abstract: Measurement technology employing optical interference phenomena such as a fringe pattern or frequency shift has been evolving for more than a century. The systems are being designed better, and their components are being built better. But the major components themselves hardly change. Most modern interferometers rely on the same conventional set of components to separate the electromagnetic field into multiple beams, such as plate optics and beam-splitters. This naturally limits the design scope and thus the potential applicability and performance. However, recent investigations suggest that incorporating novel, higher-dimensional linear-optical splitters in interferometer design can lead to several improvements. In this work, we review the underlying theory of these novel optical scatterers and some demonstrated configurations with enhanced resolution. The basic principles of optical interference and optical phase sensing are discussed in tandem. Emphasis is placed on both familiar and unfamiliar scatterers, such as the maximally-symmetric Grover multiport, whose actions are left unchanged by certain gauge transformations. These higher-dimensional, gauge-invariant multiports embody a new class of building blocks which can tailor optical interference for metrology in unconventional ways.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal control of laser intensity using differentiable programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical techniques for spatiotemporal control can produce laser pulses with custom amplitude, phase, or polarization structure. In nonlinear optics and plasma physics, the use of structured pulses typically follows a forward design approach, in which the efficacy of a known structure is analyzed for a particular application. Inverse approaches, in contrast, enable the discovery of new structures with the potential for superior performance. Here, an implementation of the unidirectional pulse propagation equation that supports automatic differentiation is combined with gradient-based optimization to design structured pulses with features that are advantageous for a range of nonlinear optical and plasma-based applications: (1) a longitudinally uniform intensity over an extended region, (2) a superluminal intensity peak that travels many Rayleigh ranges with constant duration, spot size, and amplitude, and (3) a laser pulse that ionizes a gas to form a uniform column of plasma. In the final case, optimizing the full spatiotemporal structure improves the performance by a factor of 15 compared to optimizing only spatial or only temporal structure, highlighting the advantage of spatiotemporal control.</description>

      <title>Highly efficient wideband and polarization-insensitive SMF-ARF coupling strategy with low back-reflection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a lensed-fiber based coupling strategy for low-loss interconnection between single-mode fibers and anti-resonant fibers. By optimizing structural and geometric parameters, the design simultaneously achieves high coupling efficiency and suppressed back-reflection. Experimental results demonstrate an insertion loss of 1.2 dB and back-reflection of -36.22 dB at 1550 nm, with excellent spectral stability (below 0.72 dB variation across 1500-1600 nm) and polarization insensitivity (below 0.4 dB polarization dependent loss). The compact structure not only facilitates the fabrication process, but also enables seamless ARF integration into existing optical networks, thereby addressing critical demands for high-capacity data transmission.</description>

      <title>Single-Shot All-Optical Switching in CoFeB/MgO Magnetic Tunnel Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate single shot al optical switching (AOS) in rare earth free CoFeB/MgO magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs), a material system widely adopted in spin transfer torque magnetic random access memory (STT MRAM). By tuning the capping layer thickness, we show that precise heat control enables deterministic magnetization reversal from parallel (P) to antiparallel (AP) state. Furthermore, we detect magnetization reversal in a micro scale MTJ device via the tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) effect. Our findings suggest that ultrafast spin transport or dipolar interactions or a combination of both may play essential roles in the switching process. This work represents a significant step toward integrating AOS with MTJ technology.</description>

      <title>Development of a new phase-retrieval algorithm from a single-shot image for X-ray schlieren microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, a new phase-retrieval algorithm from an X-ray schlieren image is proposed. The schlieren method allows phase-contrast imaging with an objective lens and a knife-edge filter placed at the back focal plane of the objective. This method finds a wide range of applications in the visible-light region for transparent specimen visualization. The schlieren contrast does not directly correspond to the phase shift. However, the phase map can be reconstructed from a single-shot schlieren image of a transparent and weak-phase object using the filtered Fourier transform method. A proof-of-principle experiment was performed in the hard-X-ray region at the AR-NE1A beamline of the Photon Factory facility at the High Energy Accelerator Research Organization (KEK).</description>

      <title>Seeing Clearly and Deeply: An RGBD Imaging Approach with a Bio-inspired Monocentric Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Achieving high-fidelity, compact RGBD imaging presents a dual challenge: conventional compact optics struggle with RGB sharpness across the entire depth-of-field, while software-only Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) is an ill-posed problem reliant on unreliable semantic priors. While deep optics with elements like DOEs can encode depth, they introduce trade-offs in fabrication complexity and chromatic aberrations, compromising simplicity. To address this, we first introduce a novel bio-inspired all-spherical monocentric lens, around which we build the Bionic Monocentric Imaging (BMI) framework, a holistic co-design. This optical design naturally encodes depth into its depth-varying Point Spread Functions (PSFs) without requiring complex diffractive or freeform elements. We establish a rigorous physically-based forward model to generate a synthetic dataset by precisely simulating the optical degradation process. This simulation pipeline is co-designed with a dual-head, multi-scale reconstruction network that employs a shared encoder to jointly recover a high-fidelity All-in-Focus (AiF) image and a precise depth map from a single coded capture. Extensive experiments validate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed framework. In depth estimation, the method attains an Abs Rel of 0.026 and an RMSE of 0.130, markedly outperforming leading software-only approaches and other deep optics systems. For image restoration, the system achieves an SSIM of 0.960 and a perceptual LPIPS score of 0.082, thereby confirming a superior balance between image fidelity and depth accuracy. This study illustrates that the integration of bio-inspired, fully spherical optics with a joint reconstruction algorithm constitutes an effective strategy for addressing the intrinsic challenges in high-performance compact RGBD imaging.

      <title>Terahertz Time-Domain Spectroscopy and Density Functional Theory Analysis of Low-Frequency Vibrational Modes of a Benzoxazolium-Coumarin Donor-\pi-Acceptor Chromophore</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To elucidate low-frequency vibrational modes that modulate intramolecular charge transfer (ICT), we investigate a benzoxazolium-coumarin (BCO+) donor-pi-acceptor derivative using transmission terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS). The retrieved complex refractive index reveals distinct modes at 0.62, 0.85, 1.30, 1.81, and 2.07 THz. Gas-phase density functional theory (DFT) agrees with these features and enables assignment of specific intramolecular motions. Together, THz-TDS and DFT identify characteristic low-frequency modes of BCO+ and suggest their connection to ICT-relevant nuclear motions, demonstrating that THz-TDS provides a sensitive probe of vibrational signatures in donor-pi-acceptor systems.</description>

      <title>Second-order Stark shifts exceeding 10$\,$GHz in electrically contacted SiV$^-$ centers in diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Negatively charged silicon vacancy centers (SiV$^-$) in diamond exhibit excellent spin coherence and optical properties, making them promising candidates for quantum technologies. However, the strain-induced inhomogeneous distribution of optical transition frequencies poses a challenge for scalability. We demonstrate electrical tuning of the SiV$^-$ center zero-phonon lines using in-plane contacts to apply moderate electric fields up to 45$\,$MV/m. The second-order Stark shift exceeds 10$\,$GHz, which is of the same order of magnitude as the 15$\,$GHz inhomogeneous distribution of SiV$^-$ observed in emitters embedded in optical nanostructures such as photonic crystal nanocavities. Analysis of individual SiV$^-$ centers shows significant variation in polarizabilities between defects indicating that the polarizability strongly depends on local parameters like strain. The observed polarizabilities are 3-25 times larger than those of tin vacancy centers, which we attribute to valence band resonances that delocalize the $e_u$ wavefunctions. Photoluminescence excitation measurements reveal that optical linewidths increase moderately with applied electric field strength. Our results demonstrate that large electrical Stark shifts can overcome the inhomogeneous distribution of transition frequencies, representing a significant step toward scalable SiV$^-$-based quantum technologies such as quantum repeaters.</description>

      <title>Crystallization Behavior of ZBLAN Glass Under Combined Thermal and Vibrational Effects: Part I -- Experimental Investigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: ZBLAN glass is a promising material for infrared optical fibers due to its wide transmission window and low theoretical attenuation. However, its strong tendency to crystallize during processing limits optical performance. While microgravity environments have been shown to suppress crystallization, the role of mechanical vibration under normal gravity conditions remains poorly understood. This study systematically investigates the influence of vibration on the crystallization behavior of ZBLAN using a controlled heating and vibration apparatus. Samples were subjected to varied thermal and vibrational conditions, and their crystallization onset and morphological evolution were examined through optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Results show that vibration reduces the crystallization onset temperature, indicating enhanced atomic mobility and nucleation kinetics. Progressive morphological transitions from needle-like to bow-tie and feather-like crystals were observed with increasing temperature and vibration intensity. Surface roughness analysis corroborates these findings, revealing a significant increase in nanoscale roughness in crystallized regions. Although brief exposure duration and partial thermal decoupling introduced variability among samples, the overall results confirm that vibration acts as a direct facilitator of nucleation rather than a purely thermal effect. This work provides new insight into vibration-induced crystallization in fluoride glasses and establishes the experimental foundation for follow-up modeling and apparatus optimization studies under terrestrial and microgravity conditions.</description>

Abstract: The polarization of light conveys crucial information about the spatial ordering and optical properties of a specimen. However, precise polarization measurement in challenging conditions, including constrained spaces, low light levels, and high-speed scenarios, remains a severe challenge. Addressing this problem, we introduce a real-time polarization measurement method that is accurate down to a single-photon level and provides complete information about the polarization state. Free of moving components, the polarization sensor utilizes a short rigid piece of few-mode fiber followed by a fiber array and a detector array. The calibration of the sensor relies on a neural network yielding unprecedented accuracy across all polarization states, including partially polarized light. We validate the approach by visualizing the polarization structure of biological specimens and the liquid crystal polymer sample (birefringent USAF test). Our method offers an efficient and reliable solution for real-time polarization sensing and microendoscopy under low-light conditions.</description>

Abstract: The optical truss interferometer (OTI) is a contingent subsystem proposed for the LISA telescopes to aid in the verification of a $1 \frac{\mathrm{pm}}{\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}}$ optical path length stability. Each telescope would be equipped with three pairs of compact fiber-coupled units, each forming an optical cavity with a baseline proportional to the telescope length at different points around the aperture. Employing a Pound-Drever-Hall approach to maintain a modulated laser field on resonance with each cavity, the dimensional stability of the telescope can be measured and verified. We have designed and developed prototype OTI units to demonstrate the capability of measuring stable structures, such as the LISA telescope, with a $1 \frac{\mathrm{pm}}{\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}}$ sensitivity using a set of freely mountable fiber-injected cavities. Aside from its initial motivation for the telescope, the OTI can also be readily integrated with other systems to aid in ground testing experiments. In this paper, we outline our experimental setup, measurement results, and analyses of the noise limitations.</description>

      <title>High-Precision Lunar Corner-Cube Retroreflectors: A Wave-Optics Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06409v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-precision corner-cube retroreflectors (CCRs) are critical for advanced lunar laser ranging (LLR) because they enable sub-millimeter-scale measurements of the Earth-Moon distance -- a level of precision essential for rigorous tests of relativistic gravitation and for advancing our understanding of lunar geophysics. In this work, we develop a comprehensive two-dimensional Fourier-optics model for single CCRs with apertures ranging from 80-110 mm. Our model incorporates realistic thermal-mechanical wavefront errors, detailed diffraction effects, and velocity aberration offsets. Our analysis reveals a strong coupling between aperture size and aberration angular offset: while larger CCRs deliver high on-axis flux under near-ideal conditions, their narrow diffraction lobes suffer significant flux loss at moderate aberration offsets, thereby favoring smaller apertures with broader main lobes. Furthermore, comparisons between solid fused-silica and hollow silicon-carbide (SiC) CCRs show that hollow designs not only achieve competitive or superior photon return -- particularly at 1064 nm, where phase errors are relatively reduced -- but also offer nearly an order-of-magnitude mass reduction for the same aperture sizes. These results establish a robust quantitative framework for optimizing CCR designs to perform at the sub-millimeter level under realistic lunar conditions and underscore the advantages of precision hollow SiC CCRs for next-generation LLR operations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08599v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Squeezed states of light play a key role in quantum-enhanced sensing and continuous-variable quantum information processing. Realizing integrated squeezed light sources is crucial for developing compact and scalable photonic quantum systems. In this work, we demonstrate on-chip broadband vacuum squeezing at telecommunication wavelengths on the thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) platform. Our device integrates periodically poled lithium niobate (PPLN) nanophotonic waveguides with low-loss edge couplers, comprising bilayer inverse tapers and an SU-8 polymer waveguide. This configuration achieves a fiber-to-chip coupling loss of 1.4 dB and a total homodyne detection loss of 4 dB, enabling a measured squeezing level of 1.4 dB. Additional measurements in a more efficient PPLN waveguide (without low-loss couplers) infer an on-chip squeezing level of over 10 dB at a pump power of 62 mW. These results underscore the potential of TFLN platform for efficient and scalable squeezed light generation.</description>

      <title>Fluorescence intensity correlations enable 3D imaging without sample rotations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24386v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lensless X-ray imaging provides element-specific nanoscale insights into thick samples beyond the reach of conventional light and electron microscopy. Coherent diffraction imaging (CDI) methods, such as ptychographic tomography, can recover three-dimensional (3D) nanoscale structures but require extensive sample rotation, adding complexity to experiments. X-ray elastic-scattering patterns from a single sample orientation are highly directional and provide limited 3D information about the structure. In contrast to X-ray elastic scattering, X-ray fluorescence is emitted mostly isotropically. However, first-order spatial coherence has traditionally limited nanoscale fluorescence imaging to single-crystalline samples. Here, we demonstrate that intensity correlations of X-ray fluorescence excited by ultrashort X-ray pulses contain 3D structural information of non-periodic, stationary objects. In our experiment, we illuminated a vanadium foil within a sub-200 nm X-ray laser beam focus. Without changing the sample orientation, we recorded 16 distinct specimen projections using detector regions covering different photon incidence angles relative to the X-ray free-electron laser (FEL) beam. The projections varied systematically as the fluorescing volume was translated along an astigmatism, confirming that FEL-induced fluorescence reflects real-space structural changes. Our results establish a new approach for lensless 3D imaging of non-periodic specimens using fluorescence intensity correlations, with broad implications for materials science, chemistry, and nanotechnology.</description>

Abstract: We utilize few-level model systems to analyze the polarization and phase properties of below-threshold harmonics generated from aligned molecules. In a two-level system, we find that the phase of emitted harmonics undergoes a distinct change. For harmonics with photon energies below the transition energy between the dominant field-dressed states, the phase alternates by $\pi$ between successive odd harmonic orders. In contrast, the phase remains constant for harmonics above the transition energy. Exploiting this behavior, we construct a four-level model composed of two uncoupled two-level systems aligned along orthogonal directions. We demonstrate that with selected transition frequencies lower-order harmonics follow the polarization of the linearly polarized driving field while higher-order harmonics exhibit a mirrored polarization. The model predicts that aligned systems with orthogonal transition dipoles may show analogous phase and polarization features in the below-threshold regime.</description>
