      <title>A Soluble Modified Fermi-Hubbard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recently introduced recurrence-relation ansatz applied to the Bose-Hubbard model is here used in the Fermi-Hubbard model. The resulting modified Fermi-Hubbard model is soluble and exhibits a continuous phase transition (second order) reminiscent of the integer quantum Hall resistance and a ground-state, first-order phase transition.</description>

      <title>Exploring transport mechanisms in an atomic precision advanced manufacturing (APAM) enabled pn junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the different transport mechanisms that can occur in atomically precise advanced-manufacturing (APAM) pn junction devices at cryogenic and room temperatures. We first elucidate the potential cause of the anomalous behaviors observed in the forward-bias response of these devices in recent cryogenic temperature measurements, which deviates from the theoretical response of a silicon Esaki diode. Specifically, the suppression of the tunneling current at low bias and the appearance of regular diode current at lower biases than theoretically expected for silicon. We find that the latter can be attributed to modifications in the electronic band structure within the $\delta$-layer regions, leading to band-gap narrowing induced by the high density of dopants. We also find that a combination of two sets of band-to-band tunneling (BTBT) parameters can qualitatively approximate the shape of the tunneling current at low bias. This can arise from band quantization and realignment due to the strong potential confinement in APAM-doped layers. Finally, we extend our analyses to room temperature operation, and we predict that trap-assisted tunneling (TAT) may become significant, leading to a complex superposition of BTBT and TAT transport mechanisms in the electrical measurements.</description>

      <title>Towards the Scalable Fabrication of thin-film NbTiN CPW KTWPA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kinetic inductance travelling-wave parametric amplifiers (KTWPAs) are emerging as core components in many applications where wideband cryogenic rf amplification at or near the quantum limit of added noise is critical. What is unique about these thin film superconducting devices and what makes them suitable for a wide range of applications is their ability to simultaneously provide large dynamic range and quantum-limited amplification of single photon to 100,000s of photon signals. However, despite the promising performance of co-planar NbTiN thin-film KTWPAs, the original promise of a "simple" single-layer metal fabrication has encountered roadblocks and their broader adoption has been hindered by low fabrication yield. In this work, we present a novel post-lithography correction technique that eliminates short circuits, significantly improving yield and enabling reliable wafer-scale production. Using automated image acquisition, error analysis, and correction, we successfully fabricated operational KTWPAs on high-resistivity silicon, achieving &gt; 10 dB between 2-4 GHz. This approach paves the way for the scaling up manufacturing of KTWPAs, positioning them for widespread deployment in quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Undulation-induced moir\'e superlattices with 1D polarization domains and 1D flat bands in 2D bilayer semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials have a high F\"oppl-von K\'arm\'an number and can be easily bent, much like a paper, making undulations a novel way to design distinct electronic phases. Through first-principles calculations, we reveal the formation of 1D polarization domains and 1D flat electronic bands by 1D bending modulation to a 2D bilayer semiconductor. Using 1D sinusoidal undulation of a hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) bilayer as an example, we demonstrate how undulation induces nonuniform shear patterns, creating regions with unique local stacking and vertical polarization akin to sliding-induced ferroelectrics observed in twisted moir\'e systems. This sliding-induced polarization is also observed in double-wall BN nanotubes due to curvature differences between inner and outer tubes. Furthermore, undulation generates a shear-induced 1D moir\'e pattern that perturbs electronic states, confining them into 1D quantum-well-like bands with kinetic energy quenched in modulation direction while dispersive in other directions (1D flat bands). This electronic confinement is attributed to modulated shear deformation potential resulting from tangential polarization due to the moir\'e pattern. Thus, bending modulation and interlayer shear offer an alternative avenue, termed "curvytronics", to induce exotic phenomena in 2D bilayer materials.</description>

      <title>Quasi-1D Coulomb drag in the nonlinear regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One-dimensional Coulomb drag has been an essential tool to probe the physics of interacting Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids. To date, most experimental work has focused on the linear regime while the predictions for Luttinger liquids beyond the linear response theory remain largely untested. In this letter, we report measurements of momentum transfer induced Coulomb drag between vertically-coupled quasi-one-dimensional quantum wires in the nonlinear regime. Measurements were performed at ultra-low temperatures between wires only 15 nm apart. Our results reveal a nonlinear dependence of the drag voltage as a function of the drive current superimposed with an oscillatory contribution, in agreement with theoretical predictions for Coulomb drag between Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids. Additionally, the observed current-voltage ($I$-$V$) characteristics exhibit a nonmonotonic temperature dependence, further corroborating the presence of non-Fermi-liquid behavior in our system. These findings are observed both in the single and in the multiple subband regimes and in the presence of disorder, extending the onset of this behavior beyond the clean single channel Tomonaga-Luttinger regime where the predictions were originally formulated.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Tuning of Single-Photon Emission in Monolayer WSe2 via Localized Strain Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials have emerged as promising candidates for next-generation integrated single-photon emitters (SPEs). However, significant variability in the emission energies of 2D SPEs presents a major challenge in producing identical single photons from different SPEs, which may become crucial for various quantum applications including quantum information processing. Although various approaches to dynamically tuning the emission energies of 2D SPEs have been developed to address the issue, the practical solution to matching multiple individual SPEs in a single 2D flake is still scarce. In this work, we demonstrate a precise emission energy tuning of individual SPEs in a WSe2 monolayer. Our approach utilizes localized strain fields near individual SPEs, which we control independently by adjusting the physical volume of an SU-8-based stressor layer via focused laser annealing. This technique allows continuous emission energy tuning of up to 15 meV while maintaining the qualities of SPEs. Additionally, we showcase the precise spectral alignment of three distinct SPEs in a single WSe2 monolayer to the same wavelength. The tunability of 2D SPEs represents a solid step towards the on-chip integrated photonics with 2D materials for quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Anomalous conductance steps in 3D TI HgTe-based quantum point contacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17786v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore electrical transport through a point contact in strained HgTe, a three-dimensional topological insulator. In the absence of a magnetic field $B$, there is no quantization. However, under higher magnetic fields, we observe distinct non-integer conductance steps. Based on numerical tight-binding calculations and a phenomenological Landauer-B\"uttiker approach, we attribute these atypical, non-integer quantized plateaus to significant scattering effects at the point contact.</description>

      <title>Polarimetry With Spins in the Solid State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability for optically active media to rotate the polarization of light is the basis of polarimetry, an illustrious technique responsible for many breakthroughs in fields as varied as astronomy, medicine and material science. Here, we recast the primary mechanism for spin readout in semiconductor-based quantum computers, Pauli spin-blockade (PSB), as the natural extension of polarimetry to the third dimension. We perform polarimetry with spins through a silicon quantum dot exchanging a hole with a boron acceptor, demonstrating the role of spin-orbit coupling in creating spin misalignment. Perfect spin alignment may be recovered by means of rotating the applied magnetic-field orientation. This work shows how spin misalignment sets a fundamental upper limit for the spin readout fidelity in quantum-computing systems based on PSB.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear electron transport induced by polarized terahertz radiation is studied in two-dimensional tellurene at room temperature. A direct current, quadratic in the radiation's electric field, is observed. Contributions sensitive to radiation helicity, polarization orientation as well as polarization independent current are found. We show that these contributions can be modified by the magnitude of the external gate potential. We demonstrate that this terahertz-driven electric current arises from the Berry curvature dipole and the side-jump microscopic mechanisms.Nonlinear electron transport induced by polarized terahertz radiation is studied in two-dimensional tellurene at room temperature.

      <title>Positive oscillating magnetoresistance in a van der Waals antiferromagnetic semiconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In all van der Waals layered antiferromagnetic semiconductors investigated so far a negative magnetoresistance has been observed in vertical transport measurements, with characteristic trends that do not depend on applied bias. Here we report vertical transport measurements on layered antiferromagnetic semiconductor CrPS$_4$ that exhibit a drastically different behavior, namely a strongly bias dependent, positive magnetoresistance that is accompanied by pronounced oscillations for devices whose thickness is smaller than 10 nm. We establish that this unexpected behavior originates from transport being space-charge limited, and not injection limited as for layered antiferromagetic semiconductors studid earlier. Our analysis indicates that the positive magnetoresistance and the oscillations only occur when electrons are injected into in-gap defect states, whereas when electrons are injected into the conduction band the magnetoresistance vanishes. We propose a microscopic explanation for the observed phenomena that combines concepts typical of transport through disordered semiconductors with known properties of the CrPS$_4$ magnetic state, which captures all basic experimental observations. Our results illustrate the need to understand in detail the nature of transport through vdW magnets, to extract information about the nature of the order magnetic states and its microscopic properties.</description>

      <title>Boundary topological insulators and superconductors of Altland-Zirnbauer tenfold classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a class of systems, there are gapped boundary-localized states described by a boundary Hamiltonian. The topological classification of gapped boundary Hamiltonians can lead to the emergence of boundary topological insulators (TIs) and superconductors (TSCs). In this work, we present a theoretical study of boundary TIs and TSCs of the full Altland-Zirnbauer tenfold symmetry classes. Based on the boundary projection analyses for a d-dimensional Dirac continuum model, we demonstrate that nontrivial boundary topology can arise at a (d-n)-dimensional boundary if the Dirac model incorporates (n+1) mass terms with 0&lt;n&lt;d. Furthermore, we present a unified criterion for the emergence of nontrivial boundary topology within the context of the Dirac model. Inspired by the Dirac continuum model analysis, we further construct bulk lattice Hamiltonians for realizing boundary TIs and TSCs of the full Altland-Zirnbauer tenfold symmetry classes, which enables the realization of higher-order TIs and TSCs in arbitrary dimensions with arbitrary orders. We analyze some typical examples of the constructed boundary TIs and TSCs in physical dimensions.</description>

      <title>A family of third-order topological insulators from Su-Schrieffer-Heeger stacking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a family of chiral symmetry-protected third-order topological insulators by stacking Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chains and provide a unified topological characterization by a series of Bott indices. Our approach is informed by the analytical solution of corner states for the model Hamiltonians written as a summation of the extended SSH model along three orthogonal directions. By utilizing the generalized Pauli matrices, an enumeration of the constructed model Hamiltonians generates ten distinct models, including the well-studied three-dimensional Benalcazar-Bernevig-Hughes model. By performing a boundary projection analysis for the ten models, we find that certain surfaces and hinges of the systems can exhibit, respectively, nontrivial second-order and first-order topology in the phase of the third-order topological insulators. Furthermore, we analyze the phase diagram for one of the predicted models and reveal a rich set of topological phases, including the third-order topological insulators, second-order weak topological insulators, and second-order nodal semimetals.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric performance of a minimally nonlinear voltage probe and voltage-temperature probe heat engine with broken time-reversal symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the thermoelectric performance of a voltage probe and voltage-temperature probe minimally nonlinear irreversible heat engine with broken time-reversal symmetry by considering extended Onsager relations, where a nonlinear power dissipation term ($-\gamma_h{J_L^N}^2$) is added to the heat current. The analytical expressions for efficiency at a given power and efficiency at maximum power, in terms of asymmetry parameters and generalized figures of merit, are derived and analyzed. Our analysis with broken time-reversal symmetry and nonlinear effect reveals two universal bounds on the efficiency at maximum power (EMP) that overshoot the Curzon-Ahlborn (CA) limit. Although the analytical expressions of the bounds on EMP look similar, their respective Carnot efficiency and the asymmetry parameter set the difference between these heat engines which can be proved numerically. We consider a triple-dot Aharonov-Bohm heat engine with a voltage probe and voltage-temperature probe for our numerical simulation experiment. Unlike the voltage probe, the voltage-temperature probe heat engine requires an anisotropy in the system in addition to the magnetic field to break the time-reversal symmetry. In both probe cases, we observe high efficiency with low output power when the tunneling strength $t$ is less than the coupling strength $\gamma$ and vice-versa for $t&gt;\gamma$. Our numerical experiment demonstrates that the efficiency at maximum output power and efficiency at a given power can be enhanced by increasing the power dissipation strength ($\gamma_h$) although the output power remains unaffected. The added nonlinear term helps us to surpass the CA limit of the upper bound on efficiency at maximum power for both cases with and without time-reversal symmetry.</description>

Abstract: In the long-wavelength limit, Bloch-band Berry curvature has no effect on the bulk plasmons of a two-dimensional electron system. In this Letter we show instead that bulk plasmons are a probe of real-space topology. In particular, we focus on orbital Skyrme textures in twisted transition metal dichalcogenides, presenting detailed semiclassical and quantum mechanical calculations of the optical conductivity and plasmon spectrum of twisted ${\rm MoTe}_2$.</description>

      <title>Telecom-wavelength Single-photon Emitters in Multi-layer InSe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of robust and efficient single photon emitters (SPEs) at telecom wavelengths is critical for advancements in quantum information science. Two-dimensional (2D) materials have recently emerged as promising sources for SPEs, owing to their high photon extraction efficiency, facile coupling to external fields, and seamless integration into photonic circuits. In this study, we demonstrate the creation of SPEs emitting in the 1000 to 1550 nm near-infrared range by coupling 2D indium selenide (InSe) with strain-inducing nanopillar arrays. The emission wavelength exhibits a strong dependence on the number of layers. Hanbury Brown and Twiss experiments conducted at 10 K reveal clear photon antibunching, confirming the single-photon nature of the emissions. Density-functional-theory calculations and scanning-tunneling-microscopy analyses provide insights into the electronic structures and defect states, elucidating the origins of the SPEs. Our findings highlight the potential of multilayer 2D metal monochalcogenides for creating SPEs across a broad spectral range, paving the way for their integration into quantum communication technologies.</description>

      <title>Phosphorus Nanotubes from Chemical Cleavage</title>

Abstract: We propose a strategy to make phosphorus nanotubes from two well-known phosphorus allotropes: violet phosphorus and red phosphorus. First-principles calculations show that doping with sulfur dissociates the covalent bonds between tubular phosphorus structures that form bilayers in these allotropes, resulting in free-standing 1D nanotubes. Due to the substitutional nature of the sulfur dopant, the resulting 1D structure is linear, unlike the helical ring structure studied previously. The sulfur sites are situated periodically along the 1D nanotubes and can be further functionalized. Our results show that the S-doped phosphorus nanotube can sustain a tensile strain of up to 18%. The strain also substantially modifies the electronic band gap and the effective mass of carriers. Calculations using the many-body Green's functions (GW) and the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) approaches reveal a large exciton binding energy of 1.57 eV. The one-dimensional nature, linearity, functionalizability, mechanical flexibility, tunability of electronic properties, and large exciton binding energy make this material interesting for applications in optoelectronic devices, solar cells, chemical sensors, and quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Universal Entanglement Revival of Topological Origin</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have analyzed the dynamics of entanglement in dissipative fermionic and bosonic Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) models and found that, when the decoherence channel preserves the chiral symmetry, they exhibit a revival of entanglement in a wide range of parameters. This behavior only emerges in the topological phase, with the visibility of the revival dropping to zero at the phase boundary. Furthermore, the revival acquires a universal character once the system size exceeds the localization length of the edge modes. Our findings indicate that the universal entanglement revival has its origin in the topological properties of the SSH model. These dynamical properties may be experimentally accessible, for example, using photonic quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Exploring structure diversity in atomic resolution microscopy with graph neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of deep learning (DL) has provided great opportunities for the high-throughput analysis of atomic-resolution micrographs. However, the DL models trained by image patches in fixed size generally lack efficiency and flexibility when processing micrographs containing diversified atomic configurations. Herein, inspired by the similarity between the atomic structures and graphs, we describe a few-shot learning framework based on an equivariant graph neural network (EGNN) to analyze a library of atomic structures (e.g., vacancies, phases, grain boundaries, doping, etc.), showing significantly promoted robustness and three orders of magnitude reduced computing parameters compared to the image-driven DL models, which is especially evident for those aggregated vacancy lines with flexible lattice distortion. Besides, the intuitiveness of graphs enables quantitative and straightforward extraction of the atomic-scale structural features in batches, thus statistically unveiling the self-assembly dynamics of vacancy lines under electron beam irradiation. A versatile model toolkit is established by integrating EGNN sub-models for single structure recognition to process images involving varied configurations in the form of a task chain, leading to the discovery of novel doping configurations with superior electrocatalytic properties for hydrogen evolution reactions. This work provides a powerful tool to explore structure diversity in a fast, accurate, and intelligent manner.</description>

      <title>Spin-to-charge conversion in orthorhombic RhSi topological semimetal crystalline thin films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rise of non-magnetic topological semimetals, which provide a promising platform for observing and controlling various spin-orbit effects, has led to significant advancements in the field of topological spintronics. RhSi exists in two distinct polymorphs: cubic and orthorhombic crystal structures. The noncentrosymmetric B20 cubic structure has been extensively studied for hosting unconventional multifold fermions. In contrast, the orthorhombic structure, which crystallizes in the Pnma space group (No. 62), remains less explored and belongs to the family of topological Dirac semimetals. In this work, we investigate the structural, magnetic, and electrical properties of RhSi textured-epitaxial films grown on Si(111) substrates, which crystallize in the orthorhombic structure. We investigate the efficiency of pure spin current transport across RhSi/permalloy interfaces and the subsequent spin-to-charge current conversion via inverse spin Hall effect measurements. The xperimentally determined spin Hall conductivity in orthorhombic RhSi reaches a maximum value of 126 ($\hbar$/e)($\Omega$.cm)$^{-1}$ at 10 K, which aligns reasonably well with first-principles calculations that attribute the spin Hall effect in RhSi to the spin Berry curvature mechanism. Additionally, we demonstrate the ability to achieve a sizable spin-mixing conductance (34.7 nm$^{-2}$) and an exceptionally high interfacial spin transparency of 88$%$ in this heterostructure, underlining its potential for spin-orbit torque switching applications. Overall, this study broadens the scope of topological spintronics, emphasizing the controlled interfacial spin-transport processes and subsequent spin-to-charge conversion in a previously unexplored topological Dirac semimetal RhSi/ferromagnet heterostructure.</description>

Abstract: Controlling the symmetry of optical and mechanical waves is pivotal to their full exploitation in technological applications and topology-linked fundamental physics experiments. Leveraging on the control of orbital angular momentum, we introduce here a device forming super-high-frequency-modulated optical vortex beams via acousto-optic interaction of light with acoustic vortices. Originated by shape-engineering of a single-contact bulk acoustic wave resonator, we generate vortices in a wide band of frequencies around 4 GHz and with frequency/geometrically tunable topological charge from 1 to 13 and beyond. With all electrical control and on-chip integration our device offers new solutions for angular-momentum-based light communication, three-dimensional particle manipulation, as well as novel interaction schemes for optomechanical devices.</description>

      <title>Learning the dynamics of Markovian open quantum systems from experimental data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a Bayesian algorithm to identify generators of open quantum system dynamics, described by a Lindblad master equation, that are compatible with measured experimental data. The algorithm, based on a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach, assumes the energy levels of the system are known and outputs a ranked list of interpretable master equation models that produce predicted measurement traces that closely match experimental data. We benchmark our algorithm on quantum optics experiments performed on single and pairs of quantum emitters. The latter case opens the possibility of cooperative emission effects and additional complexity due to the possible interplay between photon and phonon influences on the dynamics. Our algorithm retrieves various minimal models that are consistent with the experimental data, and which can provide a closer fit to measured data than previously suggested and physically expected approximate models. Our results represent an important step towards automated systems characterisation with an approach that is capable of working with diverse and tomographically incomplete input data. This may help with the development of theoretical models for unknown quantum systems as well as providing scientists with alternative interpretations of the data that they might not have originally envisioned and enabling them to challenge their original hypotheses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.07640v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantization of the two terminal conductance in 2D topological systems is justified by the Landauer-Buttiker (LB) theory that assumes perfect point contacts between single channel leads and the sample. We examine this assumption in a microscopic model of a Chern insulator connected to leads, using the nonequilibrium Green's function formalism. We find that the currents are localized both in the leads and in the insulator and enter and exit the insulator only near the corners. The contact details do not matter and a single channel with perfect contact is emergent, thus justifying the LB theory. The quantized two-terminal conductance shows interesting finite-size effects and dependence on system-reservoir coupling.</description>

      <title>Room Temperature Magnetic Skyrmions in Gradient-Composition Engineered CoPt Single Layers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09632v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topologically protected magnetic skyrmions in magnetic materials are stabilized by interfacial or bulk Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI). Interfacial DMI decays with increase of the magnetic layer thickness in just a few nanometers and bulk DMI typically stabilizes magnetic skyrmions at low temperatures. Consequently, more flexibility in manipulation of DMI is required for utilizing nanoscale skyrmions in energy efficient memory and logic devices at room temperature (RT). Here, we demonstrate the observation of RT skyrmions stabilized by gradient DMI (g-DMI) in composition gradient engineered CoPt single layer films by employing topological Hall effect, magnetic force microscopy, and nitrogen vacancy scanning magnetometry. Skyrmions remain stable at a wide range of applied magnetic fields and are confirmed to be nearly Bloch-type from micromagnetic simulation and analytical magnetization reconstruction. Furthermore, we observe skyrmion pairs which may be explained by skyrmion-antiskyrmion interactions. Our findings expand the family of magnetic materials hosting RT magnetic skyrmions by tuning g-DMI via gradient polarity and choice of magnetic elements.</description>

      <title>Skew scattering and ratchet effect in photonic graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03132v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present paper is devoted to a comprehensive theoretical study of asymmetric (skew) scattering in photonic graphene, with the main focus on its realization with semiconductor microcavity exciton-polaritons. As an important consequence of the skew scattering, we prove the appearance of the ratchet effect in this system. Triangular defects in the form of missing micropillars in a regular honeycomb lattice are considered as ones that break the spatial inversion symmetry, thus providing the possibility of the ratchet effect. By means of the numerical solution of the effective Schr\"odinger equation, we provide microscopical insight into the process of skew scattering and determine indicatrices, cross-sections, and asymmetry parameters. In a system with multiple coherently oriented triangular defects, a macroscopic ratchet effect occurs as a unidirectional flux upon noise-like initial conditions. Our study broadens the concept of ratchet phenomena in the field of photonics and optics of exciton-polaritons.</description>

      <title>Linear response of a Chern insulator to finite-frequency electric fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14601v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the macroscopic charge and current densities of a Chern insulator initially occupying its electronic ground state as it responds to a finite-frequency electric field; we use a previously developed formalism based on microscopic polarization and magnetization fields in extended media. In a topologically trivial insulator, our result reduces to the familiar expression for the induced current density in linear response obtained from a Kubo analysis. But for a Chern insulator we find an extra "topological" term involving the (first) Chern number associated with the occupied bands, encoding the quantum anomalous Hall effect in the presence of a frequency-dependent electric field. While an analogous term has been introduced in the "modern theories of polarization and magnetization" for the linear response of finite-sized systems to static electric fields, our expression is valid for bulk Chern insulators in the presence of both static and finite-frequency electric fields, being derived analytically from a microscopic treatment of the electronic degrees of freedom, and can be generalized in a straightforward way to describe the response of a Chern insulator to electromagnetic fields that are not only frequency-dependent but also spatially inhomogeneous.</description>

      <title>Interband contributions to nonlinear transport in semiconductor nanostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16639v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spin-orbit interaction (SOI) is a crucial ingredient for many potential applications of quantum devices, such as the use of semiconductor nanostructures for quantum computing. It is known that nonlinear conductivities are sensitive to the strength and type of SOI, however, many calculations of nonlinear transport coefficients are based on the semiclassical Boltzmann theory and make simplifying assumptions about scattering effects due to disorder. In this paper we develop and employ a microscopic theory based on the Keldysh formalism that goes beyond simple semiclassical approximations. This approach, for instance, naturally takes into account the effects of interband transitions, Berry curvature, and allows for a more precise treatment of impurity scattering. As a test of this formalism, we consider the nonlinear transport properties in an effective two-band model of one-dimensional nanowires (1DNWs) and two-dimensional hole gases (2DHGs) in the presence of a magnetic field causing Zeeman splittings of the spin states. We find that the small energy scales in nanostructures mean that interband contributions can be relevant, especially in the dirty limit, and therefore could modify qualitative features found using a purely semiclassical approach. Nonetheless, we find that different types of SOI (linear or cubic) still result in remarkably pronounced different in-plane field angle dependences, which survive even when interband effects are relevant. Our results provide a detailed understanding of when interband effects become important for nonlinear transport and can serve as the basis for a microscopic description to predict other nonlinear transport effects in materials and devices.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Non-linear Response by Manipulating the Dirac Point in the (111) LaTiO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ Interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07706v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tunable spin-orbit interaction (SOI) is an important feature for future spin-based devices. In the presence of a magnetic field, SOI induces an asymmetry in the energy bands, which can produce non-linear transport effects ($V\sim I^2$). Here, we focus on such effects to study the role of SOI in the (111) LaTiO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interface. This system is a convenient platform for understanding the role of SOI since it exhibits a single-band Hall-response through the entire gate-voltage range studied. We report a pronounced rise in the non-linear resistance at a critical in-plane field $H_{cr}$. This rise disappears with a small out-of-plane field. We explain these results by considering the location of the Dirac point formed at the crossing of the spin-split energy bands. An in-plane magnetic field pushes this point outside of the Fermi surface, and consequently changes the symmetry of the Fermi contours and intensifies the non-linear transport. An out-of-plane magnetic field opens a gap at the Dirac point, thereby significantly diminishing the non-linear effects. We propose that magnetoresistance effects previously reported in interfaces with SOI could be comprehended within our suggested scenario.</description>

      <title>Effect of Substrate on Spin-Wave Propagation Properties in Ferrimagnetic Thulium Iron Garnet Thin Films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10740v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rare-earth iron garnets have distinctive spin-wave (SW) properties such as low magnetic damping and long SW coherence length making them ideal candidates for magnonics. Among them, thulium iron garnet (TmIG) is a ferrimagnetic insulator with unique magnetic properties including perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) and topological hall effect at room temperature when grown down to a few nanometers, extending its application to magnon spintronics. Here, the SW propagation properties of TmIG films (thickness of 7-34 nm) grown on GGG and sGGG substrates are studied at room temperature. Magnetic measurements show in-plane magnetic anisotropy for TmIG films grown on GGG and out-of-plane magnetic anisotropy for films grown on sGGG substrates with PMA. SW electrical transmission spectroscopy measurements on TmIG/GGG films unveil magnetostatic surface spin waves (MSSWs) propagating up to 80 um with a SW group velocity of 2-8 km s^-1. Intriguingly, these MSSWs exhibit nonreciprocal propagation, opening new applications in SW functional devices. TmIG films grown on sGGG substrates exhibit forward volume spin waves with a reciprocal propagation behavior up to 32 um.</description>

Abstract: We present a method for the additive fabrication of planar magnetic nanoarrays with minimal surface roughness. Synthesis is accomplished by combining electron-beam lithography, used to generate nanometric patterned masks, with ion implantation in thin films. By implanting $^{56}$Fe$^{+}$ ions, we are able to introduce magnetic functionality in a controlled manner into continuous Pd thin films, achieving 3D spatial resolution down to a few tens of nanometers. Our results demonstrate the application of this technique in fabricating square artificial spin ice lattices, which exhibit well-defined magnetization textures and interactions among the patterned magnetic elements.</description>

Abstract: The diffusion motions of individual polymer aggregates in disordered porous media were visualized using the single particle tracking (SPT) method because the motions inside porous media play important roles in various fields of science and engineering. The aggregates diffused on the surfaces of pores; continuous adsorption and desorption processes were obserbed. The relationship between the size of the aggregates and pore size was analysed based on diffusion coefficients, moment scaling spectrum (MSS) slope, and diffusion anisotropy analyisies. The obtained diffusion coefficients were different for different the aggregate and pore sizes. The MSS Slope analysis indicated that more than 85% of the aggregates were confined diffusion for all the conditions investigated. The diffusion anisotropies analysis suggested that the diffusions of the aggregates were anisotropic. The interactions between the aggregates and the pores were complex and exhibited different motions than surface diffusion of smooth surfaces.</description>
