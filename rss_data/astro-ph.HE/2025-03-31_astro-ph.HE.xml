      <title>A follow-up strategy enabling discovery of electromagnetic counterparts to highly-magnified gravitationally-lensed gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Making an unambiguous detection of lensed gravitational waves is challenging with current generation detectors due to large uncertainties in sky localisations and other inferred parameter distributions. However, in the case of binary neutron star (BNS) mergers this challenge can be overcome by detecting multiple images of its lensed kilonova counterpart, simultaneously confirming the lensing nature of the event and locating it precisely - further enabling a wealth of lensed multimessenger science. Such a strategy demands answers to two key problems: 1) How can candidate lensed BNS events be identified fast enough to ensure the lensed kilonova is still detectable? 2) What is the most economical observing strategy on telescope time for following up candidate lensed events to discover lensed kilonovae? This article will discuss solutions to both points, specifically: how GW detections of progenitors in the $\sim$ 2.5 to 5 $M_\odot$ black hole "mass gap" can be interpreted as candidate lensed BNS events, giving evidence for lensing from just a single detection, and will present a strategy that can actively be employed for follow-up of such events in the O4 run of LVK and beyond.</description>

      <title>Accelerating LISA inference with Gaussian processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Source inference for deterministic gravitational waves is a computationally demanding task in LISA. In a novel approach, we investigate the capability of Gaussian Processes to learn the posterior surface in order to reconstruct individual signal posteriors. We use GPry, which automates this reconstruction through active learning, using a very small number of likelihood evaluations, without the need for pretraining. We benchmark GPry against the cutting-edge nested sampler nessai, by injecting individually three signals on LISA noisy data simulated with Balrog: a white dwarf binary (DWD), a stellar-mass black hole binary (stBHB), and a super-massive black hole binary (SMBHB). We find that GPry needs $\mathcal O(10^{-2})$ fewer likelihood evaluations to achieve an inference accuracy comparable to nessai, with Jensen-Shannon divergence $D_{\scriptscriptstyle \mathrm{JS}} \lesssim 0.01$ for the DWD, and $D_{\scriptscriptstyle \mathrm{JS}} \lesssim 0.05$ for the SMBHB. Lower accuracy is found for the less Gaussian posterior of the stBHB: $D_{\scriptscriptstyle \mathrm{JS}} \lesssim 0.2$. Despite the overhead costs of GPry, we obtain a speed-up of $\mathcal O(10^2)$ for the slowest cases of stBHB and SMBHB. In conclusion, active-learning Gaussian process frameworks show great potential for rapid LISA parameter inference, especially for costly likelihoods, enabling suppression of computational costs without the trade-off of approximations in the calculations.</description>

      <title>The Type I Superluminous Supernova Catalogue II: Spectroscopic Evolution in the Photospheric Phase, Velocity Measurements, and Constraints on Diversity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) are among the most energetic explosions in the universe, reaching luminosities up to 100 times greater than those of normal supernovae. Detailed spectral analysis hold the potential to reveal their progenitors and underlying energy sources. This paper presents the largest compilation of SLSN photospheric spectra to date, encompassing data from ePESSTO+, the FLEET search and all published spectra up to December 2022. The dataset includes a total of 974 spectra of 234 SLSNe. By constructing average phase binned spectra, we find SLSNe initially exhibit high temperatures (10000 to 11000 K), with blue continua and weak lines. A rapid transformation follows, as temperatures drop to 5000 to 6000 K by 40 days post peak, leading to stronger P-Cygni features. These averages also suggest a fraction of SLSNe may contain some He at explosion. Variance within the dataset is slightly reduced when defining the phase of spectra relative to explosion, rather than peak, and normalising to the population's median e-folding time. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) supports this, requiring fewer components to explain the same level of variation when binning data by scaled days from explosion, suggesting a more homogeneous grouping. Using PCA and K-Means clustering, we identify outlying objects with unusual spectroscopic evolution and evidence for energy input from interaction, but find not support for groupings of two or more statistically significant subpopulations. We find Fe II {\lambda}5169 lines velocities closely track the radius implied from blackbody fits, indicating formation near the photosphere. We also confirm a correlation between velocity and velocity gradient, which can be explained if all SLSNe are in homologous expansion but with different scale velocities. This behaviour aligns with expectations for an internal powering mechanism.</description>

      <title>Supermassive black holes stripping a subgiant star down to its helium core: a new type of multi-messenger source for LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Some stars orbiting supermassive black holes (SMBH) are expected to undergo a gravitational-wave (GW)-driven inspiral and initiate mass transfer on nearly circular orbits. However, the stability and duration of such phases remain unexplored. In this work, we focus on the evolution of a low-mass, radiative-envelope subgiant star being stripped by an SMBH. We find that such systems can undergo a long-lasting, stable mass-transfer phase, even if none of the angular momentum of the transferred material returns to the orbit to counterbalance the GW-driven decay. We show an example where a 2 Msun subgiant is stripped before entering the LISA band and loses almost its entire hydrogen envelope. The remaining helium core undergoes a prolonged GW-driven inspiral, becoming a loud LISA source. If formed in our galaxy, the system would be detectable for several hundred thousand years, ultimately reaching extreme signal-to-noise ratios of a million. Hydrogen shell flashes in the residual envelope cause temporary radial expansions of the stripped star. As a result, a few additional phases of rapid mass transfer occur at orbital periods of 20 - 30 hours. Eventually, the core possibly undergoes circular partial tidal disruption at an orbital period of ~10 minutes, corresponding to a GW emission frequency of a few mHz. We estimate a chance of about 1% that such a detectable LISA source exists in our own galactic center. The loud final GW transient may lead to a few detections reaching as far as ~1 Gpc, including, e.g., the Abell clusters.</description>

      <title>Exploring sub-GeV Dark Matter Physics with Cosmic Ray and Future Telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If sub-GeV Dark matter(DM) annihilates to the charged particles such as $e^+ e^-$, $\mu^+ \mu^-$, or $\pi^+ \pi^-$, it generates an additional source of electrons and positrons in the cosmic ray (CR) population within our Milky Way. During propagation, these secondary electrons and positrons undergo reacceleration processes, boosting their energies to the GeV scale. Observatories like AMS-02 can detect these high-energy particles, enabling constraints on the properties of sub-GeV DM. By analyzing AMS-02 electron and positron data, the 95\% upper limits on the DM annihilation cross-section have been established in the range of $10^{-28}$ to $10^{-27}$ cm$^3\,$s$^{-1}$, corresponding to DM masses ranging from 100 MeV to 1 GeV. Meanwhile, MeV telescopes will provide complementary constraints on DM properties by detecting photon emissions from such annihilation processes. Notably, the sensitivity of future MeV gamma-ray observatories is projected to approach or match the constraints derived from CR data.</description>

      <title>Discern Misclassified flat-spectrum radio quasars from low-frequency peaked BL Lacertae objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A sample of 312 low-frequency peaked BL Lacertae objects (LBLs) and 694 flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) with the parameters both redshift and $\gamma$-ray photon spectral index ($\Gamma _\gamma$) is compiled from the active galactic nuclei (AGNs) Catalog Data Release 2 (4LAC-DR2) from Fermi-LAT. The multi-wavelength data of the sample sources are downloaded from the Space Science Data Center (SSDC), and then match the corresponding gamma-ray data from 4FGL-DR2. The synchrotron radiation peak frequency and Compton dominance (CD) parameters of the sources are obtained by using a log-parabolic to fit the average-state multi-wavelength spectral energy distribution. A support vector machine (SVM) in the $\log L_\gamma$-$\Gamma_\gamma$ frame is utilized to delineate the optimal boundary between FSRQs and LBLs sources. The 1$\sigma$ position of the Gaussian fitting on the histograms of the $\Gamma_\gamma$, $\log \nu^{syn}_{peak}$, and CD parameter distributions are also introduced. In the criterion, 25 FSRQ candidates are selected from LBL sample sources. The optical spectral identification result confirms that 8 out of 13 candidate sources available with the optical spectral data exhibit the relationship of $EW &gt; 5 \mathring{\mathrm{A}}$.</description>

      <title>The persistent nature of the Be X-ray binary pulsar 4U 0728-25</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the results obtained with a XMM-Newton observation, performed in April 2023, of the poorly known Galactic Be X-ray binary pulsar 4U 0728-25. It was revealed at a flux level (not corrected for the absorption) $f_{\rm X}$(0.2-12 keV) = 1.7$\times 10^{-11}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, which implies an unabsorbed source luminosity $L_{\rm X} \simeq 1.3 \times 10^{35}$ erg s$^{-1}$: this is the minimum luminosity ever observed for this source. We measured a pulse period $P_{\rm spin}$ = 103.301(5) s, a value $\simeq $ 0.15 % longer than that estimated in 2016 with AstroSat. The pulse profile shows a broad single peak at all energies, with a limited energy dependence and a small increase in the pulsed fraction with energy. The time-averaged EPIC spectrum can be described equally well by four different emission models, either with a single non-thermal component (a partially covered power law or a cut-off power law), or with a thermal component in addition to the non-thermal one (a black body plus a power law, or a collisionally ionised gas plus a cut-off power law). All of them provided an equally good fit and, in the case of the power-law plus black-body model, the thermal component is characterized by a high temperature ($kT_{\rm BB} \simeq$ 1.5 keV) and a small size ($R_{\rm BB} \simeq$ 240 m), comparable with that of the neutron-star polar caps. A spectral variability along the pulse phase is present, which suggests a flux variation of the black-body component. These results show that, for its luminosity level, flux variabilty over long time scales, and spectral properties, 4U 0728-25 is very similar to most of the persistent Be X-ray binaries. Therefore, it can be considered a member of this class of sources.</description>

      <title>Auto- and cross-correlations for multiple images of corotating hotspots in accretion disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent horizon-scale observations of the Sgr A* might open up a new window to study spacetime geometry and accretion matter in the strong-field regime of gravity. Due to the short gravitational timescale for Sgr A*, variable emissions near the galactic center are expected in the observations, including variability in the Sgr A* images and flare motions within ten times gravitational radius. In this paper, we investigate the spatiotemporal auto- and cross-correlations for multiple images of a long-lived corotating hotspot near the black hole. Using the recently developed efficient ray-tracing scheme for point-like sources, we extensively consider multiple images from primary to eighth-order in the correlations. We show that these correlations exhibit a repeated inclined band-like structure in the $\Delta \Phi$-$\Delta t$ plane. And there is a periodic modulation of width of the correlated bands, with the maximum bandwidth increasing with the inclination angles. The point-slope of correlated bands is determined by the lapse in azimuthal angle and time of multiple images, as well as the apparent rotation speed of hotspots. By comparing correlations for lower-order with those for higher-order images, it is found that the fixed points for cross-correlations between lower-order images depend on the orbital configurations of hotspots. It challenges the use of correlations for lower-order images to infer black hole geometries. Additionally, we also examine the influence from hotspot shapes based on semi-analytical formulas. Although the emission shape can significantly influence light curves, it does not change the correlated bands of the correlations.</description>

      <title>A novel approach of optimizing the image cleaning performance of Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes: Application to a time-based cleaning for H.E.S.S</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces a time-based cleaning method for H.E.S.S. using CT5 in monoscopic mode and presents an optimization workflow for image-cleaning algorithms to enhance telescope sensitivity while minimizing systematic biases. We evaluate three methods - tail-cut cleaning and two flavours of time-based cleaning TIME3D and TIME4D - and find best-cut configurations for two cases: optimal overall sensitivity and minimal energy threshold. TIME3D achieves a $\sim 15\%$ improvement with regard to the standard tail-cut cleaning for $E &lt; 300$ GeV, with a $\sim 200\%$ improvement for the first energy bin (36.5 GeV &lt; E &lt; 64.9 GeV), providing a more stable performance across a wider energy range by preserving more signal. TIME4D achieves a $\sim 20\%$ improvement at low energies due to superior NSB noise suppression, allowing for an enhanced capability of detecting sources at the lowest energies. We demonstrate that using first-order estimations of the performance of a cleaning, such as image size retaining or NSB pixel reduction, cannot provide a full picture of the expected result in the final sensitivity. Beyond expanding the effective area at low energies, sensitivity improvement requires precise event reconstruction, including improved energy and directional accuracy. Enhanced gamma-hadron separation and optimized pre-selection cuts further boost sensitivity. The proposed pipeline fully explores this, providing a fair and robust comparison between different cleaning methods. The method is general and can be applied to other IACT systems like VERITAS, MAGIC. By advancing data-driven image cleaning, this work lays the groundwork for detecting faint astrophysical sources and deepening our understanding of high-energy cosmic phenomena.</description>

      <title>The very high X-ray polarisation of accreting black hole IGRJ17091-3624 in the hard state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the first detection of the X-ray polarisation of the transient black hole X-ray binary IGRJ17091-3624 taken with the Imaging X-ray polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) in March 2025, and present the results of an X-ray spectro-polarimetric analysis. The polarisation was measured in the 2--8 keV band with 5.2$\sigma$ statistical confidence. We report a polarisation degree (PD) of $9.1\pm1.6$ per cent and a polarisation angle of $83^{\circ} \pm 5^{\circ}$ (errors are $1\sigma$ confidence). There is a hint of a positive correlation of PD with energy that is not statistically significant. We report that the source is in the corona-dominated hard state, which is confirmed by a hard power-law dominated spectrum with weak reflection features and the presence of a Type-C quasi-periodic oscillation at $\sim0.2$~Hz. The orientation of the emitted radio jet is not known, and so we are unable to compare it with the direction of X-ray polarization, but we predict the two to be parallel if the geometry is similar to that in Cygnus X-1 and Swift J1727.8-1613, the two hard state black hole binaries previously observed by IXPE. In the Comptonisation scenario, the high observed PD requires a very favourable geometry of the corona, a high inclination angle (supported by the presence of a dip in the light curve) and possibly a mildly relativistic outflow and/or scattering in an optically thick wind.</description>

      <title>Microlensing of long-duration gravitational wave signals originating from Galactic sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detection of quasi-monochromatic, long-duration (continuous) gravitational wave radiation emitted by, e.g., asymmetric rotating neutron stars in our Galaxy requires a long observation time to distinguish it from the detector's noise. If this signal is additionally microlensed by a lensing object located in the Galaxy, its magnitude would be temporarily magnified, which may lead to its discovery and allow probing of the physical nature of the lensing object and the source. We study the observational feasibility of Galactic microlensing of continuous gravitational wave signals in the point mass lens approximation by discussing the parameter space of the problem as well as by applying a gravitational wave detection method, the Time Domain F-statistic search, to ground-based detectors in the simulated data.</description>

      <title>Axial perturbations of black holes with primary scalar hair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study axial perturbations of static black holes with primary hair in a family of degenerate higher-order scalar-tensor (DHOST) theories. These solutions possess a scalar charge, fully independent of the mass, leading to a continuous one-parameter deformation of the standard Schwarzschild black hole. Starting from these solutions, we also construct new black holes, solutions of other DHOST theories, obtained via disformal transformations of the metric. In particular, we investigate two specific types of disformal transformations: the first leading to a theory where gravitational waves propagate at the speed of light, the second to a Horndeski theory, where the equations of motion remain second order. The dynamics of axial perturbations can be formally related to the general relativistic equations of motion of axial perturbations in an effective metric. The causal structure of the effective metric differs from that of the background metric, leading to distinct gravitational and luminous horizons. Using a WKB approximation, we compute the quasi-normal modes for the Schr\"odinger-like equation associated with the effective metric outside the gravitational horizon.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Origin of the KM3-230213A event and associated Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel cosmological scenario to explain the exceptional KM3-230213A neutrino event reported at an energy scale of $\mathcal{O}(100)$~PeV by the KM3NeT collaboration, along with its associated gravitational wave (GW) signatures. In our framework, ultra high energy neutrinos originate from the decay of a super-heavy sterile neutrino produced via the Hawking evaporation of primordial black holes (PBHs) in the early Universe. Employing an ultraviolet complete type-I seesaw model, we demonstrate that while two sterile neutrinos are responsible for light neutrino masses as required by oscillation data, one sterile neutrino can have an exceedingly feeble coupling, allowing its lifetime to be tuned so that its decay yields a neutrino flux consistent with the observed event. Furthermore, our scenario predicts two distinct GW signatures: one arising from gravitons emitted during PBH evaporation and another from the Bremsstrahlung process during the decay of the sterile neutrino. These complementary signals provide a multi-messenger probe of the underlying physics. Our results thus offer a compelling explanation for the KM3-230213A event and open new avenues for investigating the interplay between high-energy neutrino astronomy and gravitational wave cosmology.</description>

      <title>Disc breaking through forced eccentricity growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by misaligned discs observed in eccentric orbit Be/X-ray binaries, we examine the evolution of a retrograde disc around one component of an eccentric binary with hydrodynamic simulations, $n$-body simulations and linear theory. Forced eccentricity growth from the eccentric orbit binary causes the initially circular disk to undergo eccentricity oscillations. A retrograde disc becomes more radially extended, more highly eccentric and undergoes more rapid apsidal precession compared to a prograde disc. We find that a retrograde disc can be subject to disc breaking where the disc forms two rings with different eccentricities and longitude of periastrons while remaining coplanar. This could have implications for the lightcurves and the X-ray outbursts observed in Be/X-ray binaries.</description>

      <title>Shadow and gravitational lensing produced by the nonlinear accretion of a scalar field onto a black hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hypothesis that classical scalar fields could constitute dark matter on galactic and cosmic scales has garnered significant interest. In scenarios where supermassive black holes (SMBHs) form through the accretion of matter onto black hole seeds, a critical question arises: what role does dark matter play in this process? We conduct a numerical investigation into the nonlinear dynamical evolution of black hole shadows and gravitational lensing effects resulting from the accretion of an ultralight, real scalar field onto a non-rotating black hole. The scalar field is minimally coupled to Einstein's gravity, and our simulations focus on wave packets, parameterized by their wave number and width, as they interact with and are accreted by a dynamic black hole. Our results demonstrate significant growth in the apparent horizon, photon ring, and Einstein ring sizes compared to those of a Schwarzschild black hole. These findings suggest that the observed photon ring and black hole shadow in Sgr\,A*, and M87* may be influenced by the gravitational interaction between the black hole and ultralight scalar field dark matter.</description>

      <title>Diffraction around caustics in gravitational wave lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational lensing magnification is maximal around caustics. At these source locations, an incoming wave from a point source would formally experience an infinite amplification in the high-frequency or geometric optics limit. This divergence reflects the break-down of the mathematical formalism, which is regularized by either the finite size of the source or its wavelength. We explore diffraction around caustics and their implications for the distortion of waveforms from point sources, focusing on three types of caustics: point singularities, folds, and cusps. We derive analytical results for the amplitude and phase of the diffracted waves, and compare those against the stationary phase approximation. We then study the observational signatures and detectability of these distortions on gravitational waves. We find that the lensing distortions could be detectable, but that the stationary phase approximation is still a good description of the system even close to the caustic, when the repeated gravitational wave chirps interfere with each other. We also quantify the possibility of distinguishing lensed signals from different caustics by performing Bayesian parameter estimation on simulated signals. Our results demonstrate that the universal distortions due to diffraction around caustics could be used to single out a gravitational wave event as lensed.</description>

      <title>Neutrinos and gamma rays from beta decays in an active galactic nucleus NGC 1068 jet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05247v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that TeV neutrinos and high-energy gamma rays detected from the nearby active galaxy NGC 1068 can simultaneously be explained in a model based on the beta decays of neutrons produced in the photodisintegration of 4He nuclei on ultraviolet photons in the jet. The photodisintegration of nuclei occurs at energies above several PeV, which explains the 1-100 TeV energies of the observed neutrinos. The TeV gamma-ray flux accompanying the beta decays is expected to be much lower than the neutrino flux, which agrees with the observations of NGC 1068 showing a gamma-ray deficit as compared to the expectations from proton-photon interactions. Furthermore, the synchrotron and inverse Compton gamma-ray flux associated with protons' Bethe-Heitler pair production and the photopion processes in the jet can be consistent with the observed gamma-ray flux at GeV energies for a plausible range of magnetic fields of jets. This scenario, combining beta decay and Bethe-Heitler, can be applied to other jet Seyfert galaxies such as NGC 4151. Future measurements of the neutrino flavor ratio can help confirm the beta-decay origin of the observed neutrinos.</description>

      <title>High-energy gamma-ray and neutrino emissions from interacting supernovae based on radiation hydrodynamic simulations: a case of SN 2023ixf</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18935v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent observations of core-collapse supernovae revealed that the existence of dense circumstellar matter (CSM) around their progenitors is ubiquitous. Interaction of supernova ejecta with such a dense CSM is a potential production sight of high-energy cosmic rays (CRs), gamma-rays, and neutrinos. We estimate the gamma-ray and neutrino signals from SN 2023ixf, a core-collapse supernova occurred in a nearby galaxy M101, which exhibits signatures of the interaction with the confined dense CSM. Using radiation-hydrodynamic simulation model calibrated by the optical and ultraviolet observations of SN 2023ixf, we find that the CRs cannot be accelerated in the early phase because the sharp velocity jump at the shock disappears due to strong radiation pressure. Roughly 4 days after the explosion, the collisionless sub-shock is formed in the CSM, which enables the CR production and leads to gamma-ray and neutrino emissions. The shock sweeps up the entire dense CSM roughly 9 days after the explosion, which ceases the high-energy radiation. Based on this scenario, we calculate the gamma-ray and neutrino signals, which have a peak around 9 days after the explosion. We can constrain the cosmic-ray production efficiency to be less than 10% by comparing our prediction to the Fermi-LAT upper limits. Future multi-messenger observations with an enlarged sample of nearby supernovae will provide a better constraint on the cosmic-ray production efficiency in the early phases of supernovae.</description>

      <title>A 34 Yr Timing Solution of the Redback Millisecond Pulsar Terzan 5A</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21648v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a 34-year timing solution of the redback pulsar system Terzan 5A (Ter5A). Ter5A, also known as B1744$-$24A or J1748$-$2446A, has a 11.56 ms pulse period, a $\sim$0.1 solar mass dwarf companion star, and an orbital period of 1.82 hours. Ter5A displays highly variable eclipses and orbital perturbations. Using new timing techniques, we have determined a phase-connected timing solution for this system over 34 years. This is the longest ever published for a redback pulsar. We find that the pulsar's spin variability is much larger than most globular cluster pulsars. In fact, of the nine redback pulsars with published or in preparation long-term timing solutions, Ter5A is by far the noisiest. We see no evidence of strong correlations between orbital and spin variability of the pulsar. We also find that long-term astrometric timing measurements are likely too contaminated by this variability to be usable, and therefore require careful short-term timing to determine reasonable positions. Finally, we measure an orbital period contraction of $-2.5(3) \times 10^{-13}$, which is likely dominated by the general relativistic orbital decay of the system. The effects of the orbital variability due to the redback nature of the pulsar are not needed to explain the observed orbital period derivative, but they are constrained to less than $\sim$30% of the observed value.</description>

      <title>An effective model for magnetic field amplification by the magnetorotational and parasitic instabilities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05064v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The magnetorotational instability (MRI) is considered a leading mechanism for driving angular momentum transport in differentially rotating astrophysical flows, including accretion disks and protoneutron stars. This process is mediated by the exponential amplification of the magnetic field whose final amplitude is envisioned to be limited by secondary (parasitic) instabilities. In this paper, we investigated the saturation of the MRI via parasitic modes relaxing previous approximations. We carried out the first systematic analysis of the evolution of parasitic modes as they feed off the exponentially growing MRI while being advected by the background shear flow. We provide the most accurate calculation of the amplification factor to which the MRI can grow before the fastest parasitic modes reach a comparable amplitude. We find that this amplification factor is remarkably robust, depending only logarithmically on the initial amplitude of the parasitic modes, in reasonable agreement with numerical simulations. Based on these insights, and guided by numerical simulations, we provide a simple analytical expression for the amplification of magnetic fields responsible for MRI-driven angular momentum transport. Our effective model for magnetic field amplification may enable going beyond the standard prescription for viscous transport currently employed in numerical simulations when the MRI cannot be explicitly resolved.</description>

      <title>Ultra-high-energy cosmic rays from ultra-fast outflows of active galactic nuclei</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05667v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate ultra-fast outflows (UFOs) in active galactic nuclei (AGN) as potential sources of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs). We focus on cosmic-ray nuclei, an aspect not explored previously. These large-scale, mildly-relativistic outflows, characterised by velocities up to half the speed of light, are a common feature of AGN. We study the cosmic-ray spectrum and maximum energy attainable in these environments with 3D CRPropa simulations and apply our method to 86 observed UFOs. Iron nuclei can be accelerated up to $\sim10^{20}\,$eV at the wind-termination shock in some UFOs, but the escaping flux is strongly attenuated due to photonuclear interactions with intense AGN photon fields. The maximum energy of nuclei escaping a typical UFO is limited by photodisintegration to below $\sim 10^{17}\,$eV. However, in the most extreme $5-10\%$ of UFOs, helium (nitrogen) [iron] nuclei can escape with energy exceeding $10^{17.4}$ ($10^{17.8}$) $[10^{18.4}]\,$eV. Protons and neutrons, either primaries or by-products of photodisintegration, escape UFOs with little attenuation, with half of the observed UFOs reaching energies exceeding $10^{18}\,$eV. Thus, UFOs emerge as viable sources of the diffuse cosmic-ray flux between the end of the Galactic cosmic-rays and the highest-energy extragalactic flux. For a few UFOs in our sample, nuclei escape without photodisintegration with energy up to $10^{19.8}\,$eV. This occurs during low-emission states of the AGN, which would make UFOs intermittent sources of UHECR nuclei up to the highest observed energies. The role of UFOs as UHECR sources is testable with neutrino telescopes due to a substantial accompanying flux of PeV neutrinos.</description>

Abstract: We present a census of 100 pulsars, the largest below 100 MHz, including 94 normal pulsars and six millisecond pulsars, with the Long Wavelength Array (LWA). Pulse profiles are detected across a range of frequencies from 26 to 88 MHz, including new narrow-band profiles facilitating profile evolution studies and breaks in pulsar spectra at low frequencies. We report mean flux density, spectral index, curvature, and low-frequency turnover frequency measurements for 97 pulsars, including new measurements for 61 sources. Multi-frequency profile widths are presented for all pulsars, including component spacing for 27 pulsars with two components. Polarized emission is detected from 27 of the sources (the largest sample at these frequencies) in multiple frequency bands, with one new detection. We also provide new timing solutions for five recently-discovered pulsars. Low-frequency observations with the LWA are especially sensitive to propagation effects arising in the interstellar medium. We have made the most sensitive measurements of pulsar dispersion measures (DMs) and rotation measures (RMs), with median uncertainties of 2.9x10^-4 pc cm^-3 and 0.01 rad m^-2, respectively, and can track their variations over almost a decade, along with other frequency-dependent effects. This allows stringent limits on average magnetic fields, with no variations detected above ~20 nG. Finally, the census yields some interesting phenomena in individual sources, including the detection of frequency and time-dependent DM variations in B2217+47, and the detection of highly circularly polarized emission from J0051+0423.</description>

      <title>Orbital Modulation of Gamma-Rays Beyond 100 TeV from LS 5039</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20947v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gamma-ray binaries are systems composed of a compact object orbiting a massive companion star. The interaction between these two objects can drive relativistic outflows, either jets or winds, in which particles can be accelerated to energies reaching hundreds of tera-electronvolts (TeV). It is however still debated where and under which physical conditions particles are accelerated in these objects and ultimately whether protons can be accelerated up to PeV energies. Among the well-known gamma-ray binaries, LS 5039 is a high-mass X-ray binary (HMXB) with an orbital period of 3.9 days that has been observed up to TeV energies by the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.). In this work, we present new observations of LS 5039 obtained with the High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) observatory. Our data reveal that the gamma-ray spectrum of LS 5039 extends up to 200 TeV with no apparent spectral cut-off. Furthermore, we confirm, with a confidence level of 4.7{\sigma}, that the emission between 2 TeV and 118 TeV is modulated by the orbital motion of the system, which indicates that these photons are likely produced within or near the binary orbit where they can undergo absorption by the stellar photons. In a leptonic scenario, the highest energy photons detected by HAWC can be emitted by ~200 TeV electrons inverse Compton scattering stellar photons, which would require an extremely efficient acceleration mechanism operating within LS 5039. Alternatively, a hadronic scenario could explain the data through proton-proton or proton-{\gamma} collisions of protons accelerated to peta-electronvolt (PeV) energies.</description>

      <title>A magnetised Galactic halo from inner Galaxy outflows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06312v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic halos of galaxies are crucial for understanding galaxy evolution, galactic-scale outflows, and feedback from star formation activity. Identifying the magnetised halo of the Milky Way is challenging because of the potential contamination from foreground emission arising in local spiral arms. Additionally, it is unclear how our magnetic halo is influenced by recently revealed large-scale structures such as the X-ray emitting eROSITA Bubbles. Here we report the identification of several kpc-scale magnetised structures based on their polarized radio emission and their gamma-ray counterparts, which can be interpreted as the radiation of relativistic electrons in the Galactic magnetic halo. These non-thermal structures extend far above and below the Galactic plane and are spatially coincident with the thermal X-ray emission from the eROSITA Bubbles. The morphological consistency of these structures suggests a common origin, which can be sustained by Galactic outflows driven by active star-forming regions located in the Galactic Disc at 3-5 kpc from the Galactic Centre. These results reveal how X-ray-emitting and magnetised halos of spiral galaxies can be related to intense star formation activities and suggest that the X-shaped coherent magnetic structures observed in their halos can stem from galaxy outflows.</description>

      <title>Detection of the optical counterpart of the transient ULX NGC300 ULX-1: a nascent black hole - neutron star binary?</title>

Abstract: The end points of massive star evolution are poorly known, especially those in interacting binary systems containing compact objects, such as neutron stars or black holes. Such systems are bright in X-rays, and the most luminous among them are called ultra-luminous X-ray sources (ULXs). In this paper, we address the enigmatic NGC 300 ULX-1. It's X-ray activity started in 2010 with the supernova impostor-like event SN 2010da. In the following few years the ULX was powered by persistent super-Eddington accretion but then it dimmed in X-rays. We present the most recent X-ray and optical observations. The Chandra and Swift telescopes confirm that SN 2010da/NGC 300 ULX-1 is not accreting at super-Eddington level anymore. We attribute this switch in accretion regime to the donor star variability and its fast evolution. In order to gain a better understanding of the donor star's nature, we consider its optical light curve on a decade-long time scale and show that the optical counterpart of SN 2010da/NGC 300 ULX-1 dimmed significantly over recent years. The most recent detection in optical by the Gemini telescope reveals that the source is now &gt; 2.5 mag fainter in the r' band compared to the epoch when it was spectroscopically classified as a red supergiant. We discuss the nature of the abrupt changes in the donor star properties, and consider among other possibilities the silent collapse of the donor star into a black hole.</description>

      <title>A morphological catalogue of Nova Remnants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20053v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work presents the first optical imaging catalogue of resolved Galactic nova remnants. It compiles images from proprietary observations carried out at the Nordic Optical Telescope and public archives using different telescopes and instruments. The catalogue includes images spanning from 1950 to 2024 of 66 novae out of the more than 550 novae detected to date. Diffuse emission from a nova shell is detected in 45 sources, with another 16 sources been stellar and five more been barely resolved. We used the catalogue to introduce a main morphological classification of the nova remnants (R - round, E - elliptical, B - bipolar, A - asymmetric, I - irregular, S - stellar, and G - barely resolved) with secondary features (s - smooth, c - clumpy, m - mixed, f - filaments, t - tails, m - multiple shells, e - equatorial brightness enhancement). Resolved nova remnants are mostly round (27%) or elliptical (56%), with very few bipolar or with equatorial brightness enhancement (13%). Most nova remnants are younger than 150 yr, with about 80% of nova remnant detection rate among those younger than 60 yr. The physical size of nova remnants increases with age at a rate of 0.0725 pc per century up to a median value of 0.03 pc. This relationship seems to apply even to the few known ancient nova shells with ages up to a few millennia. The aspect ratio of nova remnants can be described by a Gaussian distribution with a standard deviation $\sigma$ of 0.18 from round morphologies (major to minor axes ratio of unity).</description>
