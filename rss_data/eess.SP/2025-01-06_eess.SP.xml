      <title>Modulo Sampling: Performance Guarantees in The Presence of Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the relationship between the dynamic range and quantization noise power in modulo analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). Two modulo ADC systems are considered: (1) a modulo ADC which outputs the folded samples and an additional 1-bit folding information signal, and (2) a modulo ADC without the 1-bit information. A recovery algorithm that unfolds the quantized modulo samples using the extra 1-bit folding information is analyzed. Using the dithered quantization framework, we show that an oversampling factor of $\mathrm{OF} &gt; 3$ and a quantizer resolution of $b &gt; 3$ are sufficient conditions to unfold the modulo samples. When these conditions are met, we demonstrate that the mean squared error (MSE) performance of modulo ADC with an extra 1-bit folding information signal is better than that of a conventional ADC with the same number of bits used for amplitude quantization. Since folding information is typically not available in modulo ADCs, we also propose and analyze a recovery algorithm based on orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) that does not require the 1-bit folding information. In this case, we prove that $\mathrm{OF} &gt; 3$ and $b &gt; 3 + \log_2(\delta)$ for some $\delta &gt; 1$ are sufficient conditions to unfold the modulo samples. For the two systems considered, we show that, with sufficient number of bits for amplitude quantization, the mean squared error (MSE) of a modulo ADC is $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{\mathrm{OF}^3}\right)$ whereas that of a conventional ADC is only $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{\mathrm{OF}}\right)$. We extend the analysis to the case of simultaneous acquisition of weak and strong signals occupying different frequency bands. Finally, numerical results are presented to validate the derived performance guarantees.</description>

      <title>Indoor Position and Attitude Tracking with SO(3) Manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Driven by technological breakthroughs, indoor tracking and localization have gained importance in various applications including the Internet of Things (IoT), robotics, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). To tackle some of the challenges associated with indoor tracking, this study explores the potential benefits of incorporating the SO(3) manifold structure of the rotation matrix. The goal is to enhance the 3D tracking performance of the extended Kalman filter (EKF) and unscented Kalman filter (UKF) of a moving target within an indoor environment. Our results demonstrate that the proposed extended Kalman filter with Riemannian (EKFRie) and unscented Kalman filter with Riemannian (UKFRie) algorithms consistently outperform the conventional EKF and UKF in terms of position and orientation accuracy. While the conventional EKF and UKF achieved root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.36m and 0.43m, respectively, for a long stair path, the proposed EKFRie and UKFRie algorithms achieved a lower RMSE of 0.21m and 0.10m. Our results show also the outperforming of the proposed algorithms over the EKF and UKF algorithms with the Isosceles triangle manifold. While the latter achieved RMSE of 7.26cm and 7.27cm, respectively, our proposed algorithms achieved RMSE of 6.73cm and 6.16cm. These results demonstrate the enhanced performance of the proposed algorithms.</description>

      <title>Phase Error Sensitivity to Injection Signals in Multi-Phase Injection-Locked Ring Oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-phase injection-locked ring oscillators (MP-ILROs) are widely used for multi-phase clock generation, with their phase accuracy primarily determined by the inherent accuracy of the oscillator itself, due to the suppression of input signal errors. However, a quantitative analysis of the oscillator's sensitivity to input errors remains largely unexplored. This paper presents a phasor-based analysis of injection locking, revealing that the phase error sensitivity is influenced by factors such as injection strength and the free-running frequency of the oscillator. Simulation results align closely with theoretical calculations, validating the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Digital-Analog Transmission based Emergency Semantic Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emergency Wireless Communication (EWC) networks adopt the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) to transmit scene images in real time for quickly assessing the extent of the damage. However, existing UDP-based EWC exhibits suboptimal performance under poor channel conditions since UDP lacks an Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ) mechanism. In addition, future EWC systems must not only enhance human decisionmaking during emergency response operations but also support Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven approaches to improve rescue efficiency. The Deep Learning-based Semantic Communication (DL-based SemCom) emerges as a robust, efficient, and taskoriented transmission scheme, suitable for deployment in UDP based EWC. Due to the constraints in hardware capabilities and transmission resources, the EWC transmitter is unable to integrate sufficiently powerful NN model, thereby failing to achieve ideal performance under EWC scene. For EWC scene, we propose a performance-constrained semantic coding model, which considers the effects of the semantic noise and the channel noise. Then, we derive Cramer-Rao lower bound of the proposed semantic coding model, as guidance for the design of semantic codec to enhance its adaptability to semantic noise as well as channel noise. To further improve the system performance, we propose Digital-Analog transmission based Emergency Semantic Communication (DAESemCom) framework, which integrates the analog DL-based semantic coding and the digital Distributed Source Coding (DSC) schemes to leverage their respective advantages. The simulation results show that the proposed DA-ESemCom framework outperforms the classical Separated Source-Channel Coding (SSCC) and other DL-based Joint Source-Channel Coding (DL-based JSCC) schemes in terms of fidelity and detection performances.</description>

      <title>Knowledge Sharing-enabled Semantic Rate Maximization for Multi-cell Task-oriented Hybrid Semantic-Bit Communication Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In task-oriented semantic communications, the transmitters are designed to deliver task-related semantic information rather than every signal bit to receivers, which alleviates the spectrum pressure by reducing network traffic loads. Effective semantic communications depend on the perfect alignment of shared knowledge between transmitters and receivers, however, the alignment of knowledge cannot always be guaranteed in practice. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel knowledge sharing-enabled task-oriented hybrid semantic and bit communications mechanism, where a mobile device (MD) can proactively share and upload the task-related mismatched knowledge to associated small base station (SBS). The traditional bit communications can be adopted as an aid to transmit the rest data related to unshared mismatched knowledge to guarantee the effective execution of target tasks. Considering the heterogeneous transceivers in multi-cell networks, target task demands, and channel conditions, an optimization problem is formulated to maximize the generalized effective semantic transmission rate of all MDs by jointly optimizing knowledge sharing, semantic extraction ratio, and SBS association, while satisfying the semantic accuracy requirements and delay tolerances of MD target tasks. The formulated mixed integer nonlinear programming problem is decomposed into multiple subproblems equivalently. An optimum algorithm is proposed and another efficient algorithm is further developed using hierarchical class partitioning and monotonic optimization. Simulation results demonstrate the validity and superior performance of proposed solutions.</description>

      <title>Collaborative Knowledge Sharing-empowered Effective Semantic Rate Maximization for Two-tier Semantic-Bit Communication Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective task-oriented semantic communications relies on perfect knowledge alignment between transmitters and receivers for accurate recovery of task-related semantic information, which can be susceptible to knowledge misalignment and performance degradation in practice. To tackle this issue, continual knowledge updating and sharing are crucial to adapt to evolving task and user related demands, despite the incurred resource overhead and increased latency. In this paper, we propose a novel collaborative knowledge sharing-empowered semantic transmission mechanism in a two-tier edge network, exploiting edge cooperations and bit communications to address KB mismatch. By deriving a generalized effective semantic transmission rate (GESTR) that considers both semantic accuracy and overhead, we formulate a mixed integer nonlinear programming problem to maximize GESTR of all mobile devices by optimizing knowledge sharing decisions, extraction ratios, and BS/subchannel allocations, subject to task accuracy and delay requirements. The joint optimum solution can be obtained by proposed fractional programming based branch and bound algorithm and modified Kuhn-Munkres algorithm efficiently. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of proposed solution, especially in low signal-to-noise conditions.</description>

      <title>Millimeter-Wave Energy-Efficient Hybrid Beamforming Architecture and Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies energy-efficient hybrid beamforming architectures and its algorithm design in millimeter-wave communication systems, aiming to address the challenges faced by existing hybrid beamforming due to low hardware flexibility and high power consumption. To solve the problems of existing hybrid beamforming, a novel energy-efficient hybrid beamforming architecture is proposed, where radio-frequency (RF) switch networks are introduced at the front and rear ends of the phase shifter network, enabling dynamic connections between the RF chains and the phase shifter array as well as the antenna array. The system model of the proposed architecture is established, including digital precoding and analog precoding processes, and the practical hardware limitations such as quantization errors of the digital-to-analog converter (DAC) and phase shifter resolution. In order to maximize the energy efficiency, this paper derives an energy efficiency model including spectral efficiency and system power consumption, and a hybrid precoding algorithm is proposed based on block coordinate descent to iteratively optimize the digital precoding matrix, analog precoding matrix, and DAC resolution. Simulation results under the NYUSIM-generated millimeter-wave channels show that the proposed hybrid beamforming architecture and precoding algorithm have higher energy efficiency than existing representative architectures and precoding algorithms under complete and partial channel state information, while the loss of spectral efficiency compared to fully connected architecture is less than 20%</description>

      <title>Uncovering the Iceberg in the Sea: Fundamentals of Pulse Shaping and Modulation Design for Random ISAC Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC) is expected to play a pivotal role in future 6G networks. To maximize time-frequency resource utilization, 6G ISAC systems must exploit data payload signals, that are inherently random, for both communication and sensing tasks. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the sensing performance of such communication-centric ISAC signals, with a focus on modulation and pulse shaping design to reshape the statistical properties of their auto-correlation functions (ACFs), thereby improving the target ranging performance. We derive a closed-form expression for the expectation of the squared ACF of random ISAC signals, considering arbitrary modulation bases and constellation mappings within the Nyquist pulse shaping framework. The structure is metaphorically described as an ``iceberg hidden in the sea", where the ``iceberg'' represents the squared mean of the ACF of random ISAC signals, that is determined by the pulse shaping filter, and the ``sea level'' characterizes the corresponding variance, caused by the randomness of the data payload. Our analysis shows that, for QAM/PSK constellations with Nyquist pulse shaping, Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) achieves the lowest ranging sidelobe level across all lags. Building on these insights, we propose a novel Nyquist pulse shaping design to enhance the sensing performance of random ISAC signals. Numerical results validate our theoretical findings, showing that the proposed pulse shaping significantly reduces ranging sidelobes compared to conventional root-raised cosine (RRC) pulse shaping, thereby improving the ranging performance.</description>

      <title>Subject Specific Deep Learning Model for Motor Imagery Direction Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hemispheric strokes impair motor control in contralateral body parts, necessitating effective rehabilitation strategies. Motor Imagery-based Brain-Computer Interfaces (MI-BCIs) promote neuroplasticity, aiding the recovery of motor functions. While deep learning has shown promise in decoding MI actions for stroke rehabilitation, existing studies largely focus on bilateral MI actions and are limited to offline evaluations. Decoding directional information from unilateral MI, however, offers a more natural control interface with greater degrees of freedom but remains challenging due to spatially overlapping neural activity. This work proposes a novel deep learning framework for online decoding of binary directional MI signals from the dominant hand of 20 healthy subjects. The proposed method employs EEGNet-based convolutional filters to extract temporal and spatial features. The EEGNet model is enhanced by Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) layers that rank the electrode importance and feature maps. A subject-independent model is initially trained using calibration data from multiple subjects and fine-tuned for subject-specific adaptation. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated using subject-specific online session data. The proposed method achieved an average right vs left binary direction decoding accuracy of 58.7 +\- 8% for unilateral MI tasks, outperforming the existing deep learning models. Additionally, the SE-layer ranking offers insights into electrode contribution, enabling potential subject-specific BCI optimization. The findings highlight the efficacy of the proposed method in advancing MI-BCI applications for a more natural and effective control of BCI systems.</description>

      <title>Beyond Diagonal Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces for Multi-Carrier RF Wireless Power Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio frequency (RF) wireless power transfer (WPT) is promising for promoting sustainability in future wireless systems, but its low end-to-end power transfer efficiency is a critical challenge. For this, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) can be leveraged to enhance efficiency by providing nearly passive beamforming gains. Beyond diagonal (BD) RIS is a new RIS variant offering greater performance benefits than traditional diagonal RIS (D-RIS), though its potential for RF-WPT remains unexplored. Motivated by this, we consider a single-input single-output BD-RIS-aided RF-WPT system and we formulate a joint beamforming and waveform optimization problem aiming to maximize the harvested power at the receiver. We propose an optimization framework relying on successive convex approximation, alternating optimization, and semi-definite relaxation. Numerical results show that increasing the number of transmit sub-carriers or RIS elements improves the harvested power. We verify by simulation that BD-RIS leads to the same performance as D-RIS under far-field line-of-sight conditions (in the absence of mutual coupling), while it outperforms D-RIS as the non-line-of-sight components become dominant.</description>

      <title>CSI Compression using Channel Charting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reaping the benefits of multi-antenna communication systems in frequency division duplex (FDD) requires channel state information (CSI) reporting from mobile users to the base station (BS). Over the last decades, the amount of CSI to be collected has become very challenging owing to the dramatic increase of the number of antennas at BSs. To mitigate the overhead associated with CSI reporting, compressed CSI techniques have been proposed with the idea of recovering the original CSI at the BS from its compressed version sent by the mobile users. Channel charting is an unsupervised dimensionality reduction method that consists in building a radio-environment map from CSIs. Such a method can be considered in the context of the CSI compression problem, since a chart location is, by definition, a low-dimensional representation of the CSI. In this paper, the performance of channel charting for a task-based CSI compression application is studied. A comparison of the proposed method against baselines on realistic synthetic data is proposed, showing promising results.</description>

      <title>An unsupervised method for MRI recovery: Deep image prior with structured sparsity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Objective: To propose and validate an unsupervised MRI reconstruction method that does not require fully sampled k-space data. Materials and Methods: The proposed method, deep image prior with structured sparsity (DISCUS), extends the deep image prior (DIP) by introducing group sparsity to frame-specific code vectors, enabling the discovery of a low-dimensional manifold for capturing temporal variations. \discus was validated using four studies: (I) simulation of a dynamic Shepp-Logan phantom to demonstrate its manifold discovery capabilities, (II) comparison with compressed sensing and DIP-based methods using simulated single-shot late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) image series from six distinct digital cardiac phantoms in terms of normalized mean square error (NMSE) and structural similarity index measure (SSIM), (III) evaluation on retrospectively undersampled single-shot LGE data from eight patients, and (IV) evaluation on prospectively undersampled single-shot LGE data from eight patients, assessed via blind scoring from two expert readers. Results: DISCUS outperformed competing methods, demonstrating superior reconstruction quality in terms of NMSE and SSIM (Studies I--III) and expert reader scoring (Study IV). Discussion: An unsupervised image reconstruction method is presented and validated on simulated and measured data. These developments can benefit applications where acquiring fully sampled data is challenging.</description>

      <title>AI-Enabled Operations at Fermi Complex: Multivariate Time Series Prediction for Outage Prediction and Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Main Control Room of the Fermilab accelerator complex continuously gathers extensive time-series data from thousands of sensors monitoring the beam. However, unplanned events such as trips or voltage fluctuations often result in beam outages, causing operational downtime. This downtime not only consumes operator effort in diagnosing and addressing the issue but also leads to unnecessary energy consumption by idle machines awaiting beam restoration. The current threshold-based alarm system is reactive and faces challenges including frequent false alarms and inconsistent outage-cause labeling. To address these limitations, we propose an AI-enabled framework that leverages predictive analytics and automated labeling. Using data from $2,703$ Linac devices and $80$ operator-labeled outages, we evaluate state-of-the-art deep learning architectures, including recurrent, attention-based, and linear models, for beam outage prediction. Additionally, we assess a Random Forest-based labeling system for providing consistent, confidence-scored outage annotations. Our findings highlight the strengths and weaknesses of these architectures for beam outage prediction and identify critical gaps that must be addressed to fully harness AI for transitioning downtime handling from reactive to predictive, ultimately reducing downtime and improving decision-making in accelerator management.</description>

      <title>Explainable Brain Age Gap Prediction in Neurodegenerative Conditions using coVariance Neural Networks</title>

Abstract: Brain age is the estimate of biological age derived from neuroimaging datasets using machine learning algorithms. Increasing \textit{brain age gap} characterized by an elevated brain age relative to the chronological age can reflect increased vulnerability to neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. Hence, brain age gap is a promising biomarker for monitoring brain health. However, black-box machine learning approaches to brain age gap prediction have limited practical utility. Recent studies on coVariance neural networks (VNN) have proposed a relatively transparent deep learning pipeline for neuroimaging data analyses, which possesses two key features: (i) inherent \textit{anatomically interpretablity} of derived biomarkers; and (ii) a methodologically interpretable perspective based on \textit{linkage with eigenvectors of anatomic covariance matrix}. In this paper, we apply the VNN-based approach to study brain age gap using cortical thickness features for various prevalent neurodegenerative conditions. Our results reveal distinct anatomic patterns for brain age gap in Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia, and atypical Parkinsonian disorders. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the distinct anatomic patterns of brain age gap are linked with the differences in how VNN leverages the eigenspectrum of the anatomic covariance matrix, thus lending explainability to the reported results.</description>

      <title>Reading to Listen at the Cocktail Party: Multi-Modal Speech Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is speech separation and enhancement in multi-speaker and noisy environments using a combination of different modalities. Previous works have shown good performance when conditioning on temporal or static visual evidence such as synchronised lip movements or face identity. In this paper, we present a unified framework for multi-modal speech separation and enhancement based on synchronous or asynchronous cues. To that end we make the following contributions: (i) we design a modern Transformer-based architecture tailored to fuse different modalities to solve the speech separation task in the raw waveform domain; (ii) we propose conditioning on the textual content of a sentence alone or in combination with visual information; (iii) we demonstrate the robustness of our model to audio-visual synchronisation offsets; and, (iv) we obtain state-of-the-art performance on the well-established benchmark datasets LRS2 and LRS3.</description>

      <title>Online Meta-Learning Channel Autoencoder for Dynamic End-to-end Physical Layer Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Channel Autoencoders (CAEs) have shown significant potential in optimizing the physical layer of a wireless communication system for a specific channel through joint end-to-end training. However, the practical implementation of CAEs faces several challenges, particularly in realistic and dynamic scenarios. Channels in communication systems are dynamic and change with time. Still, most proposed CAE designs assume stationary scenarios, meaning they are trained and tested for only one channel realization without regard for the dynamic nature of wireless communication systems. Moreover, conventional CAEs are designed based on the assumption of having access to a large number of pilot signals, which act as training samples in the context of CAEs. However, in real-world applications, it is not feasible for a CAE operating in real-time to acquire large amounts of training samples for each new channel realization. Hence, the CAE has to be deployable in few-shot learning scenarios where only limited training samples are available. Furthermore, most proposed conventional CAEs lack fast adaptability to new channel realizations, which becomes more pronounced when dealing with a limited number of pilots. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the Online Meta Learning channel AE (OML-CAE) framework for few-shot CAE scenarios with dynamic channels. The OML-CAE framework enhances adaptability to varying channel conditions in an online manner, allowing for dynamic adjustments in response to evolving communication scenarios. Moreover, it can adapt to new channel conditions using only a few pilots, drastically increasing pilot efficiency and making the CAE design feasible in realistic scenarios.</description>

      <title>KeyNode-Driven Geometry Coding for Real-World Scanned Human Dynamic Mesh Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The compression of real-world scanned 3D human dynamic meshes is an emerging research area, driven by applications such as telepresence, virtual reality, and 3D digital streaming. Unlike synthesized dynamic meshes with fixed topology, scanned dynamic meshes often not only have varying topology across frames but also scan defects such as holes and outliers, increasing the complexity of prediction and compression. Additionally, human meshes often combine rigid and non-rigid motions, making accurate prediction and encoding significantly more difficult compared to objects that exhibit purely rigid motion. To address these challenges, we propose a compression method designed for real-world scanned human dynamic meshes, leveraging embedded key nodes. The temporal motion of each vertex is formulated as a distance-weighted combination of transformations from neighboring key nodes, requiring the transmission of solely the key nodes' transformations. To enhance the quality of the KeyNode-driven prediction, we introduce an octree-based residual coding scheme and a Dual-direction prediction mode, which uses I-frames from both directions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvements over the state-of-the-art, with an average bitrate saving of 24.51% across the evaluated sequences, particularly excelling at low bitrates.</description>

      <title>BERT4MIMO: A Foundation Model using BERT Architecture for Massive MIMO Channel State Information Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Massive MIMO (Multiple-Input Multiple-Output) is an advanced wireless communication technology, using a large number of antennas to improve the overall performance of the communication system in terms of capacity, spectral, and energy efficiency. The performance of MIMO systems is highly dependent on the quality of channel state information (CSI). Predicting CSI is, therefore, essential for improving communication system performance, particularly in MIMO systems, since it represents key characteristics of a wireless channel, including propagation, fading, scattering, and path loss. This study proposes a foundation model inspired by BERT, called BERT4MIMO, which is specifically designed to process high-dimensional CSI data from massive MIMO systems. BERT4MIMO offers superior performance in reconstructing CSI under varying mobility scenarios and channel conditions through deep learning and attention mechanisms. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of BERT4MIMO in a variety of wireless environments.</description>

      <title>Digital Twin-based SIM Communication and Flight Control for Advanced Air Mobility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electric Vertical Take-off and Landing vehicles (eVTOLs) are driving Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) toward transforming urban transportation by extending travel from congested ground networks to low-altitude airspace. This transition promises to reduce traffic congestion and significantly shorten commute times. To ensure aviation safety, eVTOLs must fly within prescribed flight corridors. These corridors are managed by ground-based Air Traffic Control (ATCo) stations, which oversee air-ground communication and flight scheduling. However, one critical challenge remains: the lack of high rate air-ground communication and safe flight planning within these corridors. The introduction of 6G-oriented Stacked Intelligent Metasurface (SIM) technology presents a high rate communication solution. With advanced phase-shifting capabilities, SIM enables precise wireless signal control and supports beam-tracking communication with eVTOLs. Leveraging this technology, we propose a Composite Potential Field (CPF) approach. This method dynamically integrates target, separation, and communication fields to optimize both SIM communication efficiency and flight safety. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of this DT-based approach. Compared to the potential field flight control benchmark, it improves the transmission rate by 8.3\%. Additionally, it reduces flight distance deviation from the prescribed corridor by 10\% compared to predetermined optimization methods.</description>

      <title>Design of stacked intelligent metasurfaces with reconfigurable amplitude and phase for multiuser downlink beamforming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16606v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel technology based on stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIM) has recently emerged. This platform involves cascading multiple metasurfaces, each acting as a digitally programmable physical layer within a diffractive neural network. SIM enable the implementation of signal-processing transformations directly in the electromagnetic wave domain, eliminating the need for expensive, high-precision, and power-intensive digital platforms. However, existing studies employing SIM in wireless communication applications rely solely on nearly passive structures that control only the phase of the meta-atoms in each layer. In this study, we propose a SIM-aided downlink multiuser transmission scheme, where the SIM at the base station (BS) end is designed by combining nearly passive layers with phase-only reconfiguration capabilities and active layers integrated with amplifier chips to enable amplitude control. Our optimal design aims at maximizing the sum rate for the best group of users by jointly optimizing the transmit power allocation at the BS and the wave-based beamforming at the SIM. In addition to the standard sum-power constraint at the BS, our optimization framework includes two additional constraints: (i) a per-stream power preserving constraint to prevent propagation losses across the SIM, and (ii) an amplitude constraint to account for power limitations for each active layer. To further reduce the complexity of the optimal beamforming solution, we explore a simple yet suboptimal zero-forcing (ZF) beamforming design, where the wave-based transformation implemented by the SIM is selected to eliminate interference among user streams. Finally, extensive Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that incorporating both nearly passive and active layers within the SIM significantly enhances capacity compared to previously reported phase-only coding SIM.</description>

      <title>Past, Present, and Future of Sensor-Based Human Activity Recognition Using Wearables: A Surveying Tutorial on a Still Challenging Task</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14452v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the many years since the inception of wearable sensor-based Human Activity Recognition (HAR), a wide variety of methods have been introduced and evaluated for their ability to recognize activities. Substantial gains have been made since the days of hand-crafting heuristics as features, yet, progress has seemingly stalled on many popular benchmarks, with performance falling short of what may be considered 'sufficient'-- despite the increase in computational power and scale of sensor data, as well as rising complexity in techniques being employed. The HAR community approaches a new paradigm shift, this time incorporating world knowledge from foundational models. In this paper, we take stock of sensor-based HAR -- surveying it from its beginnings to the current state of the field, and charting its future. This is accompanied by a hands-on tutorial, through which we guide practitioners in developing HAR systems for real-world application scenarios. We provide a compendium for novices and experts alike, of methods that aim at finally solving the activity recognition problem.</description>

      <title>Frame Codes for the Block-Erasure Channel -- Extended Version</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01172v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Analog codes add redundancy by expanding the dimension using real/complex-valued operations. Frame theory provides a mathematical basis for constructing such codes, with diverse applications in non-orthogonal code-division multiple access (NOMA-CDMA), distributed computation, multiple description source coding, space-time coding (STC), and more. The channel model corresponding to these applications is a combination of noise and erasures. Recent analyses showed a useful connection between spectral random-matrix theory and large equiangular tight frames (ETFs) under random uniform erasures. In this work we generalize this model to a channel where the erasures come in blocks. This particularly fits NOMA-CDMA with multiple transmit antennas for each user and STC with known spatial grouping. We present a method to adjust ETF codes to suit block erasures, and find minimum intra-block-correlation frames which outperform ETFs in this setting.</description>

      <title>MobileNetV2: A lightweight classification model for home-based sleep apnea screening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19967v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study proposes a novel lightweight neural network model leveraging features extracted from electrocardiogram (ECG) and respiratory signals for early OSA screening. ECG signals are used to generate feature spectrograms to predict sleep stages, while respiratory signals are employed to detect sleep-related breathing abnormalities. By integrating these predictions, the method calculates the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) with enhanced accuracy, facilitating precise OSA diagnosis.
  The method was validated on three publicly available sleep apnea databases: the Apnea-ECG database, the UCDDB dataset, and the MIT-BIH Polysomnographic database. Results showed an overall OSA detection accuracy of 0.978, highlighting the model's robustness. Respiratory event classification achieved an accuracy of 0.969 and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) of 0.98. For sleep stage classification, in UCDDB dataset, the ROC-AUC exceeded 0.85 across all stages, with recall for Sleep reaching 0.906 and specificity for REM and Wake states at 0.956 and 0.937, respectively.
  This study underscores the potential of integrating lightweight neural networks with multi-signal analysis for accurate, portable, and cost-effective OSA screening, paving the way for broader adoption in home-based and wearable health monitoring systems.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis and Optimization of STAR-RIS-Aided Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems Relying on Imperfect Hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00546v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS)-aided cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) systems are investigated under spatially correlated fading channels using realistic imperfect hardware. Specifically, the transceiver distortions, \textcolor{black}{time-varying phase noise, and RIS phase shift errors} are considered. Upon considering imperfect hardware and pilot contamination, we derive a linear minimum mean-square error (MMSE) criterion-based cascaded channel estimator. Moreover, a closed-form expression of the downlink ergodic spectral efficiency (SE) is derived based on maximum ratio (MR) based transmit precoding and channel statistics, where both a finite number of access points (APs) and STAR-RIS elements as well as imperfect hardware are considered. Furthermore, by exploiting the ergodic signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios (SINRs) among user equipment (UE), a max-min fairness problem is formulated for the joint optimization of the passive transmitting and reflecting beamforming (BF) at the STAR-RIS as well as of the power control coefficients. An alternating optimization (AO) algorithm is proposed for solving the resultant problems, where iterative adaptive particle swarm optimization (APSO) and bisection methods are proposed for circumventing the non-convexity of the RIS passive BF and the quasi-concave power control sub-problems, respectively. Our simulation results illustrate that the STAR-RIS-aided CF-mMIMO system attains higher SE than its RIS-aided counterpart. The performance of different hardware parameters is also evaluated. Additionally, it is demonstrated that the SE of the worst UE can be significantly improved by exploiting the proposed AO-based algorithm compared to conventional solutions associated with random passive BF and equal-power scenarios.</description>
