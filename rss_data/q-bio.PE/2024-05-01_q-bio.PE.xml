      <title>Reevaluating coexistence and stability in ecosystem networks to address ecological transients: methods and implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Representing ecosystems at equilibrium has been foundational for building ecological theories, forecasting species populations and planning conservation actions. The equilibrium "balance of nature" ideal suggests that populations will eventually stabilise to a coexisting balance of species. However, a growing body of literature argues that the equilibrium ideal is inappropriate for ecosystems. Here, we develop and demonstrate a new framework for representing ecosystems without considering equilibrium dynamics. Instead, far more pragmatic ecosystem models are constructed by considering population trajectories, regardless of whether they exhibit equilibrium or transient (i.e. non-equilibrium) behaviour. This novel framework maximally utilises readily available, but often overlooked, knowledge from field observations and expert elicitation, rather than relying on theoretical ecosystem properties. We developed innovative Bayesian algorithms to generate ecosystem models in this new statistical framework, without excessive computational burden. Our results reveal that our pragmatic framework could have a dramatic impact on conservation decision-making and enhance the realism of ecosystem models and forecasts.</description>

      <title>New Trends on the Systems Approach to Modeling SARS-CoV-2 Pandemics in a Globally Connected Planet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a critical analysis of the literature and perspective research ideas for modeling the epidemics caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. It goes beyond deterministic population dynamics to consider several key complexity features of the system under consideration. In particular, the multiscale features of the dynamics from contagion to the subsequent dynamics of competition between the immune system and the proliferating virus. Other topics addressed in this work include the propagation of epidemics in a territory, taking into account local transportation networks, the heterogeneity of the population, and the study of social and economic problems in populations involved in the spread of epidemics. The overall content aims to show how new mathematical tools can be developed to address the above topics and how mathematical models and simulations can contribute to the decision making of crisis managers.</description>

      <title>Complex contagions can outperform simple contagions for network reconstruction with dense networks or saturated dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Network scientists often use complex dynamic processes to describe network contagions, but tools for fitting contagion models typically assume simple dynamics. Here, we address this gap by developing a nonparametric method to reconstruct a network and dynamics from a series of node states, using a model that breaks the dichotomy between simple pairwise and complex neighborhood-based contagions. We then show that a network is more easily reconstructed when observed through the lens of complex contagions if it is dense or the dynamic saturates, and that simple contagions are better otherwise.</description>
