      <title>Josephson tunnel junction arrays and Andreev weak links: linked by a single energy-phase relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Josephson elements are cornerstones of cryogenic classical and quantum superconducting technology, owing to their nonlinearity. Two important types of Josephson elements are often considered distinct: the tunnel junction (superconductor-insulator-superconductor, SIS) and the Andreev weak link (superconductor-normal-superconductor, SNS) referring to any non-superconducting and non-insulating central region. SNS junctions and SIS junctions have appeared in related technological and fundamental science contexts over the last decade, such as in the design of protected qubit concepts. In this perspective article, we review correspondences between SISIS junctions and SNS junctions in limiting regimes, in which a single energy-phase relationship describes both systems. We show how this insight helps to connect recent bodies of theoretical and experimental work in both systems, and conclude by describing a few important differences.</description>

      <title>Trions Stimulate Electronic Coupling in Colloidal Quantum Dot Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent synthetic progress has enabled the controlled fusion of colloidal CdSe/CdS quantum dots in order to form dimers manifesting electronic coupling in their optical response. While this ``artificial H2 molecule'' constitutes a milestone towards the development of nanocrystal chemistry, the strength of the coupling has proven to be smaller than intended. The reason is that, when an exciton is photo-induced in the system, the hole localizes inside the CdSe cores and captures the electron, thus preventing its delocalization all over the dimer. Here, we predict, by means of k$\cdot$p theory and configuration interaction calculations, that using trions instead of neutral excitons or biexcitons restores the electron delocalization. Positive trions are particularly apt because the strong hole-hole repulsion makes electron delocalization robust against moderate asymmetries in the cores, thus keeping a homodimer-like behavior. Trion-charged colloidal quantum dot molecules have the potential to display quantum entanglement features at room temperature with existing technology.</description>

      <title>DMRG Analysis of Magnetic Order in the Zigzag Edges of Hexagonal CrN Nanoribbons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the finite temperature magnetic order at the edges of hexagonal CrN nanoribbons by using the density-functional theory combined with the density-matrix renormalization group method. Moreover, the spin-dependent transport in nanoribbons is calculated within the semi-classical Boltzmann transport theory. We find out that the zigzag edges have lower energy with respect to armchair edges. The zigzag edge of CrN nanoribbon shows half metallic electronic character which is the same as for the 2D monolayer. The localized electronic states on the zigzag edges reduce the electronic band gap energy for spin down electrons. The ab-initio electronic results are mapped into an effective 1D Heisenberg spin model up to the next nearest neighbor exchange interaction term. For zigzag ribbons, the nearest neighbor and next nearest neighbor magnetic exchange are around $10$ to $12$, and $-2$ to $0$~meV/Cr atom, respectively. The finite spin correlation length in 1D nanoribbons drops sharply to zero with temperature. The absence of long range spin correlations at the edges is a practical drawback for future room temperature 2D spintronic devices. The maximally localized Wannier functions are used for band interpolation and spin-dependent transport calculations by using the semi-classical Boltzmann equation. We show that zigzag edges of CrN are perfect spin filter under both electron and hole doping.</description>

      <title>Optical Control of Ultrafast Photocurrent in Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to manipulate electrons with the intense laser pulse enables an unprecedented control over the electronic motion on its intrinsic timescale. Present work explores the desired control of photocurrent generation in monolayer graphene on ultrafast timescale. The origin of photocurrent is attributed to the asymmetric residual electronic population in the conduction band after the end of the laser pulse, which also facilitates valley polarization. Present study offers a comprehensive analysis of the differences between these two observables, namely photocurrent and valley polarization. It is found that the corotating circularly polarized $\omega-2\omega$ laser pulses allow the generation of photocurrent but no valley polarization, whereas counterrotating circularly polarized $\omega-2\omega$ laser pulses yield significant valley polarization without any photocurrent in graphene. Different laser parameters, such as subcycle phase, wavelength, and intensity provide different knobs to control the generation of the photocurrent. In addition, threefold increase in the photocurrent's amplitude can be achieved by altering electronic properties of graphene via strain engineering. Our findings reveal intriguing underlying mechanisms into the interplay between the symmetries of the graphene's electronic structure and the driving laser pulses, shedding light on the potential for harnessing graphene's properties for novel applications in ultrafast photonics, optoelectronic devices, and quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Impact of evanescent scattering modes and finite dispersion in superconducting junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting junctions are essential building blocks for quantum hardware, and their fundamental behavior remains a highly active research field. The behaviour of generic junctions is conveniently described by Beenakker's determinant formula, linking the subgap energy spectrum to the scattering matrix characterizing the junction. In particular, the gap closing between bound and continuum states in short junctions follows from unitarity of the scattering matrix, and thus, from probability conservation. In this work, we critically reassess two assumptions: that scattering in short junctions is approximately energy-independent and dominated by planar channels. We argue that strongly energy-dependent scattering follows from finite dispersion of the conductor electrons even when they spend little time within the scattering region, and show that evanescent modes play a central role when cross-channel scattering is important. By generalizing Beenakker's equation and performing a mapping to an effective Hamiltonian, we show that the gap closing is linked to a chiral symmetry. While finite energy-dependence in the scattering breaks the chiral symmetry, we show two distinct mechanisms preserving the gap closing, each connected to new types of constraints on energy-dependent scattering matrices beyond unitarity. If the dispersive mode is planar, the gap closing is still preserved through a time-dependent probability conservation analysis of the scattering process. If the dispersive channel is evanescent, we derive a constraint which, notably, cannot follow from probability conservation. We thus demonstrate that Andreev physics reveal a much wider variety of properties of normal metal scattering than commonly expected. We expect that our findings will have an impact on the dissipative behavior of driven junctions, and offer a new perspective on fundamental properties of scattering matrices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the majorization order for comparing wave coherence and reveal its fundamental consequences in transport measurements, including power distribution, absorption, transmission, and reflection. We prove that all these measurements preserve the majorization order under unitary control, enabling direct experimental characterization of the majorization order. Specifically, waves with lower coherence in the majorization order exhibit more restricted ranges of achievable measurement values. Our results deepen the understanding of coherence in transport phenomena.</description>

      <title>Open whispering gallery modes resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There are some issues with traditional whispering gallery mode (WGM) resonators like poor light extraction and a dense mode spectrum. In this paper we introduce a solution to these limitations by proposing open WGM (OWGM) resonators that effectively reduce the mode density and enable directional radiation through a connected waveguide at the expense of some lowering in Q-factor. Numerical simulations of two-dimensional metallic and dielectric disk resonators with holes reveal a significant increase in intermode distance. The study also extends to three-dimensional dielectric OWGM resonators, demonstrating the formation of sparse spectra suitable for photonics applications. Additionally, the design of a cylindrical Bragg microresonator connected to a single-mode fiber via an optimized topology-based connector achieves near-unity transmission and efficient coupling. This approach enhances the development of new photonic devices, addressing the limitations of traditional high Q-factor WGM resonators and offering potential advancements in laser technology and optical communications, where compactness and manufacturability are prioritized over ultra-high Q-factors.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we evaluate the viability of CubeSats as an attractive platform for lightweight instrumentation by describing a proof of concept CubeSat that houses an astrophotonic chip for transit spectroscopy-based exoplanet atmosphere gas sensing. The Twin Earth SEnsoR Astrophotonic CubesaT (TESERACT) was designed to house a correlation spectroscopy chip along with an electrical and optical system for operation. We investigate design challenges and considerations in incorporating astrophotonic instrumentation such as component integration, thermal management and optical alignment. This work aims to be a pathfinder for demonstrating that astrophotonic-based CubeSat missions can perform leading edge, targeted science in lower-cost CubeSat platforms.</description>

      <title>Integrated astrophotonic phase control for high resolution optical interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long baseline optical interferometry and aperture synthesis using ground-based telescopes can enable unprecedented angular resolution astronomy in the optical domain. However, atmospheric turbulence leads to large, dynamic phase errors between participating apertures that limit fringe visibility using telescopes arrays or subaperture configurations in a single large telescope. Diffraction limited optics or adaptive optics can be used to ensure coherence at each aperture, but correlating the phase between apertures requires high speed, high stroke phase correction and recombination that is extremely challenging and costly. As a solution, we show an alternative phase correction and beam combination method using a centimeter-scale silicon astrophotonic chip optimized for H-band operation. The 4.7x10mm silicon photonic chip is fabricated using electron beam lithography with devices with 2 up to 32 independent channels. Light is coupled into the chip using single mode fiber ribbons. An array of microheaters is used to individually tune the effective index of each spiral delay waveguides. Narrowband spectral splitters at each spatial channel divert a modulated digital reference signal from an artificial guide star off-chip for phase measurement. Science light from other wavelengths is coherently combined using on-chip beam combiners and outputted to a single waveguide. We described the role, design, fabrication and characterization of the photonic chip. This photonic phase control scheme can be applied in astronomical interferometry or optical satellite communications.</description>

      <title>Application of the shift-invert Lanczos algorithm to a non-equilibrium Green function for transport problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-equilibrium Green's function theory and related methods are widely used to describe transport phenomena in many-body systems, but they often require a costly inversion of a large matrix. We show here that the shift-invert Lanczos method can dramatically reduce the computational effort. We apply the method to two test problems, namely a simple model Hamiltonian and to a more realistic Hamiltonian for nuclear fission. For a Hamiltonian of dimension 66103 we find that the computation time is reduced by a factor of 33 compared to the direct calculation of the Green's function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Force Microscopy (MRFM) describes a range of approaches to detect nuclear spins with mechanical sensors. MRFM has the potential to enable magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with near-atomic spatial resolution, opening up exciting possibilities in solid state and biological research. In many cases, the spin-mechanics coupling in MRFM is engineered with the help of periodic radio-frequency pulses. In this paper, we report that such pulses can result in unwanted parametric amplification of the mechanical vibrations, causing misinterpretation of the measured signal. We show how the parametric effect can be cancelled by auxiliary radio-frequency pulses or by appropriate post-correction after careful calibration. Future MRFM measurements may even make use of the parametric amplification to reduce the impact of amplifier noise</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continuum lattice structures which consist of joined elastic beams subject to flexural deformations are ubiquitous in nature and engineering. Here, first, we reveal the topological dynamics of continuous beam structures by rigorously proving the existence of infinitely many topological edge states within the bandgaps. Then, we obtain the analytical expressions for the topological phases of bulk bands, and propose a topological index related to the Zak phase that determines the existence of the edge states. The theoretical approach is directly applicable to general continuum lattice structures. We demonstrate the topological edge states of bridge-like frames, plates, and continuous beams on elastic foundations and springs, and the topological corner states of kagome frames. The continuum lattice structures serve as excellent platforms for exploring various kinds of topological phases and demonstrating the topologically protected states at multifrequencies, and their topological dynamics has significant implications in safety assessment, structural health monitoring, and energy harvesting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The electric control of quantum spin chains has been an outstanding goal for the few last years due to its potential use in technologies related to quantum information processing. In this work, we show the feasibility of the different steps necessary to perform controlled quantum state transfer in a $S=1/2$ titanium atoms chain employing the electric field produced by a Scanning Tunneling Microscope (STM). Our results show that the initialization and transmission of a single excitation state is achievable in short times, and with high fidelity. Our study uses spin Hamiltonians to model the magnetic atoms chain, the tip of the STM, the interaction between it and the atoms chain and the electronic response to the fields applied by the tip, employing sets of parameters compatible with the latest experiments and ab initio calculations. The time dynamical evolution is considered in the full Hilbert space and the control pulses frequencies exerted by the tip of the microscope are within the reach of present day technology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the results of the study of the acoustic and optical phonons in Si-doped AlN thin films grown by metalorganic chemical vapor deposition on sapphire substrates. The Brillouin - Mandelstam and Raman light scattering spectroscopies were used to measure the acoustic and optical phonon frequencies close to the Brillouin zone center. The optical phonon frequencies reveal non-monotonic changes, reflective of the variations in the thin-film strain and dislocation densities with the addition of Si dopant atoms. The acoustic phonon velocity decreases monotonically with increasing Si dopant concentration, reducing by ~300 m/s at the doping level of 3 x 10^19 1/cm3. Knowledge of the acoustic phonon velocities can be used to optimize ultra-wide bandgap semiconductor heterostructures and minimize the thermal boundary resistance of high-power devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.13952v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Under a high frequency drive, Josephson junctions demonstrate "Shapiro steps" of quantized voltage. These are dynamically stabilized states, in which the phase across the junction locks to the external drive. We explore the stochastic switching between two symmetric steps at $\frac{\hbar\omega}{2e}$ and $-\frac{\hbar\omega}{2e}$. Surprisingly, the switching rate exhibits a pronounced non-monotonicity as a function of temperature, violating the general expectation that transitions should become faster with temperature. We explain this behavior by realizing that the system retains memory of the dynamic state from which it is switching, thereby breaking the conventional simplifying assumptions about separations of time scales.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.05351v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the magneto-photoluminescence of an optically trapped exciton-polariton condensate in a planar semiconductor microcavity with multiple In0.08Ga0.92As quantum wells. Extremely high condensate coherence time and continuous control over the polariton confinement are among the advantages provided by optical trapping. This allows us to resolve magnetically induced {\mu}eV fine-energy shifts in the condensate and identify unusual dynamical regions in its parameter space. We observe polariton Zeeman splitting and, in small traps with tight confinement, demonstrate its full parametric screening when the condensate density exceeds a critical value, reminiscent of the spin-Meissner effect. For larger optical traps, we observe a complete inversion in the Zeeman splitting as a function of power, underlining the importance of condensate confinement and interactions with its background reservoir excitons.</description>

      <title>Tunneling of fluxons via a Josephson resonant level</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.03102v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fluxons in a superconducting loop can be coherently coupled by quantum phase slips occurring at a weak link such as a Josephson junction. If Cooper pair tunneling at the junction occurs through a resonant level, $2\pi$ quantum phase slips are suppressed, and fluxons are predominantly coupled by $4\pi$ quantum phase slips. We analyze this scenario by computing the coupling between fluxons as the level is brought into resonance with the superconducting condensate. The results indicate that the $4\pi$-dominated regime can be observed directly in the transition spectrum for circuit parameters typical of a fluxonium qubit. We also show that, if the inductive energy of the loop is much smaller than the plasma frequency of the junction, the low-energy Hamiltonian of the circuit is dual to that of a topological superconducting island. These findings can inform experiments on bifluxon qubits as well as the design of novel types of protected qubits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12867v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Key pre-synaptic and post-synaptic biological functions have been successfully implemented in various hardware systems. A noticeable example are neuronal networks constructed from memristors, which are emulating complex electro-chemical biological dynamics such a neuron's efficacy and plasticity. Neurons are highly active cells, communicating with chemical and electrical stimuli, but also emit light. These photons are suspected to be a complementary vehicle to transport information across the brain. Here, we show that a memristor also releases photons akin to the production of neuronal light. Critical attributes of so-called biophotons such as self-generation, origin, stochasticity, spectral coverage, sparsity and correlation with the neuron's activity are replicated by our solid-state approach. Our findings further extend the emulating capability of a memristor to encompass neuronal biophoton emission and open the possibility to construct a bimodal electro-optical platform with the assistance of atomic-scale devices capable of handling electrons and photons as information carriers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02472v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Josephson junctions enable dissipation-less electrical current through metals and insulators below a critical current. Despite being central to quantum technology based on superconducting quantum bits and fundamental research into self-conjugate quasiparticles, the spatial distribution of super current flow at the junction and its predicted evolution with current bias and external magnetic field remain experimentally elusive. Revealing the hidden current flow, featureless in electrical resistance, helps understanding unconventional phenomena such as the nonreciprocal critical current, i.e., Josephson diode effect. Here we introduce a platform to visualize super current flow at the nanoscale. Utilizing a scanning magnetometer based on nitrogen vacancy centers in diamond, we uncover competing ground states electrically switchable within the zero-resistance regime. The competition results from the superconducting phase re-configuration induced by the Josephson current and kinetic inductance of thin-film superconductors. We further identify a new mechanism for the Josephson diode effect involving the Josephson current induced phase. The nanoscale super current flow emerges as a new experimental observable for elucidating unconventional superconductivity, and optimizing quantum computation and energy-efficient devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04207v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Anderson overlap catastrophe (AOC) is a many-body effect arising as a result of a shakeup of a Fermi sea due to an abrupt change of a local potential, leading to a power-law dependence of the density of states on energy. Here we demonstrate that a standard quantum-dot detector can be employed as a highly tuneable probe of the AOC, where the power law can be continuously modified by a gate voltage. We show that signatures of the AOC have already appeared in previous experiments, and give explicit predictions allowing to tune and pinpoint their non-perturbative aspects.</description>

      <title>Determining Strain Components in a Diamond Waveguide from Zero-Field ODMR Spectra of NV$^{-}$ Center Ensembles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06422v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV$^{-}$) center in diamond has shown great potential in nanoscale sensing and quantum information processing due to its rich spin physics. An efficient coupling with light, providing strong luminescence, is crucial for realizing these applications. Laser-written waveguides in diamond promote NV$^{-}$ creation and improve their coupling to light but, at the same time, induce strain in the crystal. The induced strain contributes to light guiding but also affects the energy levels of NV$^{-}$ centers. We probe NV$^{-}$ spin states experimentally with the commonly used continuous-wave zero-field optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR). In our waveguides, the ODMR spectra are shifted, split, and consistently asymmetric, which we attribute to the impact of local strain. To understand these features, we model ensemble ODMR signals in the presence of strain. By fitting the model results to the experimentally collected ODMR data, we determine the strain tensor components at different positions, thus determining the strain profile across the waveguide. This shows that zero-field ODMR spectroscopy can be used as a strain imaging tool. The resulting strain within the waveguide is dominated by a compressive axial component transverse to the waveguide structure, with a smaller contribution from vertical and shear strain components.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11353v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine 2D electron transport through a long narrow channel driven by an external electric field in presence of diffusive boundary scattering. At zero temperature, we derive an analytical solution of the transition from ballistic to diffusive transport if we increase the bulk disorder strength. This crossover yields characteristic current density profiles. Furthermore, we illustrate the current density in the transition from ballistic to hydrodynamic transport. This corresponds to the Gurzhi effect in the resistivity. We also study the influence of finite temperature on current densities and average current in this system. In particular, we analyze how a particular scaling law of electron-electron scattering with respect to temperature affects the current along the channel.</description>

      <title>Topological Superfluid Responses of Superconducting Dirac Semimetals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.07676v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that topological constraints do not only dictate the geometric part of the superfluid stiffness, but can also govern the total superfluid stiffness. By introducing a general adiabatic approach for superfluid responses, we showcase such a possibility by proving that the stiffness of a superconducting Dirac cone in two dimensions (2D) is proportional to its topological charge. By relying on the emergent Lorentz invariance of Dirac electrons, we unify the superfluid stiffness and quantum capacitance in these systems. Based on this connection, we further predict a topological origin for the quantum capacitance of a Josephson junction where 2D massless Dirac electrons are sandwiched between two conventional superconductors. We show that the topological responses persist upon effecting strain, are resilient against weak disorder, and can be experimentally controlled via a Zeeman field. Remarkably, the nonuniversal topological quantization of the two superfluid responses, yet implies the universal topological quantization of the admittance modulus of the superconducting Dirac system in units of conductance. The quantum admittance effect arises when embedding the superconducting Dirac system in an ac electrical circuit with a frequency tuned at the absorption edge. These findings are in principle experimentally observable in graphene-superconductor hybrids.</description>

      <title>A Robust Large-Period Discrete Time Crystal and its Signature in a Digital Quantum Computer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.11560v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discrete time crystals (DTCs) are novel out-of-equilibrium quantum states of matter which break time translational symmetry. So far, only the simplest form of DTCs that exhibit period-doubling dynamics has been unambiguously realized in experiments. We develop an intuitive interacting spin-$1/2$ system that supports the more non-trivial period-quadrupling DTCs ($4T$-DTCs) and demonstrate its digital simulation on a noisy quantum processor. Remarkably, we found a strong signature of the predicted $4T$-DTC that is robust against and, in some cases, amplified by different types of disorders. Our findings thus shed light on the interplay between disorder and quantum interactions on the formation of time crystallinity beyond periodic-doubling, as well as demonstrate the potential of existing noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices for simulating exotic non-equilibrium quantum states of matter.</description>

      <title>Superfluid Stiffness and Josephson Quantum Capacitance: Adiabatic Approach and Topological Effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12223v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We bring forward a unified framework for the study of the superfluid stiffness and the quantum capacitance of superconducting platforms exhibiting conventional spin-singlet pairing. We focus on systems which in their normal phase contain topological band touching points or crossings, while in their superconducting regime feature a fully gapped energy spectrum. Our unified description relies on viewing these two types of physical quantities as the charge current and density response coefficients obtained for ``slow" spatiotemporal variations of the superconducting phase. Within our adiabatic formalism, the two coefficients are given in terms of Berry curvatures defined in synthetic spaces. Our work lays the foundations for the systematic description of topological diagonal superfluid responses induced by singularities dictating the synthetic Berry curvatures. We exemplify our approach for concrete one- and two-dimensional models of superconducting topological (semi)metals. We discuss topological phenomena which arise in the superfluid stiffness of bulk systems and the quantum capacitance of Josephson junctions. We show that both coefficients become proportional to a topological invariant which counts the number of topological touchings/crossings of the normal phase band structure. These topological effects can be equivalently viewed as manifestations of chiral anomaly. Our predictions appear experimentally testable in topological semimetals with proximity-induced pairing, such as in graphene-superconductor hybrids at charge neutrality.</description>

Abstract: The light dark matter mass regime has emerged as the next frontier in the direct detection experiment due to the lack of any detection signal in the higher mass range. In this paper, we propose a new detector material, a bilayer stack of graphene to detect sub-MeV dark matter. Its voltage-tunable low energy sub-eV electronic band gap makes it an excellent choice for the detector material of a light dark matter search experiment. We compute its dielectric function using the random phase approximation and estimate the projected sensitivity for sub-MeV dark matter-electron scattering and sub-eV dark matter absorption. We show that a bilayer graphene dark matter detector can have competitive sensitivity as other candidate target materials, like a superconductor, but with a tunable threshold energy in this mass regime. The dark matter scattering rate in bilayer graphene is also characterized by a daily modulation from the rotation of the Earth which may help us mitigate the backgrounds in a future experiment. We also outline a detector design concept and provide noise estimates that can be followed to setup an experiment in future.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06856v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Density oscillations in quantum fluids can reveal their fundamental characteristic features. In this work, we study the density oscillation of incompressible fractional quantum Hall (FQH) fluids created by flux insertion. For the model Laughlin state, we find that the complex oscillations seen in various density profiles in real space can be universally captured by a simple damped oscillator model in the occupation-number space. It requires only two independent fitting parameters or characteristic length scales: the decay length and the oscillation wave number. Realistic Coulomb quasiholes can be viewed as Laughlin quasiholes dressed by magnetorotons, which can be modeled by a generalized damped oscillator model. Our work reveals the fundamental connections between the oscillations seen in various aspects of FQH fluids such as in the density of quasiholes, edge, and the pair correlation function. The presented model is useful for the study of quasihole sizes for their control and braiding in experiments and large-scale numerical computation of variational energies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19445v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superconducting diode effects have recently attracted much attention for their potential applications in superconducting logic circuits. Several mechanisms such as magneto-chiral effects, finite momentum Cooper pairing, asymmetric edge currents have been proposed to give rise to a supercurrent diode effect in different materials. In this work, we establish the presence of a large intrinsic Josephson diode effect in a type-II Dirac semimetal $1T-PtTe_2$ facilitated by its helical spin-momentum locking and distinguish it from other extrinsic effects. The magnitude of the Josephson diode effect is shown to be directly correlated to the large second-harmonic component of the supercurrent that is induced by the significant contribution of the topological spin-momentum locked states that promote coherent Andreev processes in the junction. We denote such junctions, where the relative phase between the two harmonics corresponding to charge transfers of $2e$ and $4e$ can be tuned by a magnetic field, as second order ${\phi}_0$-junctions. The direct correspondence between the second harmonic supercurrent component and the diode effect in $1T-PtTe_2$ junctions makes topological semimetals with high transparency an ideal platform to study and implement the Josephson diode effect, while also enabling further research on higher order supercurrent transport in Josephson junctions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12825v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The properties of a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) in a semiconductor host with two valleys related by an underlying $C_4$ rotational symmetry are studied using Hartree-Fock (HF) and various other many-body approaches. A familiar artifact of the HF approach is a degeneracy between the valley polarized - ``Ising nematic'' - and spin polarized - ferromagnetic - phases, which is inconsistent with recent variational Monte Carlo (VMC) results. Correlation effects, computed either within the random phase approximation (RPA) or the T-matrix approximation, enhance the valley susceptibility relative to the spin susceptibility. Extrapolating the results to finite interaction strength, we find a direct first-order transition from a symmetry-unbroken state to a spin unpolarized Ising nematic fluid with full valley polarization, in qualitative agreement with VMC. The RPA results are also reminiscent of experiments on the corresponding 2DEG in AlAs heterostructures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11642v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: On-chip emitters that generate single and entangled photons are essential for photonic quantum information processing technologies. Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are attractive candidates that emit high-quality quantum states of light, however at a rate limited by their spontaneous radiative lifetime. In this study, we utilize the Purcell effect to demonstrate up to a 38-fold enhancement in the emission rate of InAs QDs by coupling them to metal-clad GaAs nanopillars. These cavities, featuring a sub-wavelength mode volume of 4.5x10-4 ({\lambda}/n)3 and quality factor of 62, enable Purcell-enhanced single-photon emission across a large bandwidth of 15 nm with a multi-photon emission probability as low as 0.5 %. The broadband nature of the cavity eliminates the need for implementing tuning mechanisms typically required to achieve QD-cavity resonance, thus relaxing fabrication constraints. Ultimately, this QD-cavity architecture represents a significant stride towards developing solid-state quantum emitters generating near-ideal single-photon states at GHz-level repetition rates.</description>

      <title>On "Consistent Quantization of Nearly Singular Superconducting Circuits"</title>

Abstract: The analysis conducted by Rymarz and DiVincenzo (Phys. Rev. X 13, 021017 (2023)) regarding quantization of superconducting circuits is insufficient to justify their general conclusions, most importantly the need to discard Kirchhoff's laws to effect variable reductions. Amongst a variety of reasons, one source of several disagreements with experimental and theoretical results is the long-standing dispute between extended vs compact variables in the presence of Josephson junctions.</description>

      <title>Exciton diffusion in two-dimensional chiral perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05946v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) organic-inorganic hybrid perovskites emerged as a versatile platform for light-emitting and photovol-taic applications due to their unique structural design and chemical flexibility. Their properties depend heavily on both the choice of the inorganic lead halide framework and the surrounding organic layers. Recently, the introduction of chiral cations into 2D perovskites has attracted major interest due to their potential for introducing chirality and tuning the chiro-optical response. Importantly, the optical properties in these materials are dominated by tightly bound excitons that also serve as primary carriers for the energy transport. The mobility of photoinjected excitons is thus important from the perspectives of fundamental material properties and optoelectronic applications, yet remains an open question. Here, we demonstrate exciton propagation in a 2D chiral perovskite methylbenzylammonium lead iodide (MBA2PbI4) using transient photoluminescence microscopy and reveal density-dependent transport over more than 100 nanometers at room temperature with diffusion coeffi-cients as high as 2 cm2/s. We observe two distinct regimes of initially rapid diffusive propagation and subsequent localiza-tion. Moreover, perovskites with enantiomer pure cations are found to exhibit faster exciton diffusion compared to the race-mic mixture, correlated with the impact of the material composition on disorder. Altogether, the observations of efficient exciton diffusion at room temperature highlight the potential of 2D chiral perovskites to merge chiro-optical properties with strong light-matter interaction and efficient energy transport.</description>
