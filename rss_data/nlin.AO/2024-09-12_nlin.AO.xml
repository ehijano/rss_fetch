      <title>Machine Learning of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems with Control Parameters Using Feedforward Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several authors have reported that the echo state network reproduces bifurcation diagrams of some nonlinear differential equations using the data for a few control parameters. We demonstrate that a simpler feedforward neural network can also reproduce the bifurcation diagram of the logistics map and synchronization transition in globally coupled Stuart-Landau equations.</description>

      <title>Synchronization of endogenous business cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.06555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2002.06555v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Business cycles tend to comove across countries. However, standard models that attribute comovement to propagation of exogenous shocks struggle to generate a level of comovement that is as high as in the data. In this paper, we consider models that produce business cycles endogenously, through some form of non-linear dynamics -- limit cycles or chaos. These models generate stronger comovement, because they combine shock propagation with synchronization of endogenous dynamics. In particular, we study a demand-driven reduced-form model in which business cycles emerge from strategic complementarities within countries, synchronizing their oscillations through international trade linkages. We develop an eigendecomposition that explores the interplay between non-linear dynamics, shock propagation and network structure, and use this theory to understand the mechanisms of synchronization. Next, we calibrate the model to data on 24 countries and show that the empirical level of comovement can only be matched by combining endogenous business cycles with exogenous shocks. Despite the limitations of using a stylized model, our results support the hypothesis that business cycles are at least in part caused by underlying non-linear dynamics.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic limit in learning period three</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08825v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A continuous one-dimensional map with period three includes all periods. This raises the following question: Can we obtain any types of periodic orbits solely by learning three data points? In this letter, we report the answer to be yes. Considering a random neural network in its thermodynamic limit, we show that under certain conditions, learning period three can embed attractors with all periods into the network as a bifurcation after learning. The associated universality is explained by a topological conjugacy between the trained network and the classical logistic map.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary mechanisms that promote cooperation may not promote social welfare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05373v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the emergence of prosocial behaviours among self-interested individuals is an important problem in many scientific disciplines. Various mechanisms have been proposed to explain the evolution of such behaviours, primarily seeking the conditions under which a given mechanism can induce highest levels of cooperation. As these mechanisms usually involve costs that alter individual payoffs, it is however possible that aiming for highest levels of cooperation might be detrimental for social welfare -- the later broadly defined as the total population payoff, taking into account all costs involved for inducing increased prosocial behaviours. Herein, by comparatively analysing the social welfare and cooperation levels obtained from stochastic evolutionary models of two well-established mechanisms of prosocial behaviour, namely, peer and institutional incentives, we demonstrate exactly that. We show that the objectives of maximising cooperation levels and the objectives of maximising social welfare are often misaligned. We argue for the need of adopting social welfare as the main optimisation objective when designing and implementing evolutionary mechanisms for social and collective goods.</description>
