      <title>High-power ultra-broadband supercontinuum generation in tapered multimode glass rods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simultaneously increasing the spectral bandwidth and average output power of mid-infrared supercontinuum sources remains a major challenge for their practical application. We address this issue through experimental developments of short tapered rods made from distinct glasses (silica, tellurite and chalcogenide families) for covering distinct spectral regions by means of supercontinuum generation in the femtosecond regime. We demonstrate that ultra-broadband spectral broadenings over the entire glass transmission window can be achieved in few-cm-long segments of tapered rods by a fine adjustment of input modal excitation. As the most significant example, our simple post-processing of glass rods unlocks the high-power regime for fiber-based supercontinuum sources beyond the 10 micron waveband. By using a 5-cm-long tapered Ge-Se-Te rod pumped at 6 micron, a supercontinuum spanning from 2 to 15 micron (3 to 14 micron) with an average output power of 93 mW (170 mW) is obtained for 500-kHz (1-MHz) repetition rate. Spectral coverages from the visible to 5 micron, and from the visible to 2.7 micron, are also reported with tapered rods made of tellurite and silica glasses, respectively. Numerical simulations are used to confirm the main contribution of the fundamental mode in the ultrafast nonlinear dynamics, as well as the possible preservation of coherence features. Our study opens a new route towards the power scaling of high-repetition-rate fiber supercontinuum sources over the full molecular fingerprint region.</description>

      <title>TL properties of RE-Doped and Co-doped Sol-gel Silica Rods. Application to Passive (OSL) and Real-time (RL) Dosimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two rods made from sol-gel silica have been doped with Ce ions or co-doped with Ce and Tb ions respectively. First, a thermoluminescence (TL) characterization of the trapping and luminescence parameters is carried out to understand the physical mechanisms involved following the irradiation of these rods and to evaluate their dosimetric properties. The optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) and the radioluminescence (RL) responses as a function of respectively absorbed dose and dose rate are assessed. The OSL response of both rods is linear as a function of the absorbed dose. The RL sensitivity of both rods proves not only to be extremely high but also shows a linear behavior over more than 6 decades, allowing real-time detection of dose rates as low as few $\mu$Gy s$^{-1}$, a threshold that to our knowledge, has never been reached. The results from RL and OSL show that these silica-based doped rods are potentially suitable for medical dosimetry and environmental monitoring around nuclear sites.</description>

      <title>Towards real-world applications of levitated optomechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Levitated optomechanics, a rapidly expanding field that employs light to monitor and manipulate the mechanical motion of levitated objects, is increasingly relevant across physics, engineering, and other fields. This technique, which involves levitating micro- and nano-scale objects in a vacuum where they exhibit high-quality motion, provides an essential platform for precision measurements. Noted for their ultra-high sensitivity, levitated particles hold potential for a wide range of real-world applications. This perspective article briefly introduces the principle of optical levitation and the dynamics of levitated particles. It then reviews the emerging applications of levitated particles in ultrasensitive force and torque measurements, acceleration and rotation sensing, electric and magnetic field detection, scanning probe microscopy, localized vacuum pressure gauging, acoustic transduction, and chemical and biological sensing. Moreover, we discuss the present challenges and explore opportunities to minimize and integrate levitation systems for broader applications. We also briefly review optomechanics with ion traps and magnetic traps which can levitate particles in high vacuum without laser heating.</description>

      <title>Controlling directional propagation in driven-dissipative 2D photonic lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling light propagation in photonic systems fosters fundamental research and practical application. Particularly, photonic lattices allow engineering band dispersions and tailor transport features through their geometry. However, complete controllability requires external manipulation of the propagating light. Here, we present a resonant excitation scheme to observe quasi-1D and uni-directional propagation of light through the bulk of two-dimensional lattices. To this end, we use the highly anisotropic light propagation exhibited at the energy of saddle points in photonic bands. When multiple drives with judicious amplitudes and phases are tuned to such energy, interference effects between these drives and photonic modes result in controllable directional propagation through the bulk. Similarly, one can formed localized states with controllable localization degrees. We illustrate these effects with driven-dissipative photonic lattices. Our work highlights the importance of external drives for dynamically controlling directional light transport in lattices, a relevant feature for all-optical routing and processing in photonics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The circular Bragg phenomenon is the circular-polarization-state-selective reflection of light in a spectral regime called the circular Bragg regime. In continuation of an expository review on this phenomenon published in 2014, an album of theoretical results is provided in this decadal update. Spectral variations of intensity-dependent and phase-dependent observable quantities in the reflection and transmission half-spaces are provided in relation to the polarization state and the direction of propagation of the incident plane wave.</description>

      <title>Existence and Stability of Dissipative Solitons in a Dual-Waveguide Lattice with Linear Gain and Nonlinear Losses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the existence and stability of in-phase and out-of-phase dissipative solitons in a dual-waveguide lattice with linear localized gain and nonlinear losses under both focusing and defocusing nonlinearities. Numerical results reveal that both types of dissipative solitons bifurcate from the linear amplified modes, and their nonlinear propagation constant changes to a real value when nonlinearity, linear localized gain, and nonlinear losses coexist. We find that increasing the linear gain coefficient leads to an increase in the power and propagation constant of both types of dissipative solitons. For defocusing nonlinearity, in-phase solitons are stable across their entire existence region, while focusing nonlinearity confines them to a small stable region near the lower cutoff value in the propagation constant. In contrast, out-of-phase solitons have a significantly larger stable region under focusing nonlinearity compared to defocusing nonlinearity. The stability regions of both types of dissipative solitons increase with increasing nonlinear losses coefficient. Additionally, we validate the results of linear stability analysis for dissipative solitons using propagation simulations, showing perfect agreement between the two methods.</description>

      <title>All-optical Saddle Trap</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The superposition of frequency-shifted Laguerre-Gauss modes can produce a rotating saddle-like intensity profile. When spinning fast enough, the optical forces produced by this structured light saddle generate a dynamically stable equilibrium point capable of trapping nanoparticles in a high vacuum, akin to a Paul trap but with its unique characteristics. We analyze the stability conditions and center-of-mass motion, dynamics and cooling of a nanoparticle levitated in the optical saddle trap. We expect the optical saddle to find applications in levitated optomechanics experiments requiring fast parametric modulation and inverted squeezing potential landscapes.</description>

      <title>Virtual Gram staining of label-free bacteria using darkfield microscopy and deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gram staining has been one of the most frequently used staining protocols in microbiology for over a century, utilized across various fields, including diagnostics, food safety, and environmental monitoring. Its manual procedures make it vulnerable to staining errors and artifacts due to, e.g., operator inexperience and chemical variations. Here, we introduce virtual Gram staining of label-free bacteria using a trained deep neural network that digitally transforms darkfield images of unstained bacteria into their Gram-stained equivalents matching brightfield image contrast. After a one-time training effort, the virtual Gram staining model processes an axial stack of darkfield microscopy images of label-free bacteria (never seen before) to rapidly generate Gram staining, bypassing several chemical steps involved in the conventional staining process. We demonstrated the success of the virtual Gram staining workflow on label-free bacteria samples containing Escherichia coli and Listeria innocua by quantifying the staining accuracy of the virtual Gram staining model and comparing the chromatic and morphological features of the virtually stained bacteria against their chemically stained counterparts. This virtual bacteria staining framework effectively bypasses the traditional Gram staining protocol and its challenges, including stain standardization, operator errors, and sensitivity to chemical variations.</description>

      <title>Quantum beats of a macroscopic polariton condensate in real space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We observe experimentally the harmonic oscillations of a macroscopic many-body wavefunction of the bosonic condensate of exciton-polaritons confined in an elliptical trap. The oscillations are caused by quantum beats between two size-quantized states of the polariton condensate split in energy due to the ellipticity of the trap. The eigen-functions of these states are $p$-shape orbitals tilted with respect to the main and the short axes of the trap. The beats between these states manifest themselves in a macroscopic periodical redistribution of the polariton density in real space. The control of frequency, amplitude and phase of the beats is achieved by sending non-resonant laser pulses to specific spots inside the trap. We visualize the condensate wave-function dynamics on a streak-camera and map them to the Bloch sphere demonstrating the implementation of Hadamard and Pauli-Z operations. The decay time of the observed oscillations is on a nanosecond scale. It exceeds the individual exciton-polariton life-time by two orders of magnitude and the coherence-time of the condensate by one order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of discrete solitons in the fractional discrete nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with the quasi-Riesz derivative</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We elaborate a fractional discrete nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger (FDNLS) equation based on an appropriately modified definition of the Riesz fractional derivative, which is characterized by its L\'{e}vy index (LI). This FDNLS equation represents a novel discrete system, in which the nearest-neighbor coupling is combined with long-range interactions, that decay as the inverse square of the separation between lattice sites. The system may be realized as an array of parallel quasi-one-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensates composed of atoms or small molecules carrying, respectively, a permanent magnetic or electric dipole moment. The dispersion relation (DR) for lattice waves and the corresponding propagation band in the system's linear spectrum are found in an exact form for all values of LI. The DR is consistent with the continuum limit, differing in the range of wavenumbers. Formation of single-site and two-site discrete solitons is explored, starting from the anti-continuum limit and continuing the analysis in the numerical form up to the existence boundary of the discrete solitons. Stability of the solitons is identified in terms of eigenvalues for small perturbations, and verified in direct simulations. Mobility of the discrete solitons is considered too, by means of an estimate of the system's Peierls-Nabarro potential barrier, and with the help of direct simulations. Collisions between persistently moving discrete solitons are also studied.</description>

      <title>Classification and reconstruction of images in the problem single-pixel imaging using classical and quantum neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-pixel cameras can be an excellent solution for light ranges outside the visible spectrum, combined with machine learning, they can analyze images quickly enough for practical applications. In the future of the development of quantum technologies, quantum computers can further speed up the solution of such problems. In this work we simulated a single-pixel detection experiment using Hadamard basis patterns, where images from the MNIST handwritten digit dataset were used as objects. There were selected 64 measurements with maximum variance (6\% of the number of pixels in the image). We created algorithms for classifying and reconstruction images based on these measurements using classical fully connected neural networks and parameterized quantum circuits. Classical and quantum classifiers showed accuracies of 96\% and 95\% respectively after 6 training epochs, which is quite competitive result. Image reconstruction was also demonstrated using classical and quantum neural networks after 10 training epochs, the structural similarity index values were 0.76 and 0.25, respectively, which indicates that the problem in such a formulation turned out to be too difficult for quantum neural networks in such a configuration for now.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exceptional points facilitate peculiar dynamics in non-Hermitian systems. Yet, in photonics, they have mainly been studied in the classical realm. In this work, we reveal the behavior of two-photon quantum states in non-Hermitian systems across the exceptional point. We probe the lossy directional coupler with an indistinguishable two-photon input state and observe distinct changes of the quantum correlations at the output as the system undergoes spontaneous breaking of parity-time symmetry. Moreover, we demonstrate a switching in the quantum interference of photons directly at the exceptional point, where Hong-Ou-Mandel dips are transformed into peaks by a change of basis. These results show that quantum interference and exceptional points are linked in curious ways that can now be further explored.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the existence and stability dynamics of self-steepening optical solitons in a periodic PT-symmetric potential.
  We show that self-steepening solitons of the modified nonlinear Schr\"odinger (MNLS) equation undergo a position shift and amplitude increase during their evolution in the MNLS equation. The stabilization of solitons by an external potential is a challenging issue. This study demonstrates that the suppression of both the amplitude increase and the position shift of self-steepening solitons can be achieved by adding a periodic PT-symmetric potential to the MNLS equation.</description>

      <title>Developing a Wyne Corrector for higher spectral bandwidth focal plane wavefront sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Focal plane wavefront sensing techniques are generally limited to using imaging systems that have below 1% spectral bandwidths, due to the radial smearing of speckles from chromatic diffraction that causes optical image magnification over larger spectral bandwidths. Wyne (1979) designed a pair of triplet lenses to optically minimize this chromatic magnification and increase the spectral bandwidth. Such a Wyne corrector could enable focal plane wavefront sensing at up to 50% spectral bandwidths and as a result open enable $&gt;50x$ higher-speed focal plane wavefront sensing. We present results of the design and laboratory testing of a Wyne corrector prototype, including a detailed tolerancing analysis considering manufactural wavelength ranges and alignment tolerances. These tests show promising results that this technology can be deployed to current and future high speed focal plane wavefront sensing instruments to enable significant performance enhancements.

      <title>Effect of multiple bands on high-harmonic generation in zinc oxide subjected to intense mid-infrared femtosecond laser pulse</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01571v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate photo-ionization and high harmonic generation in the bulk of zinc oxide (ZnO) subjected to intense femto-second laser pulses with mid-infrared wavelength (3 $\mu$m). Below threshold for optical breakdown of ZnO, we show that photo-ionization and non-adiabatic response of multiple valence and conduction bands occur on a sub-femtosecond time scale interval localized near the maximum of the laser electric field, the generated photo-current varies on the same time scale and is thus responsible for high-harmonic generation in the bulk. Good semi-quantitative agreement with the experimental data is found: clean and well defined odd-order harmonic peaks extending beyond the band edge of ZnO are exhibited for laser linearly polarized at right angles to the optical axis of the crystal.</description>

      <title>Wavelength tuning of VCSELs via controlled strain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09125v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Besides major advantages for telecommunication applications, VCSELs have attracted interest for their potential for neuro-inspired computing, frequency comb generation or high-frequency spin oscillations. In the meantime, strain applied to the laser structure has been shown to have a significant impact on the laser emission properties such as the polarization dynamics or birefringence. In this work, we further explore the influence of strain on VCSELs and how this effect could be used to fine tune the laser wavelength. Through a comprehensive investigation, we demonstrate consistent wavelength shift up to 1 nm and report a sensitivity between 0.12 to 0.18 nm / millistrain. We also record birefringence values up to 292 GHz. Our results show that controlled strain level could be considered for fine wavelength tuning and possibly alleviate the selection of VCSEL for precise wavelength requirements.</description>

      <title>Engineering Nonreciprocal Responses in Travelling-Wave Spacetime Crystals via Clausius-Mossotti Homogenization</title>

Abstract: Here, we investigate the effective response of three-dimensional spacetime crystals formed by spherical scatterers under a travelling-wave modulation. We develop an analytical formalism to homogenize the spacetime crystals that extends the renowned Clausius-Mossotti formula to time-varying platforms. Our formalism shows that travelling-wave spacetime crystals can be used to engineer a wide range of classes of nonreciprocal bianisotropic couplings in the long wavelength limit. In particular, our theory reveals the possibility of realizing a purely isotropic Tellegen response in crystals formed by interlaced sub-lattices of scatterers subjected to different modulation velocities. Furthermore, we introduce a class of generalized Minkowskian crystals that displays invariance under arbitrary Lorentz boosts aligned with a fixed spatial direction. We prove that such systems are formed by pseudo-uniaxial materials with the principal axis aligned parallel to the modulation velocity. The electromagnetic response of such generalized Minkowskian crystals is indistinguishable from that of moving photonic crystals.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Biphoton Spatial Wave Function Dynamics with Quantum Wavefront Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04973v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With an extremely high dimensionality, the spatial degree of freedom of entangled photons is a key tool for quantum foundation and applied quantum techniques. To fully utilize the feature, the essential task is to experimentally characterize the multiphoton spatial wave function including the entangled amplitude and phase information at different evolutionary stages. However, there is no effective method to measure it. Quantum state tomography is costly, and quantum holography requires additional references. Here we introduce quantum Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensing to perform efficient and reference-free measurement of the biphoton spatial wave function. The joint probability distribution of photon pairs at the back focal plane of a microlens array is measured and used for amplitude extraction and phase reconstruction. In the experiment, we observe that the biphoton amplitude correlation becomes weak while phase correlation shows up during free-space propagation. Our work is a crucial step in quantum physical and adaptive optics and paves the way for characterizing quantum optical fields with high-order correlations or topological patterns.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Control of Excitons in Atomically Thin Semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11252v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Excitons in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have emerged as a promising platform for novel applications ranging from optoelectronic devices to quantum optics and solid state quantum simulators. While much progress has been made towards characterizing and controlling excitons in TMDs, manipulating their properties during the course of their lifetime - a key requirement for many optoelectronic device and information processing modalities - remains an outstanding challenge. Here we combine long-lived interlayer excitons in angle-aligned MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ heterostructures with fast electrical control to realize dynamical control schemes, in which exciton properties are not predetermined at the time of excitation but can be dynamically manipulated during their lifetime. Leveraging the out-of-plane exciton dipole moment, we use electric fields to demonstrate dynamical control over the exciton emission wavelength. Moreover, employing a patterned gate geometry, we demonstrate rapid local sample doping and toggling of the radiative decay rate through exciton-charge interactions during the exciton lifetime. Spatially mapping the exciton response reveals charge redistribution, offering a novel probe of electronic transport in twisted TMD heterostructures. Our results establish the feasibility of dynamical exciton control schemes, unlocking new directions for exciton-based information processing and optoelectronic devices, and the realization of excitonic phenomena in TMDs.</description>
