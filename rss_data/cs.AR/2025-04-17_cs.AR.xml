      <title>E-morphic: Scalable Equality Saturation for Structural Exploration in Logic~Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In technology mapping, the quality of the final implementation heavily relies on the circuit structure after technology-independent optimization. Recent studies have introduced equality saturation as a novel optimization approach. However, its efficiency remains a hurdle against its wide adoption in logic synthesis. This paper proposes a highly scalable and efficient framework named E-morphic. It is the first work that employs equality saturation for resynthesis after conventional technology-independent logic optimizations, enabling structure exploration before technology mapping. Powered by several key enhancements to the equality saturation framework, such as direct e-graph-circuit conversion, solution-space pruning, and simulated annealing for e-graph extraction, this approach not only improves the scalability and extraction efficiency of e-graph rewriting but also addresses the structural bias issue present in conventional logic synthesis flows through parallel structural exploration and resynthesis. Experiments show that, compared to the state-of-the-art delay optimization flow in ABC, E-morphic on average achieves 12.54% area saving and 7.29% delay reduction on the large-scale circuits in the EPFL benchmark.</description>

      <title>Online Training and Inference System on Edge FPGA Using Delayed Feedback Reservoir</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A delayed feedback reservoir (DFR) is a hardwarefriendly reservoir computing system. Implementing DFRs in embedded hardware requires efficient online training. However, two main challenges prevent this: hyperparameter selection, which is typically done by offline grid search, and training of the output linear layer, which is memory-intensive. This paper introduces a fast and accurate parameter optimization method for the reservoir layer utilizing backpropagation and gradient descent by adopting a modular DFR model. A truncated backpropagation strategy is proposed to reduce memory consumption associated with the expansion of the recursive structure while maintaining accuracy. The computation time is significantly reduced compared to grid search. Additionally, an in-place Ridge regression for the output layer via 1-D Cholesky decomposition is presented, reducing memory usage to be 1/4. These methods enable the realization of an online edge training and inference system of DFR on an FPGA, reducing computation time by about 1/13 and power consumption by about 1/27 compared to software implementation on the same board.</description>

      <title>Subitizing-Inspired_Large_Language_Models_for_Floorplanning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel approach to solving the floorplanning problem by leveraging fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs). Inspired by subitizing--the human ability to instantly and accurately count small numbers of items at a glance--we hypothesize that LLMs can similarly address floorplanning challenges swiftly and accurately. We propose an efficient representation of the floorplanning problem and introduce a method for generating high-quality datasets tailored for model fine-tuning. We fine-tune LLMs on datasets with a specified number of modules to test whether LLMs can emulate the human ability to quickly count and arrange items. Our experimental results demonstrate that fine-tuned LLMs, particularly GPT4o-mini, achieve high success and optimal rates while attaining relatively low average dead space. These findings underscore the potential of LLMs as promising solutions for complex optimization tasks in VLSI design.</description>

      <title>HLS-Eval: A Benchmark and Framework for Evaluating LLMs on High-Level Synthesis Design Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid scaling of large language model (LLM) training and inference has driven their adoption in semiconductor design across academia and industry. While most prior work evaluates LLMs on hardware description language (HDL) tasks, particularly Verilog, designers are increasingly using high-level synthesis (HLS) to build domain-specific accelerators and complex hardware systems. However, benchmarks and tooling to comprehensively evaluate LLMs for HLS design tasks remain scarce.
  To address this, we introduce HLS-Eval, the first complete benchmark and evaluation framework for LLM-driven HLS design. HLS-Eval targets two core tasks: (1) generating HLS code from natural language descriptions, and (2) performing HLS-specific code edits to optimize performance and hardware efficiency. The benchmark includes 94 unique designs drawn from standard HLS benchmarks and novel sources. Each case is prepared via a semi-automated flow that produces a natural language description and a paired testbench for C-simulation and synthesis validation, ensuring each task is "LLM-ready."
  Beyond the benchmark, HLS-Eval offers a modular Python framework for automated, parallel evaluation of both local and hosted LLMs. It includes a parallel evaluation engine, direct HLS tool integration, and abstractions for to support different LLM interaction paradigms, enabling rapid prototyping of new benchmarks, tasks, and LLM methods.
  We demonstrate HLS-Eval through baseline evaluations of open-source LLMs on Vitis HLS, measuring outputs across four key metrics - parseability, compilability, runnability, and synthesizability - reflecting the iterative HLS design cycle. We also report pass@k metrics, establishing clear baselines and reusable infrastructure for the broader LLM-for-hardware community.
  All benchmarks, framework code, and results are open-sourced at https://github.com/stefanpie/hls-eval.</description>

      <title>LLM-based AI Agent for Sizing of Analog and Mixed Signal Circuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The design of Analog and Mixed-Signal (AMS) integrated circuits (ICs) often involves significant manual effort, especially during the transistor sizing process. While Machine Learning techniques in Electronic Design Automation (EDA) have shown promise in reducing complexity and minimizing human intervention, they still face challenges such as numerous iterations and a lack of knowledge about AMS circuit design. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential across various fields, showing a certain level of knowledge in circuit design and indicating their potential to automate the transistor sizing process. In this work, we propose an LLM-based AI agent for AMS circuit design to assist in the sizing process. By integrating LLMs with external circuit simulation tools and data analysis functions and employing prompt engineering strategies, the agent successfully optimized multiple circuits to achieve target performance metrics. We evaluated the performance of different LLMs to assess their applicability and optimization effectiveness across seven basic circuits, and selected the best-performing model Claude 3.5 Sonnet for further exploration on an operational amplifier, with complementary input stage and class AB output stage. This circuit was evaluated against nine performance metrics, and we conducted experiments under three distinct performance requirement groups. A success rate of up to 60% was achieved for reaching the target requirements. Overall, this work demonstrates the potential of LLMs to improve AMS circuit design.</description>

      <title>Characterizing and Optimizing LLM Inference Workloads on CPU-GPU Coupled Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based inference workloads increasingly dominate data center costs and resource utilization. Therefore, understanding the inference workload characteristics on evolving CPU-GPU coupled architectures is crucial for optimization. This paper presents an in-depth analysis of LLM inference behavior on loosely-coupled (PCIe A100/H100) and closely-coupled (GH200) systems. We analyze performance dynamics using fine-grained operator-to-kernel trace analysis, facilitated by our novel profiler SKIP and metrics like Total Kernel Launch and Queuing Time (TKLQT). Results show that closely-coupled (CC) GH200 significantly outperforms loosely-coupled (LC) systems at large batch sizes, achieving 1.9x-2.7x faster prefill latency for Llama 3.2-1B. However, our analysis also reveals that GH200 remains CPU-bound up to 4x larger batch sizes than LC systems. In this extended CPU-bound region, we identify the performance characteristics of the Grace CPU as a key factor contributing to higher inference latency at low batch sizes on GH200. We demonstrate that TKLQT accurately identifies this CPU/GPU-bound transition point. Based on this analysis, we further show that kernel fusion offers significant potential to mitigate GH200's low-batch latency bottleneck by reducing kernel launch overhead. This detailed kernel-level characterization provides critical insights for optimizing diverse CPU-GPU coupling strategies. This work is an initial effort, and we plan to explore other major AI/DL workloads that demand different degrees of CPU-GPU heterogeneous architectures.</description>

      <title>Hardware-Friendly Delayed-Feedback Reservoir for Multivariate Time-Series Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reservoir computing (RC) is attracting attention as a machine-learning technique for edge computing. In time-series classification tasks, the number of features obtained using a reservoir depends on the length of the input series. Therefore, the features must be converted to a constant-length intermediate representation (IR), such that they can be processed by an output layer. Existing conversion methods involve computationally expensive matrix inversion that significantly increases the circuit size and requires processing power when implemented in hardware. In this article, we propose a simple but effective IR, namely, dot-product-based reservoir representation (DPRR), for RC based on the dot product of data features. Additionally, we propose a hardware-friendly delayed-feedback reservoir (DFR) consisting of a nonlinear element and delayed feedback loop with DPRR. The proposed DFR successfully classified multivariate time series data that has been considered particularly difficult to implement efficiently in hardware. In contrast to conventional DFR models that require analog circuits, the proposed model can be implemented in a fully digital manner suitable for high-level syntheses. A comparison with existing machine-learning methods via field-programmable gate array implementation using 12 multivariate time-series classification tasks confirmed the superior accuracy and small circuit size of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Performance Horizon of the Latest ML Workloads with NonGEMM Workloads</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11788v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Among ML operators today, GEneralMatrix Multiplication (GEMM)-based operators are known to be key operators that build the main backbone of ML models. As their computational overhead dominates the overall execution time (e.g., 42.8% - 96.6% in our results), GEMM operators have been the prime optimization targets for fast ML inference. This led to advanced GPUs and accelerators available today, which provided significant boost in the GEMM performance compared to CPUs, aligned with the lesson from Amdahl's law. However, accelerating GEMM has significantly shifted the Amdahl's law's landscape for ML inference; due to the decreased GEMM execution time, the relative execution time of non-GEMM operators is now significant. Although the importance of non-GEMM performance is increasing, we have little knowledge about the non-GEMM performance horizon in the latest hardware platforms and models. Therefore, to guide non-GEMM-oriented optimizations, we conduct a thorough performance analysis of 17 widely adopted ML models in Hugging Face and Torchvision on workstation and data center platforms with/without GPUs. We discover that non-GEMM performance bottleneck is a considerable issue across all the platforms and models, accounting for 11.3% to 73.6% of total latency, on average. The challenge significantly aggravates when we apply quantization, which is a common model compression technique, due to the boosted GEMM performance and extra non-GEMM operators for dequantization and requantization. To provide insights into non-GEMM optimization targets, we demystify the most dominant non-GEMM operators for each model and deployment software. We also show that widely adopted optimizations such as operator fusion do not completely address the non-GEMM performance bottleneck, where non-GEMM operators still account for 15% to 48% of total latency.</description>

      <title>Gem5-AcceSys: Enabling System-Level Exploration of Standard Interconnects for Novel Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12273v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The growing demand for efficient, high-performance processing in machine learning (ML) and image processing has made hardware accelerators, such as GPUs and Data Streaming Accelerators (DSAs), increasingly essential. These accelerators enhance ML and image processing tasks by offloading computation from the CPU to dedicated hardware. These accelerators rely on interconnects for efficient data transfer, making interconnect design crucial for system-level performance. This paper introduces Gem5-AcceSys, an innovative framework for system-level exploration of standard interconnects and configurable memory hierarchies. Using a matrix multiplication accelerator tailored for transformer workloads as a case study, we evaluate PCIe performance across diverse memory types (DDR4, DDR5, GDDR6, HBM2) and configurations, including host-side and device-side memory. Our findings demonstrate that optimized interconnects can achieve up to 80% of device-side memory performance and, in some scenarios, even surpass it. These results offer actionable insights for system architects, enabling a balanced approach to performance and cost in next-generation accelerator design.</description>

      <title>VeriMind: Agentic LLM for Automated Verilog Generation with a Novel Evaluation Metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16514v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Designing Verilog modules requires meticulous attention to correctness, efficiency, and adherence to design specifications. However, manually writing Verilog code remains a complex and time-consuming task that demands both expert knowledge and iterative refinement. Leveraging recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) and their structured text generation capabilities, we propose VeriMind, an agentic LLM framework for Verilog code generation that significantly automates and optimizes the synthesis process. Unlike traditional LLM-based code generators, VeriMind employs a structured reasoning approach: given a user-provided prompt describing design requirements, the system first formulates a detailed train of thought before the final Verilog code is generated. This multi-step methodology enhances interpretability, accuracy, and adaptability in hardware design. In addition, we introduce a novel evaluation metric-pass@ARC-which combines the conventional pass@k measure with Average Refinement Cycles (ARC) to capture both success rate and the efficiency of iterative refinement. Experimental results on diverse hardware design tasks demonstrated that our approach achieved up to $8.3\%$ improvement on pass@k metric and $8.1\%$ on pass@ARC metric. These findings underscore the transformative potential of agentic LLMs in automated hardware design, RTL development, and digital system synthesis.</description>

      <title>Efficient Architecture for RISC-V Vector Memory Access</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08334v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vector processors frequently suffer from inefficient memory accesses, particularly for strided and segment patterns. While coalescing strided accesses is a natural solution, effectively gathering or scattering elements at fixed strides remains challenging. Naive approaches rely on high-overhead crossbars that remap any byte between memory and registers, leading to physical design issues. Segment operations require row-column transpositions, typically handled using either element-level in-place transposition (degrading performance) or large buffer-based bulk transposition (incurring high area overhead). In this paper, we present EARTH, a novel vector memory access architecture designed to overcome these challenges through shifting-based optimizations. For strided accesses, EARTH integrates specialized shift networks for gathering and scattering elements. After coalescing multiple accesses within the same cache line, data is routed between memory and registers through the shifting network with minimal overhead. For segment operations, EARTH employs a shifted register bank enabling direct column-wise access, eliminating dedicated segment buffers while providing high-performance, in-place bulk transposition. Implemented on FPGA with Chisel HDL based on an open-source RISC-V vector unit, EARTH enhances performance for strided memory accesses, achieving 4x-8x speedups in benchmarks dominated by strided operations. Compared to conventional designs, EARTH reduces hardware area by 9% and power consumption by 41%, significantly advancing both performance and efficiency of vector processors.</description>

      <title>Understanding and Optimizing Multi-Stage AI Inference Pipelines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09775v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has driven the need for increasingly sophisticated inference pipelines and hardware platforms. Modern LLM serving extends beyond traditional prefill-decode workflows, incorporating multi-stage processes such as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), key-value (KV) cache retrieval, dynamic model routing, and multi step reasoning. These stages exhibit diverse computational demands, requiring distributed systems that integrate GPUs, ASICs, CPUs, and memory-centric architectures. However, existing simulators lack the fidelity to model these heterogeneous, multi-engine workflows, limiting their ability to inform architectural decisions.
  To address this gap, we introduce HERMES, a Heterogeneous Multi-stage LLM inference Execution Simulator. HERMES models diverse request stages; including RAG, KV retrieval, reasoning, prefill, and decode across complex hardware hierarchies. HERMES supports heterogeneous clients executing multiple models concurrently unlike prior frameworks while incorporating advanced batching strategies and multi-level memory hierarchies. By integrating real hardware traces with analytical modeling, HERMES captures critical trade-offs such as memory bandwidth contention, inter-cluster communication latency, and batching efficiency in hybrid CPU-accelerator deployments. Through case studies, we explore the impact of reasoning stages on end-to-end latency, optimal batching strategies for hybrid pipelines, and the architectural implications of remote KV cache retrieval. HERMES empowers system designers to navigate the evolving landscape of LLM inference, providing actionable insights into optimizing hardware-software co-design for next-generation AI workloads.</description>
