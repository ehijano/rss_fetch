      <title>Dataset of artefacts for machine learning applications in astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate photometry in astronomical surveys is challenged by image artefacts, which affect measurements and degrade data quality. Due to the large amount of available data, this task is increasingly handled using machine learning algorithms, which often require a labelled training set to learn data patterns. We present an expert-labelled dataset of 1127 artefacts with 1213 labels from 26 fields in ZTF DR3, along with a complementary set of nominal objects. The artefact dataset was compiled using the active anomaly detection algorithm PineForest, developed by the SNAD team. These datasets can serve as valuable resources for real-bogus classification, catalogue cleaning, anomaly detection, and educational purposes. Both artefacts and nominal images are provided in FITS format in two sizes (28 x 28 and 63 x 63 pixels). The datasets are publicly available for further scientific applications.</description>

      <title>Tilsotua: Reproducing Slitmask Sky Positions for use with the LRIS Multislit Archive</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present tilsotua, a code that calculates sky positions of the slits from Low-Resolution Imaging Spectrograph (LRIS) slitmasks used in multislit observations. Raw data for the Keck/LRIS spectrograph does not include information about the sky positions of the slitmask targets, making it difficult to use beyond the scope of the original programs. tilsotua translates slit coordinates from the mask design files in the mask milling machine frame to sky coordinates. tilsotua also shifts the original input astrometry to modern frames using the objects targeted by mask alignment boxes. This can be applied to the archived mask design files at the Lick Observatory Archive. We demonstrate that the final reconstructed slit positions are accurate to 0."14 (RMS) across the set of archived masks based on a comparison of our calculated mask alignment box coordinates with Gaia astrometric positions of the likely alignment objects. We make available the tilsotua code, archived mask files, and slit positions of the historical masks for the community to maximize the science from Keck/LRIS data in the Keck Observatory Archive.</description>

      <title>Beetroots: spatially-regularized Bayesian inference of physical parameter maps -- Application to Orion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The current generation of millimeter receivers is able to produce cubes of 800 000 pixels by 200 000 frequency channels to cover several square degrees over the 3 mm atmospheric window. Estimating the physical conditions of the interstellar medium (ISM) with an astrophysical model on such datasets is challenging. Common approaches tend to converge to local minima and typically poorly reconstruct regions with low signal-to-noise ratio (S/N). This instrumental revolution thus calls for new scalable data analysis techniques. We present Beetroots, a Python software that performs Bayesian reconstruction of maps of physical conditions from observation maps and an astrophysical model. It relies on an accurate statistical model, exploits spatial regularization to guide estimations, and uses state-of-the-art algorithms. It also assesses the ability of the astrophysical model to explain the observations, providing feedback to improve ISM models. We demonstrate the power of Beetroots with the Meudon PDR code on synthetic data, and then apply it to estimate physical condition maps in the full Orion molecular cloud 1 (OMC-1) star forming region based on Herschel molecular line emission maps. The application to the synthetic case shows that Beetroots can currently analyse maps with up to ten thousand pixels, addressing large variations of S/N, escaping from local minima, and providing consistent uncertainty quantifications. On a laptop, the inference runtime ranges from a few minutes for 100-pixel maps to 28 hours for 8100-pixel maps. The results on the OMC-1 maps are consistent with independent estimations from the literature, and improve our understanding of the region. This work paves the way towards systematic and rigorous analyses of observations produced by current and future instruments.</description>

      <title>AstroLLaVA: towards the unification of astronomical data and natural language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present AstroLLaVA, a vision language model for astronomy that enables interaction with astronomical imagery through natural dialogue. By fine-tuning the LLaVA model on a diverse dataset of $\sim$30k images with captions and question-answer pairs sourced from NASA's `Astronomy Picture of the Day', the European Southern Observatory, and the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, we create a model capable of answering open-ended questions about astronomical concepts depicted visually. Our two-stage fine-tuning process adapts the model to both image captioning and visual question answering in the astronomy domain. We demonstrate AstroLLaVA's performance on an astronomical visual question answering benchmark and release the model weights, code, and training set to encourage further open source work in this space. Finally, we suggest a roadmap towards general astronomical data alignment with pre-trained language models, and provide an open space for collaboration towards this end for interested researchers.</description>

      <title>The CARMENES search for exoplanets around M dwarfs. Cluster analysis of signals from spectral activity indicators to search for shared periods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A multitude of spectral activity indicators are routinely computed nowadays from the spectra generated as part of planet-hunting radial velocity surveys. Searching for shared periods among them can help to robustly identify astrophysical quantities of interest, such as the stellar rotation period. However, this identification can be complicated due to the fact that many different peaks occurring in the periodograms. This is especially true in the presence of aliasing and spurious signals caused by environmental influences affecting the instrument. Our goal is to test a clustering algorithm to find signals with the same periodicity, (i.e. with the stellar rotation period) in the periodograms of a large number of activity indicators. On this basis, we have looked to evaluate the correlations between activity indicators and fundamental stellar parameters. We used generalised Lomb-Scargle periodograms to find periodic signals in 24 activity indicators, spanning the VIS and NIR channels of the CARMENES spectrograph. Common periods were subsequently determined by a machine learning algorithm for density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN). The clustering analysis of the signals apparent in the spectral activity indicators is a powerful tool for the detection of stellar rotation periods. It is straightforward to implement and can be easily automated, so that large data sets can be analysed. For a sample of 136 stars, we were able to recover the stellar rotation period in a total of 59 cases, including 3 with a previously unknown rotation period. In addition, we analysed spurious signals frequently occurring at the period of one year and its integer fractions, concluding that they are likely aliases of one underlying signal. Furthermore, we reproduced the results of several previous studies on the relationships between activity indicators and the stellar characteristics.</description>

      <title>ExoMolHR: A Relational Database of Empirical High-Resolution Molecular Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: ExoMolHR is an empirical, high-resolution molecular spectrum calculator for the high-temperature molecular line lists available from the ExoMol molecular database. Uncertainties, where available, in recommended ExoMol datasets are used to select highly accurate spectral lines. These lines largely rely on empirical energy levels generated through the MARVEL (measured active rotation vibration energy levels) procedure, which is being systematically used to improve the energy and transition data provided by the ExoMol database. The freely accessible ExoMolHR database provides line positions with calculated intensities for a user-specified wavenumber/wavelength range and temperature. Spectra can be plotted on the ExoMolHR website (https://www.exomol.com/exomolhr/) or downloaded as a CSV file. Cross sections can be calculated using the Python program PyExoCross. The ExoMolHR database currently provides 24307135 spectral lines for 33 molecules and 58 isotopologues; these numbers will increase as the ExoMol database is updated.</description>

      <title>PECCARY: A novel approach for characterizing orbital complexity, stochasticity, and regularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11970v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Permutation Entropy and statistiCal Complexity Analysis for astRophYsics (PECCARY) is a computationally inexpensive, statistical method by which any time-series can be characterized as predominantly regular, complex, or stochastic. Elements of the PECCARY method have been used in a variety of physical, biological, economic, and mathematical scenarios, but have not yet gained traction in the astrophysical community. This study introduces the PECCARY technique with the specific aims to motivate its use in and optimize it for the analysis of astrophysical orbital systems. PECCARY works by decomposing a time-dependent measure, such as the x-coordinate or orbital angular momentum time-series, into ordinal patterns. Due to its unique approach and statistical nature, PECCARY is well-suited for detecting preferred and forbidden patterns (a signature of chaos), even when the chaotic behavior is short-lived or when working with a relatively short duration time-series or small sets of time-series data. A variety of examples are used to demonstrate the capabilities of PECCARY. These include mathematical examples (sine waves, varieties of noise, sums of sine waves, well-known chaotic functions), a double pendulum system, and astrophysical tracer particle simulations with potentials of varying intricacies. Since the adopted timescale used to diagnose a given time-series can affect the outcome, a method is presented to identify an ideal sampling scheme, constrained by the overall duration and the natural timescale of the system. The accompanying PECCARY Python package and its usage are discussed.</description>

      <title>$Lux$: A generative, multi-output, latent-variable model for astronomical data with noisy labels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01745v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The large volume of spectroscopic data available now and from near-future surveys will enable high-dimensional measurements of stellar parameters and properties. Current methods for determining stellar labels from spectra use physics-driven models, which are computationally expensive and have limitations in their accuracy due to simplifications. While machine learning methods provide efficient paths toward emulating physics-based pipelines, they often do not properly account for uncertainties and have complex model structure, both of which can lead to biases and inaccurate label inference. Here we present $Lux$: a data-driven framework for modeling stellar spectra and labels that addresses prior limitations. $Lux$ is a generative, multi-output, latent variable model framework built on JAX for computational efficiency and flexibility. As a generative model, $Lux$ properly accounts for uncertainties and missing data in the input stellar labels and spectral data and can either be used in probabilistic or discriminative settings. Here, we present several examples of how $Lux$ can successfully emulate methods for precise stellar label determinations for stars ranging in stellar type and signal-to-noise from the $APOGEE$ surveys. We also show how a simple $Lux$ model is successful at performing label transfer between the $APOGEE$ and $GALAH$ surveys. $Lux$ is a powerful new framework for the analysis of large-scale spectroscopic survey data. Its ability to handle uncertainties while maintaining high precision makes it particularly valuable for stellar survey label inference and cross-survey analysis, and the flexible model structure allows for easy extension to other data types.</description>

      <title>Near-field imaging of local interference in radio interferometric data: Impact on the redshifted 21 cm power spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21728v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radio-frequency interference (RFI) is a major systematic limitation in radio astronomy, particularly for science cases requiring high sensitivity, such as 21 cm cosmology. Traditionally, RFI is dealt with by identifying its signature in the dynamic spectra of visibility data and flagging strongly affected regions. However, for RFI sources that do not occupy narrow regions in the time-frequency space, such as persistent local RFI, modeling these sources could be essential to mitigating their impact. This paper introduces two methods for detecting and characterizing local RFI sources from radio interferometric visibilities: matched filtering and maximum a posteriori (MAP) imaging. These algorithms use the spherical wave equation to construct three-dimensional near-field image cubes of RFI intensity from the visibilities. The matched filter algorithm can generate normalized maps by cross-correlating the expected contributions from RFI sources with the observed visibilities, while the MAP method performs a regularized inversion of the visibility equation in the near field. We developed a full polarization simulation framework for RFI and demonstrated the methods on simulated observations of local RFI sources. The stability, speed, and errors introduced by these algorithms were investigated, and, as a demonstration, the algorithms were applied to a subset of NenuFAR observations to perform spatial, spectral, and temporal characterization of two local RFI sources. We used simulations to assess the impact of local RFI on images, the uv plane, and cylindrical power spectra, and to quantify the level of bias introduced by the algorithms in order to understand their implications for the estimated 21 cm power spectrum with radio interferometers. The near-field imaging and simulation codes are publicly available in the Python library nfis.</description>

      <title>Implicit Electric Field Conjugation with the Photonic Lantern Nuller</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24292v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Photonic Lantern Nuller (PLN) is an instrument concept designed to characterize exoplanets within a single beam-width from its host star. The PLN leverages the spatial symmetry of a mode-selective photonic lantern (MSPL) to create nulled ports, which cancel out on-axis starlight but allow off-axis exoplanet light to couple. The null-depths are limited by wavefront aberrations in the system as well as by imperfections in the lantern. We show that the implicit electric field conjugation algorithm can be used to reduce the stellar coupling through the PLN by orders of magnitude while maintaining the majority of the off-axis light, leading to deeper null depths (~10^{-4}) and thus higher sensitivity to potential planet signals. We discuss a theory for the tradeoff we observed between the different ports, where iEFC improves the nulls of some ports at the expense of others, and show that targeting one port alone can lead to deeper starlight rejection through that port than when targeting all ports at once. We also observe different levels of stability depending on the port and discuss the implications for practically implementing this technique for science observations.</description>

      <title>AI-Driven Reconstruction of Large-Scale Structure from Combined Photometric and Spectroscopic Surveys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06309v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Galaxy surveys are crucial for studying large-scale structure (LSS) and cosmology, yet they face limitations--imaging surveys provide extensive sky coverage but suffer from photo-$z$ uncertainties, while spectroscopic surveys yield precise redshifts but are sample-limited. To take advantage of both photo-$z$ and spec-$z$ data while eliminating photo-$z$ errors, we propose a deep learning framework based on a dual UNet architecture that integrates these two datasets at the field level to reconstruct the 3D photo-$z$ density field. We train the network on mock samples representative of stage-IV spectroscopic surveys, utilizing CosmicGrowth simulations with a $z=0.59$ snapshot containing $2048^3$ particles in a $(1200~h^{-1}\rm Mpc)^3$ volume. Several metrics, including correlation coefficient, MAE, MSE, PSNR, and SSIM, validate the model's accuracy. Moreover, the reconstructed power spectrum closely matches the ground truth at small scales ($k \gtrsim 0.06~h/\rm Mpc$) within the $1\sigma$ confidence level, while the UNet model significantly improves the estimation of photo-$z$ power spectrum multipoles. This study demonstrates the potential of deep learning to enhance LSS reconstruction by using both spectroscopic and photometric data.</description>

Abstract: A fundamental goal of astrobiology is to detect life outside of Earth. This proves to be an exceptional challenge outside of our solar system, where strong assumptions must be made about how life would manifest and interact with its planet. Such assumptions are required because of the lack of a consensus theory of living systems, or an understanding of the possible extent of planetary dynamics. Here we explore a model of life spreading between planetary systems via panspermia and terraformation. Our model shows that as life propagates across the galaxy, correlations emerge between planetary characteristics and location, and can function as a population-scale agnostic biosignature. This biosignature is agnostic because it is independent of strong assumptions about any particular instantiation of life or planetary characteristic--by focusing on a specific hypothesis of what life may do, rather than what life may be. By clustering planets based on their observed characteristics, and examining the spatial extent of these clusters, we demonstrate (and evaluate) a way to prioritize specific planets for further observation--based on their potential for containing life. We consider obstacles that must be overcome to practically implement our approach, including identifying specific ways in which better understanding astrophysical and planetary processes would improve our ability to detect life. Finally, we consider how this model leads us to think in novel ways about scales of life and planetary replication.</description>

      <title>The Potential of Coordinated Gravitational-Wave Followup for Improving Kilonova Detection Prospects: Lessons from GW190425</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17558</link>

Abstract: The discovery of a kilonova associated with the GW170817 binary neutron star merger had far-reaching implications for our understanding of several open questions in physics and astrophysics. Unfortunately, since then, only one robust binary neutron star merger was detected through gravitational waves, GW190425, and no electromagnetic counterpart was identified for it following an uncoordinated search. In order to estimate the potential difference that coordinated followup could make for future events, we analyze all reported electromagnetic followup observations of GW190425. We find that even for a large gravitational-wave localization uncertainty, such as this one, most of the 90% probability region can be covered within hours with a coordinated search, given the observational resources expended in this case by the community. However, more than 5 days after the GW190425 merger, its uncoordinated search covered only 50% of the probability, with some areas observed over 100 times, and some never observed. According to some models, the GW190425 kilonova could have been detected, despite the larger distance and higher component masses compared to GW170817. These results emphasize that coordinated followup of gravitational-wave events can, in principle, significantly improve both the chances of finding electromagnetic counterparts, and the time it takes to do so, compared to uncoordinated searches.</description>

      <title>Ten-parameter simulation suite for cosmological emulation beyond $\Lambda$CDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06296v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present Goku, a suite of cosmological $N$-body simulations, and the corresponding 10-dimensional emulator, GokuEmu, for the nonlinear matter power spectrum. The simulations span the base parameters of $\Lambda$ Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) cosmology and its extensions, including dynamical dark energy ($w_0$, $w_a$), the sum of the neutrino masses ($\sum m_\nu$), the effective number of neutrinos ($N_\text{eff}$), and the running of the scalar spectral index ($\alpha_\text{s}$), enabling tests of new physics with data from upcoming surveys like the Roman Space Telescope, Euclid, and LSST. Designed within the MF-Box framework, which integrates multi-scale and multi-fidelity simulations, the suite includes high-fidelity simulations evolving $3000^3$ particles in $1\,(\text{Gpc}/h)^3$ volumes and low-fidelity simulations with $750^3$ particles across varying box sizes. This approach achieves percent-level accuracy in high-likelihood regions and 5% accuracy across broader parameter ranges, while reducing computational costs by 94% compared to single-fidelity methods. The simulations adopt an accurate treatment of massive neutrinos, enhancing predictions of the matter power spectrum on nonlinear scales. Key innovations include an adaptive sampling strategy and the use of beam search to optimize generalization accuracy. The emulator is valid for redshifts $z \leq 3$ and scales $0.01 \lesssim k / (h \, \text{Mpc}^{-1}) \lesssim 10$. Beyond the matter power spectrum, the simulations also support analyses of other statistical measures, such as the halo mass function. The emulator and its training data are publicly available at https://github.com/astro-YYH/GokuEmu, providing a valuable resource for cosmological parameter inference and model testing.</description>

      <title>High-Power Test of a C-band Linear Accelerating Structure with an RFSoC-based LLRF System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10507v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Normal conducting linear particle accelerators consist of multiple rf stations with accelerating structure cavities. Low-level rf (LLRF) systems are employed to set the phase and amplitude of the field in the accelerating structure, and to compensate the pulse-to-pulse fluctuation of the rf field in the accelerating structures with a feedback loop. The LLRF systems are typically implemented with analogue rf mixers, heterodyne based architectures and discrete data converters. There are multiple rf signals from each of rf station, so the number of rf channels required increases rapidly with multiple rf stations. With many rf channels, the footprint, component cost and system complexity of the LLRF hardware increase significantly. To meet the design goals to be compact and affordable for future accelerators, we have designed the next generation LLRF (NG-LLRF) with higher integration level based on RFSoC technology. The NG-LLRF system samples rf signals directly and performs the rf mixing digitally. The NG-LLRF has been characterized in a loopback mode to evaluate the performance of the system and tested with a standing-wave accelerating structure, a prototype for the Cool Copper Collider (C3) with peak rf power up to 16.45 MW. The loopback test demonstrated amplitude fluctuation below 0.15% and phase fluctuation below 0.15 degree, which are considerably better than the requirements of C3. The rf signals from the different stages of accelerating structure at different power levels are measured by the NG-LLRF, which will be critical references for the control algorithm designs. The NG-LLRF also offers flexibility in waveform modulation, so we have used rf pulses with various modulation schemes which could be useful for controlling some of rf stations in accelerators. In this paper, the high-power test results at different stages of the test setup will be summarized, analyzed and discussed.</description>

      <title>Doppler Shifted Transient Sodium Detection by KECK/HIRES</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03974v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We carried out the first high-resolution transit observations of the exoplanet WASP-49 Ab with Keck/HIRES. Upon custom wavelength calibration we achieve a Doppler RV precision of $&lt;$ 60 ${\rm m\,s}^{-1}$. This is an improvement in RV stability of roughly 240 ${\rm m\,s}^{-1}$ with respect to the instrument standard. We report an average sodium flux residual of $\Delta \mathcal{F}_{NaD}/ \mathcal{F}_{\star} (\lambda) \sim$ 3.2 $\pm$ 0.4 $\%$ (8.0 $\sigma$) comparable to previous studies. Interestingly, an average Doppler shift of -6.2 $\pm$ 0.5 ${\rm km\,s}^{-1}$ (12.4 $\sigma$) is identified offset from the exoplanet rest frame. The velocity residuals \textit{in time} trace a blueshift (v$_{\Gamma, ingress} \sim$ -10.3 $\pm$ 1.9 ${\rm km\,s}^{-1}$) to redshift (v$_{\Gamma, egress} \sim$ +4.1 $\pm$ 1.5 ${\rm km\,s}^{-1}$) suggesting the origin of the observed sodium is unlikely from the atmosphere of the planet. The average Na light curves indicate a depth of $\Delta \mathcal{F}_{NaD} /\mathcal{F}_{\star} (t) \sim$ 0.47 $\pm$ 0.04 % (11.7 $\sigma$) enduring $\lesssim$ 90 minutes with a half-max duration of $\sim$ 40.1 minutes. Frequent high-resolution spectroscopic observations will be able to characterize the periodicity of the observed Doppler shifts. Considering the origin of the transient sodium gas is of unknown geometry, a co-orbiting natural satellite may be a likely source.</description>
