      <title>Conditional variational autoencoder inference of neutron star equation of state from astrophysical observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new inference framework for neutron star astrophysics based on conditional variational autoencoders. Once trained, the generator block of the model reconstructs the neutron star equation of state from a given set of mass-radius observations. While the pressure of dense matter is the focus of the present study, the proposed model is flexible enough to accommodate the reconstructing of any other quantity related to dense matter equation of state. Our results show robust reconstructing performance of the model, allowing to make instantaneous inference from any given observation set. The present framework contrasts with computationally expensive evaluation of the equation-of-state posterior probability distribution based on Markov chain Monte Carlo methods.</description>

      <title>Tensor-force effects on nuclear matter in relativistic ab initio theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the relativistic Brueckner-Hartree-Fock theory in the full Dirac space, the tensor-force effects on infinite nuclear matter are elucidated by subtracting the matrix elements of tensor forces from the realistic nucleon-nucleon interaction. The tensor-force effects for the binding energy per particle of symmetric nuclear matter (SNM) as well as the symmetry energy are attractive and are more pronounced around the empirical saturation density, while the tensor forces have little impact on the pure neutron matter. By tuning the tensor-force strength, an infinite (negative) scattering length in the spin-triplet channel is found. This locates the dilute SNM with only the $^3S_1$-$^3D_1$ channel interaction at the unitary limit. Its ground-state energy is found proportional to the energy of a free Fermi gas with a scaling factor 0.38, revealing good universal properties. This work paves the way to study the tensor-force effects in neutron stars as well as finite nuclei from realistic nucleon-nucleon interactions and highlights the role of the tensor force on the deviation of the nuclear physics to the unitary limit.</description>

      <title>Electron-positron annihilation into $K\bar{K}\pi$ and their contributions to $(g-2)_\mu$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, a coherent study of the $e^+e^-$ annihilation into $K^+K^-\pi^0$, $K^0_SK^0_L\pi^0$ and $K^0_SK^\pm\pi^\mp$ is carried out within the framework of resonance chiral theory. The amplitudes are fixed by fitting to the experimental cross-section and invariant mass spectrum. With these amplitudes, one can calculate the hadronic vacuum polarization form factors of these processes. The leading order contributions of $\sigma(e^+e^- \to K\bar{K}\pi)$ to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, $(g-2)_\mu$, is obtained as $a_\mu^{\rm HVP,LO}(e^+e^- \to K\bar{K}\pi)=(3.07\pm0.07)\times10^{-10}$ up to $E_{\rm cm}=2.3$ GeV.</description>

      <title>Qu8its for Quantum Simulations of Lattice Quantum Chromodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the utility of $d=8$ qudits, qu8its, for quantum simulations of the dynamics of 1+1D SU(3) lattice quantum chromodynamics, including a mapping for arbitrary numbers of flavors and lattice size and a re-organization of the Hamiltonian for efficient time-evolution. Recent advances in parallel gate applications, along with the shorter application times of single-qudit operations compared with two-qudit operations, lead to significant projected advantages in quantum simulation fidelities and circuit depths using qu8its rather than qubits. The number of two-qudit entangling gates required for time evolution using qu8its is found to be more than a factor of five fewer than for qubits. We anticipate that the developments presented in this work will enable improved quantum simulations to be performed using emerging quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Quark-hadron pasta phase in neutron stars: the role of medium-dependent surface and curvature tensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13973v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of the hadron-quark mixed phase, often termed the \textit{pasta} phase, expected to exist in the cores of massive neutron stars. To construct the equations of state (EoS), we combine an analytical representation based on the APR EoS for hadronic matter with the MIT bag model featuring vector interactions for quark matter. For modeling the mixed phase, we utilize the compressible liquid drop model that consistently accounts for finite-size and Coulomb effects. Unlike most previous analyses that treated surface tension as a constant free parameter and neglected curvature tension, we employ microphysical calculations using the multiple reflection expansion formalism to determine these parameters, while also ensuring their self-consistency with the EoS. We construct an extensive set of mixed hybrid EoSs by varying model parameters, solve the stellar structure equations to obtain neutron star mass-radius relationships, and select the models that satisfy current astrophysical constraints. Our findings closely align with calculations using a constant surface tension in terms of EoS stiffness and resulting stellar structure. However, they reveal significant differences in the types of geometric structures and their prevalence ranges within the mixed phase. Specifically, curvature effects enhance the emergence of tubes and bubbles at high densities despite the large value of surface tension, while suppressing the existence of drops and rods at low densities.</description>

      <title>Microscopic optical potentials for medium-mass isotopes derived at the first order of the Watson multiple scattering theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.04226v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a first-principle calculation of optical potentials for nucleon elastic scattering off medium-mass isotopes. Fully based on a saturating chiral Hamiltonian, the optical potentials are derived by folding nuclear density distributions computed with ab initio self-consistent Green's function theory with a nucleon-nucleon $t$ matrix computed with a consistent chiral interaction. The dependence on the folding interaction as well as the convergence of the target densities are investigated. Numerical results are presented and discussed for differential cross sections and analyzing powers, with focus on elastic proton scattering off Calcium and Nickel isotopes. Our optical potentials generally show a remarkable agreement with the available experimental data for laboratory energies in the range 65-200 MeV. We study the evolution of the scattering observables with increasing proton-neutron asymmetry by computing theoretical predictions of the cross section and analyzing power over the Calcium and Nickel isotopic chains.</description>

      <title>Nucleonic Shells and Nuclear Masses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.16871v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The binding energy of an isotope is a sensitive indicator of the underlying shell structure as it reflects the net energy content of a nucleus. Since magic nuclei are significantly lighter, or more bound, compared to their neighbors, the presence of nucleonic shell structure makes an imprint on nuclear masses. In this work, using a carefully designed binding-energy indicator, we catalog the appearance of spherical and deformed shell and subshell closures throughout the nuclear landscape. After presenting experimental evidence for shell and subshell closures as seen through the lens of nuclear masses, we study the ability of global nuclear mass models to predict local binding-energy variations related to shell effects.</description>

      <title>Randomized measurement protocols for lattice gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.15519v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Randomized measurement protocols, including classical shadows, entanglement tomography, and randomized benchmarking are powerful techniques to estimate observables, perform state tomography, or extract the entanglement properties of quantum states. While unraveling the intricate structure of quantum states is generally difficult and resource-intensive, quantum systems in nature are often tightly constrained by symmetries. This can be leveraged by the symmetry-conscious randomized measurement schemes we propose, yielding clear advantages over symmetry-blind randomization such as reducing measurement costs, enabling symmetry-based error mitigation in experiments, allowing differentiated measurement of (lattice) gauge theory entanglement structure, and, potentially, the verification of topologically ordered states in existing and near-term experiments. Crucially, unlike symmetry-blind randomized measurement protocols, these latter tasks can be performed without relearning symmetries via full reconstruction of the density matrix.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic form factors for nucleons in short-range correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.13666v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent experimental studies have led to the suggestion that short-range correlations may be a major contributor to the nuclear EMC effect. This hypothesis requires that the structure function for nucleons involved in short-range correlations should be heavily suppressed compared to that of a free nucleon. Based on calculations performed within an AdS/QCD motivated, light-front quark-diquark model, we find that this large suppression of the nucleon structure function leads to a strong suppression of the nucleon elastic form factors.</description>

      <title>Anomalies in Particle Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03870v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The currently accepted mathematical description of the fundamental constituents and interactions of matter is the Standard Model of particle physics. Its last missing particle, the famous Higgs boson, was observed at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN in 2012. However, it is clear that the Standard Model cannot be the ultimate theory of Nature, and e.g. cannot account for Dark Matter or non-vanishing neutrino masses (and does not include gravity). In fact, searches for physics beyond the SM have been intensified since the Higgs boson discovery. In this article, we review the hints for new physics, called ``anomalies'', obtained in particle physics experiments within the last years. We consider both direct high-energy searches for new resonances at the LHC and indirect low-energy precision experiments. These anomalies range from the nuclear scale (approximately the mass of the proton) to the electroweak scale (i.e. the mass of the Higgs boson) to the TeV scale (the highest scale directly accessible at the LHC), therefore spanning over four orders of magnitude. After discussing the experimental and theoretical status of the anomalies, we summarize possible explanations in terms of new particles and new interactions. In particular, new Higgs bosons and leptoquarks are promising candidates. Discovery prospects and implications for future colliders are discussed.</description>
