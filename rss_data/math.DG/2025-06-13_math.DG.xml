      <title>On the stability of the generalized equator map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The energy, the $p$-energy ($p\in\mathbb{R}$ with $p\geq 2$) and the extrinsic $k$-energy ($k\in\mathbb{N}$) for maps between Riemannian manifolds are central objects in the geometric calculus of variations. The equator map from the unit ball to the Euclidean sphere provides an explicit critical point of all aforementioned energy functionals. During the last four decades many researchers studied the stability of this particular map when considered as a critical point of one of these energy functionals, see e.g. \cite{MR4436204}, \cite{MR705882}.
  Recently, Nakauchi \cite{MR4593065} introduced a generalized radial projection map and proved that this map is both a critical point of the energy and a critical point of the $p$-energy. This generalized radial projection map gives rise to a generalized equator map which is also both a critical point of the energy and a critical point of the $p$-energy.
  In this manuscript we first of all show that the generalized equator map is also a critical point of the extrinsic $k$-energy. Then, the main focus is a detailed stability analysis of this map, considered as a critical point of both the extrinsic $k$-energy and the $p$-energy. We thus establish a number of interesting generalizations of the classical (in)stability results of J\"ager and Kaul \cite{MR705882}.</description>

      <title>Some global properties of umbilic points of Willmore immersions in the $3$-sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the umbilic points of Willmore surfaces in codimension 1 from the viewpoint of the conformal Gauss map. We first study the local behaviour of the conformal Gauss map near umbilic curves and prove that they are geodesics up to a conformal transformation if and only if the Willmore immersion is, up to a conformal transformation, the gluing of minimal surfaces in the 3-dimensional hyperbolic space. Then, we prove a Gauss--Bonnet formula for the conformal Gauss map of Willmore surfaces which turns out to be an asymptotic expansion involving the length of the umbilic curves in the spirit of renormalized volume expansions. We interpret this formula as a unified version for the different expressions of the value of the Willmore energy for conformally minimal surfaces in each space-form.</description>

      <title>Warped products over one-dimensional base spaces and the RCD condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the Riemannian curvature-dimension condition $\mathsf{RCD}(KN,N+1)$ for an $N$-warped product $B\times_f^N F$ over a one-dimensional base space $B$ with a Lipschitz function $f: B\rightarrow \mathbb R_{\geq 0}$, provided (1) $f$ is a $Kf$-concave function, (2) $f$ satisfies a sub-Neumann boundary condition $\frac{\partial f}{\partial n}\geq 0$ on $\partial B\backslash f^{-1}(0)$ and $F$ is a compact metric measure space satisfying (3) the condition $\mathsf{RCD}(K_F (N-1), N)$ with $K_F:= \sup_B \{ (Df)^2 + Kf^2\}$. The result is sharp, i.e. we show that (1), (2) and (3) are necessary for the validity of statement provided $K_F\geq 0$. In general, only a weaker statement is true. If $f$ is assumed to be $Kf$-affine, then the condition $\mathsf{RCD}(K N, N+1)$ for the $N$-warped product holds if and only if the condition $\mathsf{RCD}(K_F(N-1), N)$ holds for $F$ for any $K_F\in \mathbb R$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish Gromov's celebrated reconstruction theorem in Lorentzian geometry. Alongside this result, we introduce and study a natural concept of isomorphy of normalized bounded Lorentzian metric measure spaces. We outline applications to the spacetime reconstruction problem from causal set theory. Lastly, we propose three notions of convergence of (isomorphism classes of) normalized bounded Lorentzian metric measure spaces, for which we prove several fundamental properties.</description>

We recall the properties of the mirror map $B\in\mathrm{End}(TTM)$, known also as the canonical endomorphism or the almost-tangent structure, solve some cohomological questions and raise other induced by the $\mathrm{d}_B$ operator.</description>

      <title>Tetraplectic structures compatible with local quaternionic toric actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a quaternionic analogue of toric geometry by developing the theory of local $Q^n := Sp(1)^n$-actions on 4n-dimensional manifolds, modeled on the regular representation. We identify obstructions that measure the failure of local properties to globalize and define two invariants: a combinatorial invariant called the characteristic pair and a cohomological invariant called the Euler class, which together classify local quaternionic torus actions up to homeomorphism. We also study tetraplectic structures in quaternionic toric geometry by introducing locally generalized Lagrangian-type toric fibrations and show that such fibrations are locally modeled on $\mathbb{R}^n\times Q^n$ using a quaternionic version of the Arnold-Liouville theorem. In the last part, we show that orbit spaces of these actions acquire the structure of quaternionic integral affine manifolds with corners and Lagrangian overlaps, and we classify such spaces by establishing a quaternionic Delzant-type theorem.</description>

Abstract: Given a holomorphic Lie algebroid $(V, \phi)$ on a compact connected Riemann surface $X$, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for a holomorphic vector bundle $E$ on $X$ to admit a holomorphic Lie algebroid connection. If $(V, \phi)$ is nonsplit, then every holomorphic vector bundle on $X$ admits a holomorphic Lie algebroid connection for $(V, \phi)$. If $(V, \phi)$ is split, then a holomorphic vector bundle $E$ on $X$ admits a holomorphic Lie algebroid connection if and only if the degree of each indecomposable component of $E$ is zero.</description>

      <title>Hessian Geometry of Latent Space in Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel method for analyzing the latent space geometry of generative models, including statistical physics models and diffusion models, by reconstructing the Fisher information metric. The method approximates the posterior distribution of latent variables given generated samples and uses this to learn the log-partition function, which defines the Fisher metric for exponential families. Theoretical convergence guarantees are provided, and the method is validated on the Ising and TASEP models, outperforming existing baselines in reconstructing thermodynamic quantities. Applied to diffusion models, the method reveals a fractal structure of phase transitions in the latent space, characterized by abrupt changes in the Fisher metric. We demonstrate that while geodesic interpolations are approximately linear within individual phases, this linearity breaks down at phase boundaries, where the diffusion model exhibits a divergent Lipschitz constant with respect to the latent space. These findings provide new insights into the complex structure of diffusion model latent spaces and their connection to phenomena like phase transitions.

      <description>arXiv:2506.10679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove an equivariant version of the CM minimization conjecture for extremal K\"ahler manifolds. This involves proving that, given an equivariant punctured family of polarized varieties, a relative version of the CM degree is strictly minimized by an extremal filling.
  This generalizes a result by Hattori for cscK manifolds with discrete automorphism group by allowing automorphisms and extremal metrics. As a main tool, we extend results by Sz\'ekelyhidi on asymptotic filtration Chow stability of cscK manifolds with discrete automorphism group to the extremal setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Line fields on surfaces are a means to describe the nematic order that may pattern them. The least distorted nematic fields are called uniform, but they can only exist on surfaces with negative constant Gaussian curvature. To identify the least distorted nematic fields on a generic surface, we relax the notion of uniformity into that of quasi-uniformity and prove that all such fields are parallel transported (in Levi-Civita's sense) by the geodesics of the surface. Both global and local constructions of quasi-uniform fields are presented to illustrate both richness and significance of the proposed notion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10276v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that there are no complete noncompact constant mean curvature hypersurfaces with the mean curvature $H &gt; 1$, finite index and finite topology in hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^4$. A more general nonexistence result can be proved in a $4$-dimensional Riemannian manifold with certain curvature conditions. We also show that $4$-manifold with $\operatorname{Ric} &gt; 1$ does not contain any complete noncompact minimal stable hypersurface with finite topology. The proof relies on the $\mu$-bubble initially introduced by Gromov and further developed by Chodosh-Li-Stryker in the context of stable minimal hypersurfaces.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the existence of torqued and anti-torqued vector fields on the hyperbolic ambient space $\mathbb{H}^n$. Although there are examples of proper torqued vector fields on open subsets of $\mathbb{H}^n$, we prove that there is not a proper torqued vector field globally defined on $\mathbb{H}^n$. Similarly, we have another non-existence result for anti-torqued vector fields as long as their conformal scalar is a non-constant function satisfying certain conditions. When the conformal scalar is constant, some examples of anti-torqued vector fields are provided.</description>

      <title>A Unified Framework to Enforce, Discover, and Promote Symmetry in Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00212v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symmetry is present throughout nature and continues to play an increasingly central role in physics and machine learning. Fundamental symmetries, such as Poincar\'{e} invariance, allow physical laws discovered in laboratories on Earth to be extrapolated to the farthest reaches of the universe. Symmetry is essential to achieving this extrapolatory power in machine learning applications. For example, translation invariance in image classification allows models with fewer parameters, such as convolutional neural networks, to be trained on smaller data sets and achieve state-of-the-art performance. In this paper, we provide a unifying theoretical and methodological framework for incorporating symmetry into machine learning models in three ways: 1. enforcing known symmetry when training a model; 2. discovering unknown symmetries of a given model or data set; and 3. promoting symmetry during training by learning a model that breaks symmetries within a user-specified group of candidates when there is sufficient evidence in the data. We show that these tasks can be cast within a common mathematical framework whose central object is the Lie derivative associated with fiber-linear Lie group actions on vector bundles. We extend and unify several existing results by showing that enforcing and discovering symmetry are linear-algebraic tasks that are dual with respect to the bilinear structure of the Lie derivative. We also propose a novel way to promote symmetry by introducing a class of convex regularization functions based on the Lie derivative and nuclear norm relaxation to penalize symmetry breaking during training of machine learning models. We explain how these ideas can be applied to a wide range of machine learning models including basis function regression, dynamical systems discovery, neural networks, and neural operators acting on fields.</description>

      <title>On the Ashbaugh-Benguria type conjecture about lower-order Neumann eigenvalues of the Witten-Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08070v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An isoperimetric inequality for lower order nonzero Neumann eigenvalues of the Witten-Laplacian on bounded domains in a Euclidean space or a hyperbolic space has been proven in this paper. About this conclusion, we would like to point out two things:
  It strengthens the well-known Szeg\H{o}-Weinberger inequality for nonzero Neumann eigenvalues of the classical free membrane problem given in [J. Rational Mech. Anal. 3 (1954) 343-356] and [J. Rational Mech. Anal. 5 (1956) 633-636];
  Recently, Xia-Wang [Math. Ann. 385 (2023) 863-879] gave a very important progress to the celebrated conjecture of M. S. Ashbaugh and R. D. Benguria proposed in [SIAM J. Math. Anal. 24 (1993) 557-570]. It is easy to see that our conclusion here covers Xia-Wang's this progress as a special case.
  In this paper, we have also proposed two open problems which can be seen as a generalization of Ashbaugh-Benguria's conjecture mentioned above.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07926v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: On a symplectic manifold $(M, \omega)$, a spacefilling brane structure is a closed 2-form $F$ which determines a complex structure, with respect to which $F +i\omega$ is holomorphic symplectic. For holomorphic symplectic compact K\"ahler 4-manifolds, we show that the moduli space of spacefilling branes is smooth, and determine its dimension. The proof relies on the local Torelli theorem for K3 surfaces and tori.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Deformation of Geometry through Function C(v): Scalar Deformation Flow and the Geometric Classification of 3-Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01146v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the scalar deformation function C(v), which captures how local geometric structures respond to motion at velocity v. This function exhibits smooth analytic behavior and defines a critical velocity vc beyond which the geometry compresses. Extending C(v) into a flow C(v, tau), we construct a scalar analogue of Ricci flow that governs the evolution of geometric configurations toward symmetric, stable states without singularities. The flow is derived from a variational energy functional and satisfies global existence and convergence properties. We show that this scalar evolution provides a pathway for topological classification of three-manifolds through conformal smoothing and energy minimization, offering a curvature-free geometric mechanism rooted in analytic deformation. The resulting framework combines techniques from differential geometry and dynamical systems and may serve as a minimal geometric model for structure formation in relativistic contexts.</description>
