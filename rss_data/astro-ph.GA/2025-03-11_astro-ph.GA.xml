      <title>Decoding the Galactic Twirl: The Downfall of Milky Way-mass Galaxies Rotation Curves in the FIRE Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent measurements of the Milky Way rotation curve found a sharp decline at around $15$-$20$ kpc from the center of the Galaxy, suggesting that the Galactic dark matter halo is much less massive than predicted by other dynamical tracers. To address this tension, we study the validity of the assumptions made in calculating the Milky Way's rotation curve. To do so, we apply Jeans' equation, the current standard approach of measuring rotation curves, to three cosmological zoom-in simulations of Milky Way-like galaxies from the FIRE-2 Latte suite. Using synthetic Gaia surveys, we replicate the sample selection process and calculation employed in measuring the Milky Way rotation curve. We examine four failure modes of this calculation and find that the measured curves deviate from the true curve by $5$-$20\%$ rather than below $5\%$, as estimated by previous works. Interestingly, there is a large galaxy-to-galaxy variance, and different systematics dominate different galaxies. We rederive the Milky Way's dark matter density profile with the rotation curve while incorporating systematics from the simulations. The posterior distribution of the density profiles is consistent with a fiducial NFW profile when assuming a gNFW profile for dark matter. We find that the virial mass, $7.32^{+1.98}_{-1.53}\times10^{11}~M_{\odot}$, consistent with other probes of the Milky Way's mass. However, we recommend that the field moves away from relying solely on the rotation curve when studying the dark matter profile, and adopts methods that incorporate additional probes and/or do not heavily depend on assumptions described in this study.</description>

      <title>GHOST commissioning science results -- IV: Chemodynamical analyses of Milky Way satellites Sagittarius II and Aquarius II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Gemini/GHOST high-resolution spectra of five stars observed in two low surface brightness Milky Way satellites, Sagittarius II (Sgr2) and Aquarius II (Aqu2). For Aqu2, the velocities and metallicities of the two stars are consistent with membership in a dark matter-dominated ultra faint dwarf galaxy (UFD). The chemical abundance ratios suggest inefficient star formation from only one or a few supernovae (e.g., low Na, Sr, Ba), and enriched potassium (K) from super-AGB stars. For Sgr2, the velocity and metallicity dispersions of its members are not clearly resolved and our detailed chemical abundances show typical ratios for metal-poor stars, with low dispersions. There is only one exception - we report the discovery of an r-process enhanced star (Sgr2584, [Eu/Fe]= $+0.7 \pm 0.2 $; thus, an r-I star). As r-I stars are found in both UFDs (Tuc III, Tuc IV, Grus II) and globular clusters (M15 and M92), then this does not help to further classify the nature of Sgr2. Our exploration of Sgr2 demonstrates the difficulty in classifying some of the faintest (ambiguous) satellites. We advocate for additional diagnostics in analysing the ambiguous systems, such as exploring radial segregation (by mass and/or chemistry), N-body simulations, and the need for dark matter to survive Galactic tidal effects. The spectra analysed in this paper were taken as part of the GHOST commissioning observations, testing faint observation limits (G &lt; 18.8) and the single and double IFU observing modes.</description>

      <title>The Gaseous Blowout of the 30 Doradus Starburst Region in the LMC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Widespread galactic winds emanate from the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), with the 30 Doradus starburst region generating the fastest and most concentrated gas flows. We report on the gas distribution, kinematics, and ionization conditions of the near-side outflow along 8 down-the-barrel sightlines using UV absorption-line observations from the HST's ULLYSES program for this region along with H I 21-cm observations from the GASS and GASKAP surveys. We find that within 1.7 degrees from the center of 30 Doradus, the wind reaches maximum speeds of $100-150\,\text{km}\,\text{s}^{-1}$ from the LMC's disk. The total integrated column densities of low-ions (O I, Si II, and Fe II) in the blueshifted wind, up to $v_{\rm LSR}=150\,\text{km}\,\text{s}^{-1}$, are highest near the center and decline radially outward. We estimate an outflow mass of $M_{\rm outflow,\,Si II}\approx(5.7-8.6)\,\times 10^{5} M_{\odot}$, outflow rate of $\dot{M}_{\rm outflow}\gtrsim0.02 M_{\odot}\,\text{yr}^{-1}$, and mass loading factor of $\eta\gtrsim0.10$ within 0.52 degrees from the center of 30 Doradus. The observed ion ratios$-$together with photoionization modeling$-$reveal that this wind is roughly $40-97\%$ photoionized. The metallicities and dust depletion patterns of the high-velocity absorbers at $v_{\rm LSR}\approx+120\,\text{km}\,\text{s}^{-1}$ can be explained by either a foreground Milky Way (MW) halo cloud or an outflow from the LMC. For the high-ions, Si IV and C IV are broader and kinematically offset from the low-ions, suggesting turbulent mixing layers (TMLs) existing in the wind. Finally, our hydrodynamical simulations of the Magellanic Clouds (MCs) and MW system suggest that the Magellanic Corona can protect the LMC winds from the ram-pressure forces exerted by the MW's halo.</description>

      <title>MeerKAT view of Hickson Compact Groups: II. HI deficiency in the core and surrounding regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hickson compact groups (HCGs) offer an ideal environment for investigating galaxy transformation as a result of interactions. It has been established that the evolutionary sequence of HCGs is marked by an intermediate stage characterised by a substantial amount of HI in their intragroup medium (IGrM) in the form of tidal tails and bridges (Phase 2), rapidly followed by a final stage where no IGrM gas is found and where their member galaxies are highly HI-deficient (Phase 3). Despite numerous single-dish and interferometric HI studies on the HCGs, a clear HI picture of the groups within their large-scale environment still remains to be uncovered. Taking advantage of the MeerKAT's high column density sensitivity and large field-of-view, we aim to investigate the rapid transformation of HCGs from the intermediate to late phases, and establish a picture of their gas content variations in the context of their large-scale environments. We performed MeerKAT observations of six HCGs selected to represent the intermediate and late phases of the proposed evolutionary sequence. Combining the HI observations with data from recent wide-field optical surveys, we evaluated the HI deficiencies of galaxies in a ~30' radius of the HCGs. We find that galaxies surrounding both phases exhibit similar distributions in their gas content. Similarly, galaxies making up the cores of Phase 2 HCGs are comparable to their neighbours in terms of HI deficiencies. However, Phase 3 groups are over an order of magnitude more deficient than their surroundings, supporting previous findings that late-phase HCG galaxies are more evolved than their large-scale environments.</description>

      <title>Diffusive vs. non-diffusive paths to interstellar hydrogen peroxide. A machine learning-based molecular dynamics study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Radical chemical reactions on cosmic dust grains play a crucial role in forming various chemical species. Among different radicals, the hydroxyl (OH) is one of the most important ones, with a rather specific chemistry. Aims. The goal of this work is to simulate the recombination dynamics of hydroxyl radicals and the subsequent formation of hydrogen peroxide (H$_{2}$O$_{2}$). Mthods. We employed neural network potentials trained on ONIOM(QM/QM) data, combining multi-reference (CASPT2) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This approach allows us to model the recombination of hydroxyl radicals on ice surfaces with high computational efficiency and accuracy. Results. Our simulations reveal that the initial position of the radicals plays a decisive role in determining recombination probability. We found that the formation of hydrogen-bond between radicals, competes with the formation of hydrogen peroxide, reducing the recombination efficiency, contrary to expectancy. This competition reduces the recombination probability for radicals that are initially formed approximately 3 \AA{} apart. Recombination probabilities also depend on the kinetic energy of the added radicals, with values around 0.33 for thermal radicals and a wide range of values between 0.33 and 1.00 for suprathermal OH radicals. Conclusions. Based on our calculations we provide recommendations for introducing OH radical recombination into kinetic astrochemical models, differentiating between thermal and suprathermal radicals. The recombination behavior varies significantly between these two cases: while thermal radicals are sometimes trapped in hydrogen-bonded minima, the case of suprathermal radicals varies with the added energy. Our most important conclusion is that OH radical recombination probability cannot be assumed 1.0 for a wide variety of cases.</description>

      <title>Dwarf Active Galactic Nuclei from Variability for the Origins of Seeds (DAVOS): Properties of Variability-Selected AGNs in the Dark Energy Survey Deep Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the black hole mass $-$ host galaxy stellar mass relation, $M_{\rm{BH}}-M_{\ast}$, for a sample of 706 $z \lesssim 1.5$ and $i \lesssim 24$ optically-variable active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in three Dark Energy Survey (DES) deep fields: C3, X3, E2, which partially cover Chandra Deep Field-South, XMM Large Scale Structure survey, and European Large Area ISO Survey, respectively. The parent sample was identified by optical variability from the DES supernova survey program imaging. Using publicly available spectra and photometric catalogs, we consolidate their spectroscopic redshifts, estimate their black hole masses using broad line widths and luminosities, and obtain improved stellar masses using spectral energy distribution fitting from X-ray to mid-infrared wavelengths. Our results confirm previous work from Hyper-Suprime Camera imaging that variability searches with deep, high-precision photometry can reliably identify AGNs in low-mass galaxies up to $z\sim1$. However, we find that the hosted black holes are overmassive than predicted by the local AGN relation, fixing host galaxy stellar mass. Instead, $z\sim 0.1-1.5$ variability-selected AGNs lie in between the $M_{\rm{BH}}-M_{\ast}$ relation for local inactive early-type galaxies and local active galaxies. This result agrees with most previous studies of $M_{\rm{BH}}-M_{\ast}$ relation for AGNs at similar redshifts, regardless of selection technique. We demonstrate that studies of variability selected AGN provide critical insights into the low-mass end of the $M_{\rm{BH}}-M_{\ast}$ relation, shedding light on the occupation fraction of that provides constraints on early BH seeding mechanisms and self-regulated feedback processes during their growth and co-evolution with their hosts.</description>

      <title>Wind of Change: Faraday Rotation in a Simulated Large Magellanic Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic fields significantly influence the structure of galaxies' interstellar media, but our understanding of magnetic field strengths and structures in external galaxies is severely limited. The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) offers a unique opportunity for improvement due to its proximity and large angular size, allowing for various detailed observations, particularly rich datasets of rotation measures and dispersion measures (RM and DM). However, interpreting these measurements is challenging due to the need for assumptions about the 3D structure for which we can only access line-of-sight integrated quantities. To address this, we conduct a suite of high-resolution magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of the LMC, incorporating star formation, star-by-star feedback, and ram pressure stripping by the Milky Way's circumgalactic medium (CGM), experienced as a circumgalactic wind in the frame of the LMC. Synthetic observations of these simulations allow us to identify parameters that closely match observed RM and DM values. Our best model, which is an excellent match to the real LMC, yields magnetic field strengths of $\sim 1.4~\mu{\rm G}$ (ordered) and $\sim 1.6~\mu{\rm G}$ (turbulent). In this model, Milky Way CGM wind experienced by the LMC plays a critical role in shaping the RM data, with the bulk of the RM signal arising not from the LMC's plane, but from warm, $\sim 10^4$ K, gas in a Reynolds layer region $\sim 1$ kpc off the plane where relatively dense material stripped from the LMC is partially ionised by hard extragalactic radiation fields. This finding suggests that we should be cautious about generalising inferences from the LMC to other galaxies that may not be shaped by similar interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new potential is presented for spherical galaxies. The technique of the construction of our model is similar to that given by An and Evans. In a special case, its mass density becomes a special one of the Hernquist model. Another special model is primarily discussed, and its intrinsic properties, such as velocity dispersions and surface densities, can be shown directly by numerical calculation. Its distribution functions in both isotropic and anisotropic cases can be expressed as some definite integrals which are suitable for numerical calculation.</description>

      <title>Turbulent fragmentation as the primary driver of core formation in Polaris Flare and Lupus I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stars form from dense cores in turbulent molecular clouds. According to the standard scenario of star formation, dense cores are created by cloud fragmentation. However, the physical mechanisms driving this process are still not fully understood from an observational standpoint. However, the physical mechanisms driving this process are still not fully understood from an observational standpoint. Our goal is to investigate the process of cloud fragmentation using observational data from nearby clouds. Specifically, we aim to examine the role of self-gravity and turbulence, both of which are key to the dynamical evolution of clouds. We applied astrodendro to the Herschel H2 column density maps to identify dense cores and determine their mass and separation in two nearby low-mass clouds: the Polaris Flare and Lupus I clouds. We then compared the observed core masses and separations with predictions from models of gravitational and turbulent fragmentation. For turbulent fragmentation, the key scales are the cloud sonic scale and its corresponding mass. The average core masses are estimated to be 0.242 Msun for Lupus I and 0.276 Msun for the Polaris Flare. The core separations peak at 0.1 - 0.2 pc in both clouds. These separations are significantly smaller than the Jeans length but agree well with the cloud sonic scale. Additionally, the density probability distribution functions of the dense cores follow log-normal distributions, which is consistent with the predictions of turbulent fragmentation. These findings suggest that the primary process driving core formation in the observed low-mass star-forming regions is not gravitational fragmentation but rather turbulent fragmentation. We found no evidence that filament fragmentation plays a significant role in the formation of dense cores.</description>

      <title>Warm Ionized Gas Outflows in Active Galactic Nuclei: What Causes it?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The driving force behind outflows, often invoked to understand the correlation between the supermassive black holes powering active galactic nuclei (AGN) and their host galaxy properties, remains uncertain. We provide new insights into the mechanisms that trigger warm ionized outflows in AGN, based on findings from the MaNGA survey. Our sample comprises 538 AGN with strong [OIII]$\lambda$5007 emission lines, of which 197 are detected in radio and 341 are radio-undetected. We analyzed [OIII]$\lambda$5007 line in summed spectra, extracted over their central 500$\times$500 pc$^2$ region. The calculated Balmer 4000 $\AA$ break, D$_n$4000 is larger than 1.45 for $\sim$95$\%$ of the sources indicating that the specific star-formation rate in their central regions is smaller than 10$^{-11.5}$ yr$^{-1}$, pointing to evidence of negative AGN feedback suppressing star-formation. Considering the whole sample, radio-detected sources show an increased outflow detection rate (56$\pm$7\%) compared to radio-undetected sources (25$\pm$3\%). They also show higher velocity, mass outflow rate, outflow power and outflow momentum rate. We noticed a strong correlation between outflow characteristics and bolometric luminosity in both samples, except that the correlation is steeper for the radio-detected sample. Our findings suggest (a) warm ionized outflows are prevalent in all types of AGN, (b) radiation from AGN is the primary driver of these outflows, (c) radio jets are likely to play a secondary role in enhancing the gas kinematics over and above that caused by radiation, and (d) very low star-formation in the central regions of the galaxies, possibly due to negative feedback of AGN activity.</description>

      <title>Kinetic model and numerical method for multispecies radiation hydrodynamic system with multiscale nonequilibrium transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive numerical framework for simulating radiation-plasma systems. The radiative transfer process spans multiple flow regimes due to varying fluid opacity across different regions, necessitating a robust numerical approach. We employ the multiscale unified gas-kinetic scheme (UGKS), which accurately captures photon transport phenomena from free streaming to diffusive wave propagation. The UGKS is also applied to the fluid model to address the significant mass disparity between electrons and ions, and their associated transport characteristics in both equilibrium continuum and non-equilibrium rarefied regimes. Our model explicitly incorporates momentum and energy exchanges between radiation and fluid fields in the coupled system, enabling detailed analysis of the complex interactions between electromagnetic and hydrodynamic phenomena. The developed algorithm successfully reproduces both optically thin and optically thick radiation limits while capturing the complex multiscale nonequilibrium dynamics of the coupled system. This unified treatment eliminates the need for separate numerical schemes in different regimes, providing a consistent and computationally effcient approach for the entire domain. The effectiveness and versatility of this approach are demonstrated through extensive numerical validation across a wide range of physical parameters and flow conditions.</description>

Abstract: We derive circular velocity curves (CVCs) from stellar dynamical models for $\sim6{,}000$ nearby galaxies in the final data release of the SDSS-IV MaNGA survey with integral-field spectroscopy, exploring connections between the inner gravitational potential (traced by CVC amplitude/shape) and galaxy properties. The maximum circular velocity ($V_{\rm circ}^{\rm max}$) and circular velocity at the half-light radius ($V_{\rm circ}(R_{\rm e}^{\rm maj})$) both scale linearly with the stellar second velocity moment $\sigma_{\rm e}^2\equiv\langle V^2+\sigma^2\rangle$ within the half-light isophote, following $V_{\rm circ}^{\rm max} \approx 1.75\sigma_{\rm e}$ (8$\%$ error) and $V_{\rm circ}(R_{\rm e}^{\rm maj}) \approx 1.65\sigma_{\rm e}$ (9$\%$ error). CVC shapes (rising, flat, declining) correlate strongly with structural and stellar population properties: declining curves dominate in massive, early-type, bulge-dominated galaxies with old, metal-rich stars and early quenching, while rising CVCs prevail in disk-dominated systems with younger stellar populations and ongoing star formation. Using a unified bulge-disk-halo model, we predict CVC shapes with minimal bias, identifying three governing parameters: bulge-to-total mass ratio ($B/T$), dark matter fraction within $R_{\rm e}$, and bulge Sersic index. The distribution of CVC shapes across the mass-size plane reflects evolutionary pathways driven by (i) in situ star formation (spurring bulge growth) and (ii) dry mergers. This establishes CVC morphology as a diagnostic for galaxy evolution, linking dynamical signatures to structural and stellar population histories.</description>

      <title>ALMA observations of CH3COCH3 and the related species CH3CHO, CH3OH, and C2H5CN in line-rich molecular cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Acetone (CH3COCH3) is a carbonyl-bearing complex organic molecule, yet interstellar observations of acetone remain limited. Studying the formation and distribution of CH3COCH3 in the interstellar medium can provide valuable insights into prebiotic chemistry and the evolution of interstellar molecules.
  Aims. We explore the spatial distribution of CH3COCH3 and its correlation with the O-bearing molecules acetaldehyde (CH3CHO) and methanol (CH3OH), as well as the N-bearing molecule ethyl cyanide (C2H5CN), in massive protostellar clumps.
  Methods. We observed 11 massive protostellar clumps using ALMA at 345 GHz, with an angular resolution of 0.7''-1.0''. Spectral line transitions were identified using the eXtended CASA Line Analysis Software Suite. We constructed integrated intensity maps of CH3COCH3, CH3CHO, CH3OH, and C2H5CN and derived their rotation temperatures, column densities, and abundances under the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium.
  Results. CH3COCH3 is detected in 16 line-rich cores from 9 massive protostellar clumps: 12 high-mass cores, 3 intermediate-mass cores, and 1 low-mass core. CH3CHO and CH3OH are also detected in all 16 cores, while C2H5CN is detected in 15. The integrated intensity maps reveal similar spatial distributions for CH3COCH3, CH3CHO, CH3OH, and C2H5CN. The line emission peaks of all four molecules coincide with the continuum emission peaks in regions without ultracompact HII regions. Significant correlations are observed in the abundances of these molecules, which also exhibit similar average temperatures.
  Conclusions. Our observational results, supported by chemical models, suggest that CH3COCH3, CH3CHO, and CH3OH originate from the same gas. The observed temperatures and abundances of CH3COCH3 are consistent with model predictions involving grain surface chemistry.</description>

      <title>JWST ASPIRE: How Did Galaxies Complete Reionization? Evidence for Excess IGM Transmission around ${\rm [O\,{\scriptstyle III}]}$ Emitters during Reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spatial correlation between galaxies and the Ly$\alpha$ forest provides insights into how galaxies reionized the Universe. Here, we present initial results on the spatial cross-correlation between [OIII] emitters and Ly$\alpha$ forest at 5.4&lt;z&lt;6.5 from the JWST ASPIRE NIRCam/F356W Grism Spectroscopic Survey in z&gt;6.5 QSO fields. Using data from five QSO fields, we find $2\sigma$ evidence for excess Ly$\alpha$ forest transmission at ~20-40 cMpc around [OIII] emitters at z=5.86, indicating that [OIII] emitters reside within a highly ionized IGM. At smaller scales, the Ly$\alpha$ forest is preferentially absorbed, suggesting gas overdensities around [OIII] emitters. Comparing with models including THESAN simulations, we interpret the observed cross-correlation as evidence for significant large-scale fluctuations of the IGM and the late end of reionization at z&lt;6, characterized by ionized bubbles over 50 cMpc around [OIII] emitters. The required UV background necessitates an unseen population of faint galaxies around the [OIII] emitters. Furthermore, we find that the number of observed [OIII] emitters near individual transmission spikes is insufficient to sustain reionization in their surroundings, even assuming all [OIII] emitters harbour AGN with 100 % LyC escape fractions. Despite broad agreement, a careful analysis of ASPIRE and THESAN, using the observed host halo mass from the clustering of [OIII] emitters, suggests that the simulations underpredict the observed excess IGM transmission around [OIII] emitters, challenging our model of reionization. Potential solutions include larger ionized bubbles at z&lt;6, more enhanced large-scale UV background or temperature fluctuations of the IGM, and possibly a patchy early onset of reionization at z&gt;10. Current observational errors are dominated by cosmic variance, meaning future analyses of more QSO fields from JWST will improve the results.</description>

      <title>ATOMS: ALMA Three-millimeter Observations of Massive Star-forming regions -XXI. A Large-sample Observational Study of Ethanol and Dimethyl Ether in Hot Cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hot cores, as a stage of massive star formation, exhibit abundant line emissions of COMs. We present a deep line survey of two isomers of C$_2$H$_6$O: ethanol (C$_2$H$_5$OH; EA), and dimethyl ether (CH$_3$OCH$_3$; DE) as well as their possible precursor CH$_3$OH towards 60 hot cores by using the ALMA 3 mm line observations. EA is detected in 40 hot cores and DE is detected in 59 hot cores. Of these, EA and DE are simultaneously detected in 39 hot cores. We calculate rotation temperatures and column densities of EA and DE by using the XCLASS software. The average rotation temperature of EA is higher than that of DE, whereas the average column density of EA is lower than that of DE. Combined with previous studies of hot cores and hot corinos, we find strong column density correlations among EA and DE ($\rho$ = 0.92), EA and CH$_3$OH ($\rho$ = 0.82), as well as DE and CH$_3$OH ($\rho$ = 0.80). The column density ratios of EA/DE versus the column densities of CH$_3$OH remain nearly constant with values within ~ 1 order of magnitude. These strong correlations and the stable ratios, suggest that EA, DE, and CH$_3$OH could be chemically linked, with CH$_3$OH potentially serving as a precursor for EA and DE. Compared with chemical models, the three different warm-up timescale models result in the systematic overproduction of EA and the systematic underproduction of DE. Therefore, our large sample observations can provide crucial constraints on chemical models.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we used the 13.7m telescope at Qinghai Station to observe CO data in 48 galaxies in Virgo clusters, of which 41 sources observed CO signals. The properties of molecular gas are deduced by co-to-$H_2$ factor. We also collected and investigated the relationship between $M_{H_2}$ and other galactic properties ($M_B$, $L_K$, sfr, and $def_{HI}$). We found correlations between $M_{H_2}$ and $M_B$, $L_K$, sfr, and $def_{HI}$. It has the strongest correlation with Lk. There is a certain correlation between MB and MB, but the scattering is larger. For sfr, the more abundant the atomic and molecular gases, the stronger the sfr activity.</description>

      <title>Narrow absorption lines from intervening material in supernovae. II. Galaxy properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interstellar medium (ISM) has a number of tracers such as the Na I D 5890, 5896 AA absorption lines that are evident in the spectra of galaxies but also in those of individual astrophysical sources such as stars, novae or quasars. Here, we investigate narrow absorption features in the spectra of nearby supernovae (SNe) and compare them to local (&lt; 0.5 kpc) and global host galaxy properties. With a large and heterogeneous sample of spectra, we are able to recover the known relations of ISM with galaxy properties: larger columns of ISM gas are found in environments that are more massive, more actively star-forming, younger and viewed from a more inclined angle. Most trends are stronger for local than global properties, and we find that the ISM column density decreases exponentially with the offset from the host galaxy centre, as expected for a gas distribution following an exponential radial profile. We also confirm trends for the velocity of galactic outflows increasing with radius. The current study demonstrates the capability of individual light sources to serve as ubiquitous tracers of ISM properties across various environments and galaxies.</description>

      <title>Identifying compact symmetric objects with high-precision VLBI and Gaia astrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compact symmetric objects (CSOs) represent a key early stage in radio galaxy evolution, but their reliable identification remains challenging. We develop a method to identify CSOs by combining Gaia optical astrometry with VLBI radio imaging. We analyze 40 CSO candidates by overlaying Gaia DR3 positions on VLBI maps to locate their central engines. CSOs are confirmed when Gaia positions lie between symmetric radio lobes, while core-jet sources show optical positions coinciding with one end of the radio structure. We verify classifications using spectral indices, variability, and jet kinematics from multi-epoch VLBI observations. Our method identified 22 genuine CSOs and 10 core-jet sources, with 8 objects remaining ambiguous. Confirmed CSOs show kinematic ages from 20 to over 1000 years and hotspot speeds typically below 0.5c. Five nearby CSOs show optical-radio offsets despite strong CSO morphology, indicating host galaxy influence. The Gaia-VLBI method provides a reliable CSO identification tool. Our sample reveals diverse radio powers, suggesting multiple evolutionary paths. CSO evolution appears influenced by both intrinsic jet power and environmental factors, with high-power CSOs potentially evolving into large-scale radio galaxies while low-power CSOs often show confinement by their host environments.</description>

      <title>X-shaped radio galaxy 3C 315</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we want to investigate X-shaped radio galaxy 3C 315, which is a FRII source, but it lies very close to the FRI/FRII borderline. We used publicly available data from Leahy's atlas of double radio-sources and NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database (NED) in order to investigate its flux density, as well as the spectral index distribution. We obtained spectral index distributions between the frequencies: 1417 MHz - 2695 MHz and 1646 MHz - 2695 MHz. Our conclusion is that the synchrotron radiation is the dominant radiation mechanism over most of the area of 3C 315. Because of very poor hotspots (i.e. warmspots) we investigated which part of the source represents more active regions. The results of this study would be helpful to understand the evolutionary process of the galaxy 3C 315.</description>

      <title>Euclid: Early Release Observations -- The Intracluster Light of Abell 2390</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intracluster light (ICL) provides a record of the dynamical interactions undergone by clusters, giving clues on cluster formation and evolution. Here, we analyse the properties of ICL in the massive cluster Abell 2390 at redshift z=0.228. Our analysis is based on the deep images obtained by the Euclid mission as part of the Early Release Observations in the near-infrared (Y, J, H bands), using the NISP instrument in a 0.75 deg$^2$ field. We subtracted a point--spread function (PSF) model and removed the Galactic cirrus contribution in each band after modelling it with the DAWIS software. We then applied three methods to detect, characterise, and model the ICL and the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG): the CICLE 2D multi-galaxy fitting; the DAWIS wavelet-based multiscale software; and a mask-based 1D profile fitting. We detect ICL out to 600 kpc. The ICL fractions derived by our three methods range between 18% and 36% (average of 24%), while the BCG+ICL fractions are between 21% and 41% (average of 29%), depending on the band and method. A galaxy density map based on 219 selected cluster members shows a strong cluster substructure to the south-east and a smaller feature to the north-west. Based on colours, the ICL (out to about 400 kpc) seems to be built by the accretion of small systems (M ~ $10^{9.5}$ solar mass), or from stars coming from the outskirts of Milky Way-type galaxies (M ~ $10^{10}$ solar mass). Though Abell 2390 does not seem to be undergoing a merger, it is not yet fully relaxed, since it has accreted two groups that have not fully merged with the cluster core. We estimate that the contributions to the inner 300 kpc of the ICL of the north-west and south-east subgroups are 21% and 9% respectively.</description>

      <title>Probing Reionization-Era Galaxies with JWST UV Luminosity Functions and Large-Scale Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has transformed our understanding of early galaxy formation, providing an unprecedented view of the first billion years of cosmic history. These observations offer a crucial opportunity to probe the interplay between galaxy formation and reionization, placing stringent constraints on theoretical models. In this work, we build upon our previously developed semi-analytical framework that self-consistently models the evolving UV luminosity function (UVLF) of galaxies and the global reionization history while incorporating the effects of radiative feedback. Comparing our predictions with JWST and HST data, we identify a fundamental tension: models that match the UVLF fail to reproduce the observed evolution of galaxy clustering (bias) with redshift, and vice versa. To resolve this, we introduce a mass-dependent duty cycle linked to star formation duration. This duty cycle approaches unity at $z &gt; 11$, requiring either enhanced UV radiation production or increased star formation efficiency to match the JWST UVLFs, while declining towards lower redshifts ($5 &lt; z \leq 9$) to remain consistent with the bias measurements. Reconciling theory with observations requires that the characteristic star formation timescale increases from $\approx 80$ Myr at $z \approx 6$ to $\approx 120$ Myr at $z \approx 8$. Finally, our extended model, assuming a halo mass-independent escape fraction of $\approx 12\%$, produces a reionization history consistent with current constraints. These findings underscore the importance of jointly constraining high-redshift galaxy models using both UVLF and bias statistics to accurately interpret JWST data and refine our understanding of early cosmic evolution.</description>

      <title>10 Years of Archival High-Resolution NIR Spectra: The Raw and Reduced IGRINS Spectral Archive (RRISA)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Immersion GRating INfrared Spectrometer (IGRINS) is a compact, high-resolution (R~45,000) near-infrared spectrograph spanning 1.45 to 2.45 um in a single exposure. We introduce the Raw and Reduced IGRINS Spectral Archive (RRISA), which provides public data access for all non-proprietary IGRINS data taken at McDonald Observatory's Harlan J. Smith Telescope, the Lowell Discovery Telescope (formerly Discovery Channel Telescope), and Gemini South. RRISA provides access to raw files, reduced data products, and cross-matched IGRINS targets with the SIMBAD, 2MASS, Gaia DR3, APOGEE2 DR17, and PASTEL catalogs. We also introduce version 3 of the IGRINS data reduction pipeline, IGRINS PLP v3, which implements an improved cosmic ray correction, pattern noise removal, and a new flexure correction that reduces telluric residuals. RRISA and supporting information can be found at http://igrinscontact.github.io.</description>

      <title>Investigating the metallicity dependence of the mass-loss rate relation of red supergiants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Red supergiants (RSGs) are cool and evolved massive stars exhibiting enhanced mass loss compared to their main sequence phase, affecting their evolution and fate. However, the theory of the wind-driving mechanism is not well-established and the metallicity dependence has not been determined. We aim to uniformly measure the mass-loss rates of large samples of RSGs in different galaxies with $-0.7\lesssim[Z]\lesssim0$ to investigate whether there is a potential correlation with metallicity. We collected photometry from the ultraviolet to the mid-infrared for all our RSG candidates to construct their spectral energy distribution (SED). Our final sample includes 893 RSG candidates in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), 396 in NGC 6822, 527 in the Milky Way, 1425 in M31, and 1854 in M33. Each SED was modelled using the radiative transfer code DUSTY under the same assumptions to derive the mass-loss rate. The mass-loss rates range from approximately $10^{-9} \ M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ to $10^{-5} \ M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ with an average value of $1.5\times10^{-7} \ M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. We provided a new mass-loss rate relation as a function of luminosity and effective temperature for both the SMC and Milky Way and compared our mass-loss rates with those derived in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). The turning point in the mass-loss rate vs. luminosity relation differs by around 0.2 dex between the LMC and SMC. The mass-loss rates of the Galactic RSGs at $\log(L/L_\odot)&lt;4.5$ were systematically lower than those determined in the other galaxies, possibly due to uncertainties in the interstellar extinction. We found 30-40% of the RSGs not to have any dust. The results for M31 and M33 are inconclusive because of source blending at distances above 0.5 Mpc given the resolution of Spitzer. Overall, we found similar mass-loss rates among the galaxies, indicating no strong correlation with metallicity.</description>

      <title>A new rotating black hole from the Newman-Janis algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new rotating black hole solution to the Einstein equations as an extension of the Kerr spacetime. To derive this solution, we use the Newman-Janis algorithm as a mathematical tool that reduces a general rotating metric into a tractable form by applying simple physical requirements. Interestingly, the solution we found may not be uniquely characterized by asymptotic parameters such as mass, angular momentum, and charge, thereby challenging the no-hair theorem. We also analyze in detail how this additional characteristics (``hair") affects the thermodynamic properties of the black hole.</description>

      <title>Is MOND necessarily nonlinear?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The iconic, deep-MOND-limit (DML) relation between acceleration and mass, $a\sim (M\mathcal{A}_0)^{1/2}/r$, implies that, in MOND, accelerations cannot be linear in the mass distribution ($\mathcal{A}_0\equiv Ga_0$ is the DML constant, and $a_0$ the MOND acceleration). This leads to important idiosyncracies of MOND, such as a breakdown of the strong equivalence principle, and the resulting ``external-field effect''. I show that the DML axioms are, in themselves, consistent with a, possibly unique, nonrelativistic, action-based, linear formulation of the DML. This model suffers from important drawbacks, which may make it unacceptable as a basis for a full-fledged MOND theory. The model is unique among MOND theories propounded to date not only in being linear -- hence not exhibiting an external-field effect, for example -- but in constituting a modification of both Newtonian inertia and Newtonian gravity. This linear and time-local model inspires and begets several, one-parameter families of models. One family employs nonlinear, time-nonlocal kinetic terms, but still linear gravitational-field equations. Other families generalize the DMLs of AQUAL and QUMOND, modifying gravity as well as inertia. All families employ fractional time derivatives and possibly fractional Laplacians. At present, I cannot base some acceptable MOND theory on these models -- for example, I cannot offer a sensible umbrella theory that interpolates between these DML models and Newtonian dynamics. They are, however, quite useful in elucidating various matter-of-principle aspects of MOND; e.g., they help to understand which predictions follow from only the basic tenets of MOND -- so-called primary predictions -- and which are secondary, i.e., theory dependent. The models may also show the way to a wider class of MOND theories. (Abridged.)</description>

      <title>GA-NIFS: High number of dual active galactic nuclei at z~3</title>

Abstract: Merger events can trigger gas accretion onto supermassive black holes (SMBHs) located at the centre of galaxies, and form close pairs of AGN. The fraction of AGN in pairs offers critical insights into the dynamics of galaxy interactions, SMBH growth, and their co-evolution with host galaxies. However, the identification of dual AGN is difficult, as it requires high-quality spatial and spectral data; hence, only very few pairs have been found in the distant Universe so far. This study aims to provide a first observational estimate of the fraction of dual AGN at 2&lt;z&lt;6 by analysing a sample of 16 AGN observed with JWST/NIRSpec IFS, as part of the GA-NIFS survey. For two AGN in our sample, we also incorporate archival VLT/MUSE data to expand the search area. We searched for nearby companion galaxies and emission-line sources within the ~20x20 kpc field of view of the NIRSpec data cubes, extending up to ~50 kpc using the MUSE data cubes. We analysed the spectra of such emitters to determine their physical and kinematic properties. We report the serendipitous discovery of a triple AGN and four dual AGN (two of which considered as candidates), with projected separations in the range 3-28 kpc. Their AGN classification is mainly based on standard optical emission line flux ratios, as observed with JWST/NIRSpec, and is complemented with additional multi-wavelength diagnostics. The identification of these 3-5 multiple AGN out of the 16 AGN systems in GA-NIFS (i.e. ~20-30%) suggests they might be more common than previously thought based on other observational campaigns. Moreover, our inferred fraction of dual AGN moderately exceeds predictions from cosmological simulations that mimic our observational criteria (~10%). This work highlights the exceptional capabilities of NIRSpec for detecting distant dual AGN, and prompts new investigations to constrain their fraction across cosmic time.</description>

      <title>Massive star cluster formation I. High star formation efficiency while resolving feedback of individual stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06509v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mode of star formation that results in the formation of globular clusters and young massive clusters is difficult to constrain through observations. We present models of massive star cluster formation using the Torch framework, which uses AMUSE to couple distinct multi-physics codes that handle star formation, stellar evolution and dynamics, radiative transfer, and magnetohydrodynamics. We upgrade Torch by implementing the N-body code PeTar, thereby enabling Torch to handle massive clusters forming from $10^6\rm\, M_\odot$ clouds with $\ge10^5$ individual stars. We present results from Torch simulations of star clusters forming from $10^4, 10^5$, and $10^6\rm M_\odot$ turbulent, spherical gas clouds (named M4, M5, M6) of radius $R=11.7$ pc. We find that star formation is highly efficient and becomes more so at higher cloud mass and surface density. For M4, M5, and M6 with initial surface densities $2.325\times 10^{1,2,3}\rm\, M_\odot\, pc^{-2}$, after a free-fall time of $t_{ff}=6.7,2.1,0.67$ Myr, we find that $\sim$30%, 40%, and 60% of the cloud mass has formed into stars, respectively. The final integrated star formation efficiency is 32%, 65%, and 85% for M4, M5, and M6. Observations of nearby clusters similar to M4 have similar integrated star formation efficiencies of $\leq$30%. The M5 and M6 models represent a different regime of cluster formation that is more appropriate for the conditions in starburst galaxies and gas-rich galaxies at high redshift, and that leads to a significantly higher efficiency of star formation. We argue that young massive clusters build up through short efficient bursts of star formation in regions that are sufficiently dense ($\ge 10^2 \rm\,M_\odot\,pc^{-2}$) and massive ($\ge10^5\rm\, M_\odot$). In such environments, the dynamical time of the cloud becomes short enough that stellar feedback cannot act quickly enough to slow star formation.</description>

      <title>Massive star cluster formation II. Runaway stars as fossils of sub-cluster mergers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12286v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two main mechanisms have classically been proposed for the formation of runaway stars. In the binary supernova scenario (BSS), a massive star in a binary explodes as a supernova, ejecting its companion. In the dynamical ejection scenario, a star is ejected during a strong dynamical encounter between multiple stars. We propose a third mechanism for the formation of runaway stars: the subcluster ejection scenario (SCES), where a subset of stars from an infalling subcluster is ejected out of the cluster via a tidal interaction with the contracting gravitational potential of the assembling cluster. We demonstrate the SCES in a star-by-star simulation of the formation of a young massive cluster from a $10^6\rm~M_\odot$ gas cloud using the Torch framework. This star cluster forms hierarchically through a sequence of subcluster mergers determined by the initial turbulent, spherical conditions of the gas. We find that these mergers drive the formation of runaway stars in our model. Late-forming subclusters fall into the central potential, where they are tidally disrupted, forming tidal tails of runaway stars that are distributed highly anisotropically. Runaways formed in the same SCES have similar ages, velocities, and ejection directions. Surveying observations, we identify several SCES candidate groups with anisotropic ejection directions. The SCES is capable of producing runaway binaries: two wide dynamical binaries in infalling subclusters were tightened through ejection. This allows for another velocity kick via subsequent via a subsequent BSS ejection. An SCES-BSS ejection is a possible avenue for the creation of hypervelocity stars unbound to the Galaxy. We expect nonspherical initial gas distributions to increase the number of calculated runaway stars. The observation of groups of runaway stars formed via the SCES can thus reveal the assembly history of their natal clusters.</description>

      <title>Orbits and vertical height distribution of 4006 open clusters in the Galactic disk using Gaia DR3</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15305v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Open clusters (OCs) in the Galaxy are excellent probes for tracing the structure and evolution of the Galactic disk. We present an updated catalog of parameters for 1,145 OCs, estimated using the Gaia DR3 data earlier listed in Cantat-Gaudin et al. (2020). This sample is complemented by 3,677 OCs from the catalog by Hunt &amp; Reffert (2023). Using the Galaxy potential and the space velocities, orbits of 4,006 OCs were computed. We provide a catalog with orbital parameters such as eccentricity, perigalactic and apogalactic distance, and the maximum vertical height traced by OCs from the Galactic disk. The OCs were found to be distributed between 5-16 kpc from the Galactic center, with older OCs showing a radially extended distribution. The low number of old OCs in the inner Solar circle region likely suggests their destruction in this area. We derive a quantitative expression for the dependency of the maximum vertical height (Z_max) OCs can reach with the cluster's age and Galactocentric radius for the first time. The young and intermediate-age OCs show similar values of Z_max till 9 kpc, with the latter group having higher values beyond. OCs older than 1 Gyr show larger values of Z_max at all Galactocentric radii and significantly larger values beyond 9 kpc. Higher values of Z_max are found in the third Galactic quadrant, suggesting a link between these higher values and the Galactic warp. This sample shows that young OCs are also involved in the diagonal ridge formation in the solar neighborhood.</description>

      <title>The period-luminosity relation of long-period variables in the Large Magellanic Cloud observed with ATLAS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16273v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Period-luminosity relations of long period variables (LPVs) are a powerful tool to map the distances of stars in our galaxy, and are typically calibrated using stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Recent results demonstrated that these relations show a strong dependence on the amplitude of the variability, which can be used to greatly improve distance estimates. However, one of the only highly sampled catalogs of such variables in the LMC is based on OGLE photometry, which does not provide all-sky coverage. Here, we provide the first measurement of the period-luminosity relation of long-period variables in the LMC using photometry from the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS). We derive conversions between ugriz, Gaia, and ATLAS c and o passbands with a precision of approximately 0.02 mag, which enable the measurement of reliable amplitudes with ATLAS for crowded fields. We successfully reproduce the known PL sequences A through E, and show evidence for sequence F using the ratios of amplitudes observed in both ATLAS pass-bands. Our work demonstrates that the ATLAS survey can recover variability in evolved red giants and lays the foundation for an all-sky distance map of the Milky Way using long-period variables.</description>

      <title>BASS XLV: Quantifying AGN Selection Effects in the Chandra COSMOS-Legacy Survey with BASS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16708v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep extragalactic X-ray surveys, such as the Chandra COSMOS-Legacy field (CCLS), are prone to be biased against active galactic nuclei (AGN) with high column densities due to their lower count rates at a given luminosity. To quantify this selection effect, we forward model nearby ($z\sim0.05$) AGN from the BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey (BASS) with well-characterized ($\gtrsim$1000 cts) broadband X-ray spectra (0.5-195 keV) to simulate the CCLS absorption distribution. We utilize the BASS low-redshift analogs with similar luminosities to the CCLS ($L_\mathrm{2-10\ keV}^\mathrm{int}\sim10^{42-45}\ \mathrm{erg}\ \mathrm{s}^{-1}$), which are much less affected by obscuration and low-count statistics, as the seed for our simulations, and follow the spectral fitting of the CCLS. Our simulations reveal that Chandra would fail to detect the majority (53.3%; 563/1056) of obscured ($N_\mathrm{H}&gt;10^{22}\ \mathrm{cm}^{-2}$) simulated BASS AGN given the observed redshift and luminosity distribution of the CCLS. Even for detected sources with sufficient counts ($\geq30$) for spectral modeling, the level of obscuration is significantly overestimated. This bias is most extreme for objects whose best fit indicates a high-column density AGN ($N_\mathrm{H}\geq10^{24}\ \mathrm{cm}^{-2}$), since the majority (66.7%; 18/27) of these are actually unobscured sources ($N_\mathrm{H}&lt;10^{22}\ \mathrm{cm}^{-2}$). This implies that previous studies may have significantly overestimated the increase in the obscured fraction with redshift and the fraction of luminous obscured AGN. Our findings highlight the importance of directly considering obscuration biases and forward modeling in X-ray surveys, as well as the need for higher-sensitivity X-ray missions such as the Advanced X-ray Imaging Satellite (AXIS), and the importance of multi-wavelength indicators to estimate obscuration in distant supermassive black holes.</description>

      <title>Neutron-capture Element Abundances of 491 Stars in Milky Way Dwarf Satellite Galaxies from Medium-Resolution Spectra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16447v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The chemical compositions of evolved stars in Local Group dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) provide insight into the galaxy's past star formation and nucleosynthesis. Neutron-capture element abundances are especially interesting. In particular, s-process elements can provide a third chemical clock for resolving star formation histories in addition to core collapse and Type Ia supernovae. Likewise, the primary sites of the r-process are still areas of extensive research. Until now, the number of stars with neutron-capture element abundances in dSphs has been limited by the need for stars bright enough for high-resolution spectroscopy. We present abundance measurements of the neutron-capture elements Sr, Y, Ba, and Eu with errors &lt; 0.4 dex - as well as new measurements of Mg - in 491 stars in Sculptor, Fornax, Draco, Sextans, and Ursa Minor. The large number of stars in our sample is possible because we used medium-resolution spectra from the DEIMOS spectrograph, assembling the largest homogeneous set of neutron-capture abundances in dwarf spheroidal galaxies to date. By utilizing the abundances of both s- and r-process elements, we find evidence of an s-process contribution at early times in Sculptor from our measurements of [Ba/Fe]. This is a potential signature of s-process nucleosynthesis in fast-rotating massive stars. By comparing our measurements of [Eu/Fe] with [Mg/Fe], we show the need for an r-process source that has a short delay time to enrich stars in the dSphs. Thus, neutron star mergers are likely not the sole source of r-process material in dSphs.</description>

Abstract: The characteristic timescale ($\tau$) of continuum variability of the accretion disk in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) is known to be related to the thermal timescale, which is predicted to scale with AGN luminosity ($L$) and restframe wavelength ($\lambda_{\rm RF}$) as $t_{\rm th} \propto L^{0.5} \lambda_{\rm RF}^2$ in the standard disk model. Using multi-epoch spectroscopic data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Reverberation Mapping project, we construct ultraviolet ensemble structure functions of luminous AGNs as a function of their luminosity and wavelength. Assuming that AGNs exhibit a single universal structure function when $\Delta t$ is normalized by $\tau$, wherein $\tau \propto L^{a} \lambda_{\rm RF}^{b}$, we find $a=0.50\pm0.03$ and $b=1.42\pm0.09$. While the value of $a$ aligns with the prediction from the standard disk model, $b$ is significantly smaller than expected, suggesting that the radial temperature (color) profile of the accretion disk is significantly steeper (shallower) than the standard disk model. Notably, this discrepancy with theory has been observed in previous studies based on spectroscopic reverberation mapping and gravitational microlensing. Although no current model of accretion disks fully matches our results, our findings provide valuable constraints for testing future physical models.</description>

      <title>Introducing the THESAN-ZOOM project: radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of high-redshift galaxies with a multi-phase interstellar medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20437v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the THESAN-ZOOM project, a comprehensive suite of high-resolution zoom-in simulations of $14$ high-redshift ($z&gt;3$) galaxies selected from the THESAN simulation volume. This sample encompasses a diverse range of halo masses, with $M_\mathrm{halo} \approx 10^8 - 10^{13}~\mathrm{M}_\odot$ at $z=3$. At the highest-resolution, the simulations achieve a baryonic mass of $142~\mathrm{M}_\odot$ and a gravitational softening length of $17~\mathrm{cpc}$. We employ a state-of-the-art multi-phase interstellar medium (ISM) model that self-consistently includes stellar feedback, radiation fields, dust physics, and low-temperature cooling through a non-equilibrium thermochemical network. Our unique framework incorporates the impact of patchy reionization by adopting the large-scale radiation field topology from the parent THESAN simulation box rather than assuming a spatially uniform UV background. In total, THESAN-ZOOM comprises $60$ simulations, including both fiducial runs and complementary variations designed to investigate the impact of numerical and physical parameters on galaxy properties. The fiducial simulation set reproduces a wealth of high-redshift observational data such as the stellar-to-halo-mass relation, the star-forming main sequence, the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation, and the mass-metallicity relation. While our simulations slightly overestimate the abundance of low-mass and low-luminosity galaxies they agree well with observed stellar and UV luminosity functions at the higher mass end. Moreover, the star-formation rate density closely matches the observational estimates from $z=3-14$. These results indicate that the simulations effectively reproduce many of the essential characteristics of high-redshift galaxies, providing a realistic framework to interpret the exciting new observations from JWST.</description>

      <title>Identification of a turnover in the initial mass function of a young stellar cluster down to 0.5 M$_{J}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04624v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A successful theory of star formation should predict the number of objects as a function of their mass produced through star-forming events. Previous studies in star-forming regions and the solar neighborhood identify a mass function increasing from the hydrogen-burning limit down to about 10 M$_{J}$. Theory predicts a limit to the fragmentation process, providing a natural turnover in the mass function down to the opacity limit of turbulent fragmentation thought to be near 1-10 M$_{J}$. Programs to date have not been sensitive enough to probe the hypothesized opacity limit of fragmentation. We present the first identification of a turnover in the initial mass function below 12 M$_{J}$ within NGC 2024, a young star-forming region. With JWST/NIRCam deep exposures across 0.7-5 $\mu$m, we identified several free floating objects down to roughly 3 M$_{J}$ with sensitivity to 0.5 M$_{J}$. We present evidence for a double power law model increasing from about 60 M$_{J}$ to roughly 12 M$_{J}$, consistent with previous studies, followed by a decrease down to 0.5 M$_{J}$. Our results support the predictions of star and brown dwarf formation theory, identifying the theoretical turnover in the mass function and suggest the fundamental limit of turbulent fragmentation near 3 M$_{J}$.</description>

      <title>SIROCCO: A Publicly Available Monte Carlo Ionization and Radiative Transfer Code for Astrophysical Outflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19908v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Outflows are critical components of many astrophysical systems, including accreting compact binaries and active galactic nuclei (AGN). These outflows can significantly affect a system's evolution and alter its observational appearance by reprocessing the radiation produced by the central engine. Sirocco (Simulating Ionization and Radiation in Outflows Created by Compact Objects - or "the code formerly known as Python") is a Sobolev-based Monte Carlo ionization and radiative transfer code. It is designed to simulate the spectra produced by any system with an azimuthally-symmetric outflow, from spherical stellar winds to rotating, biconical accretion disc winds. Wind models can either be parametrized or imported, e.g. from hydrodynamical simulations. The radiation sources include an optically thick accretion disc and various central sources with flexible spectra and geometries. The code tracks the "photon packets" produced by the sources in any given simulation as they traverse and interact with the wind. The code assumes radiative near-equilibrium, so the thermal and ionization state can be determined iteratively from these interactions. Once the physical properties in the wind have converged, Sirocco can be used to generate synthetic spectra at a series of observer sightlines. Here, we describe the physical assumptions, operation, performance and limitations of the code. We validate it against tardis, cmfgen and cloudy, finding good agreement, and present illustrative synthetic spectra from disc winds in cataclysmic variables, tidal disruption events, AGN and X-ray binaries. Sirocco is publicly available on GitHub, alongside its associated data, documentation and sample input files covering a wide range of astrophysical applications.</description>

      <title>The Lense-Thirring effect at work in M87$^\ast$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08686v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, the temporal evolution of the angles characterizing the spatial configuration of the jet in the supermassive black hole M87$^\ast$ was measured exhibiting a precessional pattern around the hole's spin axis. It would be due to the dragging induced by the fact that the hole's external spacetime is described by the Kerr metric. Here, it is shown that the Lense-Thirring orbital precessions of a test particle moving about a rotating massive object, calculated perturbatively to the first post-Newtonian order, are able to fully reproduce all the measured features of the jet axis of M87$^\ast$. In particular, by assuming that the latter is aligned with the angular momentum of the accretion disk, modelled as an effective particle moving along a circular orbit, the condition that the absolute value of the predicted Lense-Thirring precessional frequency of the disk agrees with the measured value of $0.56\pm 0.02$ radians per year of the jet's one is satisfied for a range of physically meaningful values of the hole's spin parameter, close to unity, and of the effective disk radius, of the order of just over a dozen gravitational radii. Relying upon such assumptions and results, it is possible to predict that the angle between the hole's spin axis and the jet's one stays constant over the years amounting to $1.16^\circ$, in agreement with its measured value of $1.25^\circ\pm 0.18^\circ$. Furthermore, also the temporal pattern and the amplitudes of the time series of the jet's angles are reproduced by the aforementioned Lense-Thirring precessional model.</description>

      <title>Lost in the FoG: Pitfalls of Models for Large-Scale Hydrogen Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01956v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large-scale HI surveys and their cross-correlations with galaxy distributions have immense potential as cosmological probes. Interpreting these measurements requires theoretical models that must incorporate redshift-space distortions (RSDs), such as the Kaiser and fingers-of-God (FoG) effect, and differences in the tracer and matter distributions via the tracer bias. These effects are commonly approximated with assumptions that should be tested on simulated distributions. In this work, we use the hydrodynamical simulation suite IllustrisTNG to assess the performance of models of $z \leq 1$ HI auto and HI-galaxy cross-power spectra, finding that the models employed by recent observations introduce errors comparable to or exceeding their measurement uncertainties. In particular, neglecting FoG causes $\gtrsim 10\%$ deviations between the modeled and simulated power spectra at $k \gtrsim 0.1$ $h$ / Mpc, larger than assuming a constant bias which reaches the same error threshold at slightly smaller scales. However, even without these assumptions, models can still err by $\sim 10\%$ on relevant scales. These remaining errors arise from multiple RSD damping sources on HI clustering, which are not sufficiently described with a single FoG term. Overall, our results highlight the need for an improved understanding of RSDs to harness the capabilities of future measurements of HI distributions.</description>

      <title>Computing Anharmonic Infrared Spectra of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons Using Machine-Learning Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05120v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are key contributors to interstellar aromatic infrared (IR) bands. However, current spectral databases for IR emission analysis are limited by the omission of vibrational anharmonicity and temperature effects, primarily because of the high computational cost of conventional quantum chemical calculations (QCCs). In this work, we present a machine learning-based molecular dynamics (MLMD) approach that efficiently computes anharmonic IR spectra while incorporating temperature effects. MLMD achieves predictive accuracy comparable to that of QCCs but with significantly reduced computational cost, scaling linearly with the number of atoms in the system. We applied MLMD to calculate the anharmonic spectra of 1704 PAHs in the NASA Ames PAH IR Spectroscopic Database with up to 216 carbon atoms, demonstrating its capability for high-throughput spectral calculations of large molecular systems. Our results highlight MLMD's potential to enable the development of extensive molecular spectral datasets, enhancing data-driven analyses of astronomical IR spectra, particularly in anticipation of upcoming data from the James Webb Space Telescope.</description>
