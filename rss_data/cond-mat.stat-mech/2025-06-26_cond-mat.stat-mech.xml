      <title>Zero Temperature Dynamics of Ising Systems on Hypercubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the zero-temperature Glauber dynamics of homogeneous Ising ferromagnets on hypercubes, as their dimension d varies. We investigate the asymptotic (d goes to infinity and time t goes to infinity) behavior of various quantities on hypercubes, such as the final magnetization, the probability for the system to enter a ground state, etc. Our numerical studies are carried out using a uniformly random initial state but with the constraint that the initial magnetization is zero. The final states can be divided into three categories: ground states, frozen states, and blinker states. We use the notion of a k-core to describe the geometry of the frozen states and give an exponential lower bound for the number of frozen states in terms of d. Blinker states -- which exist only in even d -- are final states containing at least one blinker (a permanently flipping spin). Blinker states can have rich local structures; we give explicit constructions for configurations that contain blinkers and prove that the lowest possible dimension for blinker configurations is d = 8. We also study the 'Nature vs. Nurture' problem on hypercubes, asking how much the final state depends on the information contained in the initial configuration, and how much depends on the realization of the dynamical evolution. Finally, we provide several conjectures and suggest some open problems based on the numerical results.</description>

      <title>Lack-of-fit reduction in the path-integral formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a reformulation of the lack-of-fit reduction in non-equilibrium thermodynamics using the path-integral formalism. The reformulation is based on the Onsager-Machlup variational principle, and it allows us to minimize the action while keeping only thermodynamically relevant solutions. The reduced evolution consists of a Hamiltonian vector field and a gradient flow. The reformulation is illustrated on the Kac-Zwanzig model, where we show how irreversibility emerges from purely Hamiltonian evolution by ignoring some degrees of freedom. We also show how to generalize the Fisher information matrix and Kullback-Leibler divergence between two probability distributions to the case when the two distributions are related by the principle of maximum entropy, even in the case when the entropy is not of Boltzmann-Gibbs type (for instance Tsallis-Havrda-Charvat).</description>

      <title>Beyond Constant-Temperature Reservoirs: A Stirling Cycle with Constant Heat-Generation Rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional heat-engine models typically assume two heat reservoirs at fixed temperatures. In contrast, radioisotope power systems introduce a fundamentally different paradigm in which the hot sources supply heat at a constant generation rate rather than maintaining a constant temperature. We develop a theoretical framework for finite-time heat engines operating between constant heat-generation-rate hot sources and constant-temperature cold reservoirs. A universal proportion between average output power and efficiency is established, independent of the specific cycle configuration or working substance. As a representative case, we analyze a finite-time Stirling cycle employing a tailored control protocol that maintains the working substance at constant temperatures during the quasi-isothermal processes. An intrinsic oscillatory behavior emerges in the temperature dynamics of the hot source, reflecting the interplay between heat accumulation and release. We further quantify the long-term decline in engine performance resulting from radioactive decay and demonstrate its impact over the system's operational lifespan. This work establishes a new theoretical prototype for heat engines and shall provide guidings for the analysis and design of radioisotope power systems.</description>

      <title>Depinning and activated motion of chiral self-propelled robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study experimentally, numerically and analytically, the dynamics of a chiral active particle (cm-sized robots), pulled at a constant translational velocity. We show that the system can be mapped to a Brownian particle driven across a periodic potential landscape, and thus exhibits a rotational depinning transition in the noiseless limit, giving rise to a creep regime in the presence of rotational diffusion. We show that a simple model of chiral, self-aligning, active particles accurately describes such dynamics. The steady-state distribution and escape times from local potential barriers, corresponding to long-lived orientations of the particles, can be computed exactly within the model and is in excellent agreement with both experiments and particle-based simulations, with no fitting parameters. Our work thus consolidates such self-propelled robots as a model system for the study of chiral active matter, and highlights the interesting dynamics arising from the interplay between external and internal driving forces in the presence of a self-aligning torque.</description>

      <title>Topological Phase Transition under Infinite Randomness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In clean and weakly disordered systems, topological and trivial phases having a finite bulk energy gap can transit to each other via a quantum critical point. In presence of strong disorder, both the nature of the phases and the associated criticality can fundamentally change. Here we investigate topological properties of a strongly disordered fermionic chain where the bond couplings are drawn from normal probability distributions which are defined by characteristic standard deviations. Using numerical strong disorder renormalization group methods along with analytical techniques, we show that the competition between fluctuation scales renders both the trivial and topological phases gapless with Griffiths like rare regions. Moreover, the transition between these phases is solely governed by the fluctuation scales, rather than the means, rendering the critical behavior to be determined by an infinite randomness fixed point with an irrational central charge. Our work points to a host of novel topological phases and atypical topological phase transitions which can be realized in systems under strong disorder.</description>

      <title>Nonabelian ferromagnets with three-body interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the thermodynamics of nonabelian ferromagnets consisting of atoms in the fundamental representation of $SU(N)$ and interacting with two-body and three-body interactions. An intricate phase structure emerges, depending on the relative strength and sign of the two-body and three-body coupling constants. In the case where two-body interactions are ferromagnetic and three-body ones are antiferromagnetic, we uncover a rich cascade of phase transitions, the appearance of phases with two distinct polarization directions being the most striking novel feature. Our results are relevant to magnetic systems where higher-body interactions cannot be neglected.</description>

      <title>Slip-flow theory for thermo-osmosis based on a kinetic model with near-wall potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, thermal-slip coefficients in slip boundary conditions of the Stokes equation are derived using the generalized slip-flow theory, with special interest in the role of near-wall potential in micro- and nanoscale flows. As the model of fluids and fluid-solid interaction, we employ the model Boltzmann equation for dilute gases and the diffuse-reflection boundaries with near-wall potential, respectively. It is found that, when the mean free path of gas molecules and the effective range of potential are of the same order of magnitude, the thermal-slip boundary condition can be derived in the near-continuum limit. In the derived slip-flow theory, the thermal-slip coefficient and the boundary-layer corrections (i.e., Knudsen-layer corrections) are determined by solving the kinetic boundary-layer problems (i.e., Knudsen-layer problems) that include external-force terms and inhomogeneous terms both driven by the potential. As the application of the slip-flow theory, thermo-osmosis between two parallel plates with uniform temperature gradients is analyzed. The results of the slip-flow theory are validated by comparing them with those of the direct numerical analysis of the same problem. Furthermore, it is found that thermo-osmosis and thermal slip on the plates are significantly affected by the features of the near-wall potential; even the gas-flow direction can be reversed when the near-wall potential is repulsive. Such a flow reversal is qualitatively similar to thermo-osmosis in liquids reported in existing molecular dynamics simulation.</description>

      <title>Shape-determined kinetic pathways in two-dimensional solid-solid phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solid-solid phase transitions are ubiquitous in nature, but the kinetic pathway of anisotropic particle systems remains elusive, where the coupling between translational and rotational motions plays a critical role in various kinetic processes. Here we investigate this problem by molecular dynamics simulation for two-dimensional ball-stick polygon systems, where pentagon, hexagon, and octagon systems all undergo an isostructural solid-solid phase transition. During heating, the translational motion exhibits merely a homogeneous expansion, whereas the time evolution of body-orientation is shape-determined. The local defects of body-orientation self-organize into a vague stripe for pentagon, a random pattern for hexagon, while a distinct stripe for octagon. The underlying kinetic pathway of octagon satisfies the quasi-equilibrium assumption, while that of hexagon and pentagon is dominated by translational motion and by rotational motion, respectively. This diversity is originated from different kinetic coupling modes determined by the anisotropy of molecules, and can affect the phase transition rates. The reverse process in terms of cooling follows the same mechanism, but the kinetic pathways are more diverse attributed to the possible kinetic traps. Our findings not only promote the theoretical understanding of microscopic kinetics of solid-solid phase transitions but also provide direct guidance for the rational design of materials utilizing desired kinetic features.</description>

      <title>Comparison between Causal and Acausal Diffusion: a Schwinger-Keldysh Effective Field Theory Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Fick's time-honored theory of diffusion, the system responds instantaneously to external perturbations, resulting in acausal behavior. Maxwell-Cattaneo theory addresses this issue by introducing a relaxation time, rendering the diffusion process causal. We focus on systems where this relaxation time is comparable to the diffusion time and significantly larger than the relaxation times of all other non-conserved operators. In such systems, late-time diffusion is influenced by this relaxation process, leading to a theory of quasi-diffusion. Using the Schwinger-Keldysh Effective Field Theory (SK-EFT) framework, we compare the theories of diffusion and quasi-diffusion by analyzing the real-time dynamics of correlation functions both in linear response and at one-loop order. In particular, we show that the one-loop corrections in the causal (quasi-diffusion) theory, in both the underdamped and the overdamped cases, are governed by two universal functions. In the overdamped case, the behavior mirrors that of the acausal (diffusion) theory, which has recently been applied for precision tests of SK-EFT in diffusive systems. We suggest that our results in the underdamped limit can also be used for precision tests in quasi-diffusive systems.</description>

      <title>Two-Loop Turbulent Helical Magnetohydrodynamics: Large-Scale Dynamo and Energy Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a two-loop field-theoretic analysis of incompressible helical magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) in fully developed stationary turbulence. A key feature of helical MHD is the appearance of an infrared-unstable ``mass-like'' term in the loop diagrams of the magnetic response function. Physically, this term corresponds to the relevant perturbation of the Joule damping, proportional to $\boldsymbol{\nabla} \times \boldsymbol{b}$ ($\boldsymbol{b} =$ magnetic field). Its presence destabilizes the trivial ground state $\langle \boldsymbol{b} \rangle = 0$ and forces us to look for a mechanism for stabilizing the system. We show that such stabilization can be achieved in two ways: (i) by introducing into induction equation an external mass-like parameter that precisely cancels these dangerous loop corrections (kinematic regime), or (ii) via spontaneous breaking of the rotational symmetry, leading to a new ground state with nonzero large-scale magnetic field (turbulent dynamo regime). For the latter case, we study the two-loop correction to the spontaneously generated magnetic field and demonstrate that Goldstone-like corrections to Alfv\'en modes along with some other anisotropic structures arise. Our results also confirm that the emergent mean magnetic field leads to a steeper slope of the magnetic energy spectrum, $-11/3 + 2\gamma_{b\star}$ (with $\gamma_{b\star} = -0.1039 - 0.4202\rho^2$, for $|\rho| \leqslant 1$ as the degree of helicity), compared to the Kolmogorov velocity spectrum of $-11/3$, thereby breaking equipartition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ a novel hydrodynamic framework for active matter coupled to an environment to study the local temperature of an active nematic, assuming proximity to thermal equilibrium. We show that, due to the mechanosensitivity of fuel consumption, linearized temperature correlations in a homogeneous active nematic steady state remain unaffected by activity. However, we demonstrate that local shearing and twisting cause a confined active nematic undergoing a spontaneous flow transition to develop a distinctive inhomogeneous temperature profile, serving as a thermal signature of activity.</description>

      <title>Memory-induced long-range order in dynamical systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06834v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time non-locality, or memory, is a non-equilibrium property shared by all physical systems. Here, we show that memory is sufficient to induce a phase of spatial long-range order (LRO) even if the system's primary dynamical variables are coupled locally. This occurs when the memory degrees of freedom have slower dynamics than the primary degrees of freedom. In addition, such an LRO phase is non-perturbative, and can be understood through the lens of a correlated percolation transition of the fast degrees of freedom mediated by memory. When the two degrees of freedom have comparable time scales, the length of the effective long-range interaction shortens. We exemplify this behavior with a model of locally coupled spins and a single dynamic memory variable, but our analysis is sufficiently general to suggest that memory could induce a phase of LRO in a much wider variety of physical systems.</description>

      <title>Non-Stationary Critical Phenomena: Expanding The Critical Point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15627v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A prototypical model of symmetry-broken active matter -- biased quorum-sensing active particles (bQSAPs) -- is used to extend notions of dynamic critical phenomena to the paradigmatic setting of driven transport, where characteristic behaviours are nonstationary and involve persistent fluxes. To do so, we construct an effective field theory with a single order-parameter -- a nonstationary analogue of active Model B -- that reflects the fact that different properties of bQSAPs can only be interpreted in terms of passive thermodynamics in appropriately chosen inertial frames. This codifies the movement of phase boundaries due to nonequilibrium fluxes between coexisting bulk phases in terms of a difference in effective chemical potentials and therefore an {\it unequal} tangent construction on a bulk free energy density. The result is both an anomalous form of coarsening and, more generally, an exotic phase structure; binodals are permitted to cross spinodal lines so that criticality is no longer constrained to a single point. Instead, criticality, with exponents that are seemingly unchanged from symmetric QSAPs, is shown to exist along a line that marks the entry to an otherwise forbidden region of phase space. The interior of this region is not critical in the conventional sense, but retains certain features of criticality, which we term pseudo-critical. Whilst an inability to satisfy a Ginzburg criterion implies that fluctuations remain relevant at macroscopic scales, finite-wavenumber fluctuations grow at finite rates and exhibit non-trivial dispersion relations. The interplay between the growth of fluctuations and the speed at which they move relative to the bulk results in distinct regimes of micro- and meso-phase separation.</description>

      <title>Global thermodynamics for isothermal fluids under gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19643v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a formulation of global thermodynamics for equilibrium systems under the influence of gravity. The free energy for simple fluids is extended to include a dependence on $(T, V, N, mgL)$, where $L$ represents the vertical system length in the direction of gravity. A central idea in this formulation is to uniquely fix the reference point of the gravitational potential, ensuring a consistent thermodynamic framework. Using this framework, we derive the probability density of thermodynamic quantities, which allows us to define a variational function for determining equilibrium liquid-gas coexistence under gravity. The resulting free energy landscape, derived from the variational function, reveals the local stability of liquid-gas configurations. Specifically, the liquid phase resides at the lower portion of the system due to gravity, while the inverted configuration (with liquid on top) is also locally stable in this landscape. Furthermore, we characterize the transition between these liquid-gas configurations as a first-order phase transition using the thermodynamic free energy of $(T,V,N,mgL)$. Finally, we validate the predictions of global thermodynamics through molecular dynamics simulations, demonstrating the applicability and accuracy of the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>Measurement-Induced Phase Transition in State Estimation of Chaotic Systems and the Directed Polymer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00547v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a solvable model of a measurement-induced phase transition (MIPT) in a deterministic but chaotic dynamical system with a positive Lyapunov exponent. In this setup, an observer only has a probabilistic description of the system but mitigates chaos-induced uncertainty through repeated measurements. Using a minimal representation via a branching tree, we map this problem to the directed polymer (DP) model on the Cayley tree, although in a regime dominated by rare events. By studying the Shannon entropy of the probability distribution estimated by the observer, we demonstrate a phase transition distinguishing a chaotic phase with reduced Lyapunov exponent from a strong-measurement phase where uncertainty remains bounded. Remarkably, the location of the MIPT transition coincides with the freezing transition of the DP, although the critical properties differ. We provide an exact, universal scaling function describing the entropy growth in the critical regime. Numerical simulations confirm our theoretical predictions, highlighting a simple yet powerful framework to explore measurement-induced transitions in classical chaotic systems.</description>

      <title>Effective and asymptotic scaling in a one-dimensional billiard problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20476v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The emergence of power laws that govern the large-time dynamics of a one-dimensional billiard of $N$ point particles is analysed. In the initial state, the resting particles are placed in the positive half-line $x\geqslant 0$ at equal distances. Their masses alternate between two distinct values. The dynamics is initialized by giving the leftmost particle a positive velocity. Due to elastic inter-particle collisions, the whole system gradually comes into motion, filling both right-hand and left-hand half-lines. As shown by [Chakraborti S., Dhar A., Krapivsky P., SciPost Phys., 2022, 13, 074], an inherent feature of such a billiard is the emergence of two different modes: the shock wave that propagates in $x\geqslant 0$ and the splash region in $x&lt;0$. Moreover, the behaviour of the relevant observables is characterized by universal asymptotic power-law dependencies. In view of the finite size of the system and of finite observation times, these dependencies only start to acquire a universal character. To analyse them, we set up molecular dynamics simulations using the concept of effective scaling exponents, familiar in the theory of continuous phase transitions. We present results for the effective exponents that govern the large-time behaviour of the shock-wave front, the number of collisions, the energies and momentum of different modes and analyse their tendency to approach corresponding universal values.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic interpretation to Stochastic Fisher Information and Single-Trajectory Speed Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20890v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Fisher information (FI) metric is a Riemannian metric that allows a geometric treatment of stochastic thermodynamics, introducing the possibility of computing thermodynamic lengths and deviations from equilibrium. At the trajectory level, a related quantity can be introduced, the stochastic Fisher information (SFI), which on average, is equivalent to the FI. In this work, we discuss two fundamental questions regarding the SFI; namely, (i) what is the thermodynamic interpretation to the SFI, and (ii) are there any trajectory-level thermodynamic bounds . We find that, contrary to previous results in the literature for the FI, the thermodynamic interpretation of the SFI depends only on the entropy produced by the system and on the thermodynamic force. Moreover, we find that the SFI allows one to derive single-trajectory speed limits, which we demonstrate to hold for a Brownian particle under a saturating drive force and a Brownian particle under a decreasing drive force. From the ensemble of single-trajectory bounds, one can derive a hierarchy of average speed limits that are always less tight than the one derived from the FI. We test our results for speed limits on the adopted models and find that the hierarchy of average speed limits is respected and that the single-trajectory speed limits behave qualitatively similar to the average and stochastic speed limits, with some trajectories achieving velocities higher than the tightest average bound whenever it does not saturate. Our results open avenues for the exploration of uncertainty relations at the trajectory level.</description>

Abstract: The consistent description of kinetic and hydrodynamic processes is applied to the study of ion transport processes in the ionic solution-porous medium system. A system of equations is obtained for the nonequilibrium single-ion distribution function, the nonequilibrium average value of the energy density of the interaction of solution ions, and the nonequilibrium average value of the number density of particles in a porous medium. Using the fractional calculus technique, a generalized diffusion equation of the Cattaneo type in fractional derivatives is obtained to describe the processes of subdiffusion of particles in a porous medium.</description>

      <title>Microcanonical simulated annealing: Massively parallel Monte Carlo simulations with sporadic random-number generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16240v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerical simulations of models and theories that describe complex experimental systems $\unicode{x2014}$in fields like high-energy and condensed-matter physics$\unicode{x2014}$ are becoming increasingly important. Examples include lattice gauge theories, which can describe, among others, quantum chromodynamics (the Standard Model description of strong interactions between elementary particles), and spin-glass systems. Beyond fundamental research, these computational methods also find practical applications, among many others, in optimization, finance, and complex biological problems. However, Monte Carlo simulations, an important subcategory of these methods, are plagued by a major drawback: they are extremely greedy for (pseudo) random numbers. The total fraction of computer time dedicated to random-number generation increases as the hardware grows more sophisticated, and can get prohibitive for special-purpose computing platforms. We propose here a general-purpose microcanonical simulated annealing (MicSA) formalism that dramatically reduces such a burden. The algorithm is fully adapted to a massively parallel computation, as we show in the particularly demanding benchmark of the three-dimensional Ising spin glass. We carry out very stringent numerical tests of the new algorithm by comparing our results, obtained on GPUs, with high-precision standard (i.e., random-number-greedy) simulations performed on the Janus II custom-built supercomputer. In those cases where thermal equilibrium is reachable (i.e., in the paramagnetic phase), both simulations reach compatible values. More significantly, barring short-time corrections, a simple time rescaling suffices to map the MicSA off-equilibrium dynamics onto the results obtained with standard simulations.</description>

      <title>Method of canonical transformations in the theory of quantum gases interacting with radiation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16439v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An approach to the theoretical study of effects and phenomena in quantum gases interacting with radiation is proposed. The approach is based on a modification of the canonical transformation method, which was once used to diagonalize Hamiltonians describing the interaction of electrons with phonons in a solid. The capabilities of the method are demonstrated by studying the influence of photons on the spectral characteristics of atoms of quantum gases interacting with radiation. Within the framework of the developed approach, the effect of "dressing" atoms of quantum gases by a cloud of virtual photons is investigated and expressions for the energy characteristics of such dressed atoms - quasiparticles are obtained. The problem of defining the concept of the effective mass of such quasiparticles is discussed.</description>

      <title>Resonances of recurrence time of monitored quantum walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19832v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recurrence time is the time a process first returns to its initial state. Using quantum walks on a graph, the recurrence time is defined through stroboscopic monitoring of the arrival of the particle to a node of the system. When the time interval between repeated measurements is tuned in such a way that eigenvalues of the unitary become degenerate, the mean recurrence time exhibits resonances. These resonances imply faster mean recurrence times, which were recorded on quantum computers. The resonance broadening is captured by a restart uncertainty relation [R. Yin, Q. Wang, S. Tornow, E. Barkai, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 122, e2402912121 (2025)]. To ensure a comprehensive analysis, we extend our investigation to include the impact of system size on the widened resonances, showing how the connectivity and energy spectrum structure of a system influence the restart uncertainty relation. Breaking the symmetry of the system, for example time-reversal symmetry breaking with a magnetic flux applied to a ring, removes the degeneracy of the eigenvalues of the unitary, hence modifying the mean recurrence time and the widening of the transitions, and this effect is studied in detail. The width of resonances studied here is related to the finite time resolution of relevant experiments on quantum computers, and to the restart paradigm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02984v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently multiple families of spin chain models were found, which have a free fermionic spectrum,even though they are not solvable by a Jordan-Wigner transformation. Instead, the free fermions emerge as a result of a rather intricate construction. In this work we consider the quantum circuit formulation of the problem. We construct circuits using local unitary gates built from the terms in the local Hamiltonians of the respective models, and ask the question: which circuit geometries (sequence of gates) lead to a free fermionic spectrum? Our main example is the 4-fermion model of Fendley, where we construct free fermionic circuits with various geometries. In certain cases we prove the free fermionic nature, while for other geometries we confirm it numerically. Surprisingly, we find that many standard brickwork circuits are not free fermionic, but we identify certain symmetric constructions which are. We also consider a recent generalization of the 4-fermion model and obtain the factorization of its transfer matrix, and subsequently derive a free-fermionic circuit for this case as well.</description>

      <title>Characterizing phase transitions and criticality in non-Hermitian extensions of the XY model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13654v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we study non-Hermitian extensions of the paradigmatic spin-1/2 XY chain in a magnetic field. Using the mapping of the model to free fermion form, we provide analytical insights into the energy spectrum of the non-Hermitian model and establish an intrinsic connection between the quasienergies and topological invariants. We also use exact diagonalization as a supplementary method to examine the performance of biorthogonal-based expectation values. Our results confirm that the theoretical analysis is consistent with the numerical results, with the extended phase diagram determined via the analytical solution and the critical behavior of the fidelity and entanglement. The entanglement transition goes hand in hand with the non-Hermitian topological phase transition. Like the Hermitian case, we analyze the critical behavior using finite-size scaling. Our results show that non-Hermiticity can induce the system into a new universality class with unusual critical exponent. We also emphasize the ability of the Loschmidt echo to characterize potential phase transitions and introduce the average of the Loschmidt echo to describe phase transitions in non-Hermitian systems.</description>

To test its validity, we apply the derived formula to the disordered Wilson-Dirac model and analyze its ability to capture topological properties in the presence of disorder. Our results demonstrate that the real-space approach provides a viable method for characterizing higher-dimensional topological phases beyond momentum-space formulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20083v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unknown node attributes in complex networks may introduce community structures that are important to distinguish from those driven by known attributes. We propose a block-corrected modularity that discounts given block structures present in the network to reveal communities masked by them. We show analytically how the proposed modularity finds the community structure driven by an unknown attribute in a simple network model. Further, we observe that the block-corrected modularity finds the underlying community structure on a number of simple synthetic network models while methods using different null models fail. We develop an efficient spectral method as well as two Louvain-inspired fine-tuning algorithms to maximize the proposed modularity and demonstrate their performance on several synthetic network models. Finally, we assess our methodology on various real-world citation networks built using the OpenAlex data by correcting for the temporal citation patterns.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21611v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $O(N)$ Non-Linear Sigma Model (NLSM) in $d=2+\epsilon$ has long been conjectured to describe the same conformal field theory (CFT) as the Wilson-Fisher (WF) $O(N)$ fixed point obtained from the $\lambda(\phi^2)^2$ model in $d=4-\epsilon$. In this work, we put this conjecture into question, building on the recent observation [Jones (2024)] that the NLSM CFT possesses a protected operator with dimension $N-1$, which is instead absent in the WF $O(N)$ CFT. We investigate the possibility of lifting this operator via multiplet recombination - the only known mechanism that could resolve this mismatch while preserving a connection between the two theories. We also explore an alternative scenario in which the NLSM $O(N)$ fixed point in $d=2+\epsilon$ is not continuously connected to the WF $O(N)$ CFT, and instead corresponds to a different universality class. For $N=3$, this could be related to the hedgehog-suppressed critical point, which describes the N\'eel-VBS phase transition in 3D.</description>

      <title>Adaptive quantum dynamics with the time-dependent variational Monte Carlo method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08575v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce an extension of the time-dependent variational Monte Carlo (tVMC) method that adaptively controls the expressivity of the variational quantum state during the simulation. This adaptive tVMC approach addresses numerical instabilities that arise when the variational ansatz is overparameterized or contains redundant degrees of freedom. Building on the concept of the local-in-time error (LITE), a measure of the deviation between variational and exact evolution, we introduce a procedure to quantify each parameter's contribution to reducing the LITE, using only quantities already computed in standard tVMC simulations. These relevance estimates guide the selective evolution of only the most significant parameters at each time step, while maintaining a prescribed level of accuracy. We benchmark the algorithm on quantum quenches in the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model using both spin-Jastrow and restricted Boltzmann machine wave functions, with an emphasis on overparameterized regimes. The adaptive scheme significantly improves numerical stability and reduces the need for strong regularization, enabling reliable simulations with highly expressive variational ans\"atze.</description>

Abstract: From a given Fokker-Planck equation, a multi-parameter deformed partner Fokker-Planck equation is constructed. This is done by first deleting a set of eigenstates of the original FPE by the multi-step Darboux-Crum transformation, and then reinstating the eigen-energy levels by the reverse Darboux-Crum transformation. Extension to fractional Fokker-Planck equation is briefly discussed. A recent study of the one-parameter isospectral FPE applied to black hole in the thermal potential approach is commented.</description>
