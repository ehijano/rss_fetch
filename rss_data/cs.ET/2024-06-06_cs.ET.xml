      <title>Haptic in-sensor computing device made of carbon nanotube-polydimethylsiloxane nanocomposites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The importance of haptic in-sensor computing devices has been increasing. In this study, we successfully fabricated a haptic sensor with a hierarchical structure via the sacrificial template method, using carbon nanotubes-polydimethylsiloxane (CNTs-PDMS) nanocomposites for in-sensor computing applications. The CNTs-PDMS nanocomposite sensors, with different sensitivities, were obtained by varying the amount of CNTs. We transformed the input stimuli into higher-dimensional information, enabling a new path for the CNTs-PDMS nanocomposite application, which was implemented on a robotic hand as an in-sensor computing device by applying a reservoir computing paradigm. The nonlinear output data obtained from the sensors were trained using linear regression and used to classify nine different objects used in everyday life with an object recognition accuracy of &gt;80 % for each object. This approach could enable tactile sensation in robots while reducing the computational cost.</description>

      <title>AMPIC: Adaptive Model Predictive Ising Controller for large-scale urban traffic signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Realizing smooth traffic flow is important for achieving carbon neutrality. Adaptive traffic signal control, which considers traffic conditions, has thus attracted attention. However, it is difficult to ensure optimal vehicle flow throughout a large city using existing control methods because of their heavy computational load. Here, we propose a control method called AMPIC (Adaptive Model Predictive Ising Controller) that guarantees both scalability and optimality. The proposed method employs model predictive control to solve an optimal control problem at each control interval with explicit consideration of a predictive model of vehicle flow. This optimal control problem is transformed into a combinatorial optimization problem with binary variables that is equivalent to the so-called Ising problem. This transformation allows us to use an Ising solver, which has been widely studied and is expected to have fast and efficient optimization performance. We performed numerical experiments using a microscopic traffic simulator for a realistic city road network. The results show that AMPIC enables faster vehicle cruising speed with less waiting time than that achieved by classical control methods, resulting in lower CO2 emissions. The model predictive approach with a long prediction horizon thus effectively improves control performance. Systematic parametric studies on model cities indicate that the proposed method realizes smoother traffic flows for large city road networks. Among Ising solvers, D-Wave's quantum annealing is shown to find near-optimal solutions at a reasonable computational cost.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Intelligent Internet of Things: Applications, Security, Privacy, and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advances in the Internet of Things (IoT) have promoted a revolution in communication technology and offered various customer services. Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have been exploited to facilitate IoT operations and maximize their potential in modern application scenarios. In particular, the convergence of IoT and AI has led to a new networking paradigm called Intelligent IoT (IIoT), which has the potential to significantly transform businesses and industrial domains. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of IIoT by investigating its significant applications in mobile networks, as well as its associated security and privacy issues. Specifically, we explore and discuss the roles of IIoT in a wide range of key application domains, from smart healthcare and smart cities to smart transportation and smart industries. Through such extensive discussions, we investigate important security issues in IIoT networks, where network attacks, confidentiality, integrity, and intrusion are analyzed, along with a discussion of potential countermeasures. Privacy issues in IIoT networks were also surveyed and discussed, including data, location, and model privacy leakage. Finally, we outline several key challenges and highlight potential research directions in this important area.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent decades, the field of quantum computing has experienced remarkable progress. This progress is marked by the superior performance of many quantum algorithms compared to their classical counterparts, with Shor's algorithm serving as a prominent illustration. Quantum arithmetic circuits, which are the fundamental building blocks in numerous quantum algorithms, have attracted much attention. Despite extensive exploration of various designs in the existing literature, researchers remain keen on developing novel designs and improving existing ones.
  In this review article, we aim to provide a systematically organized and easily comprehensible overview of the current state-of-the-art in quantum arithmetic circuits. Specifically, this study covers fundamental operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and modular exponentiation. We delve into the detailed quantum implementations of these prominent designs and evaluate their efficiency considering various objectives. We also discuss potential applications of presented arithmetic circuits and suggest future research directions.</description>

      <title>Stochastic logic in biased coupled photonic probabilistic bits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical computing often employs tailor-made hardware to implement specific algorithms, trading generality for improved performance in key aspects like speed and power efficiency. An important computing approach that is still missing its corresponding optical hardware is probabilistic computing, used e.g. for solving difficult combinatorial optimization problems. In this study, we propose an experimentally viable photonic approach to solve arbitrary probabilistic computing problems. Our method relies on the insight that coherent Ising machines composed of coupled and biased optical parametric oscillators can emulate stochastic logic. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach by using numerical simulations equivalent to the full density matrix formulation of coupled optical parametric oscillators.</description>

      <title>Gaining Cross-Platform Parallelism for HAL's Molecular Dynamics Package using SYCL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular dynamics simulations are one of the methods in scientific computing that benefit from GPU acceleration. For those devices, SYCL is a promising API for writing portable codes. In this paper, we present the case study of "HAL's MD package" that has been successfully migrated from CUDA to SYCL. We describe the different strategies that we followed in the process of porting the code. Following these strategies, we achieved code portability across major GPU vendors. Depending on the actual kernels, both significant performance improvements and regressions are observed. As a side effect of the migration process, we obtained impressing speedups also for execution on CPUs.</description>

      <title>A Fast Algorithm to Simulate Nonlinear Resistive Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11674v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Analog electrical networks have long been investigated as energy-efficient computing platforms for machine learning, leveraging analog physics during inference. More recently, resistor networks have sparked particular interest due to their ability to learn using local rules (such as equilibrium propagation), enabling potentially important energy efficiency gains for training as well. Despite their potential advantage, the simulations of these resistor networks has been a significant bottleneck to assess their scalability, with current methods either being limited to linear networks or relying on realistic, yet slow circuit simulators like SPICE. Assuming ideal circuit elements, we introduce a novel approach for the simulation of nonlinear resistive networks, which we frame as a quadratic programming problem with linear inequality constraints, and which we solve using a fast, exact coordinate descent algorithm. Our simulation methodology significantly outperforms existing SPICE-based simulations, enabling the training of networks up to 327 times larger at speeds 160 times faster, resulting in a 50,000-fold improvement in the ratio of network size to epoch duration. Our approach can foster more rapid progress in the simulations of nonlinear analog electrical networks.</description>

      <title>Exfiltration of personal information from ChatGPT via prompt injection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00199v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report that ChatGPT 4 and 4o are susceptible to a prompt injection attack that allows an attacker to exfiltrate users' personal data. It is applicable without the use of any 3rd party tools and all users are currently affected. This vulnerability is exacerbated by the recent introduction of ChatGPT's memory feature, which allows an attacker to command ChatGPT to monitor the user for the desired personal data.</description>
