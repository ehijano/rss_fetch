      <title>$U_q(\mathfrak{gl}(m|n))$ bounds on the minimal genus of virtual links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For links $L \subset \Sigma \times [0,1]$, where $\Sigma$ is a closed orientable surface, we define a $U_q(\mathfrak{gl}(1|1))$ Reshetikhin-Turaev invariant with coefficients in $\mathbb{Z}[H_1(\Sigma)]$. This invariant turns out to be equivalent to an infinite cyclic version of the Carter-Silver-Williams (CSW) polynomial. The importance of the CSW polynomial is that half its symplectic rank gives strong lower bounds on the virtual genus. Recall that the virtual genus of a virtual link $J$ is the smallest genus of all closed orientable surfaces $\Sigma$ on which $J$ can be represented by a link diagram on $\Sigma$. Here we generalize the CSW lower bound to all quantum supergroups $U_q(\mathfrak{gl}(m|n))$ with $m,n&gt;0$. For $(m,n)=(1,1)$, the $U_q(\mathfrak{gl}(m|n))$ bound is the same as the CSW bound. However, changing the value of the pair $(m,n)$ can give lower bounds better than those available from other known methods. We compare the $U_q(\mathfrak{gl}(m|n))$ lower bounds to those coming from the CSW polynomial, the surface bracket, the arrow polynomial, hyperbolicity, and the Gordon-Litherland determinant test. As a first application, we show that the Seifert genus of homologically trivial knots in thickened surfaces is not additive under the connected sum operation of virtual knots. As a second application, we prove that the Jaeger-Kauffman-Saleur invariant of a virtual knot is always realizable as the Alexander polynomial of an infinite cyclic cover of a knot complement in some $\Sigma \times [0,1]$, but is not always so on a surface of minimal genus. This is accomplished with a generalization of the $Zh$-construction, called the homotopy $Zh$-construction.</description>

      <title>Involutions on S^4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies locally linear involutions on S^4. Our main theorem shows that any such involution with a 1-dimensional fixed-point set is necessarily linear, provided the fixed-point set admits an equivariant tubular neighborhood. The proof combines modified surgery theory with an equivariant version of the Schoenflies theorem, which we establish here. We also show that equivariant tubular neighborhoods of 1-dimensional fixed-point sets, when they exist, are not unique, in contrast to the nonequivariant case. Our results combine with earlier work to provide a classification of all locally linear involutions on S^4. As a further application, we obtain that strongly negative amphichiral knots with trivial Alexander polynomial are equivariantly topologically slice with respect to the linear action, strengthening a previous result of the first two authors. Finally, we also prove that when the fixed-point set is 2-dimensional, the involution is linear if and only if the fixed-point set is an unknotted 2-knot.</description>

      <title>Panhandle polynomials of torus links and geometric applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use a decomposition of the tensor of the fundamental representation of the quantum group $U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_N)$ and the Rosso-Jones formula to establish a peculiar ``panhandle'' shape of the HOMFLY-PT polynomial of the reverse parallel of torus knots and links. Due to their panhandle-like intrinsic properties, the HOMFLY-PT polynomial is referred to as a ``panhandle polynomial''. With the help of the $\ell$-invariant, this extends to links the Etnyre-Honda result about the arc index and maximal Thurston-Bennequin invariant of torus knots. It has further geometric consequences, related to the braid index, the existence of minimal string Bennequin surfaces for banded and Whitehead doubled links, the Bennequin sharpness problem, and the equivalence of their quasipositivity and strong quasipositivity. We extend these properties to torus links, which relate to the classification of their component-wise Thurston-Bennequin invariants. Finally, we discuss the definition of the $\ell$-invariant for general links.</description>

      <title>Delta-Unknotting Number for Two-Bridge Knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $\Delta$-unknotting number for a knot is defined as the minimum number of $\Delta$-moves needed to deform the knot into the trivial knot. We determine the $\Delta$-unknotting numbers for two-bridge knots of type $C(2\beta_1, 2\beta_2, ... , 2\beta_n)$ and type $C(2\beta_1, 2\beta_2, ... , 2\beta_{n-1}, 2\beta_n-1)$, where $\beta_i$ is a positive integer for $1 \leq i \leq n$. We also discuss two-bridge knots whose $\Delta$-unknotting number is equal to one.</description>

      <title>Vietoris thickenings and complexes of manifolds are homotopy equivalent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that if $X$ is a finite-dimensional Polish metric space, then the natural bijection $\mathrm{VR}(X;r)\to \mathrm{VR^m}(X;r)$ from the (open) Vietoris-Rips complex to the Vietoris-Rips metric thickening is a homotopy equivalence. This occurs, for example, if $X$ is a Riemannian manifold. The same is true for the map $\mathrm{\check{C}}(X;r)$ to $\mathrm{\check{C}}^\mathrm{m}(X;r)$ from the \v{C}ech complex to the \v{C}ech metric thickening, and more generally, for the natural bijection $\mathrm{V}(\mathcal W)\to \mathrm{V^m}(\mathcal W)$ from the Vietoris complex to the Vietoris metric thickening of any uniformly bounded cover $\mathcal W$ of a finite dimensional Polish metric space. We also show that if $X$ is a compact metrizable space, then $\mathrm{V^m}(\mathcal W)$ is strongly locally contractible.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics aspects of Teichm\"{u}ller TQFT for generalized FAMED semi-geometric triangulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a generalized FAMED property for ideal triangulations of hyperbolic knot complements in $\mathbb{S}^3$. Given a hyperbolic knot $K$ in $\mathbb{S}^3$ and a semi-geometric triangulation $X$ of $\mathbb{S}^3 \setminus K$ that is generalized FAMED with respect to the longitude. We prove that in the semi-classical limit $\hbar \to 0^+$, for any angle structure $\alpha$, the partition function $\mathscr{Z}_\hbar(X,\alpha)$ in Teichm\"uller TQFT decays exponentially with decrease rate the volume of $\mathbb{S}^3 \setminus K$ equipped with a hyperbolic cone structure determined by $\alpha$, and that the 1-loop invariant of Dimofte-Garoufalidis emerges as the 1-loop term. With additional combinatorial conditions on the triangulations, we prove the existence of the Jones function and show that its decay rate is governed by the Neumann-Zagier potential function. In particular, the Andersen-Kashaev volume conjecture holds for every hyperbolic knot whose complement admits such kinds of triangulations.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the topological significance of the knot two-variable series $F_K$, proposed by Gukov--Manolescu and defined by Park for a class of `nice' knots. We show that the leading coefficient of $F_K$ is a monomial and express its exponent in terms of the Hopf invariant for all homogeneous braid knots and fibered knots up to 12 crossings. As an application, we deduce an explicit formula for the Hopf invariant in terms of colored Jones polynomials.
  For non-fibered strongly quasipositive knots, we study a relation between $F_K$ and the stability series of the colored Jones function, and explore similarities between $F_K$ and knot Floer homology. Finally, we propose a slope conjecture for $F_K$, relating it to the boundary slopes of the knot.</description>

      <title>Singular Meanders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problem of enumerating meanders -- pairs of simple plane curves with transverse intersections -- was formulated about forty years ago and is still far from solved. Recently, it was discovered that meanders admit a factorization into prime components. This factorization naturally leads to a broader class of objects, which we call singular meanders, in which tangential intersections between the curves are also allowed. In the present paper we initiate a systematic study of singular meanders: we develop a basic combinatorial framework, point out connections with other combinatorial objects and known integer sequences, and completely enumerate several natural families of singular meanders.</description>

      <title>Torus Knots and Minimal Models Revisited : Rational VOA characters from non-hyperbolic knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 2003, Hikami and Kirillov uncovered an intriguing connection between torus knots $\mathcal{K}_{(P,Q)}$ and Virasoro minimal models $\mathcal{M}(P,Q)$ by relating the Kashaev invariants of the knots to the characters of the corresponding minimal models. In this work, we recover and extend this connection by combining the 3D--3D correspondence with a bulk--boundary correspondence. More concretely, we study the 3D $\mathcal{N}=2$ gauge theories associated with torus-knot complements via the Dimofte--Gaiotto--Gukov construction and show that, in the infrared, these theories either flow to a unitary TQFT (when $|P-Q| = 1$), whose boundary chiral algebra reproduces that of the associated unitary minimal model, or to a 3D $\mathcal{N}=4$ rank-0 SCFT (when $|P-Q| &gt; 1$), which realizes the corresponding non-unitary chiral minimal model at the boundary after an appropriate topological twist. This framework yields new Nahm-sum-like expressions for the characters of Virasoro minimal models and other related rational conformal field theories, providing a systematic algorithm for constructing characters of rational VOAs directly from the combinatorial data of an ideal triangulation of a non-hyperbolic knot complement.</description>

      <title>The N-5 Scaling Law: Topological Dimensionality Reduction in the Optimal Design of Fully-actuated Multirotors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The geometric design of fully-actuated and omnidirectional N-rotor aerial vehicles is conventionally formulated as a parametric optimization problem, seeking a single optimal set of N orientations within a fixed architectural family. This work departs from that paradigm to investigate the intrinsic topological structure of the optimization landscape itself. We formulate the design problem on the product manifold of Projective Lines \RP^2^N, fixing the rotor positions to the vertices of polyhedral chassis while varying their lines of action. By minimizing a coordinate-invariant Log-Volume isotropy metric, we reveal that the topology of the global optima is governed strictly by the symmetry of the chassis. For generic (irregular) vertex arrangements, the solutions appear as a discrete set of isolated points. However, as the chassis geometry approaches regularity, the solution space undergoes a critical phase transition, collapsing onto an N-dimensional Torus of the lines tangent at the vertexes to the circumscribing sphere of the chassis, and subsequently reducing to continuous 1-dimensional curves driven by Affine Phase Locking. We synthesize these observations into the N-5 Scaling Law: an empirical relationship holding for all examined regular planar polygons and Platonic solids (N &lt;= 10), where the space of optimal configurations consists of K=N-5 disconnected 1D topological branches. We demonstrate that these locking patterns correspond to a sequence of admissible Star Polygons {N/q}, allowing for the exact prediction of optimal phases for arbitrary N. Crucially, this topology reveals a design redundancy that enables optimality-preserving morphing: the vehicle can continuously reconfigure along these branches while preserving optimal isotropic control authority.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define a once extended non-compact 3-dimensional TQFT $\mathcal{Z}$ from the data of a (potentially) non-semisimple modular tensor category. This is in the framework of generators and relations of [Bartlett et al., arxiv:1509.06811 (2015)], having disallowed generating 2-morphisms whose source is the empty. Moreover, we show that the projective mapping class group representations this TQFT gives rise to, are dual to those of [Lyubashenko, arXiv:hep-th/9405167 (1994)] and [De Renzi et al., arXiv:2010.14852 (2020)]. We develop a method to decompose a closed 3-manifold in terms of 2-morphism generators. We use this to compute the value of $\mathcal{Z}$ on 3-manifolds, explaining why it should recover Lyubashenko's 3-manifold invariants [Lyubashenko, arXiv:hep-th/9405167 (1994)]. Finally, we explain that the value of the non-compact TQFT on the solid torus recovers the data of a modified trace [Geer et al., arXiv:0711.4229 (2007)].</description>

      <title>Lie superalgebra invariants and almost classical knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07375v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A virtual link is said to be almost classical (AC) if it has a homologically trivial representative in some thickened surface $\Sigma \times [0,1]$, where $\Sigma$ is a closed orientable surface. AC links provide a useful window for observing the geometric topology of virtual knots. Here we take a different approach and look at AC links through the lens of quantum topology. Two adjustments are needed to the existing theory. First, it is necessary to generalize the definition of AC to include virtual tangles and, in particular, virtual braids. Secondly, to distinguish AC and non-AC tangles, the additional structure of quantum supergroups is required. For each Lie superalgebra $\mathfrak{gl}(m|n)$, we define a pair of $U_q(\mathfrak{gl}(m|n))$ Reshetikhin-Turaev functors $Q^{m|n}$, $\widetilde{Q}^{m|n} \circ Zh$ on framed virtual tangles. Here $Zh$ denotes the Bar-Natan $Zh$ construction. These functors unify the Alexander polynomial (AP) of AC links and the generalized Alexander polynomial (GAP) of all virtual links into a single quantum model: $Q^{1|1}$ recovers the AP of an AC link and for any virtual link $K$, $\widetilde{Q}^{1|1}\circ Zh(K)$ is the 2-variable GAP. However, when $(m,n) \ne (1,1)$, these invariants are generally distinct from the AP and GAP. Furthermore, in contrast to the classical case, they are not determined by $m-n$. For example, there are virtual knots with trivial GAP but nontrivial $U_q(\mathfrak{gl}(2|2))$ and $U_q(\mathfrak{gl}(3|3))$ invariants.
  Silver and Williams proved that the GAP vanishes on all AC links. Our main result is a generalization of this theorem to almost classical tangles and the $U_q(\mathfrak{gl}(m|n))$ Reshetikhin-Turaev functors. We prove that if $T$ is an almost classical tangle, then $\widetilde{Q}^{m|n}\circ Zh(T)$ is conjugate to $Q^{m|n}(T)$, with conjugation determined by an Alexander numbering of $T$.</description>

      <title>On 4-dimensional 3-handle attachments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20282v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kirby diagrams for smooth four-dimensional manifolds typically depict only the 1- and 2-handles, omitting the 3-handles. In this work, we undertake a study of 3-handle attachments and provide tools to explicitly include them in handle diagrams. We show a set of moves involving 3-handles to extend the classical Kirby calculus. Under the condition that the number of 3-handles equals the rank of the spherical part of the specific boundary's second homology group, we establish a homological criterion that identifies a geometric basis of disjoint embedded spheres in the boundary corresponding to 3-handle attachments, yielding a uniqueness theorem for 3-handle attachments.</description>

      <title>Word Length Formulae and Normal Forms of Conjugacy Classes in Surface Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12862v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we primarily investigate the following symmetric presentation of the surface group $\pi_1(\Sigma_g)=\left\langle c_1,\dots, c_{2g}\mid c_1\cdots c_{2g}c_1^{-1}\cdots c_{2g}^{-1}\right\rangle$. For every nontrivial element $x\in \pi_1(\Sigma_g)$, we obtain a uniform representation of the normal forms of $x^k$ under the length-lexicographical order. Based on this, we find a new relation among these normal forms, and then derive the following three formulae related to the word length: $|x^2|&gt;|x|$; $|x^k|=(k-1)(|x^2|-|x|)+|x|$; $\lim_{k\to\infty}\frac{|x^k|}{k}=|x^2|-|x|$. Moreover, we extend these results to obtain analogous but less precise formulae for every minimal geometric presentation. Then, we define the normal forms of conjugacy classes in $\pi_1(\Sigma_g)$ and give a criterion for determining the conjugacy of elements. As a consequence, we give efficient algorithms for solving the root-finding and conjugacy problems. Finally, we present applications concerning the computation of some growth rates.</description>

      <title>On the existence of universal links in three-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14985v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the existence of branched coverings between closed $3$-manifolds, with emphasis on universal knots and links. We prove that the only closed $3$-manifolds that admit a universal link are spherical. Furthermore, we distinguish between universal links and complement universal links and show that these notions do not coincide in general, by exhibiting infinitely many examples of complement universal links that are not universal. Also, we prove that there is no closed aspherical $3$-manifold, such that every closed, aspherical $3$-manifold is a branched covering over it. Finally, we characterize the closed $3$-manifolds admitting branching coverings from $P^3 \# P^3$, and deduce that there is no closed reducible $3$-manifold, such that every closed reducible $3$-manifold is a branched covering over it.</description>

      <title>A "cubist" decomposition of the Handel-Mosher axis bundle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16360v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the axis bundle of a nongeometric fully irreducible outer automorphism admits a canonical "cubist" decomposition into branched cubes that fit together with special combinatorics. From this structure, we locate a canonical finite collection of periodic fold lines in each axis bundle. This can be considered as an analogue of results of Hamenst\"adt and Agol from the surface setting, which state that the set of trivalent train tracks carrying the unstable lamination of a pseudo-Anosov map can be given the structure of a CAT(0) cube complex, and that there is a canonical periodic fold line in this cube complex. This work also gives an answer to questions of Handel-Mosher and Bridson-Vogtmann regarding the geometry of the axis bundle and a solution of a new flavor to the fully irreducible conjugacy problem in $\mathrm{Out}(F_r)$.</description>

      <title>A Spinorial Heat Flow Framework for Geometric Degeneration on $3$-Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19308v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a spinor-driven formulation of geometric evolution on closed $3$-manifolds, in which the spinor field is treated as the primary dynamical variable and the Riemannian metric is induced conformally by the spinor amplitude. We introduce a spinorial heat flow governed by the squared Dirac operator, \[ \partial_t \psi = - D_{g(\psi)}^{\,2} \psi , \] where the metric $g(\psi)$ depends nonlinearly on the evolving spinor field. As a consequence, the resulting system is quasi-linear and parabolic away from the nodal set $\{\psi=0\}$, while exhibiting degenerate behavior at vanishing spinor amplitude.
  We show that degeneration of the induced metric corresponds analytically to nodal behavior of the spinor field, rather than to curvature blow-up of the spinor evolution itself. This observation motivates an interpretation of geometric singularities as spinorial nodal transitions, across which the spinor field remains locally bounded in a weak or weighted sense. The induced metric evolution is derived explicitly and shown to be purely conformal, capturing only the trace component of curvature evolution and containing additional gradient terms that are not controlled \emph{a priori}. Accordingly, the proposed flow should not be identified with the Ricci flow, and any analogy with curvature smoothing is understood at a heuristic level.
  The present work establishes a coherent analytical framework for studying geometric degeneration via spinor dynamics and highlights several open problems in degenerate parabolic theory, including rigorous existence results and the precise role of nodal structures in geometric and topological evolution.</description>
