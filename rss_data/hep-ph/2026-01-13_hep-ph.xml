      <title>Threshold resummation of Semi-Inclusive Deep-Inelastic Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive threshold resummation of semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering (SIDIS), by building upon previous results by some of us for the resummation of the Drell-Yan process at fixed rapidity, which is related to SIDIS by crossing. We consider both a double-soft limit, in which both the Bjorken and the fragmentation scaling variables tend to their threshold value, and single soft limits in which either of them does. We show that in the former limit only soft radiation contributes, and in the latter limit only collinear radiation, and we derive resummed expressions for the coefficient functions in all cases. We determine explictly resummation coefficients in the nonsinglet channel up to next-to-next-to-leading log by comparing to recent fixed next-to-next-to-leading order results. Expanding out the single-soft resummation we reproduce recent next-to-leading power results.</description>

      <title>Hadronic Probes of Non-Standard Neutrino Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study leptonic decays of hadrons as probes of light neutrinophilic scalars that mediate enhanced neutrino self-interactions. Such scalars can be emitted in processes involving neutrinos, turning two-body decays into three-body final states and producing characteristic spectral distortions. We compute these effects for charged pion decay and nuclear electron capture decay, including both on-shell and off-shell scalar emission, as well as the loop-induced renormalization required to cancel divergences. Using these results, we derive the projected sensitivity of PIONEER and assess the current and future reach of BeEST. The resulting low-energy spectral tails provide a characteristic signal for light neutrinophilic scalars, making upcoming hadron decay experiments powerful probes of light mediators of non-standard neutrino self-interactions.</description>

      <title>One-loop renormalization and $\boldsymbol{\rho}$ parameter in the Georgi-Machacek model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the one-loop renormalization of the Georgi-Machacek model. At one loop, the renormalization of the model is phenomenologically important when triggered by operators that are absent at the tree level due to the global $SU(2)_R$ symmetry. By computing all the tree-level parameters from the standard input parameters $\alpha_e$, $G_\mu$, and $m_Z$, we show the ultraviolet divergent nature of the electroweak $\rho$ parameter when one-loop corrections are incorporated. In this model, four input parameters are required to completely parametrize the electroweak precision observables at one loop. We study the quantitative impact of the model parameters on the one-loop corrections to the $\rho$ parameter. At one loop, the $\rho$ parameter shows a mild dependence on the mass differences between the custodial fiveplet and the heavy custodial singlet, and mainly depends on the ratio of the doublet and triplet vacuum expectation values, and on the mixing angle between the custodial singlet CP-even scalars.</description>

      <title>Exploring Invisible New Physics with Exotic Pion Decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the sensitivity of past and future stopped-pion experiments to light, invisible dark sector particles produced in exotic pion decays. We consider two-body decays involving sterile neutrinos, $\pi^+ \to \ell^+ N$, as well as three-body decays $\pi^+ \to \ell^+ \nu_\ell X$, with $X$ an invisible scalar, axion-like particle, or dark vector. We recast existing limits from the PIENU experiment and project the reach of the planned PIONEER experiment using detailed simulations based on the current detector design. We find that PIONEER can improve bounds on exotic pion branching ratios by at least one order of magnitude below current limits. We compare the projected sensitivities with complementary constraints from lepton anomalous magnetic moments, mono-photon searches, and beam-dump experiments, identifying weak-violating axion-like particles as a particularly well-motivated benchmark. Our results establish PIONEER as a powerful and complementary probe of light, invisible dark sectors.</description>

      <title>Temperature-Dependent CPT Violation: Constraints from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we explore temperature-dependent CPT violation during Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) through electron-positron mass asymmetries parametrized by $b_0(T) = \alpha T^2$. The $T^2$ scaling naturally evades stringent laboratory bounds at zero temperature while allowing for significant CPT violation at MeV scales in the early universe \cite{ParticleDataGroup:2024cfk}. Using a modified version of the BBN code \faGithub \href{https://github.com/vallima/PRyMordial}{\,\texttt{PRyMordial}} with dynamically-solved chemical potentials and appropriate finite-mass corrections, we constrain electron-positron mass differences from observed abundances of Helium-4, Deuterium, and $N_{\rm eff}$. We find that $\alpha$ must be greater than or approximately equal to $10^{-6}$ GeV$^{-1}$ for keV-scale mass differences at BBN. All three observables show no simultaneous $1\sigma$ overlap, though pairwise combinations allow for constrained regions of parameter space. We present three toy models demonstrating how $b_0(T) \propto T^2$ arises from field-theoretic mechanisms, including temperature-driven phase transitions. These results provide the most stringent constraints on early-universe CPT violation in this regime, probing parameter space inaccessible to laboratory experiments.</description>

      <title>Baryogenesis from the Thermodynamic Arrow of Time: a Transfer-Function Bound and an Entropy-Clock Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a quantitative statement: baryogenesis driven by a purely oscillatory (zero-mean) chemical potential is parametrically suppressed under smooth freeze-out (adiabatic cancellation). A simple toy model yields an analytic low-pass transfer function F(x)=1/sqrt(1+x^2), with x = omegatau_off, capturing the suppression for omegatau_off &gt;&gt; 1. We then propose an "entropy clock" source tied to thermodynamic irreversibility: during reheating the growth of comoving entropy S = a^3 s generates a sign-definite chemical potential mu_B = epsilon * d log S/dt that drives spontaneous baryogenesis. The final asymmetry reduces to an overlap integral Pi_eff = integral dt W(t) Pi(t) between the violation window W(t) and entropy production Pi(t)= d log S/dt. As a minimal benchmark, Delta L=2 scatterings from the Weinberg operator yield T_F ~ 10^12-10^13 GeV for m_nu ~ 0.05 eV, requiring epsilonPi_eff ~ few x 10^-3.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the semileptonic decays of $\Xi_{cc}$ and $\Omega_{cc}$ baryons in QCD sum rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We firstly carry out a systematic analysis on the spin $\frac{1}{2}^{+}\rightarrow\frac{3}{2}^{+}$ weak transition process in the framework of three-point QCD sum rules, where the initial and final states are doubly and singly charmed baryons. In the phenomenological side, all possible couplings of interpolating current to hadronic states are considered. In doing operator production expansion at QCD side, the contributions of the perturbative part, vacuum condensate terms of $\langle{\bar qq}\rangle$, $\langle g_{s}^{2}GG\rangle$, $\langle \bar q g_{s}\sigma Gq\rangle$ and $g_{s}^{2}\langle{\bar qq}\rangle^{2}$ are all considered. After the form factors in space-like region ($Q^2&gt;0$) are obtained, the numerical results are extrapolated into time-like region ($Q^2&lt;0$) by a fitting function. Using the predicted form factors, we finally analyze the semileptonic decays of $\Xi_{cc}^{++}\rightarrow \Sigma_{c}^{*+}l^{+}\nu_{l}$, $\Xi_{cc}^{++}\rightarrow \Xi_{c}^{\prime*+}l^{+}\nu_{l}$, $\Omega_{cc}^{+}\rightarrow\Xi_{c}^{\prime*0}l^{+}\nu_{l}$ and $\Omega_{cc}^{+}\rightarrow \Omega_{c}^{*0}l^{+}\nu_{l}$ with $l=e,\mu$. The predictions in this work can deepen our understanding of the dynamics in the decay processes of doubly heavy baryons and provide useful information to explore the possibility of new physics in heavy baryonic decay channels.</description>

      <title>Dark-Portal Leptogenesis in a Non-Holomorphic Modular Scoto-Seesaw Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work explores the neutrino phenomenology of the scotoseesaw model under non-holomorphic $A_4$ modular flavor symmetry providing a non-SUSY framework for realization of the modular symmetry. To prevent mixing between the beyond standard model fields associated with the tree and loop-level neutrino mass contributions, we assign even and odd modular weights to these sectors, respectively. The physical allowed ranges of oscillation parameters are used to identify the viable region of modulus parameter $\tau$ in its fundamental domain. With the complex modulus $\tau$ serving as the unique source of CP violation (all other parameters are real) the framework realizes successful low-scale leptogenesis through CP-violating decays of the lightest right-handed neutrino into Standard Model leptons and the Higgs boson. The requisite CP asymmetry arises from one-loop diagrams involving dark-sector states, obviating the need for degenerate mass spectra and thereby circumventing the usual resonant leptogenesis mechanism. The observation of a long-lived charged particle ($\eta^{\pm}$) in collider experiments would offer compelling evidence for the inert scalar sector of the model and provide a crucial experimental hint on the dark-sector assisted generation of neutrino masses and leptogenesis.</description>

      <title>Physical implications of a double right-handed gauge symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Guided by the flipping principle, we propose a novel extension of the Standard Model based on a double right-handed $U(1)$ gauge symmetry. In this framework, all left-handed fermions are neutral, while right-handed fermions of the third generation carry charges distinct from those of the first two generations. This structure naturally explains the observed Standard Model fermion mass hierarchy: the heavy masses of the third generation are generated at tree level, while the lighter masses of the first and second generations arise radiatively at the one-loop level. For the active neutrino sector, the tiny masses are generated through a combination of tree-level and two-loop seesaw mechanisms. Crucially, this approach successfully reproduces the observed neutrino mass hierarchy, with the atmospheric mass-squared difference generated at tree level and the solar neutrino mass squared difference emerging at the two-loop level. These hierarchical patterns stem from the interplay between gauge invariance and a residual parity symmetry that survives the spontaneous breaking of the extended gauge group. The same residual symmetry stabilizes a viable scalar singlet dark matter candidate, which we show can reproduce the observed relic abundance while remaining consistent with current direct detection bounds. After addressing constraints from electroweak precision tests and flavor-changing neutral currents, we explore the discovery prospects for the new neutral bosons at existing and future colliders, including the LEP, LHC, and a future ILC.</description>

      <title>Distribution Functions of Radially Excited Pion using the Light-Front Quark Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the internal structure of the ground ($1S$) and the first two radially excited ($2S,3S$) states of the pion within the light-front quark model. The valence Fock sector is described using pure harmonic-oscillator eigenstates and mixed states formed as orthogonal linear combinations of these eigenfunctions. The optimal wavefunction parameters are determined through a variational procedure based on a QCD-motivated effective Hamiltonian. Using the resulting light-front wavefunctions, we study the pion distribution amplitude, parton distribution function, and electromagnetic form factor. After QCD evolution, the ground state distribution amplitude and parton distribution function are found to be in good agreement with available experimental data. At the model scale, the parton distribution functions of the $1S$ and $2S$ states show clear sensitivity to state mixing, while the distribution amplitudes and electromagnetic form factors are weakly sensitive. In contrast, for the $3S$ state, all three observables exhibit a pronounced sensitivity to mixing. The decay constants of the mixed states are also found to decrease sequentially with increasing radial excitation.</description>

      <title>A Z3-symmetric Quantum Chromodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a description of colour triplets of quarks by entangled Z3-graded Lee-Wick type fields, one with real mass and the two remaining ones with mutually conjugate complex masses. This is obtained by attributing colour degrees of freedom to six Pauli spinors, three endowed with colours and three with anti-colours, which are unitrd into one 12-component generalized "coloured Dirac spinor". The so entangled triplet of quark fields satisfies a generalized Dirac equation, with generalized 12x1\'e gamma-matrices acting on 12-component coloured spinors. The sixth order dispersion relations lead to solutions suitably vanishing in asymptotic region, exhibiting the well established confinement property of coloured quarks' degrees of freedom. We show how one can construct certain cubic combinations of those solutions in a way that cansels the damping factors, producing freely propagating functions.</description>

      <title>Low-energy $N\phi$ scattering from a pole-enhanced triangle diagram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate low-energy $N\phi$ scattering driven by a pole-enhanced triangle diagram, in which the two-kaon-exchange contribution is promoted by the near-threshold $\Lambda(1405)$ pole in the $N\bar K$ subsystem. Using an unphysical kaon mass motivated by lattice simulations, we evaluate the $N\phi$ scattering length and find that this mechanism generates an attractive interaction with a magnitude of $-1.5$ to $-0.5,\rm{fm}$. Spin-dependent effects are not treated explicitly and are expected to provide subleading corrections in the near-threshold region. We further analyze the low-energy behavior of the triangle-diagram amplitude and show that the scattering length performs a characteristic power-law dependence on the parameter $\tilde{\delta}$, defined as the mass difference between the $K\bar K$ threshold and the $\phi$ meson. This threshold-driven behavior differs from that associated with van der Waals-type forces or the long-range tail of two-pion exchange, highlighting the role of three-body dynamics encoded in the pole-enhanced triangle diagram in shaping the near-threshold $N\phi$ interaction.</description>

      <title>Probing Dark Matter annihilation in the Galactic Centre with TRIDENT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine the future sensitivity of the TRIDENT neutrino telescope to dark matter annihilation in the Galactic Centre. By applying the full detector design we show that TRIDENT will probe annihilation rates down to $\langle\sigma v\rangle\approx5\times10^{-27}\,{\rm cm}^3\,{\rm s}^{-1}$ for a $10\,{\rm TeV}$ dark matter, which is below the thermal freeze-out benchmark. The analysis is carried out with all-flavour neutrino interactions, where we demonstrate that cascade events, primarily due to $\nu_{e,\tau}$, show greater sensitivity to a dark matter signal compared to the more commonly studied track events. Furthermore, we highlight the impact of a previously overlooked background, Galactic neutrinos produced from interactions between hadronic cosmic rays and interstellar gas. We find dark matter sensitivities are more strongly degraded in the high energy region above $\sim 10\, {\rm TeV}$, with a maximal weakening of approximately a factor of $\sim 2$. This effect remains smaller than the uncertainty associated with the dark matter density profile but can nonetheless mimic a positive annihilation signal. We contextualize these results with a concrete particle model and show that TRIDENT will be able to probe the most interesting untested parts of parameter space.</description>

      <title>Quarkonium light-cone distribution amplitudes: twist structure and mass dependence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic study of the leading- and next-to-leading-twist light-cone distribution amplitudes (LCDAs) of ground-state pseudoscalar and vector quarkonium within the light-front quark model (LFQM). By implementing the replacement $M \to M_0$, we analyze the longitudinal and transverse structures of the LCDAs, together with their Gegenbauer moments, $\xi$-moments, and transverse momentum moments. We show that charge-conjugation symmetry enforces the exact vanishing of all odd Gegenbauer moments and odd $\xi$-moments. For pseudoscalar quarkonium, the twist-2 and twist-3 LCDAs become identical, which lead to their Gegenbauer moments, $\xi$-moments, and transverse momentum moments are the same, respectively. For vector quarkonium, although the twist-2 and twist-3 LCDAs differ in the case of masses quark, they progressively converge as the quark mass increases. In the heavy-quark limit, all quarkonium LCDAs satisfy $\phi^A_{2} = \phi^P_{3} \simeq \phi^{\parallel}_{2} \simeq \phi^{\perp}_{3}$, demonstrating an emergent twist-independence of quarkonium distribution amplitudes. We further find that the LCDAs become increasingly peaked and narrower with increasing quark mass, reflecting the meson system becomes increasingly close to a nonrelativistic bound state, with a more uniform and stable distribution of internal longitudinal momentum. For all quarkonium, the peak value exhibits a simple phenomenological scaling behavior governed by the ratio $m/\beta$. The transverse momentum moments increase with the meson mass, indicating a progressively more compact bound-state structure. These results reveal a universal and systematic evolution of quarkonium LCDAs driven by the quark mass.</description>

      <title>Probing the microscopic origin of prompt and non-prompt $D^{0}$ production through event-shape engineering in proton-proton collisions at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heavy-flavour hadrons are produced in the early stages of ultra-relativistic collisions at the LHC via hard partonic interactions and experience the whole system evolution. The study of prompt and non-prompt $D^{0}$ mesons provides an independent avenue to test the theories of quantum chromodynamics and to investigate beauty hadron production. Moreover, the production of both prompt and non-prompt $D^{0}$ is influenced by microscopic processes such as multi-partonic interactions (MPI) and hadronisation through fragmentation. In this study, an attempt is made to understand the production of prompt and non-prompt $D^{0}$ mesons in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13.6$ TeV using the PYTHIA8 event generator, which offers a qualitative description of charm production. The role of the transverse momentum transfer in the hardest partonic scattering ($\hat{p}_{\rm T}$), MPI, and color reconnection is systematically explored. In addition, the charged particle production in different topological regions with respect to the leading $D^{0}$ meson is studied to assess the influence of the $D^{0}$ meson on the event topology and to examine the selection biases arising from the use of charged particle multiplicity as an event classifier.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.06958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model is used to calculate the branching fractions of two-lepton decays $\eta^{(\prime)}\to\pi^+\pi^-l^+l^-$, where $l=e,\mu$. Particular attention is paid to the study of the contribution of the diagram with the exchange of two vector mesons. It is shown that taking this contribution into account is essential for the agreement between theoretical calculations and available experimental data.</description>

      <title>Light cone QCD sum rules study of the rare radiative $\Xi^{*}_{bb}\to\Xi_b\gamma$ decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rare radiative decay $\Xi^{*}_{bb}\to\Xi_b\gamma$ is investigated within the light cone QCD sum rules approach. This decay proceeds through the flavor changing neutral current $b\to s$ transition in the Standard Model. The hadronic matrix element of the considered decay is parameterized in terms of four tensor form factors $T_1^{V}(q^2)$, $T_2^{V}(q^2)$, $T_1^{A}(q^2)$ and $T_2^{A}(q^2)$. The sum rules for these form factors describing the $\Xi^{*}_{bb}\to\Xi_b\gamma$ decay are derived at $q^2=0$ point using the $\Xi_b$ distribution amplitudes. The results of the form factors are employed to calculate the corresponding decay width. Our finding indicates that this weak radiative decay could be within reach of future high statistics studies of doubly heavy baryons at LHCb and upcoming facilities.</description>

      <title>Perspectives on QCD, Topology and the Strong CP Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On the basis of allowed local gauge symmetries, the QCD Lagrangian admits a CP-violating term proportional to the topological charge density, commonly referred to as the $\theta$ term. A priori, any value of $\theta$ is consistent with the local symmetries of the theory, while current experimental limits constrain $\theta \lesssim 10^{-10}$. The apparent extreme smallness of this parameter is known as the strong $CP$ problem.
  In this work, we provide a careful critical overview of the conceptual assumptions underlying the $\theta$ term, focusing on the roles of topology, the definition of topological charge density, rough gauge field configurations, instantons, and anomalies. We contrast the assumptions required to describe QCD at nonzero $\theta$ with those sufficient at $\theta = 0$, and argue that a vanishing $\theta$ term is compatible with a formulation based solely on local gauge invariance and causal locality, without invoking additional global structure.
  The perspective developed here is intended as a conceptual analysis of the standard formulation of the strong $CP$ problem. It does not challenge the internal consistency of QCD at nonzero $\theta$, nor does it diminish the independent theoretical and phenomenological motivation for axion and axion-like particle physics, which are well-motivated extensions of the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Exclusive Decays of the Fully Heavy Tetraquarks into Light Mesons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the exclusive decays of the fully heavy tetraquark states $T_{4c,b}$ into light mesons, specifically $\pi$ and $K$, using the framework of Non-Relativistic QCD (NRQCD) and collinear QCD factorization for hard exclusive processes. We estimate the decay widths to be $10^{-9}$ GeV and $10^{-14}$ GeV for the decays $T_{4c} \to \pi^+\pi^-$ and $T_{4b} \to \pi^+\pi^-$ (and similarly for $K^+K^-$), respectively. The branching ratio for $T_{4c} \to \pi^+\pi^-(K^+K^-)$ is on the order of $10^{-8}$, making it currently unobservable in existing experiments. The factorization of $T_{4c,b}$ into light hadrons shares similarities with the decay $J/\psi \to p\bar{p}$. However, unlike the latter process, the decay $T_{4c,b} \to \pi^+\pi^-(K^+K^-)$ exhibits unique features that arise only in processes involving multiple incoming or outgoing particles. One such feature is the necessity of maintaining the $i\varepsilon$-prescription for the denominators or propagators due to the divergences in the kinematic region of interest. Employing the sector decomposition method, along with the aid of the Cheng-Wu theorem and the {\tt QHull} program, we present a systematic approach to handle the convolutions and phase-space integrations. This method can also be extended to similar processes, such as $T_{4c,b} \to p\bar{p}$, as well as to phase-space integrations where each denominator is a linear combination of integration variables.</description>

      <title>Atmospheric Mass-Squared Splitting at Sub-Percent Precision as a $CPT$ Symmetry Probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an improved test of $CPT$ symmetry in the neutrino sector by analyzing the atmospheric mass-squared splittings, $\Delta m^2_{31}$ and $\Delta \overline{m}^2_{31}$, using on-going JUNO and future DUNE and Hyper-Kamiokande experiments. Our study focuses on the discrepancy $\delta_{\nu\overline{\nu}}(\Delta m^2_{31}) = \Delta m^2_{31} - \Delta \overline{m}^2_{31}$, achieving unprecedented precision by exploiting the high statistics and reduced systematic uncertainties of these facilities. The combined analysis yields a sensitivity to $CPT$ violation at the level of $2\times 10^{-5}~\text{eV}^2$ at $3\sigma$ confidence level, representing a $60\%$ improvement over the joint T2K-NO$\nu$A-JUNO analysis. These results highlight the crucial role of multi-experiment synergies in testing fundamental symmetries of nature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We implement a finite energy constraint in the dipole picture of deep inelastic scattering by restricting the invariant mass of the produced partonic system by the virtual photon-target center of mass energy. We show that, for $Q^2=1$GeV$^2$, the effect of this constraint can reach up to $\sim$35% for charm quarks and $\sim$7% for light quarks at $x=0.01$, but then rapidly decreases at smaller $x$ or larger $Q^2$.</description>

      <title>Probing the spin parity structure of hidden charm pentaquarks from spectroscopy and magnetic moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the spin parity JP assignments of experimentally observed hidden charm pentaquark states within a baryon meson molecular framework. The pentaquark mass spectrum is obtained using the Gursey Radicati mass formula, with parameters fixed through a global fit to 41 experimentally established hadron masses. The resulting spectrum is then used to assign JP quantum numbers to the observed pentaquark candidates. Within this framework, the nonstrange states Pc 4312, Pc4440, and Pc 4457 are identified with the JP = 1/2, 3/2, and 5/2 configurations, respectively. The recently reported Belle state Pcs4459, which carries strangeness, is interpreted as the strange member of the SU3 flavor octet with JP = 3/2. Magnetic moments are subsequently evaluated using explicitly constructed wave functions. Their systematic behavior across SU3 flavor multiplets and different spin parity assignments satisfies the expected sum-rule relations and indicates that magnetic moments can serve as a useful observable for refining the quantum-number identification of hidden charm pentaquark states in future studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In scenarios where the Peccei-Quinn symmetry breaks after inflation, small-scale axion inhomogeneities may gravitationally collapse into bound structures. The evolution of these systems is typically modeled through cosmological perturbation theory applied to the Einstein-Klein-Gordon equations. In the non-relativistic regime, this framework reduces to the Gross-Pitaevskii-Poisson or Schr\"odinger-Poisson equations, depending on whether axion self-interactions are taken into account. In this work, a non-minimal gravitational coupling term $\xi R \phi^4$ is included into the axion's relativistic action as a way to introduce a gravitationally mediated pairwise interaction. By performing a perturbative expansion and subsequently taking the non-relativistic limit, an alternative set of equations that govern the early stages of structure formation is obtained.</description>

      <title>CP violating signal at DUNE in presence of nonstandard interactions and the role of second oscillation maxima</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutrino oscillation among the three active neutrino flavors is well established and supported by experiments at diverse length scales and energy scales. It may be noted that five of the neutrino oscillation parameters in the three-flavor paradigm, namely the three mixing angles ($\theta_{12}$, $\theta_{13}$, $\theta_{23}$) and the two mass-squared differences ($\Delta m^{2}_{21}$, $\Delta m^{2}_{31}$) are measured to a reasonable degree of precision. The three unknowns that are expected to be deciphered in the near future are the Dirac CP phase, $\delta$, the neutrino mass ordering, and the octant of $\theta_{23}$. The next generation of long baseline experiments, such as the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE), aims to resolve these unanswered questions. In the present work, by considering DUNE as an example, we assess the ability of long baseline experiments to extricate the intrinsic contribution from observables related to CP violation in scenarios considering SI and beyond. Additionally, we analyze the role of the second oscillation maximum in addressing the above mentioned questions. By carrying out event level and statistical analyses, we assess the potential of DUNE to probe CP violation effects both within and beyond the standard paradigm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Axion and axion-like particles (ALPs), predicted by various extensions of the Standard Model, can be copiously produced in nuclear reactors via the Primakoff process. In this work, we explore the detection of such relativistic ALPs through the plasmon effect in silicon detectors located near reactors. Utilizing the data from the Connie and Atucha-II experiments, we set the 90\% confidence level upper limits on the ALP-photon coupling $g_{a\gamma}$ over the mass range $0.1&lt; m_a &lt;100$ keV. Furthermore, we present that the projected sensitivity of the Oscura experiment, with an exposure of 30 kg$\cdot$ yr, will surpass the current reach of the NEON experiment by approximately one order of magnitude in the same mass range. This improvement would substantially expand the explored region of the QCD axion and ALP parameter space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The off-axis triple-vortex scattering process of $e^-e^+\to\gamma\gamma$ is studied theoretically, in which the positron is in a plane-wave state and the electron and photons are in vortex states. We develop a theoretical formalism for the process, which allows us to study the effects of various vortex parameters and scattering angle. We adopt a Bessel-Gaussian type wave packet for the initial vortex electron for the purpose of normalization. Numerical calculations are performed for an electron and a positron with a moderate energy around $1~\textrm{MeV}$. Our results demonstrate strong impacts of the scattering angle and the topological charges on the cross section and distributions in the energy and cone angles of the vortex photons. This could provide insight into off-axis vortex scattering and also a possible approach to distinguishing and detecting vortex electrons by off-axis vortex scattering.</description>

      <title>EPOS4 Model Predictions for Global Observables in Pb-Pb Collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 5.36 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP), a deconfined state of nuclear matter, remains a central focus of high-energy heavy-ion collision experiments. The recent operation of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in Run 3 at the new center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=5.36$ TeV necessitates theoretical predictions to characterize the energy dependence and bulk properties of the medium. In this study, we present comprehensive EPOS4 model predictions for key global observables in Pb-Pb collisions at $5.36$ TeV. We focus on the centrality dependence of the charged-particle pseudorapidity density ($dN_{ch}/d\eta$), integrated yields ($dN/dy$), mean transverse momentum ($\langle p_{T}\rangle$) for light-flavor hadrons ($\pi^{\pm}, K^{\pm}, p(\bar{p})$), and the charged particle nuclear modification factor ($R_{AA}$). The EPOS4 framework successfully captures the strong mass-dependent rise of $\langle p_{T}\rangle$ with multiplicity, a definitive signature of collective radial flow. Furthermore, the predicted charged hadron $R_{AA}$ demonstrates a clear suppression, consistent with energy loss mechanisms incorporated into the model. By comparing these predictions to existing $5.02$ TeV data, we demonstrate that the EPOS4 model offers a consistent and robust description of heavy-ion dynamics, projecting minimal energy evolution for these bulk and hard-probe observables between the two energies.</description>

      <title>Dynamical gluon effects in twist-3 generalized parton distributions of the proton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the Basis Light-Front Quantization framework, we systematically investigate the subleading-twist (twist-3) generalized parton distributions (GPDs) of the proton's valence quarks beyond the Wandzura--Wilczek (WW) approximation. The twist-3 GPDs are not independent; through the equations of motion they decompose into a non-genuine contribution and a genuine twist-3 term. The latter encodes quark--quark--gluon correlations and involves interference between the light-front Fock sectors |qqq&gt; and |qqqg&gt;, which are typically neglected in the WW approximation. Using light-front wave functions obtained from diagonalizing the proton light-front Hamiltonian for its |qqq&gt; and |qqqg&gt; Fock components, we compute these GPDs via their overlap representations. To further explore their physical implications, we also evaluate several twist-3--related quantities, including the quark orbital angular momentum, the total quark spin contribution, and the quark spin--orbit correlation. Our results provide new nonperturbative input on higher-twist dynamics particularly multi-parton interference effects relevant for future measurements at the EicC and the EIC.</description>

Abstract: We assess the accuracy of our previous Asymptotic Pad\'e predictions of the five-loop QCD $\beta$-function and quark mass anomalous dimension in the light of subsequent exact results. We find the low-order coefficients in an expansion in powers of $N_F$ (the number of flavours) were correct to within $1\%$. Furthermore an examination of recent results in $\lambda\phi^4$ theory indicates that the Asymptotic Pad\'e methods deliver predictions which increase in accuracy with loop order. Encouraged by this, we present six-loop Asymptotic Pad\'e predictions for the QCD $\beta$-function and quark mass anomalous dimension, and also for the eight-loop $\beta$-function in $O(N)$ $\lambda\phi^4$ theory.</description>

      <title>Single Production of a Vector-Like Top as a Probe of Charged Higgs Bosons at a Muon-Proton Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the discovery prospects for a vector-like top partner ($T$) within the Type-II Two-Higgs-Doublet Model (2HDM-II) at future high-energy $\mu p$ colliders. The analysis focuses on the charged Higgs decay mode $\mu^+ p \to \nu_\mu\, \bar{b}T \to \nu_\mu\, \bar{b}H^+b$, with the subsequent decay $H^+\to t\bar{b}$ yielding a final state with multiple $b$-jets and a charged lepton. A detailed detector-level simulation is carried out for benchmark configurations with charged Higgs masses around 600-650~GeV and vector-like top masses in the range $m_T \simeq 1.0$-$1.8$~TeV. For an integrated luminosity of 100~fb$^{-1}$, discovery significances above $5\sigma$ are obtained across several benchmark points, remaining robust against systematic uncertainties up to 20\%. At higher luminosities of 234~fb$^{-1}$, the sensitivity exceeds $10\sigma$ for the lightest benchmarks and stays above $5\sigma$ even in the presence of 30\% systematics.</description>

      <title>Pion scattering at finite volume within the Inverse Amplitude Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the effect of a finite volume for pion-pion scattering within Chiral Perturbation Theory (ChPT) and the Inverse Amplitude Method (IAM) in a $L^3$ box (rest frame). Our full ChPT calculation takes into account the discretization not only in the $s$-channel loops but also in the $t,u$- channels and tadpole contributions. Hence, not only the unitarity right-hand cut but also the left-hand one continuum contributions are calculated in the finite volume. A proper extension of the standard Veltman-Pasarino identities is needed, as well as a suitable projection on the internal space spanned by the irreducible representations (irreps) of the octahedral group, based on either a finite set of cubic harmonics or the matrices which represent the irreps properly. From the ChPT we construct the IAM in the internal space, which provides the full volume dependence of the interacting energy levels of two-pions scattering in the finite volume. Our results for various low-energy constants sets show sizable corrections with respect to previous analyses in the literature for $ m_\pi L \lesssim 2$, being compatible with energy levels lattice data. We expect that our analysis and results will help to optimize the process of determination of energy levels and phase-shifts with higher accuracy.</description>

      <title>Improving TauFinder Reconstruction at a 10 TeV Muon Collider with the MAIA Detector Concept</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study aims to improve the TauFinder reconstruction algorithm for the MAIA detector concept. Through this work, we seek to increase the reconstruction efficiency and identification of hadronically decaying tau leptons. Through our work, we introduce a dynamic signal cone, known as a shrinking cone, which adjusts its size based on the transverse momentum of the tau candidate. In addition to the already studied one charged hadron and three charged hadron decay modes we extend TauFinder to include decays that consist of one charged hadron and up to two neutral pions. Furthermore, we have developed a tagger that prevents electrons being misidentified as one-prong tau candidates. Applying this tagger results in near-perfect electron rejection with negligible decrease in one-prong tau reconstruction efficiency.</description>

      <title>Rare and Experimentally Challenging Supersymmetry Signatures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.06358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supersymmetry has long played a central role in the search for physics beyond the Standard Model at colliders, providing a comprehensive and internally consistent framework for generating well-motivated experimental signatures. For more than fifteen years of LHC operation, the CMS and ATLAS collaborations have achieved remarkable sensitivity to a wide range of supersymmetric signatures. Despite this unprecedented reach, no conclusive evidence for supersymmetry has emerged. If supersymmetry is nature's solution to outstanding questions in particle physics, it is necessarily challenging to find. In this article, we review supersymmetric signatures that are particularly rare or otherwise challenging, with a focus on searches at the Large Hadron Collider. We highlight experimental challenges relating to detector constraints and analysis difficulties, in addition to model challenges in the interpretation and optimization of searches. We also identify regions of signature space that remain comparatively unconstrained and therefore represent promising targets for future exploration.</description>

Abstract: AMBER (NA66) is a fixed-target facility at the M2 beam line of CERN SPS, which performs worldwide unique research on the internal structure and the excitation spectrum of hadrons. The approved first phase of the experiment focuses on three main physics topics: (i) the measurement of the production cross section of antiprotons in $p-\text{He}$ and $p-p/d$ collisions over a wide energy range; (ii) the precise measurement of the electric form factor of protons at small momentum transfers using a high-energy muon beam; (iii) the determination of pion and kaon quark PDFs through Drell-Yan and charmonium production measurements with negative and positive meson beams. Phase-2 will focus on measurements with an intense kaon beam. The high-energy muon, pion and kaon beams required for these measurements are only available at CERN.</description>

      <title>Lattice QCD determination of the $\gamma Z$ box contribution to the proton weak charge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first lattice QCD determination of the $\gamma Z$ box contribution to parity-violating electron-proton scattering, $\square_{\gamma Z}$ , a key ingredient for the precise tests of the Standard Model via the proton weak charge. Our calculation covers the electron beam energies up to $E =155 MeV$. For the axial-vector component, we achieve reduced uncertainties across the entire energy range compared with phenomenological estimates. For the vector component, the uncertainties remain slightly larger after continuum extrapolation. At $E = 0$, where the vector part vanishes, we obtain $\square_{\gamma Z}= 0.00412(9)$ , reducing the uncertainty by a factor of $2$ relative to the most precise previous determination. Incorporating this result yields an updated weak charge of $Q_{W}^{p}= 0.06987(50)$ . The calculated energy dependence of $\square_{\gamma Z}$ further provides a first-principles input for the upcoming P2 experiment at Mainz, which will operate at the optimized beam energy of $155 MeV$ to extract $Q_{W}^p$.</description>

      <title>Axion Signal Search Using Hybrid Nuclear-Electronic Spin Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.06816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventional nuclear magnetic resonance searches for the galactic axion wind lose sensitivity at low frequencies due to the unfavourable scaling of inductive readout. Here, we propose a hybrid architecture where the hyperfine interaction transduces axion-driven nuclear precession into a high-bandwidth electron-spin readout channel. We demonstrate analytically that this dispersive upconversion preserves the specific sidereal and annual modulation signatures required to distinguish dark matter signals from instrumental backgrounds. When instantiated in a silicon ${ }^{209} \text{Bi}$ donor platform, the hybrid sensor is projected to outperform direct nuclear detection by more than an order of magnitude over the $10^{-16}-10^{-6} \text{eV}$ wide mass range. With collective enhancement, the design reaches a $5 \sigma$ sensitivity to DFSZ axion-nucleon couplings within one year, establishing hyperfine-mediated sensing as a competitive path for compact, solid-state dark matter searches.</description>

      <title>Oscillatory Freeze from Inertial Holographic Dark Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a generalized holographic dark energy model in which the infrared cutoff depends on the Hubble parameter and its first two time derivatives. The inclusion of the $\ddot H$ term introduces a finite relaxation timescale for the horizon degrees of freedom, which can be interpreted as an effective entropic inertia of the holographic vacuum energy. The resulting background dynamics admit late--time solutions in which the cosmic expansion gradually halts.
  In the underdamped regime, the Hubble parameter undergoes exponentially damped oscillations and asymptotically approaches $H\to0$. The scale factor grows monotonically but by a finite amount, while curvature invariants decay exponentially, leading to an asymptotically Minkowski spacetime without future singularities. We confront the full nonlinear background evolution with cosmic chronometer measurements of the Hubble parameter and find good agreement with current late--time expansion data, with a reduced chi--squared $\chi^2/\nu\simeq0.52$. At observable redshifts, oscillatory features are strongly suppressed and remain consistent with existing constraints.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent DESI baryon acoustic oscillation data reveal deviations from $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, conventionally attributed to dynamical dark energy (DE). We demonstrate that these deviations are equally, if not better, explained by interactions between dark matter and dark energy (IDE), without requiring a time-varying DE equation of state. Using a unified framework, we analyze two IDE models--coupled quintessence and coupled fluid--against the latest CMB (Planck, ACT, SPT), DESI BAO, and SN (including DES-Dovekie recalibrated) data. Both IDE scenarios show robust evidence for non-vanishing interactions at the 3-5$\sigma$ level, with marginalized constraints significantly deviating from the $\Lambda$CDM limit. This preference persists even under DES-Dovekie SN recalibration, which weakens dynamical DE evidence. Crucially, for the same number of free parameters, IDE models provide fits to low- and high-redshift data that match or exceed the performance of the CPL dynamical DE parametrization. Our results establish IDE as a physically motivated alternative to dynamical DE, highlighting the necessity of future cosmological perturbation measurements (e.g., weak lensing, galaxy clustering) to distinguish between these paradigms.</description>

      <title>Tachyonic gravitational dark matter production after inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel gravitational mechanism for the non-thermal production of dark matter driven by curvature-induced tachyonic instabilities after inflation. Departing from the commonly studied non-minimal couplings to gravity, our framework considers a real spectator scalar field coupled quadratically to spacetime curvature invariants. We show that the rapid reorganization of spacetime curvature at the end of inflation can dynamically render the dark matter field tachyonic, triggering a short-lived phase of spontaneous symmetry breaking and explosive particle production. As a concrete and theoretically controlled example, we focus on the Gauss-Bonnet topological invariant. By combining analytical estimates with fully non-linear $3+1$ classical lattice simulations, we track the out-of-equilibrium evolution of the system and compute the resulting dark matter abundance. We find that this purely gravitational mechanism can robustly reproduce the observed dark matter relic density over a wide range of masses and inflationary scales, providing also a simple fitting function that enables a lattice-independent application of our results.</description>

      <title>Learning the relations between neutron star and nuclear matter properties with symbolic regression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The equation of state (EOS) of dense matter in neutron stars (NSs) remains uncertain, particularly at supra-nuclear densities where complex nuclear interactions and the potential presence of exotic matter, like hyperons, come into play. The complex relationships existing between nuclear matter and neutron star properties are investigated. The focus is on their nonlinearities and interdependencies. In our analysis, we apply a machine learning algorithm known as symbolic regression, paired with principal component analysis, to datasets generated from Bayesian inference over relativistic mean-field models. A systematic Principal Component Analysis has allowed to break down the percentage contribution of each element or feature in the relationships obtained. This study examines two main models (datasets): the NL model, which includes nucleonic degrees of freedom; and the NL-hyp model, which includes hyperons in addition to nucleons. Our analysis confirms a robust correlation between the tidal deformability of a 1.4 \(M_\odot\) neutron star and $\beta$-equilibrium pressure at twice the nuclear saturation density. This correlation remains once hyperons are included. The contribution of the different nuclear matter properties at saturation to the radius and tidal deformability was calculated. It was shown that the isovector properties have the largest impact, with a contribution of about 90\%. We also studied the relationship between the proton fraction at different densities and various symmetry energy parameters defined at saturation density. For the hyperon data set, we took into account the effects of the negatively charged hyperon $\Xi$ in order to recover the relationships. Our study reveals the individual impact of various symmetry energy parameters on proton fractions at different densities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-similar quasicrystals (like the famous Penrose and Ammann-Beenker tilings) are exceptional geometric structures in which long-range order, quasiperiodicity, non-crystallographic orientational symmetry, and discrete scale invariance are tightly interwoven in a beautiful way. In this paper, we show how such structures may be generalized from Euclidean space to Minkowski spacetime. We construct the first examples of such Lorentzian quasicrystals (the spacetime analogues of the Penrose or Ammann-Beenker tilings), and point out key novel features of these structures (compared to their Euclidean cousins). We end with some (speculative) ideas about how such spacetime quasicrystals might relate to reality. This includes an intriguing scenario in which our infinite $(3+1)$D universe is embedded (like one of our spacetime quasicrystal examples) in a particularly symmetric $(9+1)$D torus $T^{9,1}$ (which was previously found to yield the most symmetric toroidal compactification of the superstring). We suggest how this picture might help explain the mysterious seesaw relationship $M_{\rm Pl}M_{\rm vac}\approx M_{\rm EW}^{2}$ between the Planck, vacuum energy, and electroweak scales ($M_{\rm Pl}$, $M_{\rm vac}$, $M_{\rm EW}$).</description>

Abstract: We evaluated the emission of a low-mass particle in the system (atomic) transition for the case when the particle Lorentz factor is $10^{18}$ and found that the angular distribution of emission in the laboratory inertial system is strongly affected by the directional variation of the maximum attainable speed of the particle. We show that for a photon mass consistent with the experimental limit, $m_{ph} \leq 10^{-18}$ eV, due to the experimentally known absence of a significant anisotropy of the photon emission by an atom, the anisotropy of the one-way speed of light, $\Delta c_1/c$, is $10^{-37}$ or less. This is many orders of magnitude smaller than previously reported and the limit becomes even stronger for the lower mass of the photon.</description>

      <title>The Spin Structure of the Nucleon</title>

Abstract: We review the present understanding of the spin structure of protons and neutrons, the fundamental building blocks of nuclei collectively known as nucleons. The field of nucleon spin provides a critical window for testing Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), the gauge theory of the strong interactions since it involves fundamental aspects of hadron structure, and it can be probed in detail in experiments, particularly deep inelastic lepton scattering on polarized targets. QCD was initially probed in high energy deep inelastic lepton scattering with unpolarized beams and targets. With time, interest shifted from testing perturbative QCD to illuminating the nucleon structure itself. In fact, the spin degrees of freedom of hadrons provide an essential and detailed verification of both perturbative and nonperturbative QCD dynamics. Nucleon spin was initially thought of coming mostly from the spin of its quark constituents, based on intuition from the parton model. However, the first experiments showed that this expectation was incorrect. It is now clear that nucleon physics is much more complex, involving quark orbital angular momenta as well as gluonic and sea quark contributions. Thus, the nucleon spin structure remains a most active aspect of QCD research, involving important advances such as the developments of generalized parton distributions (GPD) and transverse momentum distributions (TMD). Elastic and inelastic lepton-proton scattering, as well as photoabsorption experiments provide various ways to investigate non-perturbative QCD.

      <title>Modular $S_4$ and $A_4$ Symmetries and Their Fixed Points: New Predictive Examples of Lepton Mixing</title>

Abstract: In the modular symmetry approach to neutrino models, the flavour symmetry emerges as a finite subgroup $\Gamma_N$ of the modular symmetry, broken by the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of a modulus field $\tau$. If the VEV of the modulus $\tau$ takes some special value, a residual subgroup of $\Gamma_N$ would be preserved. We derive the fixed points $\tau_S=i$, $\tau_{ST}=(-1+i\sqrt{3})/2$, $\tau_{TS}=(1+i\sqrt{3})/2$, $\tau_T=i\infty$ in the fundamental domain which are invariant under the modular transformations indicated. We then generalise these fixed points to $\tau_f=\gamma\tau_S$, $\gamma\tau_{ST}$, $\gamma\tau_{TS}$ and $\gamma\tau_{T}$ in the upper half complex plane, and show that it is sufficient to consider $\gamma\in\Gamma_{N}$. Focussing on level $N=4$, corresponding to the flavour group $S_4$, we consider all the resulting triplet modular forms at these fixed points up to weight 6. We then apply the results to lepton mixing, with different residual subgroups in the charged lepton sector and each of the right-handed neutrinos sectors. In the minimal case of two right-handed neutrinos, we find three phenomenologically viable cases in which the light neutrino mass matrix only depends on three free parameters, and the lepton mixing takes the trimaximal TM1 pattern for two examples. One of these cases corresponds to a new Littlest Modular Seesaw based on CSD$(n)$ with $n=1+\sqrt{6}\approx 3.45$, intermediate between CSD$(3)$ and CSD$(4)$. Finally, we generalize the results to examples with three right-handed neutrinos, also considering the level $N=3$ case, corresponding to $A_4$ flavour symmetry.</description>

      <title>Limits on new strongly interacting matter from measurements of Transverse Energy-Energy Correlations at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV at the LHC</title>

Abstract: This work establishes 95% confidence level limits to models incorporating additional fermions sensitive to the strong interaction. Precision measurements of Transverse Energy-Energy Correlations at the ATLAS experiment are used, exploiting their dependence on the strong coupling constant to analyse the effects of introducing new fermions with colour charge on the Renormalisation Group Equation. The comparison between theoretical predictions, corrected up to next-to-next-to-leading order, and the data collected by ATLAS at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV allows to constrain physics models proposing the existence of new fermions with masses up to 4 TeV, independently of assumptions on the fermion decay.</description>

      <title>Elucidating the nature of axial-vector charm-antibottom tetraquark states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15508v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Investigating the electromagnetic characteristics of unconventional states may offer new insights into their internal structures. In particular, the magnetic moment attributes may serve as a crucial physical observable for differentiating exotic states with disparate configurations or spin-parity quantum numbers. As a promising avenue for research, encompassing both opportunities and challenges, an in-depth examination of the electromagnetic properties of exotic states is crucial for advancing our understanding of unconventional states. Motivated by this, in this study, the magnetic moments of $ \rm{I(J^{P})} = 1(1^{+})$ $Z_{\bar b c}$ tetraquark states are analyzed in the framework of QCD light-cone sum rules by considering the diquark-antidiquark approximation, designated as type $3_c \otimes \bar 3_c$. Although the tetraquark states examined in this study have nearly identical masses, their magnetic moment results exhibit noticeable discrepancies. This may facilitate the differentiation between quantum numbers associated with states with identical quark content. The results show that heavy quarks overcoming light quarks can determine both the sign and the magnitude of the magnetic moments of these tetraquark states. The numerical results obtained in this study suggest that the magnetic moments of $Z_{\bar b c}$ tetraquark states may reveal aspects of their underlying structure, which could distinguish between their spin-parity quantum numbers and their internal structure. The results obtained regarding the magnetic moments of the $Z_{\bar b c}$ tetraquark states may be checked within the context of different phenomenological approaches.</description>

      <title>The Spectra of $p\bar\Lambda$ and $p\bar\Sigma$ Hexaquark States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20150v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the observation of the $J^P = 1^+$ resonance $X(2085)$ in the $p\bar{\Lambda}$ system by the BESIII collaboration, we studied the molecular states of hexaquarks $p\bar{\Lambda}$ and $p\bar{\Sigma}$ with baryon-antibaryon structures within the framework of the QCD sum rules. Non-perturbative contributions up to dimension 13 were considered in our analysis. The results indicate the existence of six possible molecular states $p\bar{\Lambda}$ and $p\bar{\Sigma}$, with quantum numbers $J^{P}=0^{-}, 0^{+}, 1^{-}$. Consequently, the current sum rule results do not support the interpretation of $X(2085)$ as a $p\bar{\Lambda}$ or $p\bar{\Sigma}$ molecular state. On the other hand, we find that the masses of the proposed $p\bar{\Lambda}$ and $p\bar{\Sigma}$ structures with $J^{P} = 1^{-}$ are in the vicinity of observed $X(2075)$, which implies that the nature of this state needs more invistigations. Moreover, the possible decay modes of the concerned hexaquark states are analyzed.</description>

      <title>Supernova constraints on lepton flavor violating ALPs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12075v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Supernovae offer a unique hot and dense environment to probe new physics beyond the Standard Model. We investigate supernova cooling constraints on lepton-flavor-violating (LFV) axions and axion-like particles (ALPs) that couple to electrons and muons. For LFV-ALP production in supernovae, muon decay and lepton bremsstrahlung have been considered previously. In this work, we identify the electron-muon coalescence channel as an efficient new production mechanism in the high-mass regime. We also include the semi-Compton scattering process, which has recently been shown to provide sizable contributions for electron-coupled ALPs. We find that muon decay dominates in the low-mass regime, electron-muon coalescence becomes the leading channel at high masses, and semi-Compton scattering provides the dominant contribution in the intermediate mass range. We find that the electron-muon coalescence process yields the strongest constraints in the mass range of $\sim (115,280)$ MeV, probing the ALP-electron-muon coupling down to $\sim 4\times 10^{-10}$ for an ALP mass of $\sim200$ MeV.</description>

Abstract: Millicharged particles are well-motivated dark matter candidates arising in many extensions of the Standard Model. We show that, despite their tiny coupling $e_m$ to photons, millicharged dark matter (mDM) in the Earth's geomagnetic field can generate a quasi-static, monochromatic magnetic signal with angular frequency twice the mDM mass. Using null results from the SuperMAG and SNIPE Hunt collaborations, we constrain the effective charge of bosonic mDM in the mass range $10^{-18}$--$10^{-14}\,\text{eV}$. The resulting upper bounds exceed stellar cooling constraints by over thirteen orders of magnitude, demonstrating the power of this method.</description>

      <title>Investigations of symmetry breakings by multiple condensates on exotic chiral condensed phases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13845v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Nambu-Goldstone modes on the exiotic chiral condensed phase with chiral and tensor-type quark-antiquark condensates are investigated by using of the two-point vertex functions. It is shown that one of the Nambu-Goldstone modes appears as a result of meson-mixing. As is well known, another method to find the Nambu-Goldstone modes is given by the use of the algebraic commutation relations between broken generators and massless modes obtained through the spontaneous symmetry breaking. This method is adopted to the cases of the chiral symmetry breakings due to the tensor-type condensate and the inhomogeneous chiral condensate. The result obtained by the use of the meson two-point vertex functions is obviously reproduced in the case of the tensor-type condensate. Furthermore, we investigate the general rules for determining the broken symmetries and the Nambu-Goldstone modes algebraically. As examples, the symmetry breaking pattern and the Nambu-Goldstone modes due to the tensor-type condensate or the inhomogeneous chiral condensate are shown by adopting the general rules developed in this paper in the algebraic method.</description>

      <title>Probing millicharged particles with NA64$\mu$ and LDMX</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04295v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Millicharged particles emerge as compelling candidates in numerous theoretically well-motivated extensions of the Standard Model. These hypothetical particles, characterized by an electric charge that is a small fraction of the elementary charge, have attracted significant attention in contemporary experimental physics. Their potential existence motivates dedicated search strategies across multiple experimental platforms, leveraging their distinctive electromagnetic interactions while evading conventional detection methods. In the present paper we estimated the projected sensitivity of fixed-target experiments, specifically NA64$\mu$ and LDMX, to the parameter space of millicharged particles. For the NA64$\mu$ experiment, with an anticipated muon flux of $\mbox{MOT}\lesssim 10^{14}$, our analysis reveals a detectable mass window of $10~\mbox{MeV} \lesssim m_\chi \lesssim 150~\mbox{MeV}$ and charge parameter range $10^{-4} \lesssim \epsilon \lesssim 7\times 10^{-4}$. This sensitivity arises from the bremsstrahlung-like missing energy signature $\mu N \to \mu N \gamma^{*}( \to \chi \bar{\chi})$. Furthermore, we evaluate the discovery potential of the LDMX facility, considering its projected electron beam statistics, $\mbox{EOT}\lesssim 2\times 10^{16}$, and energy, $E_{\rm e}\simeq 8~\mbox{GeV}$. Our results demonstrate that LDMX can probe heavier MCPs in the mass range $250~\mbox{MeV} \lesssim m_\chi \lesssim 400 ~\mbox{MeV}$, with sensitivities reaching $10^{-3} \lesssim \epsilon \lesssim 1.5 \times 10^{-3}$. This parametric window can be accessible through the distinctive invisible decay channel $\rho \to \chi \bar{\chi}$, where $\rho$-meson photo-production $\gamma N \to N \rho$ plays a pivotal role.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09670v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The origin of the baryon asymmetry of the universe remains one of the most pressing open questions in particle physics and cosmology. Electroweak baryogenesis offers an experimentally testable explanation, requiring new sources of CP violation and a strong first-order electroweak phase transition.The Two Higgs doublet model (2HDM) is the simplest scalar extension of the Standard Model that can accommodate both ingredients. We critically assess the viability of the complex 2HDM (C2HDM) (a 2HDM with a softly broken $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry and a single source of explicit CP violation in the Higgs sector) as a framework for electroweak baryogenesis, incorporating for the first time a comprehensive set of LHC Run 2 results at 13 TeV. By defining CP-violating benchmark planes tailored for a strong first-order electroweak phase transition, we identify regions of parameter space motivated by electroweak baryogenesis that will be testable at the LHC, and at future space-based gravitational wave experiments. The benchmark planes are intended to guide ongoing efforts in defining representative scenarios for the exploration of CP-violation in extended scalar sectors at the LHC Run 3 and beyond, while also assessing the emerging synergy between the LHC and future gravitational wave observatories such as LISA. We also quantify the current tension between the realisation of electroweak baryogenesis and the non-observation of the electron electric dipole moment (EDM), finding that the predicted electron EDMs typically exceed the experimental limits by at least an order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter in X-rays: Revised XMM-Newton Limits and New Constraints from eROSITA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02310v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate two classes of dark matter (DM) candidates, sub-GeV particles and primordial black holes (PBHs), that can inject low-energy electrons and positrons into the Milky Way and leave observable signatures in the X-ray sky. In the case of sub-GeV DM, annihilation or decay into $e^+e^-$ contributes to the diffuse sea of cosmic-ray (CR) leptons, which can generate bremsstrahlung and inverse Compton (IC) emission on Galactic photon fields, producing a broad spectrum from X-rays to $\gamma$-rays detectable by instruments such as eROSITA and XMM-Newton. For PBHs with masses below $\sim10^{17}$ g, Hawking evaporation similarly yields low-energy $e^\pm$, leading to comparable diffuse emission. Using the first data release from eROSITA and incorporating up-to-date CR propagation and diffusion parameters, we derive new constraints on both scenarios. For sub-GeV DM, we exclude thermally averaged annihilation cross sections in the range $\sim 10^{-27}-10^{-25} \ \mathrm{cm^3/s}$ and decay lifetimes of $\sim 10^{24}-10^{25}$ s for masses between 1 MeV and 1 GeV, with eROSITA outperforming previous X-ray constraints below $\sim$ 30 MeV. For asteroid-mass PBHs, we set new bounds on the DM fraction based on their Hawking-induced emission. Finally, we revisit earlier constraints from XMM-Newton, finding that they were approximately four orders of magnitude too stringent due to the use of the instrument's geometric solid angle rather than its exposure-weighted solid angle. Upon using the exposure-weighted solid angle, we show that the revised XMM-Newton limits are slightly weaker than those from eROSITA.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03255v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the hadronic uncertainty from light-quark loops coupled to (anti)neutrino in low-energy neutral-current (anti)neutrino scattering, estimated at the $3$-$4$ permille level. This uncertainty arises from limited knowledge of the charge-isospin correlation function of quark currents. We study the charge-charge and charge-isospin correlators within $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ and $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ chiral perturbation theory (ChPT). In $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ ChPT, the two correlators are identical to all orders in the chiral and electromagnetic expansions. We further perform a leading-order $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ ChPT calculation and discuss the relevant counterterms. Our findings reduce the hadronic uncertainty in neutral-current processes such as (anti)neutrino-electron and coherent elastic (anti)neutrino-nucleus scattering by a factor $\sim 35$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06416v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutrinos from blazars can originate from inelastic scatterings between protons within their jets and sub-GeV dark matter (DM) around them, explaining IceCube detections of neutrinos from TXS 0506+056 that are otherwise challenging for models of its jet. In this paper we calculate such DM-induced high-energy neutrinos, from TXS 0506+056 as well as from a stacked blazar sample, in the four cases where DM-quark interactions are mediated by a new massive vector, axial, scalar, and pseudoscalar particle. Intriguingly, we find that this mechanism can saturate the diffuse astrophysical neutrino flux observed by IceCube at high energies. Our mechanism will be tested by additional blazar observations and by various searches for sub-GeV DM.</description>

      <title>Two loop QCD corrections to $e^+ e^- \to J/\psi + \eta_c$ in asymptotic expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16317v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within the framework of NRQCD, the short-distance coefficients (SDCs) for the process $e^+e^-\to J/\psi+\eta_c$ have been obtained up to NNLO in asymptotic expansions over $r={16m_c^2}/{s}$ up to $r^{15}$. Although these asymptotic expressions are deviated from the full results near the threshold $r= 1$, they provide excellent approximations to the full results for $r&lt;0.8$, with deviations less than $3\%$. Therefore, these asymptotic expressions offer reliable applications for phenomenological predictions across a wide range of center-of-mass energies $\sqrt{s}$. Utilizing these asymptotic expressions, we present phenomenological predictions for the cross sections in both the on-shell mass scheme and the $\overline{\rm MS}$ mass scheme, with the uncertainty arising from the renormalization scale $\mu_R$ included. The $\mu_R$ uncertainty for predictions from the $\overline{\rm MS}$ mass scheme is slightly larger than that from the on-shell mass scheme, which is partly attributed to the helicity flip in the process $e^+e^-\to J/\psi+\eta_c$. We observe that both mass schemes yield quite similar predictions, and our theoretical results are consistent with the available experimental data.</description>

      <title>Multi-boson splashes at future colliders from electroweak compositeness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19413v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new collider signature for the composite origin of the electroweak symmetry breaking of the standard model. The Higgs sector consists of new fundamental fermions (hyper-quarks), which confine at a hadronization scale $\Lambda_{HC} \sim$ few TeV. At energies above $\Lambda_{HC}$, the Drell-Yan production of the hyper-quarks leads to the production of a few electroweak bosons, in analogy with hadron production in QCD at $e^+e^- \to q\bar{q}$ around a few GeV. We show that this regime can be probed at future colliders, namely the proposed 100 TeV hadron collider (FCC-hh) and a 10 TeV muon collider. Together with the direct discovery of electroweak resonances, the multi electroweak boson signature provides a smoking gun for Higgs compositeness.</description>

      <title>Diagonalising the LEFT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18689v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We organise the four-fermion vector current interactions below the weak scale -- i.e., in the low energy effective field theory (LEFT) -- into irreps of definite parity and $SU(N)$ flavour symmetry. Their coefficients are thus arranged into small subsets with distinct phenomenology, which are significantly smaller than traditional groupings of operators by individual fermion number. As these small subsets only mix among themselves, we show that the renormalisation group evolution is soluble semi-analytically, and examine the resulting eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the one- and two-loop running. This offers phenomenological insights, for example into the radiative stability of lepton flavour non-universality. We use these to study model-independent implications for $b\to s \tau \tau$ decays, as well as setting indirect bounds on flavour changing four-quark interactions.</description>

      <title>The N$^3$LO Twist-2 Matching of TMD Quark Transversity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17568v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (N$^3$LO) calculation of the twist-2 matching coefficients for transverse momentum dependent (TMD) quark transversity parton distribution and fragmentation functions in QCD. This matching relates the TMD quark transversity functions to their collinear counterparts in the large-transverse-momentum regime, and provides essential ingredients for precision TMD phenomenology involving transversely polarized beams. As part of our analysis, we derive the next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) DGLAP splitting functions for collinear transversity, confirming agreement with known space-like results for parton distribution functions and providing the new time-like splitting functions relevant for fragmentation functions. These results extend the perturbative toolkit for spin-dependent observables and establish the transversity sector on the same theoretical footing as unpolarized and helicity distributions. Our findings enable high-precision extractions of transversity PDFs and facilitate improved theoretical predictions for azimuthal asymmetries in semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering (SIDIS), especially in light of forthcoming data from the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC).</description>

      <title>Resonance Contributions to Radiative Corrections in Charged-Current (Anti)Neutrino-Nucleon Elastic Scattering at GeV Energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24011v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first evaluation of virtual resonance contributions to the charged-current (anti)neutrino-nucleon elastic scattering at GeV energies, focusing on the dominant $\Delta(1232)$ resonance. We approximate the vector part of the $N \to \Delta$ transition by the leading magnetic dipole term. Our results for the cross-section corrections at fixed neutrino energy indicate the permille-level contribution of resonance intermediate states to the elastic and radiative scattering cross sections. This calculation exhibits the expected infrared behavior of the invariant amplitudes and unpolarized cross sections. Our findings provide important insights into inelastic excitations in the charged-current (anti)neutrino-nucleon elastic scattering at GeV energies.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic tomography of spin-$\frac{3}{2}$ hidden-charm strange pentaquarks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26893v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding how quarks are spatially arranged inside exotic pentaquarks remains one of the key open problems in contemporary hadron spectroscopy. The electromagnetic multipole moments of hadrons provide a direct probe of their internal quark--gluon geometry and spatial charge distributions. Motivated by this, we employ QCD light-cone sum rules to compute the magnetic dipole, electric quadrupole, and magnetic octupole moments of the $J^P = 3/2^-$ pentaquark with strangeness $S = -1$. Five distinct diquark--diquark--antiquark interpolating currents are constructed to explore possible internal configurations. The resulting electromagnetic moments exhibit pronounced sensitivity to the underlying quark arrangement: magnetic dipole moments range from $-2.28\mu_N$ to $+3.36\mu_N$, establishing this observable as a key discriminator among configurations with identical quantum numbers. Nonzero electric quadrupole and magnetic octupole moments indicate clear deviations from spherical symmetry, while a detailed decomposition shows that light quarks dominate the magnetic response and the charm quark drives quadrupole deformation. These findings position electromagnetic multipole moments as quantitative and discriminating probes of exotic hadron structure, providing concrete benchmarks for forthcoming LHCb, Belle~II, and lattice QCD studies.</description>

      <title>Charm associated production of the pseudoscalar Higgs boson $h''$ in the MCPM' at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17026v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss charm associated production of the pseudoscalar Higgs boson $h''$ in the MCPM'. In our analysis we assume $m_{h''}$ = 95.4 GeV, which corresponds to an enhancement observed by the CMS collaboration in the $\gamma \gamma$ channel. As discussed recently, the MCPM' is consistent with the CMS enhancement. In this model the $h''$ Higgs boson of this mass decays dominantly into $c \bar c$ jets. The cross section for the associated $h''$ production in $p p \to h'' c \bar c$ is found to be almost as big as that for the Drell-Yan (DY) $c \bar c \to h''$ production, much larger than that for two-gluon fusion $g g \to h''$. Since in the MCPM' the dominant $h''$ decay is into the $c \bar c$ channel we have to deal with the $p p \to c \bar c c \bar c$ process with $c$ and $\bar c$ jets. In addition to the signal processes, we have sizeable single parton scattering (SPS) and double parton scattering (DPS) nonresonant background. In our analysis we include diagrams of gluon-gluon fusion $g g \to h''$ which lead to the $c \bar c c \bar c$ final state. We discuss also the possible role of the reaction $p p \to h'' h''$. Assuming 100\% c and $\bar c$ jet tagging we discuss in detail how to improve the signal-to-background ratio. Our analysis shows promising resonance-like enhancements and relatively large cross sections in the $c \bar c c \bar c$ channel within the MCPM'. In an appendix we discuss the total cross section for $h''$ production at the LHC. We also compare distributions for the reactions $p p \to h'' X$ and $p p \to Z X$ with $h''$ and $Z$ decaying to $c\bar c$ and $\mu^{+}\mu^{-}$. We hope that the LHC collaborations will in the future perform the experimental studies corresponding to the theoretical studies discussed here.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17704v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide an elementary pedagogical introduction to some basic concepts and techniques of soft (or Sudakov) resummation, specifically in QCD, paying particular attention to simple but useful tricks of the trade. We briefly review collinear (Altarelli-Parisi) and infrared (eikonal)factorization, cancellation of infrared singularities and factorization of mass singularities. We recall basic concepts on renormalization group invariance and the solution of renormalization group equations. We then show how threshold resummation can be derived from a renormalization group argument following from the cancellation of infrared singularities. We discuss various equivalent forms of the resummed result, and we briefly present transverse momentum resummation.</description>

      <title>Weak Charge Form Factor Determination at the Electron-Ion Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15865v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Determining the weak charge form factor, $F_W(Q^2)$, of nuclei over a continuous range of momentum transfers, $0\lesssim Q^2 \lesssim 0.1$ GeV$^2$, is essential for mapping out the distribution of neutrons in nuclei. The neutron density distribution has significant implications for a broad range of areas, including studies of nuclear structure, neutron stars, and physics beyond the Standard Model. Currently, our knowledge of $F_W(Q^2)$ comes primarily from fixed target experiments that measure the parity-violating longitudinal electron spin asymmetry in coherent elastic electron-ion scattering. Fixed target experiments, such as CREX and PREX-1,2, have provided high-precision weak charge form factor extractions for the $^{48}{\rm Ca}$ and $^{208}{\rm Pb}$ nuclei, respectively. However, a major limitation of fixed target experiments is that they each provide data only at a single value of $Q^2$. With the proposed Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) on the horizon, we explore its potential to impact the determination of the weak charge form factor. While it cannot compete with the precision of fixed target experiments, it can provide data over a wide and continuous range of $Q^2$ values, and for a wide variety of nuclei. We show that for integrated luminosities of $\mathcal{L} &gt; $ 200/$A$ fb$^{-1}$, where $A$ denotes the nucleus atomic weight, the EIC can be complementary to fixed target experiments, and can significantly impact constraints from CREX and PREX-1,2 by lifting degeneracies in theoretical models of the neutron density distribution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.22667v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a generalization of the $x$-space $\texttt{Candia}$ algorithm to next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (N$^3$LO) accuracy in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) for solving the DGLAP evolution equations for unpolarized parton densities in the nucleon. The algorithm is based on logarithmic expansions of the solution and can be extended to all orders in QCD. An expansion equivalent to the exact solution of the DGLAP equation at N$^3$LO is presented in the non-singlet sector. Results for approximate N$^3$LO PDFs, evolved using the most recent approximations to the N$^3$LO DGLAP splitting functions, are provided for benchmarking. The new version of the code, $\texttt{Candia-v2}$, is publicly available at https://github.com/champso1/candia-v2.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24804v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An extension of the Standard Model with $\Gamma_2\simeq S_3$ modular flavor symmetry is presented. We consider the construction of the lepton sector, augmented by two right-handed neutrino states, in the vicinity of the fixed points $\tau = i\infty $ and $\tau = i$. Due to the residual symmetries at these points, and with the aid of non-holomorphic modular forms (which constitute representations of $S_3$) and by assigning specific transformation properties to the fermion fields, highly economical models (without flavon fields) are constructed with interesting Yukawa textures. All presented models strongly prefer the inverted ordering for the neutrino masses.</description>

      <title>Cavity Multimodes as an Array for High-Frequency Gravitational Waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03341v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Microwave cavities operated in the presence of a background magnetic field provide a promising avenue for detecting high-frequency gravitational waves (HFGWs). We demonstrate for the first time that the distinct antenna patterns of multiple electromagnetic modes within a single cavity enable localization and reconstruction of key properties of an incoming HFGW signal, including its polarization ratio and frequency drift rate. Using a 9-cell cavity commonly employed in particle accelerators as a representative example, we analyze the time-domain response of 18 nearly degenerate modes, which can be sequentially excited by a frequency-drifting signal. The sensitivity is further enhanced by the number of available modes, in close analogy to the scaling achieved by a network of independent detectors, enabling sensitivity to astrophysically plausible binary sources.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.04927v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a next-to-leading order QCD sum rule analysis of $J^{PC}=1^{-+}$ light tetraquark states. By investigating various compact tetraquark and molecular configurations, we determine the mass spectrum of these states. Our calculations exclude the possibility that $\pi_{1}(1400)$ is a tetraquark or hybrid-tetraquark mixture. This suggests that it may not exist, which is consistent with recent experimental results. In contrast, we obtained multiple $1^{-+}$ states around $2.0\,\text{GeV}$ that match well with $\pi_{1}(2015)$, which makes us confident that $\pi_{1}(2015)$ is a tetraquark candidate. As for $\pi_{1}(1600)$, our results indicate that the tetraquark currents tend to couple to heavier states, reducing the possibility of it being a tetraquark, while earlier studies suggested the opposite.</description>

      <title>Exploring Lorentz Invariance Violation from Ultra-high-energy Gamma Rays Observed by LHAASO</title>

      <description>arXiv:2106.12350v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently the LHAASO Collaboration published the detection of 12 ultra-high-energy gamma-ray sources above 100 TeV, with the highest energy photon reaching 1.4 PeV. The first detection of PeV gamma rays from astrophysical sources may provide a very sensitive probe of the effect of the Lorentz invariance violation (LIV), which results in decay of high-energy gamma rays in the superluminal scenario and hence a sharp cutoff of the energy spectrum. Two highest energy sources are studied in this work. No signature of the existence of LIV is found in their energy spectra, and the lower limits on the LIV energy scale are derived. Our results show that the first-order LIV energy scale should be higher than about 10^5 times the Planck scale M_{pl} and that the second-order LIV scale is &gt;10^{-3}M_{pl}. Both limits improve by at least one order of magnitude the previous results.</description>

      <title>On an approach to canonicalizing elliptic Feynman integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23720v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present generic expressions for the integrands of canonical bases under maximal cut in elliptic Feynman integral families with multiple kinematic scales. Such integrals frequently arise in phenomenologically relevant scattering processes. The derivation of our results starts from the Legendre normal form of elliptic curves, where the geometric properties of the curves are simple and explicit, and further kinematic singularities are presented as marked points. The simplicity of the normal form allows a straightforward construction of canonical bases with an arbitrary number of marked points. They can then be mapped into any univariate elliptic integral families via an appropriate M\"obius transformation, leading to universal expressions for the integrands. As a demonstration, we discuss the application of our method to several concrete examples, including two new integral families whose canonical bases were not available in the literature. In several examples, we derive canonical bases for the full integral families without any cuts, demonstrating the simplicity of the sub-sector dependence of our canonical bases.</description>

      <title>Perturbation theory of rotating scalar fields and vacuum insensitivity to rotation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04712v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate the finite-temperature perturbation theory of interacting scalar fields under external rotation. Because of the translational non-invariance in the radial direction, Green's functions are described using the Fourier-Bessel basis, instead of the conventional Fourier basis. We derive the leading-order correction to the partition function and the one-loop self-energy. The Feynman rules obtained in our perturbation theory shows that due to the finite-size effect required by the causality constraint, the zero-temperature thermodynamics in the perturbation theory is unaffected by rotation, similarly to that in the noninteracting theory.</description>

      <title>Dynamical systems approach to Cold and Warm Inflation within slow-roll and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10454v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we systematically present a new dynamical systems approach to standard inflationary processes and their variants as constant-roll inflation. Using the techniques presented in our work one can in general investigate the attractor nature of the inflationary models in the phase space. We have compactified the phase space coordinates, wherever necessary, and regulated the nonlinear differential equations, constituting the autonomous system of equations defining the dynamical system, at the cost of a new redefined time variable which is a monotonic increasing function of the standard time coordinate. We have shown that in most of the relevant cases the program is executable although the two time coordinates may show different durations of cosmological events. If one wishes one can revert back to the cosmological time via an inverse transformation. The present work establishes a standard norm for studying dynamical as well as stability issues in any new inflationary system.</description>

      <title>Sound waves from primordial black hole formations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12243v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a numerical investigation of primordial black hole (PBH) formation from super-horizon curvature perturbations and the subsequent generation and propagation of sound waves, which can serve as a new source of stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds (SGWBs) presented in a companion letter. Using the Misner-Sharp formalism with an excision technique, our simulations extend to significantly later times than previous work and indicate that the near-critical perturbations produce a distinct compression wave featuring both overdense and underdense shells, while significantly supercritical perturbations yield only an underdense shell. We also show that a softer equation of state suppresses the formation of compression waves. Furthermore, the comoving thickness of sound shells remains nearly constant during propagation and scales with the Hubble radius at horizon re-entry, thereby serving as a key link between the gravitational-wave peak frequency and PBH mass in the companion letter. These results offer new insights into the dynamics of PBH formation and suggest potential observational signatures of PBHs in the gravitational wave (GW) spectrum from associated sound waves.</description>

      <title>Measurement of medium-induced acoplanarity in central Au-Au and pp collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=200$ GeV using direct-photon+jet and $\pi^{0}$+jet correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05789v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The STAR Collaboration reports measurements of acoplanarity using semi--inclusive distributions of charged--particle jets recoiling from direct photon and $\pi^{0}$ triggers, in central Au+Au and $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}=200$ GeV. Significant medium--induced acoplanarity broadening is observed for large but not small recoil jet resolution parameter, corresponding to recoil jet yield enhancement up to a factor of $\approx20$ for trigger--recoil azimuthal separation far from $\pi$. This phenomenology is indicative of the response of the Quark--Gluon Plasma to excitation, but not the scattering of jets off of its quasiparticles. The measurements are not well--described by current theoretical models which incorporate jet quenching.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the symmetric mass generation paradigm for lattice chiral gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20436v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Within the symmetric mass generation (SMG) approach to the construction of lattice chiral gauge theories, one attempts to use interactions to render mirror fermions massive without symmetry breaking, thus obtaining the desired chiral massless spectrum. If successful, the gauge field can be turned on, and thus a chiral gauge theory can be constructed in the phase in which SMG takes place. In this paper we argue that the zeros that often replace the mirror poles of fermion two-point functions in an SMG phase should be ``kinematical'' singularities. We conjecture that the SMG interactions generate opposite-chirality bound states, which combine with the gapped elementary mirror states to form massive Dirac fermions. The propagator zeros can then be avoided by choosing an appropriate set of interpolating fields that contains both elementary and composite fields. This allows us to apply general constraints on the existence of a chiral fermion spectrum which are valid in the presence of (non-gauge) interactions of arbitrary strength, including in any SMG phase. Using a suitably constructed one-particle lattice hamiltonian describing the fermion spectrum, we formulate a generalized no-go theorem which establishes the conditions for the applicability of the Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem to this hamiltonian. If these conditions are satisfied, the massless fermion spectrum must be vector-like. We add some general observations on the strong coupling limit of SMG models. We also elaborate on the qualitative differences between four-dimensional and two-dimensional theories that limit the lessons that can be drawn from two-dimensional models. Finally, we compile a list of open questions which must be addressed in any SMG model in order to determine whether or not it is subject to the generalized no-go theorem.</description>

      <title>Bayesian constraints on quark stars from multi-messenger observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22781v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform a systematic Bayesian analysis of quark star equations of state under current multimessenger constraints, investigating the impact of prior assumptions and extreme-mass observations. Quark matter is modeled within an interacting MIT bag framework that consistently accommodates color-superconducting phases (2SC, 2SC+s, and CFL) and perturbative QCD corrections. We find that quark star models exhibit a distinct advantage in naturally accommodating the ultra-low mass object HESS J1731-347, a configuration that is challenging for standard neutron star models. In the high-mass regime, the interpretation of the secondary component of GW190814 is shown to be strongly prior-dependent: only broad priors allow for the substantial stiffness required to support such a massive object ($\sim$2.6 M$_\odot$), while more restrictive priors favor a softer equation of state consistent with standard pulsar populations. Microscopically, we demonstrate that current data tightly constrain the effective bag constant and the overall stiffness, but cannot distinguish between different color-superconducting phases. Furthermore, we validate a reduction of the model to two effective parameters without loss of information. Our results indicate that if quark stars exist, their sound speeds consistently exceeds the conformal limit ($c_s^2&gt;1/3$) at stellar densities.</description>

      <title>Generation of High Order Harmonics in Vacuum for Various Configurations of Interacting Electromagnetic Field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09214v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High order harmonic (HOH) generation by interacting extremely intense electromagnetic waves in the quantum vacuum is investigated within the framework of the Heisenberg-Euler formalism. We consider here the process in the lowest order of a perturbation theory relative to the electromagnetic (EM) beam intensity, giving contribution to the HOH generation. The main expressions are obtained for a general geometry, whyle polarizations of different sub-beams forming the EM beam focus are almost the same. Nevertheless, explicit expressions for the HOH generation are derived for the $4\pi$-dipole in-coming waves and for the two crossing Gaussian beams. The former geometry of the EM beam is optimal at a given EM wave power, whereas the latter one is more realistic from the experimental point of view. We consider also a relationship of our present general results with the results, obtained earlier for the HOH generation during of collision of two plane electromagnetic waves.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of Kerr black hole: Tsallis-Cirto composition law and entropy quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00748v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The processes of splitting and merging of black holes obey the composition law generated by the Tsallis-Cirto $\delta=2$ statistics. The same composition law expresses the full entropy of the Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole via the entropies of its outer and inner horizons. He we apply this composition law to the entropy of the Kerr black hole. As distinct from Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole, where the full entropy depends only on mass $M$ and does not depend on its charge $Q$, the entropy of Kerr black hole is the sum of contributions from its mass $M$ and angular momentum $J$, i.e. $S(M,J)=S(M,0) + 4\pi \sqrt{J(J+1)}$. Here $S(M,0)$ is the entropy of the Schwarzschild black hole. This demonstrates that when the Kerr black hole with $J\gg 1$ absorbs or emits a massless particle with spin $s_z=\pm 1/2$, its entropy changes by $|\Delta S| = 2\pi$. We also considered the quantization of entropy suggested by the toy model, in which the black hole thermodynamics is represented by the ensemble of the Planck-scale black holes -- Planckons.</description>

      <title>Color-superconducting quarkyonic matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03517v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the role of color superconductivity in quarkyonic matter under the conditions of color and electric neutrality at $\beta$- and strong equilibrium, as relevant for neutron stars. By explicitly incorporating the color-superconducting pairing gap into the phenomenological model of a smooth transition from hadron to quark matter, we extend the known quarkyonic framework to include this essential aspect relevant at high densities. The momentum dependence of the pairing gap, motivated by the running of the QCD coupling and introduced similarly to chiral quark models with nonlocal interaction, is a novel element of the model that is crucial for enabling the simultaneous onset of all color-flavor quark states in the presence of color superconductivity. While asymptotically conformal behavior of the present model is ensured by construction, we demonstrate that reaching the conformal limit in agreement with the predictions of perturbative QCD is provided by the proper momentum dependence of the thickness of the hadron shell in momentum space. We employ the flexible meta-modeling approach to nuclear matter, analyzing the structure of the hadron shell in momentum space and focusing on the effects of color superconductivity in quarkyonic matter. Similar to the effects induced by the onset of the quarkyonic phase, color superconductivity leads to stiffening of the equation of state of the NS matter. This causes a significant impact on observable properties of neutron stars, which are analyzed and compared to recent astrophysical and theoretical constraints. We argue that the developed model of color-superconducting quarkyonic matter provides a new, consistent tool for studying the scenario of smooth quark-hadron transition in NSs.</description>

      <title>New ultralight scalar particles and the mass-radius relation of white dwarfs -- the important role of Sirius B</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06312v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the equation of state for two classes of new ultralight particles, a scalar field coupling to electrons and a light $\mathbb{Z}_\mathcal{N}$ QCD axion field coupling to nucleons. Both are potential candidates for dark matter. Using the scalar modified equations of state, we calculate models for white dwarf stars and compare their radii and masses with observed mass-radius data. The comparison results in stringent constraints on the masses of the particles and the coupling parameters. For a wide range of particle masses and coupling parameters, constraints from the white dwarf equation of state surpass existing limits, outperforming also dedicated laboratory searches. The remarkable accuracy of modern white-dwarf mass-radius relation data, exemplified by Sirius B, now allows stringent tests of dense-matter physics and constraints on new particle scenarios.</description>

      <title>Infrared Quantum Electrodynamics and the Rayleigh-Jeans Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13943</link>

Abstract: Infrared quantum electrodynamics (IR-QED) acquires a natural geometric interpretation once soft photons are described as adiabatically transported electron-photon clouds. Within this framework, the relevant infrared structure is encoded in a functional Berry phase associated with the space of gauge connections, and the corresponding Berry corrections modify the Rayleigh-Jeans spectrum. The infrared scaling symmetry of the Rayleigh-Jeans law leads to a simple renormalization-group equation whose solution determines the frequency dependence of an effective factor $F_{\rm eff}(\omega)$ controlling the strength of the electron-photon cloud dressing. As a result, the energy density of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) receives a Berry-induced correction that scales as a power law and produces a frequency-dependent temperature excess in the radio domain. Although the exponent $\gamma$ governing this scaling behaviour is not fixed internally by the present formulation of IR-QED and must instead be determined phenomenologically, the existence and structure of the excess are genuine predictions of the theory. Remarkably, the resulting expression is extremely simple and naturally aligns with the deviations suggested by the ARCADE 2 data. Taken together, these results indicate that Berry phases in IR-QED may lead to observable consequences in the low-frequency tail of the CMB spectrum.</description>

      <title>Gauge theories from scattering amplitudes with minimal assumptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21664v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the emergence of a Yang-Mills symmetry in theories with massless spin 1 particles from fundamental physical properties of scattering amplitudes. In the standard proofs, some symmetry and reality properties of the coupling constants in three-point amplitudes are assumed. These properties cannot be justified using only three-point amplitudes but we show that they arise as consequences of the consistent factorization of four-particle amplitudes, for particular choices of the particle basis. This applies to self-interactions of massless spin 1 particles and also to their interactions with spin 0 and 1/2 particles. CP invariance is a derived property, not an additional assumption. The situation for gravity interactions is analogous and it is dealt with in the same fashion.</description>

      <title>Modifications in clusterization procedures for heavy-ion collisions: minimum spanning tree, simulated annealing, coalescence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02084v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new open-source cluster finding library ''Common Clusterization Library'' (CCL) is proposed to describe the clusters production when applied to the transport codes. The new library was applied to the Parton-Hadron-Quantum-Molecular Dynamics approach to be comparable with the established and well known MST and SACA implementations on the exactly same set of the events. The presented procedures were tested with rapidity density distributions and complex observables like $\langle M_{imf} \rangle$ and $\langle Z_{\text{max}} \rangle$ vs $Z_{bound}2$ at the energies of ALADiN and NA49 experiments. An improvement to the simulated annealing chain is proposed to reduce the computational time. The new stable clusters tracking algorithm for the ''lost'' cluster recovering is presented. The results of the ''box-like'' coalescence procedure and a mixed method which incorporates the coalescence algorithm steps and the negative binding energy criteria are presented. The difference between the Helium-3 found by the MST-based cluster finding procedure and the coalescence algorithm applied on the exactly same set of events and baryons is shown for the first time.</description>

      <title>Wet Hair: Global Symmetries in Entanglement Islands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11025v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A central conjecture in quantum gravity is the non-existence of global symmetries. As a fully unitary theory, there is no information loss in a UV complete quantum gravity theory. We see both these concepts reflected in the AdS/CFT correspondence, which tells us that dynamical processes in AdS are fully captured by a manifestly unitary CFT with no information loss. Furthermore, global symmetries of the CFT are dual to gauge symmetries in the AdS, which implies no global symmetry in the AdS. In this work, we provide concrete evidence for the connection between the non-existence of global symmetries and the absence of information loss in quantum gravity. We study the $\textit{island setups}$ in which a gravitational AdS is coupled with a nongravitational bath on its boundary. In such theories, the information in the AdS can be lost to the bath. We provide concrete examples with global symmetries in the island setup, from both the bottom-up and the top-down perspectives. We argue that these global symmetries are consistent due to $\textit{entanglement islands}$, in which holography is realized in a novel fashion. The global symmetries we construct are all mixed with spontaneously broken gauge symmetries. We will show that this fact has two implications: $\textbf{1)}$ The black hole hair is detectable in the bath (``wet hair"); $\textbf{2)}$ a resolution of a puzzle proposed by Harlow and Shaghoulian.</description>

      <title>Particle production and Higgs reheating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21658v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reheating is essential for transforming the cold, vacuum dominated Universe at the end of inflation into the hot thermal bath required by the Standard Model. In many well motivated inflationary models, however, the inflaton has no direct couplings to other fields, raising the question of how the Universe becomes repopulated with particles. We address this question within the framework of geometric reheating, where energy transfer occurs purely through gravitational effects. Focusing on a Higgs inflationary scenario with a non-minimal curvature coupling $\xi \phi^2 R$, we derive the post-inflationary dynamics and compute particle production using the Bogoliubov formalism. We show that the rapid, oscillatory evolution of the curvature scalar after inflaton acts as a time dependent gravitational pump, creating scalar spectator particles even in the absence of explicit interactions. This curvature driven production mechanism provides a natural and efficient route to reheating, demonstrating that gravity alone can initiate the standard thermal history and bridge inflation with radiation domination in minimal, coupling free models of the early Universe.</description>
