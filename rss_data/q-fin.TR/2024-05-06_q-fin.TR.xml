      <title>Price-Aware Automated Market Makers: Models Beyond Brownian Prices and Static Liquidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a suite of models for price-aware automated market making platforms willing to optimize their quotes. These models incorporate advanced price dynamics, including stochastic volatility, jumps, and microstructural price models based on Hawkes processes. Additionally, we address the variability in demand from liquidity takers through models that employ either Hawkes or Markov-modulated Poisson processes. Each model is analyzed with particular emphasis placed on the complexity of the numerical methods required to compute optimal quotes.</description>

      <title>The Democratization of Wealth Management: Hedged Mutual Fund Blockchain Protocol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop several innovations designed to bring the best practices of traditional investment funds to the blockchain landscape. Our innovations combine the superior mechanisms of mutual funds and hedge funds. Specifically, we illustrate how fund prices can be updated regularly like mutual funds and performance fees can be charged like hedge funds. We show how mutually hedged blockchain investment funds can operate with investor protection schemes - high water marks - and measures to offset trading slippage when redemptions happen. We provide detailed steps - including mathematical formulations and instructive pointers - to implement these ideas as blockchain smart contracts. We discuss how our designs overcome several blockchain bottlenecks and how we can make smart contracts smarter. We provide numerical illustrations of several scenarios related to the mechanisms we have tailored for blockchain implementation.
  The concepts we have developed for blockchain implementation can also be useful in traditional financial funds to calculate performance fees in a simplified manner. We highlight two main issues with the operation of mutual funds and hedge funds and show how blockchain technology can alleviate those concerns. The ideas developed here illustrate on one hand, how blockchain can solve many issues faced by the traditional world and on the other hand, how many innovations from traditional finance can benefit decentralized finance and speed its adoption. This becomes an example of symbiosis between decentralized and traditional finance - bringing these two realms closer and breaking down barriers between such artificial distinctions - wherein the future will be about providing better risk adjusted wealth appreciation opportunities to end customers through secure, reliable, accessible and transparent services - without getting too caught up about how such services are being rendered.</description>

      <title>Non cooperative Liquidity Games and their application to bond market trading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new type of game, the Liquidity Game. We draw inspiration from the UK government bond market and apply game theoretic approaches to its analysis. In Liquidity Games, market participants (agents) use non-cooperative games where the players' utility is directly defined by the liquidity of the game itself, offering a paradigm shift in our understanding of market dynamics. Each player's utility is intricately linked to the liquidity generated within the game, making the utility endogenous and dynamic. Players are not just passive recipients of utility based on external factors but active participants whose strategies and actions collectively shape and are shaped by the liquidity of the market. This reflexivity introduces a level of complexity and realism previously unattainable in conventional models.
  We apply Liquidity Game theoretic approaches to a simple UK bond market interaction and present results for market design and strategic behavior of participants. We tackle one of the largest issues within this mechanism, namely what strategy should market makers utilize when uncertain about the type of market maker they are interacting with, and what structure might regulators wish to see.</description>
