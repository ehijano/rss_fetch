      <title>Statistics on $\ell$-interval parking functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The displacement of a car with respect to a parking function is the number of spots it must drive past its preferred spot in order to park. An $\ell$-interval parking function is one in which each car has displacement at most $\ell$. Among our results, we enumerate $\ell$-interval parking functions with respect to statistics such as inversion, displacement, and major index. We show that $1$-interval parking functions with fixed displacement exhibit a cyclic sieving phenomenon. We give closed formulas for the number of $1$-interval parking functions with a fixed number of inversions. We prove that a well-known bijection of Foata preserves the set of $\ell$-interval parking functions exactly when $\ell\leq 2$ or $\ell\geq n-2$, which implies that the inversion and major index statistics are equidistributed in these cases.</description>

      <title>A simple proof of a $(p,2)$-theorem for non-piercing regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A family of sets satisfies the $(p,2)$-property if among any $p$ sets in the family, some two intersect. Two recent works used elaborate geometric techniques to show that any family of non-piercing regions in the plane that satisfies the $(p,2)$-property can be pierced by $O(p^9)$ points. In this note we show that even in a much more general setting, piercing by $O(p)$ points can be deduced from known results on hypergraphs with a hereditarily linear Delaunay graph, which include intersection hypergraphs of non-piercing regions.</description>

      <title>Spanning k-trees, odd [1,b]-factors and spectral radius in binding graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The binding number of a graph $G$, written as $\mbox{bind}(G)$, is defined by $$ \mbox{bind}(G)=\min\left\{\frac{|N_G(X)|}{|X|}:\emptyset\neq X\subseteq V(G),N_G(X)\neq V(G)\right\}. $$ A graph $G$ is called $r$-binding if $\mbox{bind}(G)\geq r$. An odd $[1,b]$-factor of a graph $G$ is a spanning subgraph $F$ with $d_F(v)\in\{1,3,\ldots,b\}$ for all $v\in V(G)$, where $b\geq1$ is an odd integer. A spanning $k$-tree of a connected graph $G$ is a spanning tree $T$ with $d_T(v)\leq k$ for every $v\in V(G)$. In this paper, we first show a tight sufficient condition with respect to the adjacency spectral radius for connected $\frac{1}{b}$-binding graphs to have odd $[1,b]$-factors, which generalizes Fan and Lin's previous result [D. Fan, H. Lin, Binding number, $k$-factor and spectral radius of graphs, Electron. J. Combin. 31(1) (2024) \#P1.30] and partly improves Fan, Liu and Ao's previous result [A. Fan, R. Liu, G. Ao, Spectral radius, odd $[1,b]$-factor and spanning $k$-tree of 1-binding graphs, Linear Algebra Appl. 705 (2025) 1--16]. Then we put forward a tight sufficient condition via the adjacency spectral radius for connected $\frac{1}{k-2}$-binding graphs to have spanning $k$-trees, which partly improves Fan, Liu and Ao's previous result [A. Fan, R. Liu, G. Ao, Spectral radius, odd $[1,b]$-factor and spanning $k$-tree of 1-binding graphs, Linear Algebra Appl. 705 (2025) 1--16].</description>

      <title>Volumes of moduli spaces of directed ribbon graphs and Cut-and-Join operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the algebraic structure underlying the acyclic decomposition. This decomposition applies to directed metric ribbon graphs and enables the recursive computation of the volumes of their moduli spaces. Building on this, we define integral operators with these volumes and show that they satisfy a Cut-and-Join type equation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a suitable specialization of these operators gives rise to a generating series for \textit{dessins d'enfants}.</description>

      <title>Exact Tur\'{a}n densities in triple systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove several new Tur\'{a}n density results for $3$-graphs. We show: $\pi(C_4^3, \mathrm{complement\ of\ } F_5) = 2\sqrt{3} - 3$, $\pi(F_{3,2}, C_5^{3-}) = \frac{2}{9}$, and $\pi(F_{3,2}, \mathrm{induced\ complement\ of\ } F_{3,2}) = \frac{3}{8}$. The first result confirms the conjecture of Shi~[On Tur\'an denisties of small triple graphs, European J. Combin. 52 (2016) 95-102]. The other results give several special non-principal family posed by Mubayi and R\"odl~[On the Tur\'an number of triple systems, J. Combin. Theory A. 100 (2002) 135-152].</description>

      <title>Deterministic simplicial complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate simplicial complexes deterministically growing from a single vertex. In the first step, a vertex and an edge connecting it to the primordial vertex are added. The resulting simplicial complex has a 1-dimensional simplex and two 0-dimensional faces (the vertices). The process continues recursively: On the $n$-th step, every existing $d-$dimensional simplex ($d\leq n-1$) joins a new vertex forming a $(d+1)-$dimensional simplex; all $2^{d+1}-2$ new faces are also added so that the resulting object remains a simplicial complex. The emerging simplicial complex has intriguing local and global characteristics. The number of simplices grows faster than $n!$, and the upper-degree distributions follow a power law. Here, the upper degree (or $d$-degree) of a $d$-simplex refers to the number of $(d{+}1)$-simplices that share it as a face. Interestingly, the $d$-degree distributions evolve quite differently for different values of $d$. We compute the Hodge Laplacian spectra of simplicial complexes and show that the spectral and Hausdorff dimensions are infinite. We also explore a constrained version where the dimension of the added simplices is fixed to a finite value $m$. In the constrained model, the number of simplices grows exponentially. In particular, for $m=1$, the spectral dimension is $2$. For $m=2$, the spectral dimension is finite, and the degree distribution follows a power law, while the $1$-degree distribution decays exponentially.</description>

      <title>Cocompact unfolding trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper will show when a rooted path tree of a finite directed rooted graph has only finitely many orbits under the action of its undirected automorphism group (i.e. when it is cocompact). This will allow us to specify which trees are almost isomorphic to cocompact trees. We will provide an algorithm that will determine this, thus mostly answering question (1) from arXiv:2212.07205.</description>

      <title>Evasive sets, twisted varieties, and container-clique trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the affine space $\mathbb{F}_q^n$ over the finite field of order $q$, a point set $S$ is said to be $(d,k,r)$-evasive if the intersection between $S$ and any variety, of dimension $k$ and degree at most $d$, has cardinality less than $r$. As $q$ tends to infinity, the size of a $(d,k,r)$-evasive set in $\mathbb{F}_q^n$ is at most $O\left(q^{n-k}\right)$ by a simple averaging argument. We exhibit the existence of such evasive sets of sizes at least $\Omega\left(q^{n-k}\right)$ for much smaller values of $r$ than previously known constructions, and establish an enumerative upper bound $2^{O(q^{n-k})}$ for the total number of such evasive sets. The existence result is based on our study of twisted varieties. In the projective space $\mathbb{P}^n$ over an algebraically closed field, a variety $V$ is said to be $d$-twisted if the intersection between $V$ and any variety, of dimension $n - \dim(V)$ and degree at most $d$, has dimension zero. We prove an upper bound on the smallest possible degree of twisted varieties which is best possible in a mild sense. The enumeration result includes a new technique for the container method which we believe is of independent interest. To illustrate the potential of this technique, we give a simpler proof of a result by Chen--Liu--Nie--Zeng that characterizes the maximum size of a collinear-triple-free subset in a random sampling of $ \mathbb{F}_q^2$ up to polylogarithmic factors.</description>

      <title>A constructive characterization of uniformly 4-connected graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A constructive characterization of the class of uniformly $4$-connected graphs is presented. The characterization is based on the application of graph operations to appropriate vertex and edge sets in uniformly $4$-connected graphs, that is, any uniformly $4$-connected graph can be obtained from $C_5^2$ or $C_6^2$ by a number of $\Delta_1^+$ or $\Delta_2^+$-operations to quasi $4$-compatible sets.</description>

      <title>Regular sets in Cayley sum graphs on generalized dicyclic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a graph $\Gamma=(V(\Gamma),E(\Gamma))$, a subset $C$ of $V(\Gamma)$ is called an $(\alpha,\beta)$-regular set in $\Gamma$, if every vertex of $C$ is adjacent to exactly $\alpha$ vertices of $C$ and every vertex of $V(\Gamma)\setminus C$ is adjacent to exactly $\beta$ vertices of $C$. In particular, if $C$ is an $(\alpha,\beta)$-regular set in some Cayley sum graph of a finite group $G$ with connection set $S$, then $C$ is called an $(\alpha,\beta)$-regular set of $G$. In this paper, we consider a generalized dicyclic group $G$ and for each subgroup $H$ of $G$, by giving an appropriate connection set $S$, we determine each possibility for $(\alpha,\beta)$ such that $H$ is an $(\alpha,\beta)$-regular set of $G$.</description>

      <title>Constructing Optimal Kobon Triangle Arrangements via Table Encoding, SAT Solving, and Heuristic Straightening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new methods and results for constructing optimal Kobon triangle arrangements. First, we introduce a compact table notation for describing arrangements of pseudolines, enabling the representation and analysis of complex cases, including symmetrical arrangements, arrangements with parallel lines, and arrangements with multiple-line intersection points. Building on this, we provide a simple heuristic method and tools for recovering straight-line arrangements from a given table, with the ability to enforce additional properties such as symmetries. The tool successfully recovers arrangements for many previously known optimal solutions. Additionally, we develop a tool that transforms the search for optimal Kobon arrangement tables into a SAT problem, allowing us to leverage modern SAT solvers (specifically Kissat) to efficiently find new solutions or to show that no other solutions exist (for example, confirming that no optimal solution exists in the 11-line case). Using these techniques, we find new optimal Kobon arrangements for 23 and 27 lines, along with several other new results.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although algebraic matroids were discovered in the 1930s, interest in them was largely dormant until their recent use in applications of algebraic geometry. Because nonlinear algebra is computationally challenging, it is easier to work with an isomorphic linear matroid if one exists. We describe an explicit construction that produces a linear representation over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero starting with the data used in applications. We will also discuss classical examples of algebraic matroids in the modern language of polynomial ideals, illustrating how the existence of an isomorphic linear matroid depends on properties of the field.</description>

Abstract: The ideals generated by fold products of linear forms are generalizations of powers of defining ideals of star configurations, or of Veronese type ideals, and in this paper we study their Betti numbers. In earlier work, the authors together with Yu Xie showed that these ideals have linear graded free resolution, and in this paper we take the study of the homological information about these ideals to the next natural level.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe an algorithmic method to transform a Euclidean wallpaper pattern into a Circle Limit-style picture \`a la Escher. The design goals for the method are to be mathematically sound, aesthetically pleasing and fast to compute. It turns out that a certain class of conformal maps is particularly well-suited for the problem. Moreover, in our specific application, a very simple method, sometimes jokingly called the "Neandertal Method" for its almost brutal simplicity, proves to be highly efficient, as it can easily be parallelized to be run on the GPU, unlike many other approaches.</description>

      <title>Prime Power Residues and Blocking Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $q$ be a fixed odd prime. We show that a finite subset $B$ of integers, not containing any perfect $q^{th}$ power, contains a $q^{th}$ power modulo almost every prime if and only if $B$ corresponds to a blocking set (with respect to hyperplanes) in $\mathrm{PG}(\mathbb{F}_{q}^{k})$. Here, $k$ is the number of distinct prime divisors of $q$-free parts of elements of $B$. As a consequence, the property of a subset $B$ to contain $q^{th}$ power modulo almost every prime $p$ is invariant under geometric $q$-equivalence defined by an element of the projective general linear group $\mathrm{PGL}(\mathbb{F}_{q}^{k})$. Employing this connection between two disparate branches of mathematics, Galois geometry and number theory, we classify, and provide bounds on the sizes of, minimal such sets $B$.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic Structure of the Equilateral Pentagon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The combinatorial structure of the realization space of the euqilateral pentagon linkage is closely related to a tiling of the hyperbolic plane by right-angled pentagons. In this correspondence lower dimensional faces of the tiling correspond to degenerate realizations of the linkage. We extend this combinatorial correspondence to a full conformal parameterization of the space of all such linkaged controlled by one point in the hyperbolic plane. To do so we exploit the symmetry of the realization space, combine it with the Riemann mapping theorem and a normalization procedure introduced by Springborn. The resulting parameterization is "democratic" in the sense of Yoshida Masaaki: All points are treated exactly equal.</description>

      <title>Observables of random spanning trees in random environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this thesis, we study a new disordered system called random spanning tree in random environment (RSTRE) across different families of graphs with varying disorder distributions. We examine several observables as functions of the disorder strength (inverse temperature) $\beta \geq 0$, and compare their values to the extreme cases $\beta = 0$ and $\beta \rightarrow \infty$, which correspond to the uniform spanning tree (UST) and the minimum spanning tree (MST), respectively. The results concerning the diameter are in line with those of arXiv:2311.01808 and arXiv:2410.16830, while the findings on local observables are based on arXiv:2410.16836. This thesis also includes new material on the RSTRE in the Euclidean infinite lattice, as well as a novel result on the diameter of the unweighted UST on a slightly supercritical random graph.</description>

      <title>Linear codes for $b$-symbol read channels attaining the Griesmer bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reading channels where $b$-tuples of adjacent symbols are read at every step have e.g.\ applications in storage. Corresponding bounds and constructions of codes for the $b$-symbol metric, especially the pair-symbol metric where $b=2$, were intensively studied in the last fifteen years. Here we determine the optimal code parameters of linear codes in the $b$-symbol metric assuming that the minimum distance is sufficiently large. We also determine the optimal parameters of linear binary codes in the pair-symbol metric for small dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study approximations of polytopes in the standard model for computing polytopes using Minkowski sums and (convex hulls of) unions. Specifically, we study the ability to approximate a target polytope by polytopes of a given depth. Our main results imply that simplices can only be ``trivially approximated''. On the way, we obtain a characterization of simplices as the only ``outer additive'' convex bodies.</description>

      <title>The Richness of CSP Non-redundancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the field of constraint satisfaction problems (CSP), a clause is called redundant if its satisfaction is implied by satisfying all other clauses. An instance of CSP$(P)$ is called non-redundant if it does not contain any redundant clause. The non-redundancy (NRD) of a predicate $P$ is the maximum number of clauses in a non-redundant instance of CSP$(P)$, as a function of the number of variables $n$. Recent progress has shown that non-redundancy is crucially linked to many other important questions in computer science and mathematics including sparsification, kernelization, query complexity, universal algebra, and extremal combinatorics. Given that non-redundancy is a nexus for many of these important problems, the central goal of this paper is to more deeply understand non-redundancy.
  Our first main result shows that for every rational number $r \ge 1$, there exists a finite CSP predicate $P$ such that the non-redundancy of $P$ is $\Theta(n^r)$. Our second main result explores the concept of conditional non-redundancy first coined by Brakensiek and Guruswami [STOC 2025]. We completely classify the conditional non-redundancy of all binary predicates (i.e., constraints on two variables) by connecting these non-redundancy problems to the structure of high-girth graphs in extremal combinatorics.
  Inspired by these concrete results, we build off the work of Carbonnel [CP 2022] to develop an algebraic theory of conditional non-redundancy. As an application of this algebraic theory, we revisit the notion of Mal'tsev embeddings, which is the most general technique known to date for establishing that a predicate has linear non-redundancy. For example, we provide the first example of predicate with a Mal'tsev embedding that cannot be attributed to the structure of an Abelian group, but rather to the structure of the quantum Pauli group.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.00875v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explain how to encode an algebraic series by a finite amount of data, namely its minimal polynomial, a total order and its first terms with respect to this order, and how to do effective arithmetic on the level of these encodings. The reasoning is based on the Newton-Puiseux algorithm and an effective equality test for algebraic series. We also explain how to derive information about the support of an algebraic series, that is, the vertices and bounded faces of the convex hull of its support. Furthermore, we show how to identify the polynomial and rational solutions of a polynomial equation.</description>

      <title>A unified Erd\H{o}s-P\'{o}sa theorem for cycles in graphs labelled by multiple abelian groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.09488v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1965, Erd\H{o}s and P\'{o}sa proved that there is an (approximate) duality between the maximum size of a packing of cycles and the minimum size of a vertex set hitting all cycles. Such a duality does not hold for odd cycles, and Dejter and Neumann-Lara asked in 1988 to find all pairs ${(\ell, z)}$ of integers where such a duality holds for the family of cycles of length $\ell$ modulo $z$. We characterise all such pairs, and we further generalise this characterisation to cycles in graphs labelled with a bounded number of abelian groups, whose values avoid a bounded number of elements of each group. This unifies almost all known types of cycles that admit such a duality, and it also provides new results. Moreover, we characterise the obstructions to such a duality in this setting, and thereby obtain an analogous characterisation for cycles in graphs embeddable on a fixed compact orientable surface.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.13117v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The identities which are in the literature often called ``bounded Littlewood identities" are determinantal formulas for the sum of Schur functions indexed by partitions with bounded height. They have interesting combinatorial consequences such as connections between standard Young tableaux of bounded height, lattice walks in a Weyl chamber, and noncrossing matchings. In this paper we prove affine analogs of the bounded Littlewood identities. These are determinantal formulas for sums of cylindric Schur functions. We also study combinatorial aspects of these identities. As a consequence we obtain an unexpected connection between cylindric standard Young tableaux and \( r \)-noncrossing and \( s \)-nonnesting matchings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09445v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How small can a set of vertices in the $n$-dimensional hypercube $Q_n$ be if it meets every copy of $Q_d$? The asymptotic density of such a set (for $d$ fixed and $n$ large) is denoted by $\gamma_d$. It is easy to see that $\gamma_d \leq 1/(d+1)$, and it is known that $\gamma_d=1/(d+1)$ for $d \leq 2$, but it was recently shown that $\gamma_d &lt; 1/(d+1)$ for $d \geq 8$. In this paper we show that the latter phenomenon also holds for $d=7$ and $d=6$.</description>

      <title>On the order of the shortest solution sequences for the pebble motion problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20550v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected graph with $N$ vertices. Let $k$ be the number of vertices in a longest path of $G$ such that every vertex on the path is a cut vertex of $G$, and every intermediate vertex of the path is a degree-two vertex of $G$. Let $k$ be the number of vertices of such a longest path of $T$ that every vertex of the path is a cut vertex and that every intermediate vertex of the path is a degree-two vertex of $T$. Let $P=\{1,\ldots,n\}$ be a set of pebbles with $n+k &lt; N$. A configuration of $P$ on $G$ is defined as a function $f$ from $V(G)$ to $\{0, 1, \ldots, n \}$ with $|f^{-1}(i)| = 1$ for $1 \le i \le n$, where $f^{-1}(i)$ is a vertex occupied with the $i$th pebble for $1 \le i \le n$ and $f^{-1}(0)$ is a set of unoccupied vertices. A move is defined as shifting a pebble from a vertex to some unoccupied neighbor. The pebble motion problem on the pair $(G,P)$ is to decide whether a given configuration of pebbles is reachable from another by executing a sequence of moves. In this paper, we show that the length of the shortest solution sequence of the pebble motion problem on the pair $(G,P)$ is in $O(Nn + n^2 \log(\min\{n,k\}))$ if $G$ is a $N$-vertex tree, and it is in $O(N^2 + \frac{n^3}{N-n} + n^2 \log(\min\{n,N-n\}))$ if $G$ is a connected general $N$-vertex graph. We provide an algorithm that can obtain a solution sequence of lengths that satisfy these orders, with the same computational complexity as the order of the length.

      <title>Substructure Analysis and Cycle Enumeration Methods for Oriented Graphs Based on Parameterizing Hermitian Laplacian Matrices by Galois Conjugates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17553v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the principal minors of a parameterized Hermitian Laplacian matrix for oriented graphs. Particularly, we focus on the properties of the matrix for parameters chosen as Galois conjugates of a primitive $p$th root of unity, where $p$ is an odd prime. We demonstrate that under this condition, the product of the corresponding Hermitian Laplacian determinants is an integer power of $p$. This algebraic property forms the basis for a method to enumerate non-vanishing unicyclic graph components within certain substructures. The study is situated within a framework where a variable unit-modulus complex parameter is introduced into the Hermitian Laplacian matrix, which also allows for an examination of relationships among principal minors under different parameters. Our analysis adopts the concept of substructures, defined as vertex-edge pairs $(V',E')$ where edges in $E'$ are not restricted to connecting vertices within $V'$.</description>

Abstract: The base sequences BS(n+1,n) are four sequences of $\pm1$ and lengths n+1,n+1,n,n with zero auto correlation. The base sequence conjecture states that BS(n+1,n) exists for all integers $n&gt;0$ and has been verified for $n\le40$. We present our algorithm and gives construction of BS(n+1,n) for $n=41,42,43$.
  The Normal sequences NS (n) and the Near-normal sequences NNS (n) are subclasses of BS(n+1,n). Yang conjecture asserts that there is a NNS(n) for each even integer n and has been verified for $n\le40$. We found that there is no NNS(n) for n=42 and 44 by exhaustive search, which gives the first counter case of Yang conjecture. We also show that there is no NS(n) for n=41,42,43,44,45 by exhaustive search and proves that no NS(n) exist for $n=8k-2,k \in Z_+$.</description>

This paper determines $\spex\left(n, C_{2k+1}^{\square}\right)$ for all sufficiently large $n$, establishing the unique extremal graph. Here, $C_{2k+1}^{\square}$ is the odd prism -- the Cartesian product $C_{2k+1} \square K_2$ -- where the Cartesian product $G \square F$ has vertex set $V(G) \times V(F)$, and edges between $(u_1,v_1)$ and $(u_2,v_2)$ if either $u_1 = u_2$ and $v_1v_2 \in E(F)$, or ($v_1 = v_2$ and $u_1u_2 \in E(G)$).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03926v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct an explicit Hamiltonian cycle in the state graph of the 5-puzzle on a toroidal 2x 3 grid, a graph with 720 vertices. The cycle is described by a short symbolic sequence of 48 moves over the alphabet {L,R,V}, repeated $15$ times, which can be verified directly. We also find a shorter 24-move sequence whose repetition yields a 2-cycle cover, which can be spliced into a Hamiltonian path. These constructions arise naturally from a general method: lifting Hamiltonian cycles from a quotient graph under the action of the puzzle's symmetry group.
  The method produces compact, human-readable cycle encodings and appears effective in broader settings, suggesting a combinatorial grammar underlying Hamiltonian paths in symmetric configuration spaces.</description>

Abstract: We prove a relatively simple combinatorial characterization of simplicial $d$-spheres on $d+4$ vertices. Our criteria are given in terms of the intersection patterns of a simplicial complex's family of minimal non-faces. Namely, let $\Sigma$ be a simplicial complex on $d+4$ vertices and let $\mathcal{F}=\{A_0,\ldots, A_{n-1}\}$ be its family of minimal non-faces, indices taken in $\mathbb{Z}_n$. Then $\Sigma$ is a $d$-sphere if and only if $n\geq 3$ is odd, successive $A_i$ are disjoint, and the maximum intersections $A_i\cap A_{i+2} \cap A_{i+4} \cap \cdots \cap A_{i+n-3}$ partition the vertex set.</description>

      <title>Cumulants and Limit Theorems for $q$-step walks on random graphs of long-range percolation radius model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11667v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study cumulants of numbers of $q$-step walks on Erd\"os-R\'enyi-type random graphs of long-range percolation radius model in the limit when the number of vertices $N$, concentration $c$, and the interaction radius $R$ tend to infinity. These cumulants can be associated with a formal cumulant expansion of the free energy of matrix models of exponential random graphs widely known in mathematical and theoretical physics.
  We show that in three different asymptotic regimes, the limiting values of $k$-th cumulants ${\cal F}_k^{(q)}$ exist and can be associated with one or another family of tree-type diagrams, in dependence of the asymptotic behavior of parameters $cR/N$ for $q$-step non-closed walks and $c^2R/N^2$ for 3-step closed walks, respectively. In certain cases, we obtain ${\cal F}_k^{(q)}$ in explicit form.
  These results allow us to prove Limit Theorems for the number of non-closed walks and for the number of triangles in corresponding ensembles of large random graphs. As a consequence, we indicate an asymptotic regime when in random graphs that we consider, the average vertex degree remains bounded while the total number of triangles infinitely increases, thus rigorously solving a graph collapse problem known in applications.</description>

      <title>Estimates on the decay of the Laplace-Polya integral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12835v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Laplace--P\'olya integral, defined by $J_n(r) = \frac1\pi\int_{-\infty}^\infty \mathrm{sinc}^n t \cos(rt) \mathrm{d} \, t$, appears in several areas of mathematics. We study this quantity by combinatorial methods; accordingly, our investigation focuses on the values at integer $r$'s. Our main result establishes a lower bound for the ratio $\frac{J_n(r+2)}{J_n(r)}$ which extends and generalises the previous estimates of Lesieur and Nicolas, and provides a natural counterpart to the upper estimate established in our previous work. We derive the statement by purely combinatorial, elementary arguments. As a corollary, we deduce that no subdiagonal central sections of the unit cube are extremal, apart from the minimal, maximal, and the main diagonal sections. We also prove several consequences for Eulerian numbers.</description>

      <title>Covariance Decomposition for Distance Based Species Tree Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16425v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In phylogenomics, species-tree methods must contend with two major sources of noise; stochastic gene-tree variation under the multispecies coalescent model (MSC) and finite-sequence substitutional noise. Fast agglomerative methods such as GLASS, STEAC, and METAL combine multi-locus information via distance-based clustering. We derive the exact covariance matrix of these pairwise distance estimates under a joint MSC-plus-substitution model and leverage it for reliable confidence estimation, and we algebraically decompose it into components attributable to coalescent variation versus sequence-level stochasticity. Our theory identifies parameter regimes where one source of variance greatly exceeds the other. For both very low and very high mutation rates, substitutional noise dominates, while coalescent variance is the primary contributor at intermediate mutation rates. Moreover, the interval over which coalescent variance dominates becomes narrower as the species-tree height increases. These results imply that in some settings one may legitimately ignore the weaker noise source when designing methods or collecting data. In particular, when gene-tree variance is dominant, adding more loci is most beneficial, while when substitution noise dominates, longer sequences or imputation are needed. Finally, leveraging the derived covariance matrix, we implement a Gaussian-sampling procedure to generate split support values for METAL trees and demonstrate empirically that this approach yields more reliable confidence estimates than traditional bootstrapping.</description>

      <title>Bisections of mass assignments by parallel hyperplanes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06924v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove a result on the bisection of mass assignments by parallel hyperplanes on Euclidean vector bundles. Our methods consist of the development of a novel lifting method to define the configuration space--test map scheme, which transforms the problem to a Borsuk--Ulam-type question on equivariant fiber bundles, along with a new computation of the parametrized Fadell--Husseini index. As the primary application, we show that any $d+k+m-1$ mass assignments to linear $d$-spaces in $\mathbb{R}^{d+m}$ can be bisected by $k $ parallel hyperplanes in at least one $d$-space, provided that the Stirling number of the second kind $S(d+k+m-1, k)$ is odd. This generalizes all known cases of a conjecture by Sober\'on and Takahashi, which asserts that any $d+k-1$ measures in $\mathbb{R}^d$ can be bisected by $k$ parallel hyperplanes.</description>
