      <title>Model-based and empirical analyses of stochastic fluctuations in economy and finance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The objective of this work is the investigation of complexity, asymmetry, stochasticity and non-linearity of the financial and economic systems by using the tools of statistical mechanics and information theory. More precisely, this thesis concerns statistical-based modeling and empirical analyses with applications in finance, forecasting, production processes and game theory. In these areas the time dependence of probability distributions is of prime interest and can be measured or exactly calculated for model systems. The correlation coefficients and moments are among the useful quantities to describe the dynamics and the correlations between random variables. However, the full investigation can only be achieved if the probability distribution function of the variable is known; its derivation is one of the main focuses of the present work.</description>

      <title>SpotV2Net: Multivariate Intraday Spot Volatility Forecasting via Vol-of-Vol-Informed Graph Attention Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06249v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces SpotV2Net, a multivariate intraday spot volatility forecasting model based on a Graph Attention Network architecture. SpotV2Net represents assets as nodes within a graph and includes non-parametric high-frequency Fourier estimates of the spot volatility and co-volatility as node features. Further, it incorporates Fourier estimates of the spot volatility of volatility and co-volatility of volatility as features for node edges, to capture spillover effects. We test the forecasting accuracy of SpotV2Net in an extensive empirical exercise, conducted with the components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average index. The results we obtain suggest that SpotV2Net yields statistically significant gains in forecasting accuracy, for both single-step and multi-step forecasts, compared to a panel heterogenous auto-regressive model and alternative machine-learning models. To interpret the forecasts produced by SpotV2Net, we employ GNNExplainer \citep{ying2019gnnexplainer}, a model-agnostic interpretability tool, and thereby uncover subgraphs that are critical to a node's predictions.</description>
