      <title>Online Policy Learning and Inference by Matrix Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Making online decisions can be challenging when features are sparse and orthogonal to historical ones, especially when the optimal policy is learned through collaborative filtering. We formulate the problem as a matrix completion bandit (MCB), where the expected reward under each arm is characterized by an unknown low-rank matrix. The $\epsilon$-greedy bandit and the online gradient descent algorithm are explored. Policy learning and regret performance are studied under a specific schedule for exploration probabilities and step sizes. A faster decaying exploration probability yields smaller regret but learns the optimal policy less accurately. We investigate an online debiasing method based on inverse propensity weighting (IPW) and a general framework for online policy inference. The IPW-based estimators are asymptotically normal under mild arm-optimality conditions. Numerical simulations corroborate our theoretical findings. Our methods are applied to the San Francisco parking pricing project data, revealing intriguing discoveries and outperforming the benchmark policy.</description>

      <title>Separation capacity of linear reservoirs with random connectivity matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We argue that the success of reservoir computing lies within the separation capacity of the reservoirs and show that the expected separation capacity of random linear reservoirs is fully characterised by the spectral decomposition of an associated generalised matrix of moments. Of particular interest are reservoirs with Gaussian matrices that are either symmetric or whose entries are all independent. In the symmetric case, we prove that the separation capacity always deteriorates with time; while for short inputs, separation with large reservoirs is best achieved when the entries of the matrix are scaled with a factor $\rho_T/\sqrt{N}$, where $N$ is the dimension of the reservoir and $\rho_T$ depends on the maximum length of the input time series. In the i.i.d. case, we establish that optimal separation with large reservoirs is consistently achieved when the entries of the reservoir matrix are scaled with the exact factor $1/\sqrt{N}$. We further give upper bounds on the quality of separation in function of the length of the time series. We complement this analysis with an investigation of the likelihood of this separation and the impact of the chosen architecture on separation consistency.</description>

      <title>Uniform Generalization Bounds on Data-Dependent Hypothesis Sets via PAC-Bayesian Theory on Random Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose data-dependent uniform generalization bounds by approaching the problem from a PAC-Bayesian perspective. We first apply the PAC-Bayesian framework on `random sets' in a rigorous way, where the training algorithm is assumed to output a data-dependent hypothesis set after observing the training data. This approach allows us to prove data-dependent bounds, which can be applicable in numerous contexts. To highlight the power of our approach, we consider two main applications. First, we propose a PAC-Bayesian formulation of the recently developed fractal-dimension-based generalization bounds. The derived results are shown to be tighter and they unify the existing results around one simple proof technique. Second, we prove uniform bounds over the trajectories of continuous Langevin dynamics and stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics. These results provide novel information about the generalization properties of noisy algorithms.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Pareto-Smoothed Weighting for High-Dimensional Heterogeneous Treatment Effect Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a growing interest in estimating heterogeneous treatment effects across individuals using their high-dimensional feature attributes. Achieving high performance in such high-dimensional heterogeneous treatment effect estimation is challenging because in this setup, it is usual that some features induce sample selection bias while others do not but are predictive of potential outcomes. To avoid losing such predictive feature information, existing methods learn separate feature representations using the inverse of probability weighting (IPW). However, due to the numerically unstable IPW weights, they suffer from estimation bias under a finite sample setup. To develop a numerically robust estimator via weighted representation learning, we propose a differentiable Pareto-smoothed weighting framework that replaces extreme weight values in an end-to-end fashion. Experimental results show that by effectively correcting the weight values, our method outperforms the existing ones, including traditional weighting schemes.</description>

      <title>Taming False Positives in Out-of-Distribution Detection with Human Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robustness to out-of-distribution (OOD) samples is crucial for safely deploying machine learning models in the open world. Recent works have focused on designing scoring functions to quantify OOD uncertainty. Setting appropriate thresholds for these scoring functions for OOD detection is challenging as OOD samples are often unavailable up front. Typically, thresholds are set to achieve a desired true positive rate (TPR), e.g., $95\%$ TPR. However, this can lead to very high false positive rates (FPR), ranging from 60 to 96\%, as observed in the Open-OOD benchmark. In safety-critical real-life applications, e.g., medical diagnosis, controlling the FPR is essential when dealing with various OOD samples dynamically. To address these challenges, we propose a mathematically grounded OOD detection framework that leverages expert feedback to \emph{safely} update the threshold on the fly. We provide theoretical results showing that it is guaranteed to meet the FPR constraint at all times while minimizing the use of human feedback. Another key feature of our framework is that it can work with any scoring function for OOD uncertainty quantification. Empirical evaluation of our system on synthetic and benchmark OOD datasets shows that our method can maintain FPR at most $5\%$ while maximizing TPR.</description>

      <title>A Notion of Uniqueness for the Adversarial Bayes Classifier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new notion of uniqueness for the adversarial Bayes classifier in the setting of binary classification. Analyzing this notion of uniqueness produces a simple procedure for computing all adversarial Bayes classifiers for a well-motivated family of one dimensional data distributions. This characterization is then leveraged to show that as the perturbation radius increases, certain notions of regularity improve for adversarial Bayes classifiers. We demonstrate with various examples that the boundary of the adversarial Bayes classifier frequently lies near the boundary of the Bayes classifier.</description>

      <title>Neyman Meets Causal Machine Learning: Experimental Evaluation of Individualized Treatment Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A century ago, Neyman showed how to evaluate the efficacy of treatment using a randomized experiment under a minimal set of assumptions. This classical repeated sampling framework serves as a basis of routine experimental analyses conducted by today's scientists across disciplines. In this paper, we demonstrate that Neyman's methodology can also be used to experimentally evaluate the efficacy of individualized treatment rules (ITRs), which are derived by modern causal machine learning algorithms. In particular, we show how to account for additional uncertainty resulting from a training process based on cross-fitting. The primary advantage of Neyman's approach is that it can be applied to any ITR regardless of the properties of machine learning algorithms that are used to derive the ITR. We also show, somewhat surprisingly, that for certain metrics, it is more efficient to conduct this ex-post experimental evaluation of an ITR than to conduct an ex-ante experimental evaluation that randomly assigns some units to the ITR. Our analysis demonstrates that Neyman's repeated sampling framework is as relevant for causal inference today as it has been since its inception.</description>

      <title>Online $\mathrm{L}^{\natural}$-Convex Minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An online decision-making problem is a learning problem in which a player repeatedly makes decisions in order to minimize the long-term loss. These problems that emerge in applications often have nonlinear combinatorial objective functions, and developing algorithms for such problems has attracted considerable attention. An existing general framework for dealing with such objective functions is the online submodular minimization. However, practical problems are often out of the scope of this framework, since the domain of a submodular function is limited to a subset of the unit hypercube. To manage this limitation of the existing framework, we in this paper introduce the online $\mathrm{L}^{\natural}$-convex minimization, where an $\mathrm{L}^{\natural}$-convex function generalizes a submodular function so that the domain is a subset of the integer lattice. We propose computationally efficient algorithms for the online $\mathrm{L}^{\natural}$-convex function minimization in two major settings: the full information and the bandit settings. We analyze the regrets of these algorithms and show in particular that our algorithm for the full information setting obtains a tight regret bound up to a constant factor. We also demonstrate several motivating examples that illustrate the usefulness of the online $\mathrm{L}^{\natural}$-convex minimization.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-Observations and Super Learner for the Estimation of the Restricted Mean Survival Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of right-censored data, we study the problem of predicting the restricted time to event based on a set of covariates. Under a quadratic loss, this problem is equivalent to estimating the conditional Restricted Mean Survival Time (RMST). To that aim, we propose a flexible and easy-to-use ensemble algorithm that combines pseudo-observations and super learner. The classical theoretical results of the super learner are extended to right-censored data, using a new definition of pseudo-observations, the so-called split pseudo-observations. Simulation studies indicate that the split pseudo-observations and the standard pseudo-observations are similar even for small sample sizes. The method is applied to maintenance and colon cancer datasets, showing the interest of the method in practice, as compared to other prediction methods. We complement the predictions obtained from our method with our RMST-adapted risk measure, prediction intervals and variable importance measures developed in a previous work.</description>

      <title>Making Better Use of Unlabelled Data in Bayesian Active Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fully supervised models are predominant in Bayesian active learning. We argue that their neglect of the information present in unlabelled data harms not just predictive performance but also decisions about what data to acquire. Our proposed solution is a simple framework for semi-supervised Bayesian active learning. We find it produces better-performing models than either conventional Bayesian active learning or semi-supervised learning with randomly acquired data. It is also easier to scale up than the conventional approach. As well as supporting a shift towards semi-supervised models, our findings highlight the importance of studying models and acquisition methods in conjunction.</description>

      <title>Lazy Data Practices Harm Fairness Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data practices shape research and practice on fairness in machine learning (fair ML). Critical data studies offer important reflections and critiques for the responsible advancement of the field by highlighting shortcomings and proposing recommendations for improvement. In this work, we present a comprehensive analysis of fair ML datasets, demonstrating how unreflective yet common practices hinder the reach and reliability of algorithmic fairness findings. We systematically study protected information encoded in tabular datasets and their usage in 280 experiments across 142 publications.
  Our analyses identify three main areas of concern: (1) a \textbf{lack of representation for certain protected attributes} in both data and evaluations; (2) the widespread \textbf{exclusion of minorities} during data preprocessing; and (3) \textbf{opaque data processing} threatening the generalization of fairness research. By conducting exemplary analyses on the utilization of prominent datasets, we demonstrate how unreflective data decisions disproportionately affect minority groups, fairness metrics, and resultant model comparisons. Additionally, we identify supplementary factors such as limitations in publicly available data, privacy considerations, and a general lack of awareness, which exacerbate these challenges. To address these issues, we propose a set of recommendations for data usage in fairness research centered on transparency and responsible inclusion. This study underscores the need for a critical reevaluation of data practices in fair ML and offers directions to improve both the sourcing and usage of datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adversarial training is a common technique for learning robust classifiers. Prior work showed that convex surrogate losses are not statistically consistent in the adversarial context -- or in other words, a minimizing sequence of the adversarial surrogate risk will not necessarily minimize the adversarial classification error. We connect the consistency of adversarial surrogate losses to properties of minimizers to the adversarial classification risk, known as \emph{adversarial Bayes classifiers}. Specifically, under reasonable distributional assumptions, a convex loss is statistically consistent for adversarial learning iff the adversarial Bayes classifier satisfies a certain notion of uniqueness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Power systems operate under uncertainty originating from multiple factors that are impossible to account for deterministically. Distributional forecasting is used to control and mitigate risks associated with this uncertainty. Recent progress in deep learning has helped to significantly improve the accuracy of point forecasts, while accurate distributional forecasting still presents a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel general approach for distributional forecasting capable of predicting arbitrary quantiles. We show that our general approach can be seamlessly applied to two distinct neural architectures leading to the state-of-the-art distributional forecasting results in the context of short-term electricity demand forecasting task. We empirically validate our method on 35 hourly electricity demand time-series for European countries. Our code is available here: https://github.com/boreshkinai/any-quantile.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To optimize efficiently over discrete data and with only few available target observations is a challenge in Bayesian optimization. We propose a continuous relaxation of the objective function and show that inference and optimization can be computationally tractable. We consider in particular the optimization domain where very few observations and strict budgets exist; motivated by optimizing protein sequences for expensive to evaluate bio-chemical properties. The advantages of our approach are two-fold: the problem is treated in the continuous setting, and available prior knowledge over sequences can be incorporated directly. More specifically, we utilize available and learned distributions over the problem domain for a weighting of the Hellinger distance which yields a covariance function. We show that the resulting acquisition function can be optimized with both continuous or discrete optimization algorithms and empirically assess our method on two bio-chemical sequence optimization tasks.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Federated Inference for Survival Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In cancer research, overall survival and progression free survival are often analyzed with the Cox model. To estimate accurately the parameters in the model, sufficient data and, more importantly, sufficient events need to be observed. In practice, this is often a problem. Merging data sets from different medical centers may help, but this is not always possible due to strict privacy legislation and logistic difficulties. Recently, the Bayesian Federated Inference (BFI) strategy for generalized linear models was proposed. With this strategy the statistical analyses are performed in the local centers where the data were collected (or stored) and only the inference results are combined to a single estimated model; merging data is not necessary. The BFI methodology aims to compute from the separate inference results in the local centers what would have been obtained if the analysis had been based on the merged data sets. In this paper we generalize the BFI methodology as initially developed for generalized linear models to survival models. Simulation studies and real data analyses show excellent performance; i.e., the results obtained with the BFI methodology are very similar to the results obtained by analyzing the merged data. An R package for doing the analyses is available.</description>

      <title>Conformal Prediction with Learned Features</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on the problem of conformal prediction with conditional guarantees. Prior work has shown that it is impossible to construct nontrivial prediction sets with full conditional coverage guarantees. A wealth of research has considered relaxations of full conditional guarantees, relying on some predefined uncertainty structures. Departing from this line of thinking, we propose Partition Learning Conformal Prediction (PLCP), a framework to improve conditional validity of prediction sets through learning uncertainty-guided features from the calibration data. We implement PLCP efficiently with alternating gradient descent, utilizing off-the-shelf machine learning models. We further analyze PLCP theoretically and provide conditional guarantees for infinite and finite sample sizes. Finally, our experimental results over four real-world and synthetic datasets show the superior performance of PLCP compared to state-of-the-art methods in terms of coverage and length in both classification and regression scenarios.</description>

Abstract: Contrastive learning is a model pre-training technique by first creating similar views of the original data, and then encouraging the data and its corresponding views to be close in the embedding space. Contrastive learning has witnessed success in image and natural language data, thanks to the domain-specific augmentation techniques that are both intuitive and effective. Nonetheless, in tabular domain, the predominant augmentation technique for creating views is through corrupting tabular entries via swapping values, which is not as sound or effective. We propose a simple yet powerful improvement to this augmentation technique: corrupting tabular data conditioned on class identity. Specifically, when corrupting a specific tabular entry from an anchor row, instead of randomly sampling a value in the same feature column from the entire table uniformly, we only sample from rows that are identified to be within the same class as the anchor row. We assume the semi-supervised learning setting, and adopt the pseudo labeling technique for obtaining class identities over all table rows. We also explore the novel idea of selecting features to be corrupted based on feature correlation structures. Extensive experiments show that the proposed approach consistently outperforms the conventional corruption method for tabular data classification tasks.

      <title>Structured Conformal Inference for Matrix Completion with Applications to Group Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a conformal inference method to construct joint confidence regions for structured groups of missing entries within a sparsely observed matrix. This method is useful to provide reliable uncertainty estimation for group-level collaborative filtering; for example, it can be applied to help suggest a movie for a group of friends to watch together. Unlike standard conformal techniques, which make inferences for one individual at a time, our method achieves stronger group-level guarantees by carefully assembling a structured calibration data set mimicking the patterns expected among the test group of interest. We propose a generalized weighted conformalization framework to deal with the lack of exchangeability arising from such structured calibration, and in this process we introduce several innovations to overcome computational challenges. The practicality and effectiveness of our method are demonstrated through extensive numerical experiments and an analysis of the MovieLens 100K data set.</description>

      <title>An exactly solvable model for emergence and scaling laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning models can exhibit what appears to be a sudden ability to solve a new problem as training time ($T$), training data ($D$), or model size ($N$) increases, a phenomenon known as emergence. In this paper, we present a framework where each new ability (a skill) is represented as a basis function. We solve a simple multi-linear model in this skill-basis, finding analytic expressions for the emergence of new skills, as well as for scaling laws of the loss with training time, data size, model size, and optimal compute ($C$). We compare our detailed calculations to direct simulations of a two-layer neural network trained on multitask sparse parity, where the tasks in the dataset are distributed according to a power-law. Our simple model captures, using a single fit parameter, the sigmoidal emergence of multiple new skills as training time, data size or model size increases in the neural network.</description>

      <title>Robust Data Clustering with Outliers via Transformed Tensor Low-Rank Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.09055v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, tensor low-rank representation (TLRR) has become a popular tool for tensor data recovery and clustering, due to its empirical success and theoretical guarantees. However, existing TLRR methods consider Gaussian or gross sparse noise, inevitably leading to performance degradation when the tensor data are contaminated by outliers or sample-specific corruptions. This paper develops an outlier-robust tensor low-rank representation (OR-TLRR) method that provides outlier detection and tensor data clustering simultaneously based on the t-SVD framework. For tensor observations with arbitrary outlier corruptions, OR-TLRR has provable performance guarantee for exactly recovering the row space of clean data and detecting outliers under mild conditions. Moreover, an extension of OR-TLRR is proposed to handle the case when parts of the data are missing. Finally, extensive experimental results on synthetic and real data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. We release our code at https://github.com/twugithub/2024-AISTATS-ORTLRR.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Representations in Explainable AI: From Theory to Practice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.07007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2008.07007v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interpretable representations are the backbone of many explainers that target black-box predictive systems based on artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms. They translate the low-level data representation necessary for good predictive performance into high-level human-intelligible concepts used to convey the explanatory insights. Notably, the explanation type and its cognitive complexity are directly controlled by the interpretable representation, tweaking which allows to target a particular audience and use case. However, many explainers built upon interpretable representations overlook their merit and fall back on default solutions that often carry implicit assumptions, thereby degrading the explanatory power and reliability of such techniques. To address this problem, we study properties of interpretable representations that encode presence and absence of human-comprehensible concepts. We demonstrate how they are operationalised for tabular, image and text data; discuss their assumptions, strengths and weaknesses; identify their core building blocks; and scrutinise their configuration and parameterisation. In particular, this in-depth analysis allows us to pinpoint their explanatory properties, desiderata and scope for (malicious) manipulation in the context of tabular data where a linear model is used to quantify the influence of interpretable concepts on a black-box prediction. Our findings lead to a range of recommendations for designing trustworthy interpretable representations; specifically, the benefits of class-aware (supervised) discretisation of tabular data, e.g., with decision trees, and sensitivity of image interpretable representations to segmentation granularity and occlusion colour.</description>

      <title>Dual-Mandate Patrols: Multi-Armed Bandits for Green Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.06560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2009.06560v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conservation efforts in green security domains to protect wildlife and forests are constrained by the limited availability of defenders (i.e., patrollers), who must patrol vast areas to protect from attackers (e.g., poachers or illegal loggers). Defenders must choose how much time to spend in each region of the protected area, balancing exploration of infrequently visited regions and exploitation of known hotspots. We formulate the problem as a stochastic multi-armed bandit, where each action represents a patrol strategy, enabling us to guarantee the rate of convergence of the patrolling policy. However, a naive bandit approach would compromise short-term performance for long-term optimality, resulting in animals poached and forests destroyed. To speed up performance, we leverage smoothness in the reward function and decomposability of actions. We show a synergy between Lipschitz-continuity and decomposition as each aids the convergence of the other. In doing so, we bridge the gap between combinatorial and Lipschitz bandits, presenting a no-regret approach that tightens existing guarantees while optimizing for short-term performance. We demonstrate that our algorithm, LIZARD, improves performance on real-world poaching data from Cambodia.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Estimation of Riesz Representers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2101.00009v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many causal parameters are linear functionals of an underlying regression. The Riesz representer is a key component in the asymptotic variance of a semiparametrically estimated linear functional. We propose an adversarial framework to estimate the Riesz representer using general function spaces. We prove a nonasymptotic mean square rate in terms of an abstract quantity called the critical radius, then specialize it for neural networks, random forests, and reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces as leading cases. Our estimators are highly compatible with targeted and debiased machine learning with sample splitting; our guarantees directly verify general conditions for inference that allow mis-specification. We also use our guarantees to prove inference without sample splitting, based on stability or complexity. Our estimators achieve nominal coverage in highly nonlinear simulations where some previous methods break down. They shed new light on the heterogeneous effects of matching grants.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric consistency for maximum likelihood estimation and clustering based on mixtures of elliptically-symmetric distributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.06108v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The consistency of the maximum likelihood estimator for mixtures of elliptically-symmetric distributions for estimating its population version is shown, where the underlying distribution $P$ is nonparametric and does not necessarily belong to the class of mixtures on which the estimator is based. In a situation where $P$ is a mixture of well enough separated but nonparametric distributions it is shown that the components of the population version of the estimator correspond to the well separated components of $P$. This provides some theoretical justification for the use of such estimators for cluster analysis in case that $P$ has well separated subpopulations even if these subpopulations differ from what the mixture model assumes.</description>

      <title>Conditional Variational Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02246v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inverse problems aim to determine parameters from observations, a crucial task in engineering and science. Lately, generative models, especially diffusion models, have gained popularity in this area for their ability to produce realistic solutions and their good mathematical properties. Despite their success, an important drawback of diffusion models is their sensitivity to the choice of variance schedule, which controls the dynamics of the diffusion process. Fine-tuning this schedule for specific applications is crucial but time-costly and does not guarantee an optimal result. We propose a novel approach for learning the schedule as part of the training process. Our method supports probabilistic conditioning on data, provides high-quality solutions, and is flexible, proving able to adapt to different applications with minimum overhead. This approach is tested in two unrelated inverse problems: super-resolution microscopy and quantitative phase imaging, yielding comparable or superior results to previous methods and fine-tuned diffusion models. We conclude that fine-tuning the schedule by experimentation should be avoided because it can be learned during training in a stable way that yields better results.</description>

      <title>Laplace-HDC: Understanding the geometry of binary hyperdimensional computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10759v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the geometry of binary hyperdimensional computing (HDC), a computational scheme in which data are encoded using high-dimensional binary vectors. We establish a result about the similarity structure induced by the HDC binding operator and show that the Laplace kernel naturally arises in this setting, motivating our new encoding method Laplace-HDC, which improves upon previous methods. We describe how our results indicate limitations of binary HDC in encoding spatial information from images and discuss potential solutions, including using Haar convolutional features and the definition of a translation-equivariant HDC encoding. Several numerical experiments highlighting the improved accuracy of Laplace-HDC in contrast to alternative methods are presented. We also numerically study other aspects of the proposed framework such as robustness and the underlying translation-equivariant encoding.</description>

      <title>The Power of Resets in Online Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15417v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulators are a pervasive tool in reinforcement learning, but most existing algorithms cannot efficiently exploit simulator access -- particularly in high-dimensional domains that require general function approximation. We explore the power of simulators through online reinforcement learning with {local simulator access} (or, local planning), an RL protocol where the agent is allowed to reset to previously observed states and follow their dynamics during training. We use local simulator access to unlock new statistical guarantees that were previously out of reach:
  - We show that MDPs with low coverability (Xie et al. 2023) -- a general structural condition that subsumes Block MDPs and Low-Rank MDPs -- can be learned in a sample-efficient fashion with only $Q^{\star}$-realizability (realizability of the optimal state-value function); existing online RL algorithms require significantly stronger representation conditions.
  - As a consequence, we show that the notorious Exogenous Block MDP problem (Efroni et al. 2022) is tractable under local simulator access.
  The results above are achieved through a computationally inefficient algorithm. We complement them with a more computationally efficient algorithm, RVFS (Recursive Value Function Search), which achieves provable sample complexity guarantees under a strengthened statistical assumption known as pushforward coverability. RVFS can be viewed as a principled, provable counterpart to a successful empirical paradigm that combines recursive search (e.g., MCTS) with value function approximation.</description>
