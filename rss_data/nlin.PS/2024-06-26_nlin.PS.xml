      <title>Effect of clustering on Turing instability in complex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Turing instability in complex networks have been shown in the literature to be dominated by the distribution of the nodal degrees. The conditions for Turing instability have been derived with an explicit dependence on the eigenvalues of the Laplacian, which in turn depends on the network topology. This study reveals that apart from average degree of the network, another global network measure - the nodal clustering - also plays a crucial role. Analytical and numerical results are presented to show the importance of clustering for several network topologies ranging from the $\mathbb{S}^1$ / $\mathbb{H}^2$ hyperbolic geometric networks that enable modelling the naturally occurring clustering in real world networks, as well as the random and scale free networks, which are obtained as limiting cases of the $\mathbb{S}^1$ / $\mathbb{H}^2$ model. Analysis of eigenvector localization properties in these networks are shown to reveal distinct signatures that enable identifying the so called Turing patterns even in complex networks.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear lattices from the physics of ecosystems: The Lefever-Lejeune nonlinear lattice in $\mathbb{Z}^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16598v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We argue that the spatial discretization of the strongly nonlinear Lefever-Lejeune partial differential equation defines a nonlinear lattice that is physically relevant in the context of the nonlinear physics of ecosystems, modelling the dynamics of vegetation densities in dry lands. We study the system in the lattice $\mathbb{Z}^2$, which is especially relevant because of its natural dimension for the emergence of pattern formation. Theoretical results identify parametric regimes for the system that distinguish between extinction and potential convergence to non-trivial states. Importantly, we analytically identify conditions for Turing instability, detecting thresholds on the discretization parameter for the manifestation of this mechanism. Numerical simulations reveal the sharpness of the analytical conditions for instability and illustrate the rich potential for pattern formation even in the strongly discrete regime, emphasizing the importance of the interplay between higher dimensionality and discreteness.</description>

      <title>Cycling and spiral-wave modes in an active cyclic Potts model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05257v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We studied the nonequilibrium dynamics of a cycling three-state Potts model using simulations and theory. This model can be tuned from thermal-equilibrium to far-from-equilibrium conditions. At low cycling energy, the homogeneous dominant state cycles via nucleation and growth, while spiral waves are formed at high energy. For large systems, a discontinuous transition occurs from these cyclic homogeneous phases to spiral waves, while the opposite transition is absent. Conversely, these two modes can coexist for small systems. The waves can be reproduced by a continuum theory, and the transition can be understood from the competition between nucleation and growth.</description>
