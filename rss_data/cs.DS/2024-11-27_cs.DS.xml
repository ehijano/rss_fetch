      <title>A New 0(klog n) Algorithm for Josephus Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new O(k log n) algorithm of the Josephus problem. The time complexity of our algorithm is O(k log n), and this time complexity is on a par with the existing O(k log n) algorithm. We do not have any recursion overhead or stack overflow because we do not use any recursion. Therefore, the space complexity of our algorithm is O(1), and ours is better than the existing O(k log n) algorithm in this respect. When k is small and n is large, our algorithm is better than the existing O(k log n) algorithm. This new algorithm is based on a relation between the Josephus problem and a maximum Nim of combinatorial game theory.</description>

      <title>Online $b$-Matching with Stochastic Rewards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $b$-matching problem is an allocation problem where the vertices on the left-hand side of a bipartite graph, referred to as servers, may be matched multiple times. In the setting with stochastic rewards, an assignment between an incoming request and a server turns into a match with a given success probability. Mehta and Panigrahi (FOCS 2012) introduced online bipartite matching with stochastic rewards, where each vertex may be matched once. The framework is equally interesting in graphs with vertex capacities. In Internet advertising, for instance, the advertisers seek successful matches with a large number of users.
  We develop (tight) upper and lower bounds on the competitive ratio of deterministic and randomized online algorithms, for $b$-matching with stochastic rewards. Our bounds hold for both offline benchmarks considered in the literature. As in prior work, we first consider vanishing probabilities. We show that no randomized online algorithm can achieve a competitive ratio greater than $1-1/e\approx 0.632$, even for identical vanishing probabilities and arbitrary uniform server capacities. Furthermore, we conduct a primal-dual analysis of the deterministic \textsc{StochasticBalance} algorithm. We prove that it achieves a competitive ratio of $1-1/e$, as server capacities increase, for arbitrary heterogeneous non-vanishing edge probabilities. This performance guarantee holds in a general setting where servers have individual capacities and for the vertex-weighted problem extension. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result for \textsc{StochasticBalance} with arbitrary non-vanishing probabilities.
  We remark that our impossibility result implies in particular that, for the AdWords problem, no online algorithm can be better than $(1-1/e)$-competitive in the setting with stochastic rewards.</description>

      <title>Smoothed Analysis of the k-Swap Neighborhood for Makespan Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Local search is a widely used technique for tackling challenging optimization problems, offering simplicity and strong empirical performance across various problem domains. In this paper, we address the problem of scheduling a set of jobs on identical parallel machines with the objective of makespan minimization, by considering a local search neighborhood, called $k$-swap. A $k$-swap neighbor is obtained by interchanging the machine allocations of at most $k$ jobs scheduled on two machines. While local search algorithms often perform well in practice, they can exhibit poor worst-case performance. In our previous study, we showed that for $k \geq 3$, there exists an instance where the number of iterations required to converge to a local optimum is exponential in the number of jobs. Motivated by this discrepancy between theoretical worst-case bound and practical performance, we apply smoothed analysis to the $k$-swap local search. Smoothed analysis has emerged as a powerful framework for analyzing the behavior of algorithms, aiming to bridge the gap between poor worst-case and good empirical performance. In this paper, we show that the smoothed number of iterations required to find a local optimum with respect to the $k$-swap neighborhood is bounded by $O(m^2 \cdot n^{2k+2} \cdot \log m \cdot \phi)$, where $n$ and $m$ are the numbers of jobs and machines, respectively, and $\phi \geq 1$ is the perturbation parameter. The bound on the smoothed number of iterations demonstrates that the proposed lower bound reflects a pessimistic scenario which is rare in practice.</description>

      <title>Broadcasting in Heterogeneous Tree Networks with Edge Weight Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A broadcasting problem in heterogeneous tree networks with edge weight uncertainty under the postal model is considered in this paper. The broadcasting problem asks for a minmax-regret broadcast center, which minimizes the worst-case loss in the objective function. Due to the presence of edge weight uncertainty, it is not easy to attack the broadcasting problem. An $O(n \log n \log \log n)$-time algorithm is proposed for solving the broadcasting problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 2024 PACE Challenge focused on the One-Sided Crossing Minimization (OCM) problem, which aims to minimize edge crossings in a bipartite graph with a fixed order in one partition and a free order in the other. We describe our OCM solver submission that utilizes various reduction rules for OCM and, for the heuristic track, employs local search approaches as well as techniques to escape local minima. The exact and parameterized solver uses an ILP formulation and branch &amp; bound to solve an equivalent Feedback Arc Set instance.</description>

      <title>Enabling Skip Graphs to Process K-Dimensional Range Queries in a Mobile Sensor Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A skip graph is a resilient application-layer routing structure that supports range queries of distributed k-dimensional data. By sorting deterministic keys into groups based on locally computed random membership vectors, nodes in a standard skip graph can optimize range query performance in mobile networks such as unmanned aerial vehicle swarms. We propose a skip graph extension that inverts the key and membership vector roles and bases group membership on deterministic vectors derived from the z-ordering of k-dimensional data and sorting within groups is based on locally computed random keys.</description>

      <title>Weakly acyclic diagrams: A data structure for infinite-state symbolic verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ordered binary decision diagrams (OBDDs) are a fundamental data structure for the manipulation of Boolean functions, with strong applications to finite-state symbolic model checking. OBDDs allow for efficient algorithms using top-down dynamic programming. From an automata-theoretic perspective, OBDDs essentially are minimal deterministic finite automata recognizing languages whose words have a fixed length (the arity of the Boolean function). We introduce weakly acyclic diagrams (WADs), a generalization of OBDDs that maintains their algorithmic advantages, but can also represent infinite languages. We develop the theory of WADs and show that they can be used for symbolic model checking of various models of infinite-state systems.</description>

      <title>A Fixed-Parameter Algorithm for the Kneser Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.06761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.06761v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Kneser graph $K(n,k)$ is defined for integers $n$ and $k$ with $n \geq 2k$ as the graph whose vertices are all the $k$-subsets of $\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$ where two such sets are adjacent if they are disjoint. A classical result of Lov\'asz asserts that the chromatic number of $K(n,k)$ is $n-2k+2$. In the computational Kneser problem, we are given an oracle access to a coloring of the vertices of $K(n,k)$ with $n-2k+1$ colors, and the goal is to find a monochromatic edge. We present a randomized algorithm for the Kneser problem with running time $n^{O(1)} \cdot k^{O(k)}$. This shows that the problem is fixed-parameter tractable with respect to the parameter $k$. The analysis involves structural results on intersecting families and on induced subgraphs of Kneser graphs.
  We also study the Agreeable-Set problem of assigning a small subset of a set of $m$ items to a group of $\ell$ agents, so that all agents value the subset at least as much as its complement. As an application of our algorithm for the Kneser problem, we obtain a randomized polynomial-time algorithm for the Agreeable-Set problem for instances that satisfy $\ell \geq m - O(\frac{\log m}{\log \log m})$. We further show that the Agreeable-Set problem is at least as hard as a variant of the Kneser problem with an extended access to the input coloring.</description>

      <title>Invertible Bloom Lookup Tables with Less Memory and Randomness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.07583v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we study Invertible Bloom Lookup Tables (IBLTs) with small failure probabilities. IBLTs are highly versatile data structures that have found applications in set reconciliation protocols, error-correcting codes, and even the design of advanced cryptographic primitives. For storing $n$ elements and ensuring correctness with probability at least $1 - \delta$, existing IBLT constructions require $\Omega(n(\frac{\log(1/\delta)}{\log(n)}+1))$ space and they crucially rely on fully random hash functions.
  We present new constructions of IBLTs that are simultaneously more space efficient and require less randomness. For storing $n$ elements with a failure probability of at most $\delta$, our data structure only requires $\mathcal{O}\left(n + \log(1/\delta)\log\log(1/\delta)\right)$ space and $\mathcal{O}\left(\log(\log(n)/\delta)\right)$-wise independent hash functions.
  As a key technical ingredient we show that hashing $n$ keys with any $k$-wise independent hash function $h:U \to [Cn]$ for some sufficiently large constant $C$ guarantees with probability $1 - 2^{-\Omega(k)}$ that at least $n/2$ keys will have a unique hash value. Proving this is non-trivial as $k$ approaches $n$. We believe that the techniques used to prove this statement may be of independent interest.
  We apply our new IBLTs to the encrypted compression problem, recently studied by Fleischhacker, Larsen, Simkin (Eurocrypt 2023). We extend their approach to work for a more general class of encryption schemes and using our new IBLT we achieve an asymptotically better compression rate.</description>

      <title>Comments on "$\mathcal{O}(m\cdot n)$ algorithms for the recognition and isomorphism problems on circular-arc graphs"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13708v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the work [$\mathcal{O}(m\cdot n)$ algorithms for the recognition and isomorphism problems on circular-arc graphs, SIAM J. Comput. 24(3), 411--439, (1995)], Wen-Lian Hsu claims three results concerning the class of circular-arc graphs: - the design of so-called \emph{decomposition trees} that represent the structure of all normalized intersection models of circular-arc graphs, - an $\mathcal{O}(m\cdot n)$ recognition algorithm for circular-arc graphs, - an $\mathcal{O}(m\cdot n)$ isomorphism algorithm for circular-arc graphs. In [Discrete Math. Theor. Comput. Sci., 15(1), 157--182, 2013] Curtis, Lin, McConnell, Nussbaum, Soulignac, Spinrad, and Szwarcfiter showed that Hsu's isomorphism algorithm is incorrect. In this note, we show that the other two results -- namely, the construction of decomposition trees and the recognition algorithm -- are also flawed.</description>

      <title>On Interim Envy-Free Allocation Lotteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.07839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.07839v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With very few exceptions, recent research in fair division has mostly focused on deterministic allocations. Deviating from this trend, we study the fairness notion of interim envy-freeness (iEF) for lotteries over allocations, which serves as a sweet spot between the too stringent notion of ex-post envy-freeness and the very weak notion of ex-ante envy-freeness. Our analysis relates iEF to other fairness notions as well, and reveals tradeoffs between iEF and efficiency. Even though several of our results apply to general fair division problems, we are particularly interested in instances with equal numbers of agents and items where allocations are perfect matchings of the items to the agents. We show how to compute iEF allocations in matching allocation instances in polynomial time, while also maximizing several efficiency objectives, even though this proves to be considerably more challenging than computing envy-free allocations. Our algorithms use efficient solutions to a novel variant of the bipartite matching problem. We also study the extension of iEF when payments to or from the agents are allowed. We present a series of results on two optimization problems, including a generalization of the classical rent division problem to random allocations.</description>

      <title>Convergence of a L2 regularized Policy Gradient Algorithm for the Multi Armed Bandit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06388v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although Multi Armed Bandit (MAB) on one hand and the policy gradient approach on the other hand are among the most used frameworks of Reinforcement Learning, the theoretical properties of the policy gradient algorithm used for MAB have not been given enough attention. We investigate in this work the convergence of such a procedure for the situation when a $L2$ regularization term is present jointly with the 'softmax' parametrization. We prove convergence under appropriate technical hypotheses and test numerically the procedure including situations beyond the theoretical setting. The tests show that a time dependent regularized procedure can improve over the canonical approach especially when the initial guess is far from the solution.</description>

      <title>Representation of Classical Data on Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00742v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing is currently gaining significant attention, not only from the academic community but also from industry, due to its potential applications across several fields for addressing complex problems. For any practical problem which may be tackled using quantum computing, it is imperative to represent the data used onto a quantum computing system. Depending on the application, many different types of data and data structures occur, including regular numbers, higher-dimensional data structures, e.g., n-dimensional images, up to graphs. This report aims to provide an overview of existing methods for representing these data types on gate-based quantum computers.</description>
