      <title>Geometric and Analytic Aspects of Simon-Lojasiewicz Inequalities on Vector Bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In real analysis, the Lojasiewicz inequalities, revitalized by Leon Simon in his pioneering work on singularities of energy minimizing maps, have proven to be monumental in differential geometry, geometric measure theory, and variational problems. These inequalities provide specific growth and stability conditions for prescribed real-analytic functions, and have found applications to gradient flows, gradient systems, and as explicated in this paper, vector bundles over compact Riemannian manifolds. In this work, we outline the theory of functionals and variational problems over vector bundles, explore applications to arbitrary real-analytic functionals, and describe the energy functional on $S^{n-1}$ as a functional over a vector bundle.</description>

      <title>Myers-Steenrod theorems for metric and singular Riemannian foliations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the group of isometries preserving a metric foliation on a closed Alexandrov space $X$, or a singular Riemannian foliation on a manifold $M$ is a closed subgroup of the isometry group of $X$ in the case of a metric foliation, or of the isometry group of $M$ for the case of a singular Riemannian foliation. We obtain a sharp upper bound for the dimension of these subgroups and show that, when equality holds, the foliations that realize this upper bound are induced by fiber bundles whose fibers are round spheres or projective spaces. Moreover, singular Riemannian foliations that realize the upper bound are induced by smooth fiber bundles whose fibers are round spheres or projective spaces.</description>

      <title>Multi-toric geometries with larger compact symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study complete, simply-connected manifolds with special holonomy that are toric with respect to their multi-moment maps. We consider the cases where there is a connected non-Abelian symmetry group containing the torus. For $\mathrm{Spin}(7)$-manifolds, we show that the only possibility are structures with a cohomogeneity-two action of $T^{3} \times \mathrm{SU}(2)$. We then specialise the analysis to holonomy $G_{2}$, to Calabi-Yau geometries in real dimension six and to hyperK\"ahler four-manifolds. Finally, we consider weakly coherent triples on $\mathbb{R} \times \mathrm{SU}(2)$, and their extensions over singular orbits, to give local examples in the $\mathrm{Spin}(7)$-case that have singular orbits where the stabiliser is of rank one.</description>

      <title>Extending Gromov's optimal systolic inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence of nontrivial cup products or Massey products in the cohomology of a manifold leads to inequalities of systolic type, but in general such inequalities are not optimal (tight). Gromov proved an {optimal} systolic inequality for complex projective space. We provide a natural extension of Gromov's inequality to manifolds whose fundamental cohomology class is a cup product of 2-dimensional classes.</description>

      <title>On Riemann curvature of spherically symmetric metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, studying the inverse problem, we establish a curvature compatibility condition on a spherically symmetric Finsler metric. As an application, we characterize the spherically symmetric metrics of scalar curvature. We construct a Berwald frame for a spherically symmetric Finsler surface and calculate some associated geometric objects. Several examples are provided and discussed. Finally, we give a note on a certain general $(\alpha,\beta)$-metric that appears in the literature.</description>

      <title>Foliations transverse to a closed conformal vector field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study the geometric properties of codimension one foliations on Riemannian manifolds equipped with vector fields that are closed and conformal. Apart from its singularities, these vector fields define codimension one foliations with nice geometric features, which we call Montiel Foliations. We investigate conditions for which a foliation transverse to this structure has totally geodesic leaves, as well as how the ambient space and the geometry of the leaves forces a given foliation into a Montiel Foliation. Our main results concern minimal leaves and constant mean curvature foliations, having compact or complete noncompact leaves. Finally, we characterize totally geodesic foliations by means of its relation to a prior Montiel Foliation.</description>

      <title>Ends of (singular) Ricci shrinkers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We estimate the number of ends of smooth and singular Ricci shrinkers focussing first on general ends and later on asymptotically conical ones. In particular, we obtain a variety of applications to sequences of Ricci shrinkers converging in a weak pointed sense to a possibly singular limit Ricci shrinker, for instance no new conical end can form in the limit.</description>

Abstract: The inverse of the metric matrices on the Siegel-Jacobi upper half space ${\mathcal{X}}^J_n$, invariant to the restricted real Jacobi group $G^J_n(\mathbb{R})_0$ and extended Siegel-Jacobi $\tilde{{\mathcal{X}}}^J_n$ upper half space, invariant to the action of the real Jacobi $G^J_n(\mathbb{R})$, are presented. The results are relevant for Berezin quantization of the manifolds ${\mathcal{X}}^J_ n$ and $\tilde{\mathcal{X}}^J_n$. Explicit calculations in the case $n=2$ are given.</description>

      <title>On the classificarion of 3-dimensional spherical Sasakian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we consider spherical hypersurfaces in $\mathbb C^2$ with a fixed Reeb vector field as 3-dimensional Sasakian manifolds. We establish the correspondence between three different sets of parameters, namely, those arising from representing the Reeb vector field as an automorphism of the Heisenberg sphere, the parameters used in Stanton's description of rigid spheres, and the parameters arising from the rigid normal forms. We also geometrically describe the moduli space for rigid spheres, and provide geometric distinction between Stanton's hypersurfaces and those found by Ezhov and Schmalz. Finally, we determine the Sasakian automorphism groups of the rigid spheres and detect the homogeneous Sasakian manifolds among them.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04539v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A tensor -- meaning here a tensor field $\Theta$ of any type $(p,q)$ on a manifold -- may be called integrable if it is parallel relative to some torsion-free connection. We provide analytical and geometric characterizations of integrability for differential $q$-forms, $q=0,1,2,n-1,n$ (in dimension $n$), vectors, bivectors, symmetric $(2,0)$ and $(0,2)$ tensors, as well as complex-diagonalizable and nilpotent tensors of type $(1,1)$. In most cases, integrability is equivalent to algebraic constancy of $\Theta$ coupled with the vanishing of one or more suitably defined Nijenhuis-type tensors, depending on $\Theta$ via a quasilinear first-order differential operator. For $(p,q)=(1,1)$, they include the ordinary Nijenhuis tensor.</description>

      <title>Balanced metrics and Gauduchon cone of locally conformally Kahler manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A complex Hermitian $n$-manifold $(M,I, \omega)$ is called locally conformally Kahler (LCK) if $d\omega=\theta\wedge\omega$, where $\theta$ is a closed 1-form, balanced if $\omega^{n-1}$ is closed, and SKT if $dId\omega=0$. We conjecture that any compact complex manifold admitting two of these three types of Hermitian forms (balanced, SKT, LCK) also admits a Kahler metric, and prove partial results towards this conjecture. We conjecture that the (1,1)-form $-d(I\theta)$ is Bott--Chern homologous to a positive (1,1)-current. This conjecture implies that $(M,I)$ does not admit a balanced Hermitian metric. We verify this conjecture for all known classes of LCK manifolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a geometric framework for the processing of SPD-valued data that preserves subspace structures and is based on the efficient computation of extreme generalized eigenvalues. This is achieved through the use of the Thompson geometry of the semidefinite cone. We explore a particular geodesic space structure in detail and establish several properties associated with it. Finally, we review a novel inductive mean of SPD matrices based on this geometry.</description>

Abstract: We prove a nonlinear characteristic $C^k$-gluing theorem for vacuum gravitational fields in Bondi gauge for a class of characteristic hypersurfaces near static vacuum $n$-dimensional backgrounds, $n\ge 3$, with any finite $k$, with cosmological constant $ \Lambda \in \mathbb{R}$, near Birmingham-Kottler backgrounds. This generalises the $C^2$-gluing of Aretakis, Czimek and Rodnianski, carried-out near light cones in four-dimensional Minkowski spacetime.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The present article introduces a generalization of the Hamiltonian field theory for a Lagrangian density, allowing the formulation of this kind of field theories for variational problem of more general nature than those associated to a classical variational problem. It is achieved by realizing that the usual construction of the Hamiltonian equations can be performed without the use of the so called Hamiltonian section, whose existence is problematic when general variational problems are considered. The developed formalism is applied to obtain an unified problem and a Hamiltonian field theory for the vakonomic Herglotz variational problem.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates the curvature properties of higher direct images $ R^qf_*\Omega_{X/S}^p(E)$, where $f: X\rightarrow S$ is a family of compact K\"ahler manifolds equipped with a hermitian vector bundle $E \rightarrow X$. We derive a general curvature formula and explore several special cases, including those where $p + q = n$, $q = 0$, and $p = n$, with $E$ being a line bundle. Furthermore, the paper examines the curvature in the context of fiberwise hermitian flat cases, families of Hermite-Einstein vector bundles, and applications to moduli spaces and Weil-Petersson metrics, providing some insight into their geometric and analytical properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this contribution, we study spacetimes of cosmological interest, without making any symmetry assumptions. We prove a rigid Hawking singularity theorem for positive cosmological constant, which sharpens known results. In particular, it implies that any spacetime with $\operatorname{Ric} \geq -ng$ in timelike directions and containing a compact Cauchy hypersurface with mean curvature $H \geq n$ is timelike incomplete. We also study the properties of cosmological time and volume functions, addressing questions such as: When do they satisfy the regularity condition? When are the level sets Cauchy hypersurfaces? What can one say about the mean curvature of the level sets? This naturally leads to consideration of Hawking type singularity theorems for Cauchy surfaces satisfying mean curvature inequalities in a certain weak sense.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the affine-additive group as a metric measure space with a canonical left-invariant measure and a left-invariant sub-Riemannian metric. We prove that this metric measure space is locally 4-Ahlfors regular and it is hyperbolic, meaning that it has a non-vanishing 4-capacity at infinity. This implies that the affine-additive group is not quasiconformally equivalent to the Heisenberg group or to the roto-translation group in contrast to the fact that both of these groups are globally contactomorphic to the affine-additive group. Moreover, each quasiregular map, from the Heisenberg group to the affine-additive group must be constant.</description>

Abstract: A bisection line divides a convex planar curve into two parts with equal areas. It is natural to study the envelope of these lines, which in general present singularities. The polygonal case is particularly inte\-resting, since there are several different notions of a discrete envelope. In this paper, we study three different notions of discrete envelopes of bisection lines and the connections between them.</description>

      <title>A special class of $k$-harmonic maps inducing calibrated fibrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14074v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider two special classes of $k$-harmonic maps between Riemannian manifolds which are related to calibrated geometry, satisfying a first order fully nonlinear PDE. The first is a special type of weakly conformal map $u \colon (L^k, g) \to (M^n, h)$ where $k \leq n$ and $\alpha$ is a calibration $k$-form on $M$. Away from the critical set, the image is an $\alpha$-calibrated submanifold of $M$. These were previously studied by Cheng-Karigiannis-Madnick when $\alpha$ was associated to a vector cross product, but we clarify that such a restriction is unnecessary. The second, which is new, is a special type of weakly horizontally conformal map $u \colon (M^n, h) \to (L^k, g)$ where $n \geq k$ and $\alpha$ is a calibration $(n-k)$-form on $M$. Away from the critical set, the fibres $u^{-1} \{ u(x) \}$ are $\alpha$-calibrated submanifolds of $M$.
  We also review some previously established analytic results for the first class; we exhibit some explicit noncompact examples of the second class, where $(M, h)$ are the Bryant-Salamon manifolds with exceptional holonomy; we remark on the relevance of this new PDE to the Strominger-Yau-Zaslow conjecture for mirror symmetry in terms of special Lagrangian fibrations and to the $\mathrm{G}_2$ version by Gukov-Yau-Zaslow in terms of coassociative fibrations; and we present several open questions for future study.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05470v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $M^n, n\geq 3,$ be a complete Riemannian manifold of constant scalar curvature $R$ and $f: M^n\rightarrow M^{n+k}(c)$ be an isometric immersion into a space form with flat normal bundle. Assume that $f$ admits a principal normal vector field of multiplicity $n-1$ at each point. Our main result is of a global character and states that (i) $R\geq 0$ if $c= 0;$\ (ii) $ R&gt; (n-1)(n-2)c$ if $c&gt; 0;$ and (iii) $R\geq n(n-1)c$ if $c&lt; 0.$ The inequalities are optimal. Our second result is of a local character and states that if in addition we assume that $c$ is non-negative and the mean curvature field of $f$ is parallel then $M^n$ has non-negative sectional curvature.</description>

      <title>On non-elliptic symplectic manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.00326</link>
      <description>arXiv:1807.00326v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a closed symplectic manifold of dimension $2n$ with non-ellipticity. We can define an almost K\"ahler structure on $M$ by using the given symplectic form. Hence, we have a $\G=\pi_1(M)$-invariant almost K\"ahler structure on the universal covering, $\ti M$, of $M$. Using Darboux coordinate charts, we globally deform the given almost K\"ahler structure on $\ti M$ off a Lebesgue measure zero subset to obtain a $\G$-invariant Lipschitz K\"ahler flat structure on $\ti M$ which is $\G$-homotopy equivalent to the given almost K\"ahler structure. Analogous to Teleman's $L^2$-Hodge decomposition on PL manifolds or Lipschitz Riemannian manifolds, we give a $L^2$-Hodge decomposition theorem on $\ti M$ with respect to the Lipschitz K\"ahler flat metric. Using an argument of Gromov, we give a vanishing theorem for $L^2$ harmonic $p$-forms, $p\not=n$ (resp. a non-vanishing theorem for $L^2$ harmonic $n$-forms) on $\ti M$, then the signed Euler characteristic satisfies $(-1)^n\chi(M)\geq0$ (resp. $(-1)^n\chi(M)&gt;0$). Similarly, for any closed even dimensional Riemannian manifold $(M, g)$, we can construct a $\G$-invariant Lipschitz K\"ahler flat structure on the universal covering, $(\ti M, \ti g)$, of $(M, g)$ which is $\G$-homotopy equivalent to and quasi-isometric to the metric $\ti g$. As an application, using Gromov's method we show that the Chern-Hopf conjecture holds true in closed even dimensional Riemannian manifolds with nonpositive curvature (resp. strictly negative curvature), it gives a positive answer to a Yau's problem due to S. S. Chern and H. Hopf.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2007.02544v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, the Cauchy problem for a Friedrichs system on a globally hyperbolic manifold with a timelike boundary is investigated. By imposing admissible boundary conditions, the existence and the uniqueness of strong solutions are shown. Furthermore, if the Friedrichs system is hyperbolic, the Cauchy problem is proved to be well-posed in the sense of Hadamard. Finally, examples of Friedrichs systems with admissible boundary conditions are provided.</description>

      <title>Reductive quotients of klt singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.02812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.02812v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the quotient of a klt type singularity by a reductive group is of klt type. In particular, given a klt variety $X$ endowed with the action of a reductive group $G$ and admitting a quasi-projective good quotient $X\rightarrow X/\!/G$, we can find a boundary $B$ on $X/\!/G$ so that the pair $(X/\!/G,B)$ is klt. This applies for example to GIT-quotients of klt varieties. Our main result has consequences for complex spaces obtained as quotients of Hamiltonian K\"ahler $G$-manifolds, for collapsings of homogeneous vector bundles as introduced by Kempf, and for good moduli spaces of smooth Artin stacks. In particular, it implies that the good moduli space parametrizing $n$-dimensional K-polystable Fano manifolds of volume $v$ has klt type singularities. As a corresponding result regarding global geometry, we show that quotients of Mori Dream Spaces with klt Cox rings are Mori Dream Spaces with klt Cox ring. This in turn applies to show that projective GIT-quotients of varieties of Fano type are of Fano type; in particular, projective moduli spaces of semistable quiver representations are of Fano type.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2204.07277v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given an eigenvalue $\lambda$ of the Laplace-Beltrami operator on $n-$spheres or $-$hemispheres, with multiplicity $m$ such that $\lambda=\lambda_{k}=\dots = \lambda_{k+m-1}$, we characterise the lowest and highest orders in the set $\left\{k,\dots,k+m-1\right\}$ for which P\'{o}lya's conjecture holds and fails. In particular, we show that P\'{o}lya's conjecture holds for hemispheres in the Neumann case, but not in the Dirichlet case when $n$ is greater than two. We further derive P\'{o}lya-type inequalities by adding a correction term providing sharp lower and upper bounds for all eigenvalues. This allows us to measure the deviation from the leading term in the Weyl asymptotics for eigenvalues on spheres and hemispheres. As a direct consequence, we obtain similar results for domains which tile hemispheres. We also obtain direct and reversed Li-Yau inequalities for $\mathbb{S}^2$ and $\mathbb{S}^4$, respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.03163v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that a non-projective compact K\"ahler $3$-fold with nef anti-canonical bundle is, up to a finite \'etale cover, one of the following: a manifold with vanishing first Chern class; the product of a K3 surface and the projective line; or a projective space bundle over a $2$-dimensional torus. This result extends Cao-H\"oring's structure theorem for projective manifolds to compact K\"ahler manifolds in dimension $3$. For the proof, we investigate the Minimal Model Program for compact K\"ahler $3$-folds with nef anti-canonical bundles by using the positivity of direct image sheaves, $\mathbb{Q}$-conic bundles, and orbifold vector bundles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16655v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The main goal of this article is to generalize Mess' work and using results from Labourie--Wentworth, Potrie--Sambarino and Smilga, to show that inside Hitchin representations, infinitesimal deformations of Fuchsian representations of a cocompact surface group do not act properly along the directions corresponding to the sum of a mixed odd differential and a $2m$-differential for any $1\leq m \leq \lfloor\frac{n}{2}\rfloor$.
  In the process, we introduce affine versions of cross ratios and triple ratios. We introduce Margulis invariants and relate them with affine crossratios and infinitesimal Jordan projections. We obtain a general equivalent criterion for existence of proper affine actions in terms of the structure of the Margulis invariant spectra. Also, using a stability argument we show the existence of proper affine actions of non-abelian free groups whose linear part is a Hitchin representation.</description>

      <title>Five tori in $S^4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03460v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ivansic proved that there is a link $L$ of five tori in $S^4$ with hyperbolic complement. We describe $L$ explicitly and study its properties, and discover that $L$ is in many aspects similar to the Borromean rings in $S^3$. In particular the following hold: (1) Any two tori in $L$ are unlinked, but three are not; (2) The complement $M=S^4\setminus L$ is integral arithmetic hyperbolic; (3) The symmetry group of $L$ acts $k$-transitively on its components for all $k$; (4) The double branched covering over $L$ has geometry $\mathbb H^2 \times \mathbb H^2$; (5) The fundamental group of $M$ has a nice presentation via commutators; (6) The Alexander ideal is explicit; (7) Every class $x\in H^1(M, \mathbb Z)=\mathbb Z^5$ with $x_i\neq 0$ is represented by a perfect circle-valued Morse function; (8) By longitudinal Dehn surgery along $L$ we get a closed 4-manifold with fundamental group $\mathbb Z^5$; (9) The link $L$ can be put in perfect position.
  This leads also to the first descriptions of a cusped hyperbolic 4-manifold as a complement of tori in $\mathbb R \mathbb P^4$ and of some explicit Lagrangian tori in the product of two surfaces of genus two.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06623v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the geometric and combinatorial effect of smoothing an intersection point in a collection of arcs or curves on a surface. We prove that all taut arcs with fixed endpoints and all taut 1-manifolds with at least two non-disjoint components on an orientable surface with negative Euler characteristic admit a taut smoothing, and also that all taut arcs with free endpoints admit a smoothing that is either taut or becomes taut after removing at most one intersection. We deduce that for every Riemannian metric on a surface, the shortest properly immersed arcs with at least $k$ self-intersections have exactly $k$ self-intersections when the endpoints of the arc are fixed, and at most $k+1$ self-intersections otherwise, and that the arc length spectrum is "coarsely ordered" by self-intersection number. Along the way, we obtain partial analogous results in the case of curves.</description>

      <title>Flux Quantization on 11-dimensional Superspace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16456v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Flux quantization of the C-field in 11d supergravity is arguably necessary for the (UV-)completion of the theory, in that it determines the torsion charges carried by small numbers of M-branes. However, hypotheses about C-field flux-quantization ("models of the C-field") have previously been discussed only in the bosonic sector of 11d supergravity and ignoring the supergravity equations of motion. Here we highlight a duality-symmetric formulation of on-shell 11d supergravity on superspace, observe that this naturally lends itself to completion of the theory by flux quantization, and indeed that 11d super-spacetimes are put on-shell by carrying quantizable duality-symmetric super-C-field flux; the proof of which we present in detail.</description>

      <title>Floer Homology with DG Coefficients. Applications to cotangent bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07953v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define Hamiltonian Floer homology with differential graded (DG) local coefficients for symplectically aspherical manifolds. The differential of the underlying complex involves chain representatives of the fundamental classes of the moduli spaces of Floer trajectories of arbitrary dimension. This setup allows in particular to define and compute Floer homology with coefficients in chains on fibers of fibrations over the free loop space of the underlying symplectic manifold. We develop the DG Floer toolset, including continuation maps and homotopies, and we also define and study symplectic homology groups with DG local coefficients. We define spectral invariants and establish general criteria for almost existence of contractible periodic orbits on regular energy levels of Hamiltonian systems inside Liouville domains.
  In the case of cotangent bundles, we prove a Viterbo isomorphism theorem with DG local coefficients. This serves as a stepping stone for applications to the almost existence of contractible closed characteristics on closed smooth hypersurfaces. In this context, our methods allow to access for the first time the dichotomy between closed manifolds that are aspherical and those that are not.</description>

      <title>Second Maximum of a Gaussian Random Field and Exact (t-)Spacing test</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18397v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce the novel concept of the second maximum of a Gaussian random field on a Riemannian submanifold. This second maximum serves as a powerful tool for characterizing the distribution of the maximum. By utilizing an ad-hoc Kac Rice formula, we derive the explicit form of the maximum's distribution, conditioned on the second maximum and some regressed component of the Riemannian Hessian. This approach results in an exact test, based on the evaluation of spacing between these maxima, which we refer to as the spacing test.
  We investigate the applicability of this test in detecting sparse alternatives within Gaussian symmetric tensors, continuous sparse deconvolution, and two-layered neural networks with smooth rectifiers. Our theoretical results are supported by numerical experiments, which illustrate the calibration and power of the proposed tests. More generally, this test can be applied to any Gaussian random field on a Riemannian manifold, and we provide a general framework for the application of the spacing test in continuous sparse kernel regression.
  Furthermore, when the variance-covariance function of the Gaussian random field is known up to a scaling factor, we derive an exact Studentized version of our test, coined the $t$-spacing test. This test is perfectly calibrated under the null hypothesis and has high power for detecting sparse alternatives.</description>
