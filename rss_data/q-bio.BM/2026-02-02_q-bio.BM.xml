      <title>Minimal-Action Discrete Schr\"odinger Bridge Matching for Peptide Sequence Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative modeling of peptide sequences requires navigating a discrete and highly constrained space in which many intermediate states are chemically implausible or unstable. Existing discrete diffusion and flow-based methods rely on reversing fixed corruption processes or following prescribed probability paths, which can force generation through low-likelihood regions and require countless sampling steps. We introduce Minimal-action discrete Schr\"odinger Bridge Matching (MadSBM), a rate-based generative framework for peptide design that formulates generation as a controlled continuous-time Markov process on the amino-acid edit graph. To yield probability trajectories that remain near high-likelihood sequence neighborhoods throughout generation, MadSBM 1) defines generation relative to a biologically informed reference process derived from pre-trained protein language model logits and 2) learns a time-dependent control field that biases transition rates to produce low-action transport paths from a masked prior to the data distribution. We finally introduce guidance to the MadSBM sampling procedure towards a specific functional objective, expanding the design space of therapeutic peptides; to our knowledge, this represents the first-ever application of discrete classifier guidance to Schr\"odinger bridge-based generative models.</description>

      <title>Disentangling multispecific antibody function with graph neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multispecific antibodies offer transformative therapeutic potential by engaging multiple epitopes simultaneously, yet their efficacy is an emergent property governed by complex molecular architectures. Rational design is often bottlenecked by the inability to predict how subtle changes in domain topology influence functional outcomes, a challenge exacerbated by the scarcity of comprehensive experimental data. Here, we introduce a computational framework to address part of this gap. First, we present a generative method for creating large-scale, realistic synthetic functional landscapes that capture non-linear interactions where biological activity depends on domain connectivity. Second, we propose a graph neural network architecture that explicitly encodes these topological constraints, distinguishing between format configurations that appear identical to sequence-only models. We demonstrate that this model, trained on synthetic landscapes, recapitulates complex functional properties and, via transfer learning, has the potential to achieve high predictive accuracy on limited biological datasets. We showcase the model's utility by optimizing trade-offs between efficacy and toxicity in trispecific T-cell engagers and retrieving optimal common light chains. This work provides a robust benchmarking environment for disentangling the combinatorial complexity of multispecifics, accelerating the design of next-generation therapeutics.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Scaling Behaviors in Molecular Language Models: Effects of Model Size, Data, and Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular generative models, often employing GPT-style language modeling on molecular string representations, have shown promising capabilities when scaled to large datasets and model sizes. However, it remains unclear and subject to debate whether these models adhere to predictable scaling laws under fixed computational budgets, which is a crucial understanding for optimally allocating resources between model size, data volume, and molecular representation. In this study, we systematically investigate the scaling behavior of molecular language models across both pretraining and downstream tasks. We train 300 models and conduct over 10,000 experiments, rigorously controlling compute budgets while independently varying model size, number of training tokens, and molecular representation. Our results demonstrate clear scaling laws in molecular models for both pretraining and downstream transfer, reveal the substantial impact of molecular representation on performance, and explain previously observed inconsistencies in scaling behavior for molecular generation. Additionally, we publicly release the largest library of molecular language models to date to facilitate future research and development.
