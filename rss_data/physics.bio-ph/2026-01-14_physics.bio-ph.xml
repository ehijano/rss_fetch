      <title>Optimal Discretization in Hour-Glass Molecular Clocks Driven by Oscillating Free Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hour-glass clocks do not free-run; they keep time by riding an external rhythm. Motivated by the primordial KaiBC system in cyanobacteria, we study a driven, finite-state molecular clock that advances through a small number of biochemical states under an intrinsic driving energy and a rotating energy landscape set by day-night metabolism. In the continuum limit, coherence is maximized at a resonant operating point where the intrinsic drift matches the driving frequency. In realistic clocks with a finite number of states, discreteness matters: as the rotating landscape sweeps over a lattice of states, it generates a small and high frequency vibration of the collective phase that makes timing inaccurate. Combining the resonant cost with this discreteness penalty yields a trade-off in the number of states: few states are energetically cheap but noisy; many states are precise but costly. The optimum lies at moderate discretization (typically five to fifteen states) and an environmental coupling that is strong enough for responsiveness yet weak enough to avoid large discrete-state vibrations. These design rules rationalize why KaiC's hexameric architecture falls near the predicted optimum and suggest a general principle for hour-glass clocks across organisms.</description>

      <title>Information-Thermodynamic Analysis of the DNA--RNA Polymerase Complex via Interface Dissipation: large Based on Observer--Observed Swap Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: RNA polymerase (RNAP) is a molecular machine that reads information encoded in the base sequence of a DNA template while producing mechanical motion (transcription elongation; forward/backward stepping; backtracking) through chemical-potential differences of nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs) and fluctuations under external conditions. A prior work formulated a mismatch in free-energy accounting as the involvement of a term originating from genetic information (e.g.\ $k_BT\log P(N)$), and interpreted RNAP as a Maxwell's demon / Szilard-engine-like device that converts information into motion. However, in information thermodynamics, the bookkeeping of information and dissipation can depend on how one partitions the composite system into a device and a target (observer/observed labeling).</description>

      <title>FRET between NV centers in diamond and chlorophyll molecules: a novel resource for multimodal sensing and imaging in plant cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work demonstrates efficient Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) between ensembles of shallow nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers located 7 nm and 9 nm below a single-crystal diamond surface and a naturally occurring fluorophore, namely a mixture of chlorophyll a and b molecules extracted from Arabidopsis thaliana. The broad fluorescence band of NV centers spectrally overlaps with the absorption of chlorophyll molecules, enabling FRET. As a result, depositing a chlorophyll layer on the diamond surface reduces the NV fluorescence lifetime from approximately 14 ns to below 4 ns, indicating efficient energy transfer. Laser-induced photobleaching of chlorophyll restores the unquenched NV lifetime. In contrast, NV centers located deeper within the diamond at depths of 40 nm and 72 nm remain unaffected, confirming that the observed quenching originates from a short-range FRET mechanism. The NV ensembles retain their optically detected magnetic resonance contrast while FRET is observed, demonstrating preservation of their spin properties. These proof-of-principle experiments establish the feasibility of combining FRET-based distance measurements with magnetic sensing using optically readable spins.</description>

      <title>Crossing the Functional Desert: Critical Cascades and a Feasibility Transition for the Emergence of Life</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The origin of life poses a problem of combinatorial feasibility: How can persistent functional organization arise in exponentially branching assembly spaces when unguided exploration behaves as a memoryless random walk? We show that nonlinear threshold-cascade dynamics in connected interaction networks provide a minimal, substrate-agnostic mechanism that can soften this obstruction. Below a critical connectivity threshold, cascades die out locally and structured input-output response mappings remain sparse and transient-a "functional desert" in which accumulation is dynamically unsupported. Near the critical percolation threshold, system-spanning cascades emerge, enabling persistent and discriminative functional responses. We illustrate this transition using a minimal toy model and generalize the argument to arbitrary networked systems. Also near criticality, cascades introduce structural and functional persistence, directional bias, and weak dynamical path-dependence into otherwise memoryless exploration, allowing biased accumulation over short coherence timescales. This connectivity-driven transition-functional percolation-requires only generic ingredients: interacting units, nonlinear thresholds, influence transmission, and non-zero coherence times. The mechanism does not explain specific biochemical pathways, but it identifies a necessary dynamical regime in which structured functional organization can emerge and persist, providing a physical foundation for how combinatorial feasibility barriers can be crossed through network dynamics alone.</description>

      <title>Controlling microalgae populations by phototactic memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how microorganisms navigate in complex environments is a central question in active matter and biological physics. Phototaxis - the ability to use light as a navigation cue - is a widespread strategy in motile microalgae to optimise photosynthesis and avoid light-induced stress. The microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is a model system for studying this behaviour, where navigation is classically attributed to a photosensitive organelle named eyespot. While this mechanism enables cells to sense the direction of incoming light, their response to light intensity gradients remains less understood. Here we show that structured light landscapes can guide microalgae populations and localise them in defined spatial regions. By analysing single-cell trajectories, we find that cells actively steer relative to the local light gradient, and a comparison with a minimal theoretical model shows that a short-time memory of light exposure acting on the transition between positive and negative phototaxis is necessary to reproduce the observed accumulation. At longer times, we observe a gradual decrease in cell number density within the trapping region, consistent with phototactic adaptation. Beyond controlling population dynamics, our results reveal new aspects of phototactic behaviour, highlighting gradient-aligned steering together with temporal integration as central mechanisms for navigation in structured environments.</description>

      <title>Designing topological edge states in bacterial active matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topology provides a unifying framework for understanding robust transport through protected edge states arising from nontrivial wavenumber topology. Extending these concepts to active matter, however, remains largely unexplored experimentally, with realizations limited to systems composed of chiral active particles. Here, we realize topological edge states in dense bacterial suspension, which represents a prototypical active matter system, using microfabricated geometrical structures with nontrivial wavenumber topology. Inspired by previous theoretical studies, we constructed a directional kagome network composed of ratchet-shaped channels that induce unidirectional bacterial flow. In this network, we found clear edge localization of bacterial density. A steady-state analysis based on the bacterial transport model and experimentally measured velocity field reveals how the characteristic collective flow generates edge localization. The model also uncovers the topological origin of the observed edge states. By tuning the geometry of the microfabricated networks, we identified directional channel design and network chirality as the key design features essential for the emergence of the edge state. Our results pave the way for establishing a control and design principle of topological transport in such active matter systems.</description>

      <title>Beyond uniform screening: electrostatic heterogeneity dictates solution structure of complex macromolecules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The complexity of biomolecular interactions necessitates advanced methodologies to accurately capture their behavior in solution. In this work, we focus on monoclonal antibodies and adopt a multi-scale coarse-graining strategy for their modeling, with particular emphasis on the role of electrostatic interactions. Using scattering experiments, theoretical analysis, and large-scale computer simulations, we explicitly compare two selected case studies-markedly different in their charge distributions. Through mutually corroborating lines of evidence, we demonstrate that conventional approaches relying on electrostatic screening and implicit charge representations fail to capture the structural and thermodynamic properties of antibody solutions when strong charge heterogeneity is present, even at a moderate (amino acid) level of coarse-graining. These findings highlight the importance of a correct treatment of electrostatic interactions and ion screening for heterogeneously- and oppositely-charged colloidal and protein systems. Such considerations are essential to move beyond descriptive models towards a truly predictive framework, with direct implications for the formulation of therapeutics and the treatment of other complex soft-matter systems.</description>

      <title>Mechanical Interactions Govern Self-Organized Ordering in Bacterial Colonies on Surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00898v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bacterial colonies growing on surfaces are shaped by mechanical stresses transmitted through the community, governed by the balance between cell growth and steric and cell-substrate interactions. Using overdamped dynamics simulations of nonmotile, stress-responsive bacteria, we examine how purely mechanical interactions determine colony morphology and internal organization. Growth-induced extensile stresses compete with steric constraints, giving rise to the spontaneous formation of microdomains composed of highly aligned cells. We characterize this self-organization through the distribution of microdomain areas and a nematic order parameter that quantifies colony-wide alignment. Mechanosensitivity does not systematically alter domain structure, but increasing substrate friction reduces the mean domain size and broadens the diversity of orientations. Shifting the balance toward steric interactions, by lengthening the cell division size, slows the relaxation of colony shape toward isotropy and broadens the distribution of contact forces, producing a slower exponential decay. In dense colonies, strong forces are transmitted anisotropically through chains of aligned neighbors within microdomains. These findings demonstrate that colony-level morphology and stress organization can emerge from local mechanical interactions alone, even without requiring biochemical signaling. By linking microscopic force transmission to macroscopic growth dynamics, our study provides a physical framework for understanding how mechanical interactions shape the self-organization of bacterial communities under surface confinement.</description>

      <title>Forces and symmetry breaking of a living meso-swimmer</title>

Abstract: Swimming is ubiquitous in nature and crucial for the survival of a wide range of organisms. The physics of swimming at the viscosity-dominated microscale and inertia-dominated macroscale is well studied. However, in between lies a complicated mesoscale with swimmers affected by non-linear and time-dependent fluid mechanics. The intricate motility strategies, combined with complex and periodically changing body shapes add extra challenges for accurate meso-swimming modelling. Here, we have further developed the micropipette force sensor to directly probe the swimming forces of the meso-organism Artemia. Through deep neural network-based image analysis, we show how Artemia achieves an increased propulsive force by increasing its level of time-reversal symmetry breaking. We present a universal force-based scaling law for a wide range of micro- to meso-organisms with different body shapes, swimming strategies, and level of inertia at the mesoscale. These results capture fundamental aspects of biological meso-swimming dynamics and provide guidance for future biomimicking meso-robot designs.</description>

Abstract: Learning is based on synaptic plasticity, which affects and is driven by neural activity. Because pre- and postsynaptic spiking activity is shaped by randomness, the synaptic weights follow a stochastic process, requiring a probabilistic framework to capture the noisy synaptic dynamics. We consider a paradigmatic supervised learning example: a presynaptic neural population impinging in a sequence of episodes on a recurrent network of integrate-and-fire neurons through synapses undergoing spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) with additive potentiation and multiplicative depression. We first analytically compute the drift- and diffusion coefficients for a single synapse within a single episode (microscopic dynamics), mapping the true jump process to a Langevin and the associated Fokker-Planck equations. Leveraging new analytical tools, we include spike-time--resolving cross-correlations between pre- and postsynaptic spikes, which corrects substantial deviations seen in standard theories purely based on firing rates. We then apply this microdynamical description to the network setup in which hetero-associations are trained over one-shot episodes into a feed-forward matrix of STDP synapses connecting to neurons of the recurrent network (macroscopic dynamics). By mapping statistically distinct synaptic populations to instances of the single-synapse process above, we self-consistently determine the joint neural and synaptic dynamics and, ultimately, the time course of memory degradation and the memory capacity. We demonstrate that specifically in the relevant case of sparse coding, our theory can quantitatively capture memory capacities which are strongly overestimated if spike-time--resolving cross-correlations are ignored.

      <title>Direct measurement of the attractive electrosolvation force between a pair of colloidal particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14652v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In solution, electrically like-charged particles can experience a strong and long-ranged attraction that leads to the formation of stable, slowly reorganizing clusters. The attractive force underpinning this spontaneous organization process has been shown to depend on both the sign of charge of the particle and the nature of the solvent medium. The origin of the attraction has been ascribed to the preferential orientation of solvent molecules at the object-electrolyte interface. Here, we use optical imaging to directly measure the spatial profile of the potential of mean force between isolated pairs of charged microspheres. Working with particles carrying a variety of surface chemistries we find that the range of the electrosolvation attraction is substantially longer than previously held. In particular we show that particles carrying strongly anionic surface coatings composed of DNA or phospholipid bilayers display long-range attraction. We further find that the length scale governing the decay of the attractive force can depend on the properties of the interacting particles. This contrasts with the canonical expectation that the screening length governing the interaction of charged particles in solution depends exclusively on the properties of the intervening electrolyte medium. The observations point to significant departures from current thinking, and the likely need for a model of interactions that accounts for the molecular nature of the solvent, its interfacial behaviour, and spatial correlations. Finally, a strong and long-ranged attraction mediated by anionic matter constituting lipid membranes and chromatin could carry far-reaching implications for biological organization and structure formation.</description>

      <title>EEG Brain mapping based on the Duffing oscillator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00618v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study proposes a Duffing oscillator based measurement framework for detecting frequency components associated with postsynaptic potential related activity in EEG recordings. The Duffing oscillator is employed as a nonlinear measurement system whose high sensitivity to weak periodic inputs enables robust frequency estimation in the presence of strong noise. Because postsynaptic potentials are embedded in noisy EEG recordings, they are treated as weak signals. Based on the detected weak-signal frequency distributions across EEG channels, topographic maps of brain activity are constructed to visualize spatial variations in neural activation. For this purpose, EEG signals recorded from two musicians and two audience members during a music experiment were analysed. The frequency components of the weak signals were searched within the 4 37 Hz range across all EEG channels. Subsequently, topographic brain maps were generated according to the number of detected weak-signal components. The results indicate that Duffing oscillator based weak signal detection is an effective tool for EEG brain mapping. Compared with Fourier and wavelet-based methods, the proposed technique provides a more detailed representation of brain activation. These findings suggest that the proposed approach has potential for investigating various pathological conditions and for enhancing the understanding of cognitive and behavioural functions of the human brain.</description>
