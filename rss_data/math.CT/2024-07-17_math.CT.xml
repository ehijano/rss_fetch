      <title>Combining fixpoint and differentiation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interactions between derivatives and fixpoints have many important applications in both computer science and mathematics. In this paper, we provide a categorical framework to combine fixpoints with derivatives by studying Cartesian differential categories with a fixpoint operator. We introduce an additional axiom relating the derivative of a fixpoint with the fixpoint of the derivative. We show how the standard examples of Cartesian differential categories where we can compute fixpoints provide canonical models of this notion. We also consider when the fixpoint operator is a Conway operator, or when the underlying category is closed. As an application, we show how this framework is a suitable setting to formalize the Newton-Raphson optimization for fast approximation of fixpoints and extend it to higher order languages.</description>

      <title>Filtral pretoposes and compact Hausdorff locales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.11169v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The category of compact Hausdorff locales is a pretopos which is filtral, meaning that every object is covered by one whose subobject lattice is isomorphic to the lattice of filters of complemented elements. We show that any filtral pretopos satisfying some mild additional conditions can be embedded into the category of compact Hausdorff locales. This result is valid in the internal logic of any topos. Assuming the principle of weak excluded middle and the existence of copowers of the terminal object in the pretopos, the image of the embedding contains all spatial compact Hausdorff locales.
  The notion of filtrality was introduced by V. Marra and L. Reggio (Theory Appl. Categ., 2020) to characterise the category of compact Hausdorff spaces within the class of pretoposes. Our results can be regarded as a constructive extension of the aforementioned characterisation, avoiding reference to points. If the ambient logic is classical, i.e. it satisfies excluded middle, and the prime ideal theorem for Boolean algebras holds, we obtain as a corollary the characterisation of compact Hausdorff spaces in op. cit.</description>

      <title>Diagrammatic category theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.08891v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In category theory, the use of string diagrams is well known to aid in the intuitive understanding of certain concepts, particularly when dealing with adjunctions and monoidal categories. We show that string diagrams are also useful in exploring fundamental properties of basic concepts in category theory, such as universal properties, (co)limits, Kan extensions, and (co)ends. For instance, string diagrams are utilized to represent visually intuitive proofs of the Yoneda lemma, necessary and sufficient conditions for being adjunctions, the fact that right adjoints preserve limits (RAPL), and necessary and sufficient conditions for having pointwise Kan extensions. We also introduce a method for intuitively calculating (co)ends using diagrammatic representations and employ it to prove several properties of (co)ends and weighted (co)limits. This paper proposes that using string diagrams is an effective approach for beginners in category theory to learn the fundamentals of the subject in an intuitive and understandable way.</description>

      <title>Adding a constant and an axiom to a doctrine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08324v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the meaning of "adding a constant to a language" for any doctrine, and "adding an axiom to a theory" for a primary doctrine, by showing how these are actually two instances of the same construction. We prove their universal properties, and how these constructions are compatible with additional structure on the doctrine. Existence of Kleisli object for comonads in the 2-category of indexed poset is proved in order to build these constructions.</description>
