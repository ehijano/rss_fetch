      <title>Brown measures of deformed $L^\infty$-valued circular elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Brown measure of $a+\mathfrak{c}$, where $a$ lies in a commutative tracial von Neumann algebra $\mathcal{B}$ and $\mathfrak{c}$ is a $\mathcal{B}$-valued circular element. Under certain regularity conditions on $a$ and the covariance of $\mathfrak{c}$ this Brown measure has a density with respect to the Lebesgue measure on the complex plane which is real analytic apart from jump discontinuities at the boundary of its support. With the exception of finitely many singularities this one-dimensional spectral edge is real analytic. We provide a full description of all possible edge singularities as well as all points in the interior, where the density vanishes. The edge singularities are classified in terms of their local edge shape while internal zeros of the density are classified in terms of the shape of the density locally around these points. We also show that each of these countably infinitely many singularity types occurs for an appropriate choice of $a$ when $\mathfrak{c}$ is a standard circular element. The Brown measure of $a+\mathfrak{c}$ arises as the empirical spectral distribution of a diagonally deformed non-Hermitian random matrix with independent entries when its dimension tends to infinity.</description>

      <title>A kinetic model approximation of Walsh's spider process on the infinite star-like graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider processes of deterministic motions on $k$ copies of the star-like graph $S_k= K_{1,k}$ with $k$ edges which are perturbed by two stochastic mechanisms: one caused by interfaces located at the graphs' centers, the other describing jumps between different copies of the same edge. We prove that diffusing scaling of these processes leads in the limit to the Walsh's spider process on $S_k$.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing SLE-decorated Liouville quantum gravity surfaces from random permutons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Permutons constructed from a Liouville quantum gravity surface and a pair of space-filling Schramm-Loewner evolutions (SLEs) have been shown -- or are conjectured -- to describe the scaling limit of various natural models of random constrained permutations. We prove that, in two distinct and natural settings, these permutons uniquely determine, modulo rotation, scaling, translation and reflection, both the Liouville quantum gravity surface and the pair of space-filling SLEs used in their construction. In other words, the Liouville quantum gravity surface and the pair of space-filling SLEs can be deterministically reconstructed from the permuton.
  Our results cover the cases of the skew Brownian permutons, the universal limits of pattern-avoiding permutations, and the meandric permuton, which is the conjectural permuton limit of permutations obtained from uniform meanders.
  In the course of the proof, we give a detailed description of how the support of the permuton relates to the multiple points of the two space-filling SLEs.</description>

      <title>Sticky coupling as a control variate for sensitivity analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present and analyze a control variate strategy based on couplings to reduce the variance of finite difference estimators of sensitivity coefficients, called transport coefficients in the physics literature. We study the bias and variance of a sticky-coupling and a synchronous-coupling based estimator as the finite difference parameter $\eta$ goes to zero. For diffusions with elliptic additive noise, we show that when the drift is contractive outside a compact the bias of a sticky-coupling based estimator is bounded as $\eta \to 0$ and its variance behaves like $\eta^{-1}$, compared to the standard estimator whose bias and variance behave like $\eta^{-1}$ and $\eta^{-2}$, respectively. Under the stronger assumption that the drift is contractive everywhere, we additionally show that the bias and variance of the synchronous-coupling based estimator are both bounded as $\eta \to 0$. Our hypotheses include overdamped Langevin dynamics with many physically relevant non-convex potentials. We illustrate our theoretical results with numerical examples, including overdamped Langevin dynamics with a highly non-convex Lennard-Jones potential to demonstrate both failure of synchronous coupling and the effectiveness of sticky coupling in the not globally contractive setting.</description>

      <title>Global solutions to the stochastic heat equation with superlinear accretive reaction term and polynomially growing multiplicative noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that mild solutions to the stochastic heat equation with superlinear accretive forcing and polynomially growing multiplicative noise cannot explode under two sets of assumptions. The first set of assumptions allows both the deterministic forcing and multiplicative noise terms to grow polynomially, as long as the multiplicative noise is sufficiently larger. The second set of assumptions imposes an Osgood condition on the deterministic forcing and allows the multiplicative noise to grow polynomially. In both cases, the multiplicative noise cannot grow faster than $u^{\frac{3}{2}}$, as this would cause explosion.</description>

      <title>A theory of generalised coordinates for stochastic differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic differential equations are ubiquitous modelling tools in physics and the sciences. In most modelling scenarios, random fluctuations driving dynamics or motion have some non-trivial temporal correlation structure, which renders the SDE non-Markovian; a phenomenon commonly known as ``colored'' noise. Thus, an important objective is to develop effective tools for mathematically and numerically studying (possibly non-Markovian) SDEs. In this report, we formalise a mathematical theory for analysing and numerically studying SDEs based on so-called `generalised coordinates of motion'. Like the theory of rough paths, we analyse SDEs pathwise for any given realisation of the noise, not solely probabilistically. Like the established theory of Markovian realisation, we realise non-Markovian SDEs as a Markov process in an extended space. Unlike the established theory of Markovian realisation however, the Markovian realisations here are accurate on short timescales and may be exact globally in time, when flows and fluctuations are analytic. This theory is exact for SDEs with analytic flows and fluctuations, and is approximate when flows and fluctuations are differentiable. It provides useful analysis tools, which we employ to solve linear SDEs with analytic fluctuations. It may also be useful for studying rougher SDEs, as these may be identified as the limit of smoother ones. This theory supplies effective, computationally straightforward methods for simulation, filtering and control of SDEs; amongst others, we re-derive generalised Bayesian filtering, a state-of-the-art method for time-series analysis. Looking forward, this report suggests that generalised coordinates have far-reaching applications throughout stochastic differential equations.</description>

      <title>Large deviations for a spatial average of stochastic heat and wave equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the one-dimensional stochastic heat and wave equations driven by Gaussian noises with constant initial conditions. We study the spatial average of the solutions on an interval of length $R$ and show that the family of laws of the spatial average satisfies the large deviation principle as $R$ goes to infinity. We also present the large deviation principle in the space of continuous functions. We prove these results using the tools of Malliavin calculus to evaluate the covariance of nonlinear functionals of the solution.</description>

      <title>Hessian Spectrum at the Ground State in Spherical Spin Glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine the bulk Hessian spectrum at approximate ground states in any spherical spin glass. Marginal stability, the presence of many near-zero Hessian eigenvalues, is shown to be equivalent to full replica symmetry breaking near overlap $1$ at zero temperature. This connection has long been implicit in the physics literature, which also links marginal stability to the performance of efficient algorithms. For even models, we prove the Hessian has no outlier eigenvalues, which has geometric consequences for low temperature Gibbs measures in the case that marginal stability is absent. Our proofs rely on interpolation bounds for certain vector spin glass models. For generic spin glasses, we give another more conceptual argument that full RSB near overlap $1$ implies marginal stability at low temperature.</description>

      <title>Rates of convergence in the central limit theorem for Banach valued dependent variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide rates of convergence in the central limit theorem in terms of projective criteria for adapted stationary sequences of centered random variables taking values in Banach spaces, with finite moment of order $p \in ]2,3]$ as soon as the central limit theorem holds for the partial sum normalized by $n^{-1/2}$. %The conditions are expressed in terms of projective criteria. This result applies to the empirical distribution function in $L^p(\mu)$, where $p\geq 2$ and $\mu$ is a real $\sigma$-finite measure: under some $\tau$-mixing conditions we obtain a rate of order $O(n^{-(p-2)/2})$. In the real case, our result leads to new conditions to reach the optimal rates of convergence in terms of Wasserstein distances of order $p\in ]2,3]$.</description>

      <title>Absence of percolation for infinite Poissonian systems of stopped paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The state space of our model is the Euclidean space in dimension d = 2. Simultaneously, from all points of a homogeneous Poisson point process, we let grow independent and identically distributed random continuum paths. Each path stops growing at time t \&amp;gt; 0 if it hits the trace of the other curves realized up until time t. Such dynamic is well-defined as long as the distribution of paths has a finite second moment at each time t \&amp;gt; 0. Letting the time runs until infinity so that each path reaches its stopping curve, we study the connected property of the graph formed by all stopped curves. Our main result states the absence of percolation in this graph, meaning that each cluster consists of a finite number of curves. The assumptions on the distribution of paths are very mild, with the main one being the so-called 'loop assumption' which ensures that finite clusters (necessarily containing a loop) occur with positive probability. The main issue in this model comes from the long-range dependence arising from long sequences of causalities in the hitting/stopping procedure. Most methods based on block approaches fail to effectively address the question of percolation in this setting.</description>

      <title>On the stationary measures of two variants of the voter model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the voter model, vertices of a graph (interpreted as voters) adopt one out of two opinions (0 and 1), and update their opinions at random times by copying the opinion of a neighbor chosen uniformly at random. This process is dual to a system of coalescing random walks. The duality implies that the set of stationary measures of the voter model on a graph is linked to the dynamics of the collision of random walks on this graph. By exploring the key ideas behind this relationship, we characterize the sets of stationary measures for two variations of the voter model: first, a version that incorporates interchanging of opinions among voters, and second, the voter model on dynamical percolation. To achieve these results, we analyze the collision properties of random walks in two contexts: first, with a swapping behavior that complicates collisions, and second, with random walks defined on a dynamical percolation environment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the precise large deviation probabilities for the sizes of intermediate level sets in branching Brownian motion (BBM). Our conclusions improve on a result of A\"{i}dekon, Hu and Shi in [J. Math. Sci. \textbf{238}(2019)]. Additionally, we analyze the typical behaviors of BBM conditioned on large level sets. Our approach relies on the connections between intermediate level sets, additive martingale limits of BBM, and the global minimum of linearly transformed BBMs.</description>

As part of the proof we obtain a bound for the least non-zero singular value of $X-z$ when $z$ is an edge eigenvalue and a bound for the inner product between left and right singular vectors of $X-z$ when $|z|=1+O(N^{-1/2})$.</description>

      <title>Normal to Poisson phase transition for subgraph counting in the random-connection model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the limiting behavior of the count of subgraphs isomorphic to a graph $G$ with $m\geq 0$ fixed endpoints in the random-connection model, as the intensity $\lambda$ of the underlying Poisson point process tends to infinity. When connection probabilities are of order $\lambda^{-\alpha}$ we identify a phase transition phenomenon via a critical decay rate $\alpha^\ast_m (G)&gt;0$ such that normal approximation for subgraph counts holds when $\alpha \in (0,\alpha^\ast_m (G) )$, and a Poisson limit result holds if $\alpha = \alpha^\ast_m (G)$. Our method relies on cumulant growth rates derived by the convex analysis of planar diagrams that list the partitions involved in cumulant identities. As a result, by the cumulant method we obtain normal approximation results with convergence rates in the Kolmogorov distance, and a Poisson limit theorem, for subgraph counts.</description>

      <title>Percolation of discrete GFF in dimension two I. Arm events in the random walk loop soup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, which is the first part of a series of two papers, we study the random walk loop soup in dimension two. More specifically, we estimate the probability that two large connected components of loops come close to each other, in the subcritical and critical regimes. The associated four-arm event can be estimated in terms of exponents computed in the Brownian loop soup, relying on the connection between this continuous process and conformal loop ensembles (with parameter $\kappa \in (8/3,4]$).
  Along the way, we need to develop several useful tools for the loop soup, based on separation for random walks and surgery for loops, such as a "locality" property and quasi-multiplicativity. The results established here then play a key role in a second paper, in particular to study the connectivity properties of level sets in the random walk loop soup and in the discrete Gaussian free field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study percolation of two-sided level sets for the discrete Gaussian free field (DGFF) in 2D. For a DGFF $\varphi$ defined in a box $B_N$ with side length $N$, we show that with high probability, there exist low crossings in the set of vertices $z$ with $|\varphi(z)|\le\varepsilon\sqrt{\log N}$ for any $\varepsilon&gt;0$, while the average and the maximum of $\varphi$ are of order $\sqrt{\log N}$ and $\log N$, respectively. Our method also strongly suggests the existence of such crossings below $C\sqrt{\log\log N}$, for $C$ large enough. As a consequence, we also obtain connectivity properties of the set of thick points of a random walk.
  We rely on an isomorphism between the DGFF and the random walk loop soup (RWLS) with critical intensity $\alpha=1/2$, and further extend our study to the occupation field of the RWLS for all subcritical intensities $\alpha\in(0,1/2)$. For the RWLS in $B_N$, we show that for $\lambda$ large enough, there exist low crossings of $B_N$, remaining below $\lambda$, even though the average occupation time is of order $\log N$. Our results thus uncover a non-trivial phase-transition for this highly-dependent percolation model.
  For both the DGFF and the occupation field of the RWLS, we further show that such low crossings can be found in the "carpet" of the RWLS - the set of vertices which are not in the interior of any cluster of loops.
  This work is the second part of a series of two papers. It relies heavily on tools and techniques developed for the RWLS in the first part, especially surgery arguments on loops, which were made possible by a separation result in the RWLS. This allowed us, in that companion paper, to derive several useful properties such as quasi-multiplicativity, and obtain a precise upper bound for the probability that two large connected components of loops "almost touch", which is instrumental here.</description>

      <title>Damage detection in an uncertain nonlinear beam based on stochastic Volterra series</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The damage detection problem in mechanical systems, using vibration measurements, is commonly called Structural Health Monitoring (SHM). Many tools are able to detect damages by changes in the vibration pattern, mainly, when damages induce nonlinear behavior. However, a more difficult problem is to detect structural variation associated with damage, when the mechanical system has nonlinear behavior even in the reference condition. In these cases, more sophisticated methods are required to detect if the changes in the response are based on some structural variation or changes in the vibration regime, because both can generate nonlinearities. Among the many ways to solve this problem, the use of the Volterra series has several favorable points, because they are a generalization of the linear convolution, allowing the separation of linear and nonlinear contributions by input filtering through the Volterra kernels. On the other hand, the presence of uncertainties in mechanical systems, due to noise, geometric imperfections, manufacturing irregularities, environmental conditions, and others, can also change the responses, becoming more difficult the damage detection procedure. An approach based on a stochastic version of Volterra series is proposed to be used in the detection of a breathing crack in a beam vibrating in a nonlinear regime of motion, even in reference condition (without crack). The system uncertainties are simulated by the variation imposed in the linear stiffness and damping coefficient. The results show, that the nonlinear analysis done, considering the high order Volterra kernels, allows the approach to detect the crack with a small propagation and probability confidence, even in the presence of uncertainties.</description>

      <title>An R package for nonparametric inference on dynamic populations with infinitely many types</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fleming-Viot diffusions are widely used stochastic models for population dynamics which extend the celebrated Wright-Fisher diffusions. They describe the temporal evolution of the relative frequencies of the allelic types in an ideally infinite panmictic population, whose individuals undergo random genetic drift and at birth can mutate to a new allelic type drawn from a possibly infinite potential pool, independently of their parent. Recently, Bayesian nonparametric inference has been considered for this model when a finite sample of individuals is drawn from the population at several discrete time points. Previous works have fully described the relevant estimators for this problem, but current software is available only for the Wright-Fisher finite-dimensional case. Here we provide software for the general case, overcoming some non trivial computational challenges posed by this setting. The R package FVDDPpkg efficiently approximates the filtering and smoothing distribution for Fleming-Viot diffusions, given finite samples of individuals collected at different times. A suitable Monte Carlo approximation is also introduced in order to reduce the computational cost.</description>

      <title>Detecting Change Points of Covariance Matrices in High Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Testing for change points in sequences of high-dimensional covariance matrices is an important and equally challenging problem in statistical methodology with applications in various fields. Motivated by the observation that even in cases where the ratio between dimension and sample size is as small as $0.05$, tests based on a fixed-dimension asymptotics do not keep their preassigned level, we propose to derive critical values of test statistics using an asymptotic regime where the dimension diverges at the same rate as the sample size.
  This paper introduces a novel and well-founded statistical methodology for detecting change points in a sequence of high-dimensional covariance matrices. Our approach utilizes a min-type statistic based on a sequential process of likelihood ratio statistics. This is used to construct a test for the hypothesis of the existence of a change point with a corresponding estimator for its location. We provide theoretical guarantees for these inference tools by thoroughly analyzing the asymptotic properties of the sequential process of likelihood ratio statistics in the case where the dimension and sample size converge with the same rate to infinity. In particular, we prove weak convergence towards a Gaussian process under the null hypothesis of no change. To identify the challenging dependency structure between consecutive test statistics, we employ tools from random matrix theory and stochastic processes. Moreover, we show that the new test attains power under a class of alternatives reflecting changes in the bulk of the spectrum, and we prove consistency of the estimator for the change-point location.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel mesh-free and direct method for computing the shape derivative in PDE-constrained shape optimization problems. Our approach is based on a probabilistic representation of the shape derivative and is applicable for second-order semilinear elliptic PDEs with Dirichlet boundary conditions and a general class of target functions. The probabilistic representation derives from an extension of a boundary sensitivity result for diffusion processes due to Costantini, Gobet and El Karoui [14]. Moreover, we present a simulation methodology based on our results that does not necessarily require a mesh of the relevant domain, and provide Taylor tests to verify its numerical accuracy</description>

      <description>arXiv:2109.13819v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by recent developments of quasi-stationary Monte Carlo methods, we investigate the stability of quasi-stationary distributions of killed Markov processes under perturbations of the generator. We first consider a general bounded self-adjoint perturbation operator, and after that, study a particular unbounded perturbation corresponding to truncation of the killing rate. In both scenarios, we quantify the difference between eigenfunctions of the smallest eigenvalue of the perturbed and unperturbed generators in a Hilbert space norm. As a consequence, L1 norm estimates of the difference of the resulting quasi-stationary distributions in terms of the perturbation are provided.</description>

Abstract: We study a rumour propagation model along the lines of \cite{lebensztayn2008disk} as a long-range percolation model on $\Z$. We begin by showing a sharp phase transition-type behaviour in the sense of exponential decay of the survival time of the rumour cluster in the sub-critical phase.
  In the super-critical phase, \update{under the assumption that radius of influence r.v. has $2+\epsilon$ moment finite (for some $\epsilon&gt;0$)}, we show that the rightmost vertex in the rumour cluster has a deterministic speed in the sense that after appropriate scaling, the location of the rightmost vertex converges a.s.\ to a deterministic positive constant. \update{Under the assumption that radius of influence r.v. has $4+\epsilon$ moment finite,} we obtain a central limit theorem for appropriately scaled and centred rightmost vertex. Later, we introduce a rumour propagation model with reactivation.
  For this section, we work with a family of exponentially decaying i.i.d. radius of influence r.v.'s, and we obtain the speed result for the scaled rightmost position of the rumour cluster. Each of these results is novel, in the sense that such properties have never been established before in the context of the rumour propagation model on $\Z$, to the best of our knowledge.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.04864v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a stochastic geometry dynamics inspired by opinion dynamics, which captures the essence of modern asymmetric social networks, with leaders and followers. Opinions are represented by points in the Euclidean space and the leader of an agent is the agent with the closest opinion. In this dynamics, each follower updates its opinion by halving the distance to its leader. We show that this simple dynamics and its iterates exhibit several interesting purely geometric phenomena pertaining to the evolution of leadership and of opinion clusters, which are reminiscent of those observed in social network. We also show that when the initial opinions are randomly distributed as a stationary Poisson point process, the probability of occurrence of each of these phenomena can be represented by an integral geometry formula involving semi-agebraic domains. Furthermore, we prove this property for step 0 and step 1 of the dynamics using percolation techniques. We f inally analyze numerically the limiting behavior of this follower dynamics. In the Poisson case, the agents fall into two categories, that of ultimate followers, which never stop updating their opinions, and that of ultimate leaders, which adopt a fixed opinion in a finite time. All our findings are complemented by spatial discrete event simulations.</description>

Abstract: Superpositions of Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes allow a flexible dependence structure, including long range dependence for OU-type processes. Their complex asymptotics are governed by three effects: the behavior of the L\'evy measure both at infinity and at zero, and the behavior at zero of the measure governing the dependence. We establish almost sure rates of growth depending on the characteristics of the process and prove a Marcinkiewicz--Zygmund type SLLN for the integrated process.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we consider sample path growth of superpositions of Ornstein--Uhlenbeck type processes (supOU). SupOU processes are stationary infinitely divisible processes defined as integrals with respect to a random measure. They allow marginal distributions and correlations to be modeled independently. Our results show that the almost sure behavior is primarily governed by the tail of the marginal distribution. In particular, we obtain a general integral test for the sample path growth that covers both heavy-tailed and light-tailed scenarios. We also investigate the tail behavior of the marginal distributions in connection with the characteristics of the underlying random measure.</description>

      <title>Mixing cutoff for simple random walks on the Chung-Lu digraph</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15356v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we are interested in the mixing behaviour of simple random walks on inhomogeneous directed graphs. We focus our study on the Chung-Lu digraph, which is an inhomogeneous network that generalizes the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi digraph. In particular, under the Chung-Lu model, edges are included in the graph independently and according to given Bernoulli laws, so that the average degrees are fixed. To guarantee the a.s. existence of a unique reversible measure, which is implied by the strong connectivity of the graph, we assume that the average degree grows logarithmically in the size $n$ of the graph. In this weakly dense regime, we prove that the total variation distance to equilibrium displays a cutoff behaviour at the entropic time of order $\log(n)/\log\log(n)$. Moreover, we prove that on a precise window, the cutoff profile converges to the Gaussian tail function. This is qualitatively similar to what was proved in [6,7,8] for the directed configuration model, where degrees are deterministically fixed. In terms of statistical ensembles, our analysis provides an extension of these cutoff results from a hard to a soft-constrained model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07326v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we establish two fundamental results for the sublevel set persistent homology for stationary processes indexed by the positive integers. The first is a strong law of large numbers for the persistence diagram (treated as a measure "above the diagonal" in the extended plane) evaluated on a large class of sets and functions$\unicode{x2014}$more than just continuous functions with compact support. We prove this result subject to only minor conditions that the sequence is ergodic and the tails of the marginals are not too heavy. The second result is a central limit theorem for the persistence diagram evaluated on the class of all step functions; this result holds as long as a $\rho$-mixing criterion is satisfied and the distributions of the partial maxima do not decay too slowly. Our results greatly expand those extant in the literature to allow for more fruitful use in statistical applications, beyond idealized settings. Examples of distributions and functions for which the limit theory holds are provided throughout.</description>

This class includes every fixed pattern of ups and downs having at least one of each, such as the alternating case considered by Stanley in arXiv:math/0511419 and Widom in arXiv:math/0511533. In every case considered the convergence in the limit of long permutations is to normal with mean and variance linear in the length of the permutation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2110.14332v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$ and a coloring of its edges, a subgraph of $G$ is called rainbow if its edges have distinct colors. The rainbow girth of an edge coloring of G is the minimum length of a rainbow cycle in G. A generalization of the famous Caccetta-H\"aggkvist conjecture, proposed by the first author, is that if in an coloring of the edge set of an $n$-vertex graph by $n$ colors, in which each color class is of size $k$, the rainbow girth is at most $\lceil \frac{n}{k} \rceil$. In the known examples for sharpness of this conjecture the color classes are stars, suggesting that when the color classes are matchings, the result may be improved. We show that the rainbow girth of $n$ matchings of size at least 2 is $O(\log n)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.09034v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of almost surely discrete random probability measures is an active line of research in Bayesian nonparametrics. The idea of assuming interaction across the atoms of the random probability measure has recently spurred significant interest in the context of Bayesian mixture models. This allows the definition of priors that encourage well-separated and interpretable clusters. In this work, we provide a unified framework for the construction and the Bayesian analysis of random probability measures with interacting atoms, encompassing both repulsive and attractive behaviours. Specifically, we derive closed-form expressions for the posterior distribution, the marginal and predictive distributions, which were not previously available except for the case of measures with i.i.d. atoms. We show how these quantities are fundamental both for prior elicitation and to develop new posterior simulation algorithms for hierarchical mixture models. Our results are obtained without any assumption on the finite point process that governs the atoms of the random measure. Their proofs rely on analytical tools borrowed from the Palm calculus theory, which might be of independent interest. We specialise our treatment to the classes of Poisson, Gibbs, and determinantal point processes, as well as in the case of shot-noise Cox processes. Finally, we illustrate the performance of different modelling strategies on simulated and real datasets.</description>

Abstract: We discuss a central limit theorem in the framework of the group algebra of the Thompson group $F$. We consider the sequence of self-adjoint elements given by $a_n=\frac{g_n+g_n^{*}}{\sqrt{2}}$ in the noncommutative probability space $(\mathbb{C}(F),\varphi)$, where the expectation functional $\varphi$ is the trace associated to the left regular representation of $F$, and the $g_n$-s are the generators of $F$ in its standard infinite presentation. We show that the limit law of the sequence $s_n = \frac{a_0+\cdots+a_{n-1}}{\sqrt{n}}$ is the standard normal distribution.</description>

Abstract: Let $d,n\in \mathbb{N}$ be such that $d=\omega(1)$, and $d\le n^{1-a}$ for some constant $a&gt;0$. Consider a $d$-regular graph $G=(V, E)$ and the random graph process that starts with the empty graph $G(0)$ and at each step $G(i)$ is obtained from $G(i-1)$ by adding uniformly at random a new edge from $E$. We show that if $G$ satisfies some (very) mild global edge-expansion, and an almost optimal edge-expansion of sets up to order $O(d\log n)$, then for any constant $k\in \mathbb{N}$ in the random graph process on $G$, typically the hitting times of minimum degree at least $k$ and of $k$-connectedness are equal. This, in particular, covers both $d$-regular high dimensional product graphs and pseudo-random graphs, and confirms a conjecture of Joos from 2015. We further demonstrate that this result is tight in the sense that there are $d$-regular $n$-vertex graphs with optimal edge-expansion of sets up to order $\Omega(d)$, for which the probability threshold of minimum degree at least one is different than the probability threshold of connectivity.</description>
