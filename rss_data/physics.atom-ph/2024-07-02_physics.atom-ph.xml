      <title>Imaging of single barium atoms in a second matrix site in solid xenon for barium tagging in a $^{136}$Xe double beta decay experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutrinoless double beta decay is one of the most sensitive probes for new physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. One of the isotopes under investigation is $^{136}$Xe, which would double beta decay into $^{136}$Ba. Detecting the single $^{136}$Ba daughter provides a sort of ultimate tool in the discrimination against backgrounds. Previous work demonstrated the ability to perform single atom imaging of Ba atoms in a single-vacancy site of a solid xenon matrix. In this paper, the effort to identify signal from individual barium atoms is extended to Ba atoms in a hexa-vacancy site in the matrix and is achieved despite increased photobleaching in this site. Abrupt fluorescence turn-off of a single Ba atom is also observed. Significant recovery of fluorescence signal lost through photobleaching is demonstrated upon annealing of Ba deposits in the Xe ice. Following annealing, it is observed that Ba atoms in the hexa-vacancy site exhibit antibleaching while Ba atoms in the tetra-vacancy site exhibit bleaching. This may be evidence for a matrix site transfer upon laser excitation. Our findings offer a path of continued research toward tagging of Ba daughters in all significant sites in solid xenon.</description>

      <title>A new technique to measure gravitational mass of ultra-cold matter and its implications for antimatter studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measuring the effect of gravity on antimatter is a longstanding problem in physics that has significant implications for our understanding of the fundamental nature of the universe. Here, we present a technique to measure the gravitational mass of atoms, motivated by a recent measurement of antimatter atoms in CERN [1]. We demonstrate the results on ultra-cold atoms by measuring the surviving fraction of atoms gradually released from a quadrupole magnetic trap, which is tilted due to gravitational potential. We compare our measurements with a Monte Carlo simulation to extract the value of the gravitational constant. The difference between the literature value for g, the local acceleration due to gravity, and the measured value is $(-1.9 \pm 12^{stat} \pm 5^{syst}) \times 10^{- 4} g$. We demonstrate the importance of various design parameters in the experiment setup, and estimate their contribution to the achievable accuracy in future experiments. Our method demonstrates simplicity, precision, and reliability, paving the way for future precision studies of the gravitational force on antimatter. It also enables a precise calibration of atom traps based on the known gravitational attraction of normal matter to Earth.</description>

      <title>Short-term stability of a microcell optical reference based on Rb atom two-photon transition at 778 nm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the development and short-term stability characterization of an optical frequency reference based on the spectroscopy of the rubidium two-photon transition at 778 nm in a microfabricated vapor cell. When compared against a 778 nm reference signal extracted from a frequency-doubled cavity-stabilized telecom laser, the short-term stability of the microcell frequency standard is 3.5 $\times$ 10$^{-13}$ $\tau^{-1/2}$ until 200~s, in good agreement with a phase noise level of $+$ 43 dBrad$^2$/Hz at 1~Hz offset frequency. The two main contributions to the short-term stability of the microcell reference are currently the photon shot noise and the intermodulation effect induced by the laser frequency noise. With still a relevant margin of progress, these results show the interest of this spectroscopic approach for the demonstration of high-stability miniaturized optical vapor cell clocks. Such clocks are poised to be highly beneficial for applications in navigation, communications, and metrology.</description>

      <title>Creation, Control, and Modeling of NV Centers in Nanodiamonds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sensing based on Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) centers in nanodiamonds (NDs) offers significant potential across various applications. However, optimizing their quantum-optical properties remains challenging. This study focuses on enhancing and controlling the optical properties of NV centers in NDs through surface chemistry tuning and proton beam irradiation. Systematic thermal oxidations were performed to investigate the evolution of surface chemical groups using IR spectroscopy and their influence on optical properties using photoluminescence spectroscopy and PL decay measurements. Proton irradiation was explored over a wide range of fluences (10^14 to 10^17 cm^-2) to precisely control the NV center concentration, identifying conditions that maximize creation and emission intensity. Furthermore, NV center charge state control was achieved by analyzing the NV-/NV0 ratio with varying surface terminations and NV center concentrations. A novel predictive mathematical model was developed to evaluate the efficiencies of forming NV- and NV0. Although tested specifically with proton-irradiated NDs, this model has broad applicability, representing a significant advancement in predicting the outcomes of ion-beam-based color center generation in diamond.</description>

      <title>Effects of resonant dipole-dipole interactions in the spin noise of atomic vapors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform spin noise spectroscopy close to resonance in a 1-mm-thick cell containing a dense Rubidium vapor. A laser is used to excite optical dipoles in the vapor while probing the Faraday rotation noise. We report unusual lineshapes of the spin noise spectra with a strong density dependence, which we attribute to interactions arising between particles in the system. Introducing a two-body model and simulations, we show that these features are the hallmark of a strong dipole-dipole interaction between binaries within the ensemble. A precise fit of the experimental spectra allows to extract the strength and the duration of the dipole-dipole interaction. We unveil its impact on the spin noise frequency and investigate the role of the atomic motion in the unexpected lineshapes. This work demonstrates the potential of spin noise spectroscopy to observe and quantify strong interactions occurring within a particle ensemble.</description>

      <title>Adiabatons in a double tripod coherent atom-light coupling scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical adiabatons are specific shape-invariant pulse pairs propagating at the reduced group velocity and without optical absorption in the medium. The purpose of this study is to analyze and demonstrate adiabaton formation in many level atomic systems. Here we focus on the analysis of five level M-type and double tripod systems. It is found that M-type atomic systems are prone to intensity dependent group velocity and pulse front steepening which prevents the formation of long range optical adiabatons. In contrast, the double tripod atomic system is quite favorable for the formation of optical adiabatons leading to two different optical field configurations propagating with invariant shape.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic angular momentum, spin and helicity of higher-order Poincare modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The availability of coherent sources of higher order Poincare optical beams have opened up new opportunities for applications such as in the optical trapping of atoms and small particles, the manipulation of chirally-sensitive systems and in improved encoding schemes for broad-bandwidth communications. Here we determine the intrinsic properties of Poincare Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) modes which have so far neither been evaluated, nor their significance highlighted. The theoretical framework we adopt here is both novel and essential because it emphasises the crucial role played by the normally ignored axial components of the twisted light fields of these modes. We show that the inclusion of the axial field components enables the intrinsic properties of the Poincare modes, notably their angular momentum, both spin and orbital as well as their helicity and chirality, to be determined. We predict significant enhancements of the intrinsic properties of these modes when compared with those due to the zero order LG modes. In particular, we show that higher order LG Poincare modes exhibit super-chirality and, significantly so, even in the case of the first order</description>

      <title>Non-Gaussian generalized two-mode squeezing: applications to two-ensemble spin squeezing and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bosonic two-mode squeezed states are paradigmatic entangled Gaussian states that have wide utility in quantum information and metrology. Here, we show that the basic structure of these states can be generalized to arbitrary bipartite quantum systems in a manner that allows simultaneous, Heisenberg-limited estimation of two independent parameters for finite-dimensional systems. Further, we show that these general states can always be stabilized by a relatively simple Markovian dissipative process. In the specific case where the two subsystems are ensembles of two-level atoms or spins, our generalized states define a notion of two-mode spin squeezing that is valid beyond the Gaussian limit and that enables true multi-parameter estimation. We discuss how generalized Ramsey measurements allow one to reach the two-parameter quantum Cramer-Rao bound, and how the dissipative preparation scheme is compatible with current experiments.</description>

      <title>New Radiative and Collisional Atomic Data for Sr {\sc ii} and Y {\sc ii} with application to Kilonova modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spectra of singly ionised Strontium and Yttrium (Sr {\sc ii} and Y {\sc ii}) have been proposed as identifications of certain spectral features in the AT2017gfo spectrum. With the growing demand for NLTE simulations of Kilonovae, there is a increasing need for atomic data for these and other $r$-process elements. Our goal is to expand upon the current set of atomic data for $r$-process elements, by presenting transition probabilities and Maxwellian-averaged effective collision strengths for Sr {\sc ii} and Y {\sc ii}. The Breit-Pauli and DARC $R$-matrix codes are employed to calculate the appropriate collision strengths, which are thermally averaged according to a Maxwellian distribution to calculate excitation and de-excitation rates. The {\sc tardis} and {\sc ColRadPy} packages are subsequently used to perform LTE and NLTE modelling respectively. A complete set of transition probabilities and effective collision strengths involving levels for Sr {\sc ii} and Y {\sc ii} have been calculated for temperature ranges compatible with kilonova plasma conditions. Forbidden transitions were found to disagree heavily with the Axelrod approximation, an approximation which is currently employed by other models within the literature. Theoretically important spectral lines are identified with both LTE and NLTE modelling codes. LTE simulations in {\sc tardis} reveal no new significant changes to the full synthetic spectra. NLTE simulations in {\sc ColRadPy} provide indications of which features are expected to be strong for a range of regimes, and we include luminosity estimates. Synthetic emission spectra over KNe densities and temperatures reveal potentially interesting spectral lines in the NIR.</description>

      <title>Transport property predictions for laser resonance chromatography on Rf$^+$ (Z = 104)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08120v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a theoretically designed laser resonance chromatography (LRC) experiment on Rf$^+$ (Z = 104) drifting in He buffer gas. To this end, we first developed a four-level rate equation model that simulates the optical pumping of Rf$^+$ from its ground state, $^2$D$_{3/2}$ (7s$^2$6d$^1$), to the metastable $^4$F$_{3/2}$ (7s$^1$6d$^2$) state via laser resonant excitation of the intermediate $^4$F$_{3/2}$ (7s$^1$6d$^1$7p$^1$) state prior to electronic state chromatography. This model predicts a 93% pumping efficiency that suffices to enable efficient laser resonance chromatography of this ion. We then performed accurate relativistic Multi-Reference Configuration-Interaction (MRCI) calculations to model the interaction of Rf$^+$ with He in the ground $^2$D$_{3/2}$ (7s$^2$6d$^1$), low-lying $^2$D$_{5/2}$ (7s$^2$6d$^1$), and metastable $^4$F$_{3/2}$ (7s$^1$6d$^2$) states. These ion-atom interaction potentials were used to calculate the state-specific ion mobilities. For gas temperatures above 100 K and small applied electric fields, the reduced ion mobilities of the ground and metastable states differ significantly. In particular, at room temperature the difference between the reduced ion mobilities of these states is larger than 11%, and as such sufficiently large to ensure LRC of this ion.</description>

Abstract: We report first results obtained during the commissioning of the Laser Resonance Chromatography (LRC) apparatus, which is conceived to enable atomic structure investigations in the region of the heaviest elements beyond nobelium. In our studies we first established optimum conditions for the operation of the different components of the setup, including the radio-frequency quadrupole ion buncher and the cryogenic drift tube, which was operated with helium buffer gas at relatively low electric fields. We used laser ablated hafnium, lutetium, and ytterbium cations to assess the chromatography performance of the drift tube at a gas temperature of $295$K. Arrival time distributions of singly charged lutetium revealed two distinct ion mobilities of this ion in the ground and metastable state in helium with a relative difference of about $19$%. By using $^{219}$Rn ions from a $^{223}$Ra recoil source the overall efficiency of the apparatus is found to be $(0.6\pm0.1)$%. The findings help to establish LRC on lutetium, which is the lighter chemical homolog of lawrencium.</description>

      <title>Interatomic Interaction Models for Magnetic Materials: Recent Advances</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12544v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Atomistic modeling is a widely employed theoretical method of computational materials science. It has found particular utility in the study of magnetic materials. Initially, magnetic empirical interatomic potentials or spin-polarized density functional theory (DFT) served as the primary models for describing interatomic interactions in atomistic simulations of magnetic systems. Furthermore, in recent years, a new class of interatomic potentials known as magnetic machine-learning interatomic potentials (magnetic MLIPs) has emerged. These MLIPs combine the computational efficiency, in terms of CPU time, of empirical potentials with the accuracy of DFT calculations. In this review, our focus lies on providing a comprehensive summary of the interatomic interaction models developed specifically for investigating magnetic materials. We also delve into the various problem classes to which these models can be applied. Finally, we offer insights into the future prospects of interatomic interaction model development for the exploration of magnetic materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08849v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In order to interpret and predict the behavior and properties of fusion plasma, accurate cross sections for electronic processes in collisions between plasma impurities and atomic hydrogen are required. In this work, we investigate the electron capture, target excitation, and ionization processes occurring in collision of ${\rm N}^{4+}$ with atomic hydrogen in a broad energy domain ranging from 0.06 to 225 keV/u. We consider ${\rm N}^{4+}$ ground state ${\rm N}^{4+} (2s)$ and also ${\rm N}^{4+} (2p)$ since the impurities in the edge plasma environment may be excited due to collisions with electrons and ions/atoms. Total and partial cross sections in both spin-averaged and spin-resolved cases are calculated using a two-active-electron semiclassical asymptotic-state close-coupling approach. For electron capture cross sections the present results show the best overall agreement with available experimental data for both total and partial cross sections, and the origins of observed discrepancies are discussed. Furthermore, we provide new data for target excitation and ionization processes, which are essential to improve our understanding of this relevant collision system. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has recently published a report highlighting the importance and the scarcity of such data. Our work therefore will allow a better modeling and thus understanding of magnetically confined fusion plasma.</description>

      <title>Potential scatterings in $L^2$ space: (1) non-orthogonality of stationary states</title>

Abstract: Orthogonality of eigenstates of different energies and its implications in potential scattering are unlabeled. Scalar products of scattering states of different energies are found to have finite non-orthogonal terms in potentials of finite widths. Their superpositions have time-dependent norms, and are not suitable for isolate states. In these systems, a perturbative method and a variational method are viable methods for finding a rigorous transition probability that describes phenomena completely. In various exceptional potentials, an orthogonality is satisfied.</description>

      <title>Atomic clock interferometry using optical tweezers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14412v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Clock interferometry refers to the coherent splitting of a clock into two different paths and recombining in a way that reveals the proper time difference between them. Unlike the comparison of two separate clocks, this approach allows testing how non-flat spacetime influences quantum coherence. Atomic clocks are currently the most accurate time keeping devices. Here we propose using optical tweezers to implement clock interferometry. Our proposed clock interferometer employs an alkaline-earth-like atom held in an optical trap at the magic wavelength. Through a combination of adiabatic, tweezer-based, splitting and recombining schemes and a modified Ramsey sequence on the clock states, we achieve a linear sensitivity to the gravitational time dilation. Moreover, the measurement of the time dilation is insensitive to relative fluctuations in the intensity of the tweezer beams. We analyze the tweezer clock interferometer and show that it is feasible with current technological capabilities. The proposed interferometer could test the effect of gravitational redshift on quantum coherence, and implement the quantum twin paradox.</description>
