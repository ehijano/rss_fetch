      <title>BESTOpt: A Modular, Physics-Informed Machine Learning based Building Modeling, Control and Optimization Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern buildings are increasingly interconnected with occupancy, heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems, distributed energy resources (DERs), and power grids. Modeling, control, and optimization of such multi-domain systems play a critical role in achieving building-sector decarbonization. However, most existing tools lack scalability and physical consistency for addressing these complex, multi-scale ecosystem problems. To bridge this gap, this study presents BESTOpt, a modular, physics-informed machine learning (PIML) framework that unifies building applications, including benchmarking, evaluation, diagnostics, control, optimization, and performance simulation. The framework adopts a cluster-domain-system/building-component hierarchy and a standardized state-action-disturbance-observation data typology. By embedding physics priors into data-driven modules, BESTOpt improves model accuracy and physical consistency under unseen conditions. Case studies on single-building and cluster scenarios demonstrate its capability for multi-level centralized and decentralized control. Looking ahead, BESTOpt lays the foundation for an open, extensible platform that accelerates interdisciplinary research toward smart, resilient, and decarbonized building ecosystems.</description>

      <title>Optimal County-Level Siting of Data Centers in the United States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data centers are growing rapidly, creating the pressing need for the development of critical infrastructure build out to support these resource-intensive large loads. Their immense consumption of electricity and, often, freshwater, continues to stress an already constrained and aging power grid and water resources. This paper presents a comprehensive modeling approach to determine the optimal locations to construct such facilities by quantifying their resource use and minimizing associated costs. The interdisciplinary modeling approach incorporates a number of factors including the power grid, telecommunications, climate, water use, and collocated generation potential. This work establishes the base model whose functionality is shown through several test cases focusing on carbon-free generation collocation on a county-level in the United States. The results suggest that while capital costs are the biggest driver, having a longer future outlook and allowing more variable generation collocation influences the model to choose sites with higher renewable potential.</description>

      <title>Robust Grid-Forming Control Based on Virtual Flux Observer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the design and analysis of a novel grid-forming (GFM) control method for grid-connected converters (GCCs). The core novelty lies in a virtual flux observer-based synchronization and load angle control method. The terminal voltage of the converter is directly regulated to provide voltage-source behavior. The control parameters are designed for decoupling and pole placement. The proposed method exhibits strong robustness in stability and dynamical performance across varying and uncertain grid strengths. The robust control performance of the proposed method is first demonstrated by small-signal analysis, then validated by experiments on a 20 kVA power conversion system.</description>

      <title>Sequential Operating Simulation of Solid State Transformer-Driven Next-Generation 800 VDC Data Center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial-intelligence (AI) workloads are driving rapid growth in data-center electricity use and rack power density, increasing demand for power-delivery systems that are efficient and robust to fast load transients. Conventional uninterruptible power supply (UPS) based AC distribution chains involve multiple conversion stages and line-frequency transformers, which compound losses and are less compatible with dynamic AI power profiles. Although solid-state transformers (SSTs) and 800 VDC distribution architecture are widely discussed, implementable topology/control details, and long-horizon validation with realistic operating profiles remain limited. This paper develops an SST-driven 800 VDC architecture that converts 10 kV MVAC to an 800V LVDC bus using a three-phase H-bridge AC/DC stage cascaded with a dual-active-bridge (DAB) DC/DC stage. A coordinated closed-loop control scheme, combining rectifier voltage/current regulation and DAB phase-shift control, is designed to maintain DC-bus voltage stability. The proposed system is implemented on the real-time digital simulation (RTDS) platform and evaluated via sequential simulations using real-world day- and month-scale operating profiles of data centers, benchmarked against a UPS supply chain. Numerical studies demonstrate tight 800 VDC regulation, reduced input-side energy consumption compared with the UPS baseline, and satisfactory power-quality performance. A capacitance sensitivity test quantifies tradeoffs between DC-bus ripple and low-frequency input-power oscillations, yielding a practical capacitance range for design. Overall, the work provides a reproducible evaluation workflow and actionable guidance for next-generation AI data centers.</description>

      <title>Agentic AI-RAN Empowering Synergetic Sensing, Communication, Computing, and Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future sixth-generation (6G) networks are expected to support low-altitude wireless networks (LAWNs), where unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and aerial robots operate in highly dynamic three-dimensional environments under stringent latency, reliability, and autonomy requirements. In such scenarios, autonomous task execution at the network edge demands holistic coordination among sensing, communication, computing, and control (SC3) processes. Agentic Artificially Intelligent Radio Access Networks (Agentic AI-RAN) offer a promising paradigm by enabling the edge network to function as an autonomous decision-making entity for low-altitude agents with limited onboard resources. In this article, we propose and design a task-oriented Agentic AI-RAN architecture that enables SC3 task execution within a single edge node. This integrated design tackles the fundamental problem of coordinating heterogeneous workloads in resource-constrained edge environments. Furthermore, a representative low-altitude embodied intelligence system is prototyped based on a general-purpose Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) platform to demonstrate autonomous drone navigation in realistic settings. By leveraging the Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) partitioning technique and the containerized deployment, the demonstration system achieves physical resource isolation while supporting tightly coupled coordination between real-time communication and multimodal inference under a unified task framework. Experimental results demonstrate low closed-loop latency, robust bidirectional communication, and stable performance under dynamic runtime conditions, highlighting its viability for mission-critical low-altitude wireless networks in 6G.</description>

      <title>Challenges in the Proper Metrological Verification of Smart Energy Meters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The most common instruments currently measuring active/reactive energy and power quality indicators are smart energy meters. Unfortunately, the verification of such meters is currently performed under ideal conditions or with simple signal models, which do not recreate actual states occurring in the power grid and do not ensure the verification of the properties of their signal chains. This paper presents challenges in the proper metrological verification of smart energy meters. It presents existing legal and normative requirements and scientific research directions regarding these meters. Selected test results are presented, which show that although the tested meters meet the normative and legal requirements because they have been approved for sale, numerous imperfections in the signal and measurement chains of the analyzed instruments are revealed for the selected test signal. On the basis of the presented research results, further directions of research in the field of smart energy meters have been determined.</description>

      <title>A Cognitive Framework for Autonomous Agents: Toward Human-Inspired Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces a human-inspired reinforcement learning (RL) architecture that integrates Pavlovian and instrumental processes to enhance decision-making in autonomous systems. While existing engineering solutions rely almost exclusively on instrumental learning, neuroscience shows that humans use Pavlovian associations to leverage predictive cues to bias behavior before outcomes occur. We translate this dual-system mechanism into a cue-guided RL framework in which radio-frequency (RF) stimuli act as conditioned (Pavlovian) cues that modulate action selection. The proposed architecture combines Pavlovian values with instrumental policy optimization, improving navigation efficiency and cooperative behavior in unknown, partially observable environments. Simulation results demonstrate that cue-driven agents adapt faster, achieving superior performance compared to traditional instrumental-solo agents. This work highlights the potential of human learning principles to reshape digital agents intelligence.</description>

      <title>Computation-Accuracy Trade-Off in Service-Oriented Model-Based Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Representing a control system as a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)-referred to as Service-Oriented Model-Based Control (SOMC)-enables runtime-flexible composition of control loop elements. This paper presents a framework that optimizes the computation-accuracy trade-off by formulating service orchestration as an A$^\star$search problem, complemented by Contextual Bayesian Optimization (BO) to tune the multi-objective cost weights. A vehicle longitudinal-velocity control case study demonstrates online, performancedriven reconfiguration of the control architecture. We show that our framework not only combines control and software structure but also considers the real-time requirements of the control system during performance optimization.</description>

      <title>On a Coupled Adoption-Opinion Framework for Competing Innovations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a two-layer adoption-opinion model to study the diffusion of two competing technologies within a population whose opinions evolve under social influence and adoption-driven feedback. After adopting one technology, individuals may become dissatisfied and switch to the alternative. We prove the existence and uniqueness of the adoption-diffused equilibrium, showing that both technologies coexist and that neither partial-adoption nor monopoly can arise. Numerical simulations show that while opinions shape the equilibrium adoption levels, the relative market share between the two technologies depends solely on their user-experience. As a consequence, interventions that symmetrically boost opinions or adoption can disproportionately favor the higher-quality technology, illustrating how symmetric control actions may generate asymmetric outcomes.</description>

      <title>Model Predictive Control for Coupled Adoption-Opinion Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates an optimal control problem for an adoption-opinion model that couples opinion dynamics with a compartmental adoption framework on a multilayer network to study the diffusion of sustainable behaviors. Adoption evolves through social contagion and perceived benefits, while opinions are shaped by social interactions and feedback from adoption levels. Individuals may also stop adopting virtuous behavior due to external constraints or shifting perceptions, affecting overall diffusion. After the stability analysis of equilibria, both in the presence and absence of adopters, we introduce a Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework that optimizes interventions by shaping opinions rather than directly enforcing adoption. This nudge-based control strategy allows policymakers to influence diffusion indirectly, making interventions more effective and scalable. Numerical simulations demonstrate that, in the absence of control, adoption stagnates, whereas MPC-driven interventions sustain and enhance adoption across communities.</description>

      <title>ReLU Networks for Model Predictive Control: Network Complexity and Performance Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed a resurgence in using ReLU neural networks (NNs) to represent model predictive control (MPC) policies. However, determining the required network complexity to ensure closed-loop performance remains a fundamental open problem. This involves a critical precision-complexity trade-off: undersized networks may fail to capture the MPC policy, while oversized ones may outweigh the benefits of ReLU network approximation. In this work, we propose a projection-based method to enforce hard constraints and establish a state-dependent Lipschitz continuity property for the optimal MPC cost function, which enables sharp convergence analysis of the closed-loop system. For the first time, we derive explicit bounds on ReLU network width and depth for approximating MPC policies with guaranteed closed-loop performance. To further reduce network complexity and enhance closed-loop performance, we propose a non-uniform error framework with a state-aware scaling function to adaptively adjust both the input and output of the ReLU network. Our contributions provide a foundational step toward certifiable ReLU NN-based MPC.</description>

      <title>Identification of Port-Hamiltonian Differential-Algebraic Equations from Input-Output Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many models of physical systems, such as mechanical and electrical networks, exhibit algebraic constraints that arise from subsystem interconnections and underlying physical laws. Such systems are commonly formulated as differential-algebraic equations (DAEs), which describe both the dynamic evolution of system states and the algebraic relations that must hold among them. Within this class, port-Hamiltonian differential-algebraic equations (pH-DAEs) offer a structured, energy-based representation that preserves interconnection and passivity properties. This work introduces a data-driven identification method that combines port-Hamiltonian neural networks (pHNNs) with a differential-algebraic solver to model such constrained systems directly from noisy input-output data. The approach preserves the passivity and interconnection structure of port-Hamiltonian systems while employing a backward Euler discretization with Newton's method to solve the coupled differential and algebraic equations consistently. The performance of the proposed approach is demonstrated on a DC power network, where the identified model accurately captures system behaviour and maintains errors proportional to the noise amplitude, while providing reliable parameter estimates.</description>

      <title>Performance of Differential Protection Applied to Collector Cables of Offshore Wind Farms with MMC-HVDC Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ongoing global transition towards low-carbon energy has propelled the integration of offshore wind farms, which, when combined with Modular Multilevel Converter-based High-Voltage Direct Current (MMC-HVDC) transmission, present unique challenges for power system protection. In collector cables connecting wind turbines to offshore MMC, both ends are supplied by Inverter-Based Resources (IBRs), which modify the magnitude and characteristics of fault currents. In this context, this paper investigates the limitations of conventional differential protection schemes under such conditions and compares them with enhanced strategies that account for sequence components. Using electromagnetic transient simulations of a representative offshore wind farm modeled in PSCAD/EMTDC software, internal and external fault scenarios are assessed, varying fault types and resistances. The comparative evaluation provides insights into the sensitivity and selectivity of differential protection and guides a deeper conceptual understanding of the evolving protection challenges inherent to future converter-dominated grids.</description>

      <title>Maximizing Reach-Avoid Probabilities for Linear Stochastic Systems via Control Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The maximization of reach-avoid probabilities for stochastic systems is a central topic in the control literature. Yet, the available methods are either restricted to low-dimensional systems or suffer from conservative approximations. To address these limitations, we propose control architectures that combine the flexibility of Markov Decision Processes with the scalability of Model Predictive Controllers. The Model Predictive Controller tracks reference signals while remaining agnostic to the stochasticity and reach-avoid objective. Instead, the reach-avoid probability is maximized by optimally updating the controller's reference online. To achieve this, the closed-loop system, consisting of the system and Model Predictive Controller, is abstracted as a Markov Decision Process in which a new reference can be chosen at every time-step. A feedback policy generating optimal references is then computed via Dynamic Programming. If the state space of the system is continuous, the Dynamic Programming algorithm must be executed on a finite system approximation. Modifications to the Model Predictive Controller enable a computationally efficient robustification of the Dynamic Programming algorithm to approximation errors, preserving bounds on the achieved reach-avoid probability. The approach is validated on a perturbed 12D quadcopter model in cluttered reach-avoid environments proving its flexibility and scalability.</description>

      <title>AMBER: A Columnar Architecture for High-Performance Agent-Based Modeling in Python</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Agent-based modeling (ABM) has emerged as an indispensable methodology for studying complex adaptive systems across the natural and social sciences. However, Python-based ABM frameworks face a fundamental tension between the accessibility that has made Python dominant in scientific computing and the performance requirements of large-scale simulations. This paper introduces AMBER, a framework that resolves this tension through a novel architectural approach: replacing the conventional object-per-agent representation with columnar state management using the Polars DataFrame library. We analyze the computational characteristics of both paradigms, present the architectural design of AMBER including its core abstractions, spatial environments, experiment management, and optimization capabilities. Empirical evaluation on three canonical benchmarks demonstrates that AMBER achieves speedups of 1.2x to 93x depending on workload characteristics, with the greatest advantages for models dominated by population-wide attribute operations. Memory profiling reveals 30-50% reduction in peak usage compared to object-oriented frameworks. Our results establish columnar state management as a viable architectural foundation for high-performance ABM in interpreted languages.</description>

      <title>Multi-User Content Diversity in Wireless Networks</title>

Abstract: Immersive applications such as eXtended Reality (XR), cloud gaming, and real-time video streaming are central to the vision of 6G networks. These applications require not only low latency and high data rates, but also consistent and high-quality User Experience (UX). Traditional rate allocation and congestion control mechanisms in wireless networks treat users uniformly based on channel conditions, rely only on network-centric Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), and ignore the content diversity, which can lead to inefficient resource utilization and degraded UX. In this paper, we introduce the concept of Multi-User Content Diversity, which recognizes that different users concurrently consume media with varying complexity, and therefore have different bitrate requirements to achieve satisfactory UX. We propose multiple different frameworks that exploit multi-user content diversity and lead to overall network-wide gains in terms of UX. For each framework, we demonstrate the required information exchange between Application Servers (ASs), Application Clients (ACs), and the network, and the algorithms that run in each of these components to optimize a network-wide UXbased objective. Simulation results demonstrate that exploiting multi-user content diversity leads to significant gains in UX capacity, UX fairness, and network utilization, when compared to conventional rate control methods. These findings highlight the potential of content-aware networking as a key enabler for emerging wireless systems.</description>

      <title>Game-to-Real Gap: Quantifying the Effect of Model Misspecification in Network Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Game-theoretic models and solution concepts provide rigorous tools for predicting collective behavior in multi-agent systems. In practice, however, different agents may rely on different game-theoretic models to design their strategies. As a result, when these heterogeneous models interact, the realized outcome can deviate substantially from the outcome each agent expects based on its own local model. In this work, we introduce the game-to-real gap, a new metric that quantifies the impact of such model misspecification in multi-agent environments. The game-to-real gap is defined as the difference between the utility an agent actually obtains in the multi-agent environment (where other agents may have misspecified models) and the utility it expects under its own game model. Focusing on quadratic network games, we show that misspecifications in either (i) the external shock or (ii) the player interaction network can lead to arbitrarily large game-to-real gaps. We further develop novel network centrality measures that allow exact evaluation of this gap in quadratic network games. Our analysis reveals that standard network centrality measures fail to capture the effects of model misspecification, underscoring the need for new structural metrics that account for this limitation. Finally, through illustrative numerical experiments, we show that existing centrality measures in network games may provide a counterintuitive understanding of the impact of model misspecification.</description>

      <title>Zero-Shot MARL Benchmark in the Cyber-Physical Mobility Lab</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a reproducible benchmark for evaluating sim-to-real transfer of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) policies for Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs). The platform, based on the Cyber-Physical Mobility Lab (CPM Lab) [1], integrates simulation, a high-fidelity digital twin, and a physical testbed, enabling structured zero-shot evaluation of MARL motion-planning policies. We demonstrate its use by deploying a SigmaRL-trained policy [2] across all three domains, revealing two complementary sources of performance degradation: architectural differences between simulation and hardware control stacks, and the sim-to-real gap induced by increasing environmental realism. The open-source setup enables systematic analysis of sim-to-real challenges in MARL under realistic, reproducible conditions.</description>

      <title>A Categorical Approach to Semantic Interoperability across Building Lifecycle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Buildings generate heterogeneous data across their lifecycle, yet integrating these data remains a critical unsolved challenge. Despite three decades of standardization efforts, over 40 metadata schemas now span the building lifecycle, with fragmentation accelerating rather than resolving. Current approaches rely on point-to-point mappings that scale quadratically with the number of schemas, or universal ontologies that become unwieldy monoliths. The fundamental gap is the absence of mathematical foundations for structure-preserving transformations across heterogeneous building data. Here we show that category theory provides these foundations, enabling systematic data integration with $O(n)$ specification complexity for $n$ ontologies. We formalize building ontologies as first-order theories and demonstrate two proof-of-concept implementations in Categorical Query Language (CQL): 1) generating BRICK models from IFC design data at commissioning, and 2) three-way integration of IFC, BRICK, and RealEstateCore where only two explicit mappings yield the third automatically through categorical composition. Our correct-by-construction approach treats property sets as first-class schema entities and provides automated bidirectional migrations, and enables cross-ontology queries. These results establish feasibility of categorical methods for building data integration and suggest a path toward an app ecosystem for buildings, where mathematical foundations enable reliable component integration analogous to smartphone platforms.</description>

      <title>Noise Resilience and Robust Convergence Guarantees for the Variational Quantum Eigensolver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) are a class of hybrid quantum-classical algorithms that leverage on classical optimization tools to find the optimal parameters for a parameterized quantum circuit. One relevant application of VQAs is the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), which aims at steering the output of the quantum circuit to the ground state of a certain Hamiltonian. Recent works have provided global convergence guarantees for VQEs under suitable local surjectivity and smoothness hypotheses, but little has been done in characterizing convergence of these algorithms when the underlying quantum circuit is affected by noise. In this work, we characterize the effect of different coherent and incoherent noise processes on the optimal parameters and the optimal cost of the VQE, and we study their influence on the convergence guarantees of the algorithm. Our work provides novel theoretical insight into the behavior of parameterized quantum circuits. Furthermore, we accompany our results with numerical simulations implemented via Pennylane.</description>

      <title>Mixture-of-Models: Unifying Heterogeneous Agents via N-Way Self-Evaluating Deliberation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the N-Way Self-Evaluating Deliberation (NSED) protocol, a Runtime Mixture-of-Models (MoM) architecture that constructs emergent composite models from a plurality of distinct expert agents. Unlike traditional Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) which rely on static gating networks, NSED employs a Dynamic Expertise Broker - a runtime optimization engine that treats model selection as a variation of the Knapsack Problem, binding heterogeneous checkpoints to functional roles based on live telemetry and cost constraints. At the execution layer, we formalize deliberation as a Macro-Scale Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), where the consensus state loops back through a semantic forget gate to enable iterative refinement without proportional VRAM scaling. Key components include an orchestration fabric for trustless N-to-N peer review, a Quadratic Voting activation function for non-linear consensus, and a feedback-driven state update. Empirical validation on challenging benchmarks (AIME 2025, LiveCodeBench) demonstrates that this topology allows ensembles of small (less than 20B) consumer-grade models to match or exceed the performance of state-of-the-art 100B+ parameter models, establishing a new hardware arbitrage efficiency frontier. Furthermore, testing on the DarkBench safety suite reveals intrinsic alignment properties, with peer-mediated correction reducing sycophancy scores below that of any individual agent.</description>

Abstract: This paper proposes a frequency-wise approach for stability analysis of multi-input, multi-output (MIMO) Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) feedback systems through Scaled Relative Graphs (SRGs). Unlike traditional methods, such as the Generalized Nyquist Criterion (GNC), which relies on a coupled analysis that requires the multiplication of models, our approach enables the evaluation of system stability in a decoupled fashion, system by system, each of which is represented by its SRG (or an over-approximation thereof), and it provides an intuitive, visual representation of system behavior. Our results provide conditions for certifying the stability of stable and square MIMO LTI systems connected in closed loop.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Detection of Friction Anomalies in Satellite Reaction Wheels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04060v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As the number of satellites in orbit has increased exponentially in recent years, ensuring their correct functionality has started to require automated methods to decrease human workload. In this work, we present an algorithm that analyzes the on-board data related to friction from the Reaction Wheel Assemblies (RWA) of a satellite and determines their operating status, distinguishing between nominal status and several possible anomalies that require preventive measures to be taken. The algorithm first uses a model based on hybrid systems theory to extract the information relevant to the problem. The extraction process combines techniques in changepoint detection, dynamic programming, and maximum likelihood in a structured way. A classifier then uses the extracted information to determine the status of the RWA. This last classifier has been previously trained with a labelled dataset produced by a high-fidelity simulator, comprised for the most part of nominal data. The final algorithm combines model-based and data-based approaches to obtain satisfactory results with an accuracy around 95%.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14652v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel Kernelized Data-Driven Predictive Control (KDPC) scheme for robust, offset-free tracking of nonlinear systems. Our computationally efficient hybrid approach separates the prediction: (1) kernel ridge regression learns the nonlinear map from past trajectories, and (2) analytical linearization of the kernel map approximates the effect of future inputs. This linearization is key, allowing the controller to be formulated as a standard Quadratic Program (QP) for efficient real-time implementation. Offset-free tracking is inherently achieved by using input increments. We provide theoretical guarantees for recursive feasibility and asymptotic stability. The algorithm is validated on a nonlinear Van der Pol oscillator, where it successfully rejects unmeasured disturbances and eliminates steady-state errors, outperforming a standard model-based controller.</description>

      <title>Robust H-infinity control and worst-case search in constrained parametric space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15480v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Standard H-infinity/H2 robust control and analysis tools operate on uncertain parameters assumed to vary independently within prescribed bounds. This paper extends their capabilities in the presence of constraints coupling these parameters and restricting the parametric space. Focusing on the worst-case search, we demonstrate - based on the theory of upper-C1 functions - the validity of using standard, readily available smooth optimization algorithms to address this nonsmooth constrained optimization problem. In particular, we prove that the sequential quadratic programming algorithm converges to Karush-Kuhn-Tucker points, and that such conditions are satisfied by any subgradient at a local minimum. This worst-case search then enables robust controller synthesis: identified worst-case configurations are iteratively added to an active set on which a non-smooth multi-models optimization of the controller is performed. The methodology is illustrated on a satellite benchmark with flexible appendages, of order 50 with 43 uncertain parameters. From a practical point of view, we combine the local exploitation proposed above with a global exploration using either Monte-Carlo sampling or particle swarm optimization. We show that the proposed constrained optimization effectively complements Monte-Carlo sampling by enabling fast detection of rare worst-case configurations, and that the robust controller optimization converges with less than 10 active configurations.</description>

      <title>Small-Signal Stability Oriented Real-Time Operation of Power Systems with a High Penetration of Inverter-Based Resources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04892v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study proposes a control strategy to ensure the safe operation of modern power systems with high penetration of inverter-based resources (IBRs) within an optimal operation framework. The objective is to obtain operating points that satisfy the optimality conditions of a predefined problem while guaranteeing small-signal stability. The methodology consists of two stages. First, an offline analysis of a set of operating points is performed to derive a data-driven regression-based expression that captures a damping-based stability index as a function of the operating conditions. Second, an Online Feedback Optimization (OFO) controller is employed to drive the system toward an optimal operating point while maintaining a secure distance from the instability region. The proposed strategy is evaluated on an academic test case based on a modified version of the IEEE 9-bus system, in which synchronous generators are replaced by IBRs operating under both grid-following and grid-forming control modes. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the method and are discussed in detail.</description>

      <title>Data Generation for Stability Studies of Power Systems with High Penetration of Inverter-Based Resources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06369v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing penetration of inverter-based resources (IBRs) is fundamentally reshaping power system dynamics and creating new challenges for stability assessment. Data-driven approaches, and in particular machine learning models, require large and representative datasets that capture how system stability varies across a wide range of operating conditions and control settings. This paper presents an open-source, high-performance computing framework for the systematic generation of such datasets. The proposed tool defines a scalable operating space for large-scale power systems, explores it through an adaptive sampling strategy guided by sensitivity analysis, and performs small-signal stability assessments to populate a high-information-content dataset. The framework efficiently targets regions near the stability margin while maintaining broad coverage of feasible operating conditions. The workflow is fully implemented in Python and designed for parallel execution. The resulting tool enables the creation of high-quality datasets that support data-driven stability studies in modern power systems with high IBR penetration.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Control Barrier Functions under State Estimation: From Euclidean Space to Lie Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16198v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ensuring safety for autonomous systems under uncertainty remains challenging, particularly when safety of the true state is required despite the true state not being fully known. Control barrier functions (CBFs) have become widely adopted as safety filters. However, standard CBF formulations do not explicitly account for state estimation uncertainty and its propagation, especially for stochastic systems evolving on manifolds. In this paper, we propose a safety-critical control framework with a provable bound on the finite-time safety probability for stochastic systems under noisy state information. The proposed framework explicitly incorporates the uncertainty arising from both process and measurement noise, and synthesizes controllers that adapt to the level of uncertainty. The framework admits closed-form solutions in linear settings, and experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness on systems whose state spaces range from Euclidean space to Lie groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.16003v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time-optimal control for triple integrator under full box constraints is a fundamental problem in the field of optimal control, which has been widely applied in the industry. However, scenarios involving asymmetric constraints, non-stationary boundary conditions, and active position constraints pose significant challenges. This paper provides a complete characterization of time-optimal switching surfaces for the problem, leading to novel insights into the geometric structure of the optimal control. The active condition of position constraints is derived, which is absent from the literature. An efficient algorithm is proposed, capable of planning time-optimal trajectories under asymmetric full constraints and arbitrary boundary states, with a 100% success rate. Computational time for each trajectory is within approximately 10$\mu$s, achieving a 5-order-of-magnitude reduction compared to optimization-based baselines.</description>
