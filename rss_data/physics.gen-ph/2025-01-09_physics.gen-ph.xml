      <title>Holographic reconstruction of k-essence model with Tsallis and the most generalized Nojiri-Odintsov version of holographic dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The holographic principle, which has its roots in string theory and black hole thermodynamics, connects the maximum distance of a quantum field theory to its infrared cutoff, which is correlated with the vacuum energy. The present study explores a reconstruction scheme for the k-essence form of dark energy with the most generalized version of holographic dark energy introduced in S. Nojiri, and S. D. Odintsov (2006) (Gen. Relativ. Gravit., 38 p: 1285-1304 ) and (S. Nojiri and S. D. Odintsov, 2017, European Physical Journal C, 77, pp.1-8 ). Here,Ulbossyn Ualikhanova in the initial phase of the study, we begin with a reconstruction scheme of the k-essence model with Tsallis holographic dark energy and finally with a highly generalized version of holographic dark energy with Nojiri-Odintsov generalization. Finally, we have studied the cosmological consequences of the k-essence dark energy with the generalized versions of holographic fluid.</description>

      <title>Time crystal $\phi^4$ kinks by curvature coupling as toy model for mechanism of oscillations propelled by mass, like observed for electron and neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dirac equation requires $E=mc^2$ energy of resting particle, leading to some $\exp(-iEt/\hbar)$ evolution of its field - periodic process of $\omega=mc^2/\hbar$ frequency, literally propelled by particle mass, confirmed experimentally e.g. for quantum phase of electron as de Broglie clock/Zitterbewegung, or flavor oscillations of neutrinos for 3 masses. Entities having energetically preferred periodic process already in the lowest energy state are recently searched for as time crystals.
  To understand such mechanism of propulsion by mass itself, it would be valuable to recreate something like this in simple models like wobbling kinks. There is proposed such toy model as 1+1D $(\phi,\psi)$ Lorentz invariant two-component scalar field theory, extending popular $\phi^4$ model by second component $\psi$ corresponding to such periodically evolving degree of freedom like quantum phase, which is coupled through powers of curvature $R=\partial_0 \phi\partial_1 \psi-\partial_1 \phi\partial_0 \psi$, as suggested by earlier 3+1D model, this way obtaining the required $0&lt;\omega&lt;\infty$ periodic process by energy minimization, preferred due to structure of the kink.</description>

      <title>Topological, Differential Geometry Methods and Modified Variational Approach for Calculation of the Propagation Time of a Signal, Emitted by a GPS-Satellite and Depending on the Full Set of 6 Kepler Parameters Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previously a mathematical approach has been developed for calculation of the propagation time of a signal, emitted by a moving along an elliptical orbit satellite, with account also for the General Relativity Theory (GRT) effects. The formalism was restricted to one dynamical parameter (the true anomaly or the eccentric anomaly angle). In this paper the aim is to extend the formalism to the case, when also the other five Kepler parameters will be changing.The following problem can be formulated: if two satellites move on two space-distributed orbits and they exchange signals, how can the propagation time be calculated? In this paper approaches from differential geometry and topology were implemented.The action functional for the propagation time is represented in the form of a quadratic functional in the differentials of the Kepler elements. The known mapping from celestial mechanics is used, when by means of a transformation the 6 Kepler parameters are mapped into the cartesian coordinates X, Y, Z. This is in fact a submersion of a manifold of 6 parameters into a manifold of 3 parameters. If a variational approach is applied with respect to a differential form in terms of the differentials of the Kepler parameters, the second variation will be different from zero and the Stokes theorem can be applied, provided that the second partial derivatives of the Cartesian coordinates with respect to the Kepler parameters are assumed to be different from zero. From topology viewpoint this requirement is equivalent to the existence of the s.c. Morse functions (non-degenerate at the critical points). In the given case it has been shown that Morse function cannot exist with respect to each one of the Kepler parameters- Morse function cannot be defined with respect to the omega angle.</description>

      <title>A new type of Multiverse, G\"odel theorems and the nonstandard logic of classical, quantum mechanics and quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem is posed of establishing a possible relationship between a new type of Multi-verse representation, G\"odel undecidability theorems and the logic of classical, quantum mechanics and quantum gravity. For this purpose example cases of multi-verses are first discussed in the context of non-relativistic classical, quantum mechanics and quantum gravity. As a result, it is confirmed that thanks to G\"odel theorems non-relativistic classical and quantum mechanics, as well as quantum gravity theory are incomplete. As a consequence, they necessarily admit undecidable logical propositions and therefore obey a three-way boolean logical, i.e., a propositional logic with the three different logical truth values true, false and undecidable.</description>

      <title>Impossible Galaxies, the Hubble Tension and the Ricci soliton miracle,</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The standard model of cosmology has begun to show signs of internal inconsistencies under the relentless onslaught of precision data from the James Webb Telescope (JWST), the Hubble Telescope (HST) and other space-based observation platforms as well as those from the ground. The most statistically significant tension, the so-called Hubble Tension currently stands at between 4 {\sigma} to 6 {\sigma} statistical significance. The JWST high resolution images reveal mature and sometimes quenched galaxies at high redshifts (z&gt;6) which standard cosmological models have failed to both predict and explain. This is the impossible galaxies problem. These short comings of the standard model of cosmology have led to a plethora of new models attempting to explain the inconsistencies between theory and observation. Thus far, none of them adequately address these tensions. In this article, we demonstrate that by including a Ricci soliton into Einstein's field equations both tensions can be adequately resolved. The Ricci soliton is sourced from gravitational energy.</description>
