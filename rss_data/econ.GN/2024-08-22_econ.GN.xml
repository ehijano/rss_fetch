      <title>Rooftop and Community Solar Adoption with Income Heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Each household in a population characterized by income heterogeneity faces random demand for electricity and decides if and when it should adopt a solar product, rooftop solar or community solar. A central planner, aiming to meet an adoption level target within a set time, offers net metering and subsidy on solar products and minimizes its total cost. Our focus is on analyzing the interactions of three new features we add to the literature: income diversity, availability of community solar, and consideration of adoption timing. {Methodology and results:} We develop a bilevel optimization formulation to derive the optimal subsidy policy. The upper level (planner's) problem is a constrained non-linear optimization model in which the planner aims to minimize the average subsidy cost. The lower level (household's) problem is an optimal stopping formulation, which captures the adoption decisions of the households. We derive a closed-form expression for the distribution of optimal adoption time of households for a given subsidy policy. We show that the planner's problem is convex in the case of homogeneous subsidy for the two products. {Managerial implications:} Our results underscore the importance for planners to consider three factors - adoption level target, time target, and subsidy budget - simultaneously as they work in tandem to influence the adoption outcome. The planners must also consider the inclusion of community solar in their plans because, as we show, community and rooftop solar attract households from different sides of the income spectrum. In the presence of income inequality, the availability of community makes it easier to meet solar adoption targets.</description>

      <title>Making intellectual property rights work for climate technology transfer and innovation in developing countries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the controversial role of Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs) in climate technology transfer and innovation in developing countries. Using a systematic literature review and expert interviews, we assess the role of IPRs on three sources of climate technology: (1) international technology transfer, (2) adaptive innovation, and (3) indigenous innovation. Our contributions are threefold. First, patents have limited impact in any of these channels, suggesting that current debates over IPRs may be directed towards the wrong targets. Second, trademarks and utility models provide incentives for climate innovation in the countries studied. Third, drawing from the results, we develop a framework to guide policy on how IPRs can work better in the broader context of climate and trade policies, outlining distinct mechanisms to support mitigation and adaptation. Our results indicate that market mechanisms, especially trade and demand-pull policies, should be prioritised for mitigation solutions. Adaptation differs, relying more on indigenous innovation due to local needs and low demand. Institutional mechanisms, such as finance and co-development, should be prioritised to build innovation capacities for adaptation.</description>

      <title>Empirical Equilibria in Agent-based Economic systems with Learning agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an agent-based simulator for economic systems with heterogeneous households, firms, central bank, and government agents. These agents interact to define production, consumption, and monetary flow. Each agent type has distinct objectives, such as households seeking utility from consumption and the central bank targeting inflation and production. We define this multi-agent economic system using an OpenAI Gym-style environment, enabling agents to optimize their objectives through reinforcement learning. Standard multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) schemes, like independent learning, enable agents to learn concurrently but do not address whether the resulting strategies are at equilibrium. This study integrates the Policy Space Response Oracle (PSRO) algorithm, which has shown superior performance over independent MARL in games with homogeneous agents, with economic agent-based modeling. We use PSRO to develop agent policies approximating Nash equilibria of the empirical economic game, thereby linking to economic equilibria. Our results demonstrate that PSRO strategies achieve lower regret values than independent MARL strategies in our economic system with four agent types. This work aims to bridge artificial intelligence, economics, and empirical game theory towards future research.</description>

      <title>Cross-border Commodity Pricing Strategy Optimization via Mixed Neural Network for Time Series Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of global trade, cross-border commodity pricing largely determines the competitiveness and market share of businesses. However, existing methodologies often prove inadequate, as they lack the agility and precision required to effectively respond to the dynamic international markets. Time series data is of great significance in commodity pricing and can reveal market dynamics and trends. Therefore, we propose a new method based on the hybrid neural network model CNN-BiGRU-SSA. The goal is to achieve accurate prediction and optimization of cross-border commodity pricing strategies through in-depth analysis and optimization of time series data. Our model undergoes experimental validation across multiple datasets. The results show that our method achieves significant performance advantages on datasets such as UNCTAD, IMF, WITS and China Customs. For example, on the UNCTAD dataset, our model reduces MAE to 4.357, RMSE to 5.406, and R2 to 0.961, significantly better than other models. On the IMF and WITS datasets, our method also achieves similar excellent performance. These experimental results verify the effectiveness and reliability of our model in the field of cross-border commodity pricing. Overall, this study provides an important reference for enterprises to formulate more reasonable and effective cross-border commodity pricing strategies, thereby enhancing market competitiveness and profitability. At the same time, our method also lays a foundation for the application of deep learning in the fields of international trade and economic strategy optimization, which has important theoretical and practical significance.</description>
