      <title>Quantum Variational Transformer Model for Enhanced Cancer Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of cancer type and primary tumor site is critical for effective diagnosis, personalized treatment, and improved outcomes. Traditional models struggle with the complexity of genomic and clinical data, but quantum computing offers enhanced computational capabilities. This study develops a hybrid quantum-classical transformer model, incorporating quantum attention mechanisms via variational quantum circuits (VQCs) to improve prediction accuracy. Using 30,000 anonymized cancer samples from the Genome Warehouse (GWH), data preprocessing included cleaning, encoding, and feature selection. Classical self-attention modules were replaced with quantum attention layers, with classical data encoded into quantum states via amplitude encoding. The model, trained using hybrid backpropagation and quantum gradient calculations, outperformed the classical transformer model, achieving 92.8% accuracy and an AUC of 0.96 compared to 87.5% accuracy and an AUC of 0.89. It also demonstrated 35% faster training and 25% fewer parameters, highlighting computational efficiency. These findings showcase the potential of quantum-enhanced transformers to advance biomedical data analysis, enabling more accurate diagnostics and personalized medicine.</description>

      <title>Single-Trajectory Bayesian Modeling Reveals Multi-State Diffusion of the MSH Sliding Clamp</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: DNA mismatch repair (MMR) is the essential mechanism for preserving genomic integrity in various living organisms. In this process, MutS homologs (MSH) play crucial roles in identifying mismatched basepairs and recruiting downstream MMR proteins. The MSH protein exhibits distinct functions and diffusion dynamics before and after the recognition of mismatches while traversing along DNA. An ADP-bound MSH, known as the MSH searching clamp, scans DNA sequences via rotational diffusion along the DNA backbone. Upon recognizing a mismatch, the MSH combines with ATP molecules, forming a stable sliding clamp. Recent experimental evidence challenges the conventional view that the sliding clamp performs a simple Brownian motion. In this study, we explore the diffusion dynamics of the ATP-bound MSH sliding clamp through single-particle tracking experiments and introduce a Bayesian single-trajectory modeling framework to analyze its motion. Our quantitative analysis reveals that the diffusion characteristics defy explanation by a single-state diffusion mechanism. Instead, our in-depth model inference uncovers three distinct diffusion states, each characterized by specific diffusion coefficients. These states alternate over time, with cross-state transitions predominantly involving one intermediate state, and direct transitions between the slowest and the fastest states being scarce. We propose that these multi-state dynamics reflect underlying conformational changes in the MSH sliding clamp, highlighting a more intricate diffusion mechanism than previously appreciated.</description>

      <title>The three-dimensional impulse-response model: Modeling the training process in accordance with energy system-specific adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14841v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Athletic training is characterized by physiological systems responding to repeated exercise-induced stress, resulting in gradual alterations in the functional properties of these systems. The adaptive response leading to improved performance follows a remarkably predictable pattern that may be described by a systems model provided that training load can be accurately quantified and that the constants defining the training-performance relationship are known. While various impulse-response models have been proposed, they are inherently limited in reducing training stress (the impulse) into a single metric, assuming that the adaptive responses are independent of the type of training performed. This is despite ample evidence of markedly diverse acute and chronic responses to exercise of different intensities and durations. Herein, we propose an alternative, three-dimensional impulse-response model that uses three training load metrics as inputs and three performance metrics as outputs. These metrics, represented by a three-parameter critical power model, reflect the stress imposed on each of the three energy systems: the alactic (phosphocreatine/immediate) system; the lactic (glycolytic) system; and the aerobic (oxidative) system. The purpose of this article is to outline the scientific rationale and the practical implementation of the three-dimensional impulse-response model.</description>
