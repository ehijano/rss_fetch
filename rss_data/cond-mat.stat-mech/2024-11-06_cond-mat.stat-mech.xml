      <title>The q-deformed Haldane-Shastry chain at q=i with even length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note we announce some results extending our recent work with A. Toufik on the free-fermion point q=i of the Haldane-Shastry chain to the case with an even number N of sites. The resulting long-range version of the Heisenberg XX chain may be viewed as a model of fermions with extended gl(1|1) symmetry. Unlike for odd N, the conserved charges are nilpotent and exhibit Jordan blocks.</description>

      <title>$O(N)\times O(2)$ scalar models: including $\mathcal{O}(\partial^2)$ corrections in the Functional Renormalization Group analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of phase transitions in frustrated magnetic systems with $O(N)\times O(2)$ symmetry has been the subject of controversy for more than twenty years, with theoretical, numerical and experimental results in disagreement. Even theoretical studies lead to different results, with some predicting a first-order phase transition while others find it to be second-order. Recently, a series of results from both numerical simulations and theoretical analyses, in particular those based on the Conformal Bootstrap, have rekindled interest in this controversy, especially as they are still not in agreement with each other. Studies based on the functional renormalization group have played a major role in this controversy in the past, and we revisit these studies, taking them a step further by adding non-trivial second order derivative terms to the derivative expansion of the effective action. We confirm the first-order nature of the phase transition for physical values of $N$, i.e. for $N=2$ and $N=3$ in agreement with the latest results obtained with the Conformal Bootstrap. We also study an other phase of the $O(N)\times O(2)$ models, called the sinusoidal phase, qualitatively confirming earlier perturbative results.</description>

      <title>Mpemba effect in the relaxation of an active Brownian particle in a trap without metastable states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the role of activity in the occurrence of the Mpemba effect within a system of an active colloid diffusing in a potential landscape devoid of metastable minimum. The Mpemba effect is characterized by a phenomenon where a hotter system reaches equilibrium quicker than a colder one when both are rapidly cooled to the same low temperature. While a minimal asymmetry in the potential landscape is crucial for observing this effect in passive colloidal systems, the introduction of activity can either amplify or reduce the threshold of this minimal asymmetry, resulting in the activity-induced and suppressed Mpemba effect. We attribute these variations in the Mpemba effect to the effective translational shift in the phase space, which occurs as activity is changed.</description>

      <title>Ensemble inequivalence and phase transitions in unlabeled networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discover a first-order phase transition in the canonical ensemble of random unlabeled networks with a prescribed average number of links. The transition is caused by the nonconcavity of microcanonical entropy. Above the critical point, the canonical and microcanonical ensembles are equivalent and have a well-behaved thermodynamic limit. Below the critical point, the ensemble equivalence is broken, and the canonical ensemble is a mixture of phases: empty networks and networks with logarithmic average degrees. As a consequence, networks with bounded average degrees do not survive in the thermodynamic limit, decaying into the empty phase. The celebrated percolation transition in labeled networks is thus absent in unlabeled networks. In view of these differences between labeled and unlabeled ensembles, the question of which one should be used as a null model of different real-world networks cannot be ignored.</description>

      <title>Lower Bound of Entropy Production in an Underdamped Langevin System with Normal Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the lower bound of the entropy production in a one-dimensional underdamped Langevin system constrained by a time-dependent parabolic potential. We focus on minimizing the entropy production during transitions from a given initial distribution to a given final distribution taking a given finite time. We derive the conditions for achieving the minimum entropy production for the processes with normal distributions, using the evolution equations of the mean and covariance matrix to determine the optimal control protocols for stiffness and center of the potential. Our findings reveal that not all covariance matrices can be given as the initial and final conditions due to the limitations of the control protocol. This study extends existing knowledge of the overdamped systems to the underdamped systems.</description>

      <title>Yang-Lee zeros for real-space condensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the electrostatic analogy, we derive an exact formula for the limiting Yang-Lee zero distribution in the random allocation model of general weights. This exhibits a real-space condensation phase transition, which is induced by a pressure change. The exact solution allows one to read off the scaling of the density of zeros at the critical point and the angle at which locus of zeros hits the critical point. Since the order of the phase transition and critical exponents can be tuned with a single parameter for several families of weights, the model provides a useful testing ground for verifying various relations between the distribution of zeros and the critical behavior, as well as for exploring the behavior of physical quantities in the mesoscopic regime, i.e., systems of large but finite size. The main result is that asymptotically the Yang-Lee zeros are images of a conformal mapping, given by the generating function for the weights, of uniformly distributed complex phases.</description>

      <title>Contrasting thermodynamic and hydrodynamic entrop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, using \textit{hydrodynamic entropy} we quantify the multiscale disorder in Euler and hydrodynamic turbulence. These examples illustrate that the hydrodynamic entropy is not extensive because it is not proportional to the system size. Consequently, we cannot add hydrodynamic and thermodynamic entropies, which measure disorder at macroscopic and microscopic scales, respectively. In this paper, we also discuss the hydrodynamic entropy for the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation and Ising spins.</description>

      <title>Exploring the properties of quantum scars in a toy model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of ergodicity and explore its deviation caused by quantum scars in an isolated quantum system, employing a pedagogical approach based on a toy model. Quantum scars, originally identified as traces of classically unstable orbits in certain wavefunctions of chaotic systems, have recently regained interest for their role in non-ergodic dynamics, as they retain memory of their initial states. We elucidate these features of quantum scars within the same framework of this toy model. The integrable part of the model consists of two large spins, with a classical counterpart, which we combine with a random matrix to induce ergodic behavior. Scarred states can be selectively generated from the integrable spin Hamiltonian by protecting them from the ergodic states using a projector method. Deformed projectors mimic the 'quantum leakage' of scarred states, enabling tunable mixing with ergodic states and thereby controlling the degree of scarring. In this simple model, we investigate various properties of quantum scarring and shed light on different aspects of many-body quantum scars observed in more complex quantum systems. Notably, the underlying classicality can be revealed through the entanglement spectrum and the dynamics of 'out-of-time-ordered correlators'.</description>

      <title>Collective Foraging and Behavioural Heterogeneity in Ants: First-Passage Statistics with Heterogeneous Walkers in a Honeycomb Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Individual behavioural heterogeneity is key to understanding how natural populations adapt flexibly to environmental changes. In ant species like $\textit{Aphaenogaster senilis}$, two key roles in collective foraging are commonly recognised: scouts, who discover food patches, and recruits, who exploit these patches and transport food back to the nest. These roles involve distinct movement patterns and exploratory behaviours. In this chapter, we develop a correlated random walk model on the bounded honeycomb lattice to interpret and replicate empirical observations of foraging ants in an enclosed arena with honeycomb tiling. We do so by extending the theory of first-passage processes for $\mathcal{N}$ random walkers when individuals belong to a heterogeneous population. We apply this theory to examine how individual behavioural heterogeneity in ants affects collective foraging efficiency, focusing on first-passage time statistics for nest-to-patch and patch-to-patch movements. With the combined use of the mathematical model and the controlled experimental setup we evaluate (i) the impact of distinct movement strategies by scouts and recruits on finding food items and (ii) whether ants practice strict central place foraging or utilise previously discovered patches as starting points for further exploration.</description>

      <title>Hierarchy of degenerate stationary states in a boundary-driven dipole-conserving spin chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kinetically constrained spin chains serve as a prototype for structured ergodicity breaking in isolated quantum systems. We show that such a system exhibits a hierarchy of degenerate steady states when driven by incoherent pump and loss at the boundary. By tuning the relative pump and loss and how local the constraints are, one can stabilize mixed steady states, noiseless subsystems, and various decoherence-free subspaces, all of which preserve large amounts of information. We also find that a dipole-conserving bulk suppresses current in steady state. These exact results based on the flow in Hilbert space hold regardless of the specific Hamiltonian or drive mechanism. Our findings show that a competition of kinetic constraints and local drives can induce different forms of ergodicity breaking in open systems, which should be accessible in quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Bethe Ansatz, Quantum Circuits, and the F-basis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Bethe Ansatz is a method for constructing exact eigenstates of quantum-integrable spin chains. Recently, deterministic quantum algorithms, referred to as "algebraic Bethe circuits", have been developed to prepare Bethe states for the spin-1/2 XXZ model. These circuits represent a unitary formulation of the standard algebraic Bethe Ansatz, expressed using matrix-product states that act on both the spin chain and an auxiliary space. In this work, we systematize these previous results, and show that algebraic Bethe circuits can be derived by a change of basis in the auxiliary space. The new basis, identical to the "F-basis" known from the theory of quantum-integrable models, generates the linear superpositions of plane waves that are characteristic of the coordinate Bethe Ansatz. We explain this connection, highlighting that certain properties of the F-basis (namely, the exchange symmetry of the spins) are crucial for the construction of algebraic Bethe circuits. We demonstrate our approach by presenting new quantum circuits for the inhomogeneous spin-1/2 XXZ model.</description>

      <title>Gapless Floquet topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases in insulators and superconductors are known for their robust edge modes, linked to bulk invariants through the bulk-boundary correspondence. While this principle traditionally applies to gapped phases, recent advances have extended it to gapless systems, where topological edge states persist even in the absence of a bulk gap. We extend this framework to periodically driven chains with chiral symmetry, revealing the existence of topological edge zero- and pi-modes despite the lack of bulk gaps in the quasienergy spectrum. By examining the half-period decomposition of chiral evolutions, we construct topological invariants that circumvent the need to define the Floquet Hamiltonian, making them more suitable for generalization to the gapless regime. We provide explicit examples, including generalizations of the Kitaev chain and related spin models, where localized pi-modes emerge even when the bulk is gapless at the same quasi-energy as the edge modes. We numerically study the effect of interactions, which give a finite lifetime to the edge modes in the thermodynamic limit with the decay rate consistent with Fermi's Golden Rule.</description>

      <title>A proof of self-organized criticality in a sandpile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bak, Tang, and Wiesenfeld introduced self-organized criticality with the example of a growing sandpile that reaches then sustains a critical density. They presented the abelian sandpile as a potential model. About a decade later, Dickman, Mu\~noz, Vespignani, and Zapperi claimed that self-organizing sandpile models share their critical densities with parametrized model versions that have conventional phase transitions. Fey, Levine, and Wilson subsequently demonstrated that this fails to occur with the abelian sandpile model. However, the primary subject of Dickman et al.'s work was stochastic sandpile models, and it was widely speculated that their paradigm might still hold in that setting. To this end, we confirm a conjecture of Levine and Silvestri by providing the first rigorous proof that activated random walk in dimension one is driven directly to a critical density corresponding to a parametrized phase transition and then remains there.</description>

      <title>Computing critical exponents in 3D Ising model via pattern recognition/deep learning approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we computed three critical exponents ($\alpha, \beta, \gamma$) for the 3D Ising model with Metropolis Algorithm using Finite-Size Scaling Analysis on six cube length scales (L=20,30,40,60,80,90), and performed a supervised Deep Learning (DL) approach (3D Convolutional Neural Network or CNN) to train a neural network on specific conformations of spin states. We find one can effectively reduce the information in thermodynamic ensemble-averaged quantities vs. reduced temperature t (magnetization per spin $&lt;m&gt;(t)$, specific heat per spin $&lt;c&gt;(t)$, magnetic susceptibility per spin $&lt;\chi&gt;(t)$) to \textit{six} latent classes. We also demonstrate our CNN on a subset of L=20 conformations and achieve a train/test accuracy of 0.92 and 0.6875, respectively. However, more work remains to be done to quantify the feasibility of computing critical exponents from the output class labels (binned $m, c, \chi$) from this approach and interpreting the results from DL models trained on systems in Condensed Matter Physics in general.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Discrete Modern Hopfield Networks in Open Quantum System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The modern Hopfield network, proposed by Krotov and Hopfield, is a mathematical generalization of the Hopfield network, which is a basic model of associative memory that employs higher-order interactions. This study introduces an open quantum model for discrete modern Hopfield networks that generalizes the open quantum Hopfield network. Our model integrates dissipative quantum spin systems, governed by quantum master equations, with classical hopping terms and additional quantum effects through a transverse field. We analytically examined the behavior of the stable fixed points and numerically determined the phase diagram. The results demonstrated qualitatively distinct behaviors from the open quantum Hopfield network, showing that the ferromagnetic and limit cycle phases have additional stable fixed points.</description>

      <title>Vibrational similarities in jamming-unjamming of polycrystalline and disordered granular packings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Jammed structures with finite shear modulus emerge from polycrystalline monodisperse and disordered bidisperse granular packings. To link these macroscopic mechanical properties with microstructural characteristics, we examine the vibrational behavior of two-dimensional polycrystalline monodisperse and disordered bidisperse systems using discrete element method simulations. The vibrational density of states (DOS) reflects structural disorder and soft modes, and we analyze this for both types of packings as they approach jamming and unjamming densities. Our results reveal that the low-frequency plateau in the DOS, observed in both polycrystalline and disordered packings, originates from nonaffine particle displacements, particularly those involving "rattlers", which are prominent near jamming and unjamming states. Although the jamming and unjamming process is irreversible, we find no evidence of expected history dependence in the DOS across any of the systems studied.</description>

      <title>Linear response in a charged gas in curved spacetime and covariant heat equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the linear response of a near-equilibrium charged relativistic gas in the presence of electromagnetic and gravitational field in a generic stationary spacetime up to the second order of relaxation time and calculate the tensorial kinetic coefficients introduced by the presence of the strong electromagnetic and/or gravitational field. Using the covariant transfer equations thus developed, a covariant heat equation governing the relativistic heat conduction is derived, which, in Minkowski spacetime, reduces into a form which is remarkably similar to the well-known Cattaneo equation but with a different sign in front of the second-order time derivative term. We also perform a comparative analysis on the different behaviors of our heat equation and the Cattaneo equation in Minkowski spacetime. Furthermore, the effect of gravity on the heat conduction predicted by our heat equation is illustrated around Schwarzschild black hole, which makes a sharp contrast to the Minkowski case.</description>

      <title>Kardar-Parisi-Zhang fluctuations in the synchronization dynamics of limit-cycle oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13253v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The time-dependent process whereby one-dimensional systems of self-sustained oscillators synchronize is shown to display scale invariance in space and time, akin to that found in the dynamics of equilibrium critical phenomena. Remarkably, the process is largely independent of system details, sharing with a class of nonequilibrium surface kinetic roughening the universal scaling behavior of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation with columnar noise, and featuring phase fluctuations that follow a Tracy-Widom probability distribution. This is revealed by a numerical exploration of rings of Stuart-Landau oscillators (the universal representation of an oscillating system close to a Hopf bifurcation) and rings of van der Pol oscillators, both paradigmatically supporting self-sustained oscillations. The critical behavior is very well defined for limit-cycle oscillations near bifurcation, and still dominates comparatively far from it. In particular, the Tracy-Widom fluctuation distribution seems to be an extremely robust feature of the synchronization process. The nonequilibrium criticality here described appears to transcend the details of the coupled dynamical systems that synchronize, making plausible its experimental observation.</description>

      <title>Bringing together two paradigms of non-equilibrium: Fragile versus robust aging in driven glassy systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03516v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There are two key paradigms for non-equilibrium dynamics: on the one hand, aging towards an equilibrium state that cannot be reached on reasonable timescales; on the other, external driving that can lead to non-equilibrium steady states. We explore how these two mechanisms interact, by studying the behaviour of trap models, which are paradigmatic descriptions of slow glassy dynamics, when driven by trajectory bias towards high or low activity. To diagnose whether the driven systems continue to age, we establish a framework for mapping the biased dynamics to a Markovian time evolution with time-dependent transition rates. We find that the original aging dynamics reacts in two qualitatively distinct ways to the driving: it can be destroyed by driving of any nonzero strength (fragile aging), whereby the dynamics either reaches an active steady state or effectively freezes; or it can persist within a finite range of driving strengths around the undriven case (robust aging). This classification into fragile and robust aging could form the basis for distinguishing different universality classes of aging dynamics.</description>

      <title>Microscopic origin of twist-dependent electron transfer rate in bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00783v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using molecular simulation and continuum dielectric theory, we consider how electrochemical kinetics are modulated by twist angle in bilayer graphene electrodes. By establishing a connection between twist angle and the screening length of charge carriers within the electrode, we investigate how tunable metallicity modifies the statistics of the electron transfer energy gap. Constant potential molecular simulations show that the activation free energy for electron transfer increases with screening length, leading to a non-monotonic dependence on the twist angle. The twist angle alters the density of states, tuning the number of thermally-accessible channels for electron transfer and the reorganization energy by affecting the stability of the vertically excited state through attenuated image charge interactions. Understanding these effects allows us to express the Marcus rate of interfacial electron transfer as a function of twist angle, consistent with a growing body of experimental observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07520v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the microcanonical thermal pure quantum (mTPQ) method, the canonical ensemble is derived using Taylor series expansions. We prove that the truncation error decreases exponentially with system size when the effective temperature of the mTPQ state is smaller than the target temperature, and otherwise, the error remains constant. We also show the discipline to set the mTPQ parameter by considering the trade-off between the error and the numerical cost.</description>

      <title>Long-range multi-scalar models at three loops</title>

      <description>arXiv:2007.04603v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the three-loop beta functions of long-range multi-scalar models with general quartic interactions. The long-range nature of the models is encoded in a kinetic term with a Laplacian to the power $0&lt;\zeta&lt;1$, rendering the computation of Feynman diagrams much harder than in the usual short-range case ($\zeta=1$). As a consequence, previous results stopped at two loops, while six-loop results are available for short-range models. We push the renormalization group analysis to three loops, in an $\epsilon=4\zeta-d$ expansion at fixed dimension $d&lt;4$, extensively using the Mellin-Barnes representation of Feynman amplitudes in the Schwinger parametrization. We then specialize the beta functions to various models with different symmetry groups: $O(N)$, $(\mathbb{Z}_2)^N \rtimes S_N$, and $O(N)\times O(M)$. For such models, we compute the fixed points and critical exponents.</description>

      <title>Stable distributions and domains of attraction for unitarily invariant Hermitian random matrix ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.14877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.14877v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider random matrix ensembles on the set of Hermitian matrices that are heavy tailed, in particular not all moments exist, and that are invariant under the conjugate action of the unitary group. The latter property entails that the eigenvectors are Haar distributed and, therefore, factorise from the eigenvalue statistics. We prove a classification for stable matrix ensembles of this kind of matrices represented in terms of matrices, their eigenvalues and their diagonal entries with the help of the classification of the multivariate stable distributions and the harmonic analysis on symmetric matrix spaces. Moreover, we identify sufficient and necessary conditions for their domains of attraction. To illustrate our findings we discuss for instance elliptical invariant random matrix ensembles and P\'olya ensembles, the latter playing a particular role in matrix convolutions. As a byproduct we generalise the derivative principle on the Hermitian matrices to general tempered distributions. This principle relates the joint probability density of the eigenvalues and the diagonal entries of the random matrix.</description>

      <title>Models of Animal Behavior as Active Particle Systems with Nonreciprocal Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14850v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Active particle systems of interacting self-propelled particles offer a versatile framework for modeling complex systems. When employed to describe aspects of animal behavior, the complexity of animal movement and decision-making often requires the use of unique types of effective interactions between the particles -- notably nonreciprocal effective forces that do not obey the usual conservation laws of Newtonian mechanics. Here we review two recent empirically-motivated models, of two very different types of animal behavior, where the behavior is described in terms of active particles which interact through nonreciprocal effective forces. The first model describes the dynamics of animal contests, wherein typically two rivals fight over a localized resource. The uniquely shaped effective potentials between the model's 'contestant particles' manifest the adversarial nature of contest interactions and capture the dynamical essence of contest behavior in space and time. The second model describes the stabilization of cohesive swarms through long-range and adaptive gravity-like attraction. This 'adaptive gravity' model explains the observed mass and velocity profiles of laboratory midge swarms. These examples demonstrate that theoretical models that use the framework of active particles to describe animal behavior can expand the scope of active-particle research, as well as explain complex phenomena in animal behavior.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00597v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a mathematical framework for symmetry-resolved entanglement entropy with a non-abelian symmetry group. To obtain a reduced density matrix that is block-diagonal in the non-abelian charges, we define subsystems operationally in terms of subalgebras of invariant observables. We derive exact formulas for the average and the variance of the typical entanglement entropy for the ensemble of random pure states with fixed non-abelian charges. We focus on compact, semisimple Lie groups. We show that, compared to the abelian case, new phenomena arise from the interplay of locality and non-abelian symmetry, such as the asymmetry of the entanglement entropy under subsystem exchange, which we show in detail by computing the Page curve of a many-body system with SU(2) symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06307v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study Ruelle-Pollicott resonances in translationally invariant quantum many-body lattice systems via spectra of a momentum-resolved operator propagator on infinite systems. Momentum dependence gives insight into the decay of correlation functions, showing that, depending on their symmetries, different correlation functions in general decay with different rates. Focusing on the kicked Ising model the spectrum seems to be typically composed of an annular random matrix like ring whose size we theoretically predict, and few isolated resonances. We identify several interesting regimes, including a mixing regime with a power-law decay of correlation functions. In that regime we also observe a huge difference in time-scales of different correlation functions due to an almost conserved operator. An exact expression for the singular values of the operator propagator is conjectured, showing that it becomes singular at a special point.</description>

      <title>Thermal false vacuum decay in (1+1)-dimensions: Evidence for non-equilibrium dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06411v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We numerically study the evolution of a classical real scalar field in ${(1+1)}$ dimensions with initial conditions describing thermal fluctuations around a metastable vacuum. We track false vacuum decay in real time and compare several observables to the predictions of the standard Euclidean formalism. We find agreement for the shape of the critical bubble and the exponential suppression of the decay rate. However, the decay rate prefactor is almost an order of magnitude lower than the predicted value. We argue that this signals a breakdown of thermal equilibrium during the bubble nucleation. In addition, the inefficient thermalization in the system biases the properties of the statistical ensemble and leads to further decrease of the decay rate with time. We substantiate our interpretation with a suite of stochastic field simulations with controlled thermalization time. Varying this time we find that the predictions of the standard equilibrium formalism are recovered when it is sufficiently short. We propose an upper bound on the thermalization time that must be satisfied in order to ensure the applicability of the Euclidean rate calculation. We discuss that this bound is unavoidably violated in common single-field models, irrespective of the number of spacetime dimensions, implying that deviations from equilibrium in these models cannot be neglected. In theories with multiple fields, the bound may or may not hold, depending on the setup details. We investigate one more signature of non-equilibrium dynamics -- coherent oscillonic precursors to the critical bubble nucleation. We show that they get suppressed in the stochastic dynamical simulations when the thermalization time is reduced.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20334v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a computational study of phonon relaxation in face-centered cubic (fcc) nickel (Ni), focusing on ultra-fast magnetization dynamics. The phonons are excited beyond their thermal equilibrium population, and the relaxation behavior is analyzed as a function of both wave vector ($\vec{q}$) and phonon frequency ($\omega$). To efficiently investigate these excitations, we introduce a trajectory post-processing technique, the frozen-trajectory excitation, which facilitates the $(\vec{q},\omega)$-resolved analysis. Molecular dynamics simulations combined with the frozen-phonon multislice method predict relaxation signatures observable with time-resolved transmission electron microscopy (TEM) at 10 -- 20 fs resolution. Our findings indicate mode dependence in the relaxation processes, highlighting the importance of phonon-specific behavior consideration in ultrafast dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23784v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To unlock the potential for assembling complex colloidal "molecules", we investigate a minimal binary system of programmable colloidal atom-electron equivalents (PAE-EE), where electron equivalents (EEs) are multivalent linkers with two distinct types of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) ends complementary to those ssDNAs on binary programmable atom equivalents (PAEs). We derive a statistical mechanical framework for calculating the effective interaction between PAEs mediated by EEs with arbitrary valency, which quantitatively agrees with simulations that explicitly include EEs. Our analysis reveals an anomalous dependence of PAE-PAE interactions on the EE valency, showing that EE-mediated interactions converge at the large valency limit. Moreover, we identify an optimal EE valency that maximizes the interaction difference between targeted and non-targeted binding pairs of PAEs. These findings offer design principles for targeted self-assembly in PAE-EE systems.</description>
