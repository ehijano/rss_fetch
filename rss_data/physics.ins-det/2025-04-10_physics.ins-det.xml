      <title>Broadband Optical Modulation and Control at Millikelvin Temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A universal experimental challenge when studying radiation effects on cryogenic devices is to precisely and accurately characterize the position-dependent device response very near the energy detection threshold. We have developed a compact cryogenic optical beam steering system that can be used to generate O({\mu}s) pulses of small numbers of photons over the energy range of 1.2 - 4.5eV at room temperature, and deliver those photons via fiber optic to any specified location on the surface of a detector operating at cryogenic temperatures. This new system will allow for robust calibration of any photon-sensitive detector, including supercondcting devices. The system can be used efficiently to explore the physics of target materials, quantify the position sensitivity of different sensor designs, measure phonon transport, and study the effects of quasiparticle poisoning on detector operation. We describe the design of this pulsed calibration method and present first results obtained with a second-generation system operated at room temperature and sub-Kelvin temperatures.</description>

      <title>European Strategy for Particle Physics Update -- PIONEER: a next generation rare pion decay experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: PIONEER is a rapidly developing effort aimed to perform a pristine test of lepton flavour universality (LFU) and of the unitarity of the first row of the CKM matrix by significantly improving the measurements of rare decays of the charged pion. In Phase I, PIONEER aims to measure the charged-pion branching ratio to electrons vs.\ muons $R_{e/\mu}$ to 1 part in $10^4$, improving the current experimental result $R_{e/\mu}\,\text{(exp)} =1.2327(23)\times10^{-4}$ by a factor of 15. This precision on $R_{e/\mu}$ will match the theoretical accuracy of the SM prediction allowing for a test of LFU at an unprecedented level, probing non-SM explanations of LFU violation through sensitivity to quantum effects of new particles up to the PeV mass scale. Phase II and III will aim to improve the experimental precision of the branching ratio of pion beta decay, $\pi^+\to \pi^0 e^+ \nu (\gamma)$, currently at $1.036(6)\times10^{-8}$, by a factor of three and six, respectively. The improved measurements will be used to extract $V_{ud}$ in a theoretically pristine manner. The ultimate precision of $V_{ud}$ is expected to reach the 0.05\,\% level, allowing for a stringent test of CKM unitarity. The PIONEER experiment will also improve the experimental limits by an order of magnitude or more on a host of exotic decays that probe the effects of heavy neutrinos and dark sector physics. This input to the 2026 update of the European Strategy for Particle Physics Strategy describes the physics motivation and the conceptual design of the PIONEER experiment, and is prepared based on the PIONEER proposal submitted to and approved with high priority by the PSI program advisory committee (PAC). Using intense pion beams, and state-of-the-art instrumentation and computational resources, the PIONEER experiment is aiming to begin data taking by the end of this decade.</description>

      <title>High-Precision Lunar Corner-Cube Retroreflectors: A Wave-Optics Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-precision corner-cube retroreflectors (CCRs) are critical for advanced lunar laser ranging (LLR) because they enable sub-millimeter-scale measurements of the Earth-Moon distance -- a level of precision essential for rigorous tests of relativistic gravitation and for advancing our understanding of lunar geophysics. In this work, we develop a comprehensive two-dimensional Fourier-optics model for single CCRs with apertures ranging from 80-110 mm. Our model incorporates realistic thermal-mechanical wavefront errors, detailed diffraction effects, and velocity aberration offsets. Our analysis reveals a strong coupling between aperture size and aberration angular offset: while larger CCRs deliver high on-axis flux under near-ideal conditions, their narrow diffraction lobes suffer significant flux loss at moderate aberration offsets, thereby favoring smaller apertures with broader main lobes. Furthermore, comparisons between solid fused-silica and hollow silicon-carbide (SiC) CCRs show that hollow designs not only achieve competitive or superior photon return -- particularly at 1064 nm, where phase errors are relatively reduced -- but also offer nearly an order-of-magnitude mass reduction for the same aperture sizes. These results establish a robust quantitative framework for optimizing CCR designs to perform at the sub-millimeter level under realistic lunar conditions and underscore the advantages of precision hollow SiC CCRs for next-generation LLR operations.</description>

      <title>Resistivity measurement for non-magnetic materials using high-order resonance mode of mfm-cantilever oscillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A method to measure the electrical resistivity of materials using magnetic-force microscopy (MFM) is discussed, where MFM detects the magnetic field caused by the tip-oscillation-induced eddy current. To achieve high sensitivity, a high cantilever oscillation frequency is preferable, because it induces large eddy currents in the material. Higher-order resonance modes of the cantilever oscillation leads to higher frequency. To discuss such high-order-mode oscillation, a differential equation governing MFM cantilever oscillation in the high-order resonance mode is formulated, and an analytical solution of the phase difference is obtained. The result shows that the phase difference decreases at higher modes, because the effective spring constant increases faster than the force from the eddy current.</description>

      <title>Comparative Performance Analysis of Crystals in Total-Body PET Scanners: Monte-Carlo Simulation Study with Different Materials and Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14220v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Total-Body PET (TB-PET) scanners represent a significant advancement in medical diagnostics, exemplified by the uEXPLORER, the world's first TB-PET system with an axial span of 194 cm, which exhibits exceptional sensitivity and spatial resolution. This study employs the Monte Carlo simulation toolkit Geant4 to evaluate various configurations and materials of detector crystals. We concentrate on three critical parameters: sensitivity, intrinsic coincidence time resolution (CTR), and energy resolution across three crystal designs: 1)standard LYSO crystals as the baseline; 2)0.1% Mg, 1% Ce doped $Gd_3Al_2Ga_3O_{12}$ (Mg,Ce:GAGG) as an alternative material; and 3)pyramid-shaped LYSO crystals, which maintain the same dimensions as the standard LYSO. The research is grounded in the geometric configuration of the uEXPLORER. Our findings reveal that pyramid-shaped LYSO crystals exhibit superior performance, achieving an impressive CTR of 42 ps. In contrast, PET detectors utilizing doped GAGG crystals demonstrate a 6% reduction in intrinsic CTR compared to LYSO. However, Mg,Ce:GAGG crystals surpass LYSO in energy resolution by 25%, while cuboidal LYSO crystals achieve approximately 37% greater sensitivity than their Mg,Ce:GAGG counterparts. These results underscore the impact of different crystal materials and geometries on PET scanner performance, emphasizing the trade-offs among sensitivity, coincidence time resolution (CTR), and energy resolution. Such insights are pivotal for informing the design of future TB-PET systems.</description>

      <title>The SABRE South Technical Design Report Executive Summary</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13889v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this technical design report (TDR) executive summary we describe the SABRE South detector to be built at the Stawell Underground Physics Laboratory (SUPL). The SABRE South detector is designed to test the long-standing DAMA/LIBRA signal of an annually modulating rate consistent with dark matter by using the same target material. Located in the Southern Hemisphere, the detector is uniquely positioned to disentangle modulating seasonal effects. SABRE South uses seven ultra-high purity NaI(Tl) crystals (with a total target mass of either 35 kg or 50 kg), hermetically sealed in copper enclosures that are suspended within a liquid scintillator active veto. High quantum efficiency and low background Hamamatsu R11065 photomultiplier tubes are directly coupled to both ends of the crystal, and enclosed with the crystal in an oxygen free copper enclosure. The active veto system consists of 11.6 kL of linear alkylbenzene (LAB) doped with a mixture of fluorophores and contained in a steel vessel, which is instrumented with at least 18 Hamamatsu R5912 photomultipliers. The active veto tags key radiogenic backgrounds intrinsic to the crystals, such as ${^{40}}$K, and is expected to suppress the total background by 27% in the 1-6 keV region of interest. In addition to the liquid scintillator veto, a muon veto is positioned above the detector shielding. This muon veto consists of eight EJ-200 scintillator modules, with Hamamatsu R13089 photomultipliers coupled to both ends. With an expected total background of 0.72 cpd/kg/keV, SABRE South can test the DAMA/LIBRA signal with 5$\sigma$ discovery or 3$\sigma$ exclusion after two years of data taking.</description>

      <title>Investigating irradiation effects and space charge sign inversion in n-type Low Gain Avalanche Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03462v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low Gain Avalanche Detectors built on n-type substrate (nLGADs) have been developed by IMB-CNM to enhance the detection of low-penetrating particles, with a wide range of applications from medicine, industry to synergies with developments for high-energy physics (HEP). In this work, irradiation effects on nLGADs were investigated through proton irradiation at the CERN PS-IRRAD facility up to proton fluences of $10^{14}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$. Electrical characterization before and after irradiation reveals space charge sign inversion of the n-type bulk, leading to significant modifications in the depletion behavior and electric field distribution. Utilizing UV TCT and TPA-TCT measurements, the impact of irradiation on the electric fields and the gain are studied in more detail, confirming a change of sensor depletion and a reduced electric field in the gain layer. The results suggest that donor removal in nLGADs is stronger pronounced already at lower fluences compared to acceptor removal in traditional p-type LGADs. These findings provide not only first insights into the effects of irradiation on nLGADs but also contribute to the development of methods to quantify the donor removal.</description>

      <title>Cross-Correlated Force Measurement for Thermal Noise Reduction in Torsion Pendulum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00250v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The torsion pendulum is a prevailing instrument for measuring small forces acting on a solid body or those between solid bodies. While it offers powerful advantages, the measurement precision suffers from thermal noises of the suspending wires giving rise to stochastic torque noises. This paper proposes a new scheme to reduce the effect of such noise by employing a double torsion pendulum and cross-correlation technique based on the theoretical analysis that the thermal torque noise appears at each end of the suspending wire differentially. Cross-correlating two synthesized data streams which are composed of the rotation angles of two torsion stages, it yields the power spectral density estimate of external forces acting on the lower stage with the reduced effect from the thermal torque noises. As an example use case, we discuss the application to the study on the coupling strength of ultra light dark matter to standard model particles. Our evaluation indicates that the upper limit may be improved by an order of magnitude than the previous experiments at 2 mHz, which corresponds to about $8\times10^{-18}$ eV.</description>

      <title>Molten salt ion source using glass capillaries as emitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09374v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A proof of concept of an ion source using a molten salt mixture rich in Cs and O ions, able to emit an ion current both in positive and negative polarities, is presented. Similar to liquid metal ion sources, the ions of the salt are emitted by field evaporation from a Taylor cone formed under the influence of an intense electric field. In contrast to an "open" source design in which the conducting liquid covers the surface of a metallic needle, the presented setup uses a conical glass capillary as an emitter tip. {\ffcol The latter is observed by a camera, which revealed the formation of a bubble in the tip containing the molten salt. A glow was also observed during beam emission revealing the anchoring point of the stressed meniscus.} A stable ion beam emission of about 50 min and an intensity of several $\mu$A was obtained. The behavior of the molten salt mixture in vacuum conditions is discussed, as its properties are essential to the design of the presented ion source.</description>

      <title>Direct Measurement of the $^{39}$Ar Half-life from 3.4 Years of Data with the DEAP-3600 Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13196v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The half-life of $^{39}$Ar is measured using the DEAP-3600 detector located 2 km underground at SNOLAB. Between 2016 and 2020, DEAP-3600 used a target mass of (3269 $\pm$ 24) kg of liquid argon distilled from the atmosphere in a direct-detection dark matter search. Such an argon mass also enables direct measurements of argon isotope properties. The decay of $^{39}$Ar in DEAP-3600 is the dominant source of triggers by two orders of magnitude, ensuring high statistics and making DEAP-3600 well-suited for measuring this isotope's half-life. Use of the pulse-shape discrimination technique in DEAP-3600 allows powerful discrimination between nuclear recoils and electron recoils, resulting in the selection of a clean sample of $^{39}$Ar decays. Observing over a period of 3.4 years, the $^{39}$Ar half-life is measured to be $(302 \pm 8_{\rm stat} \pm 6_{\rm sys})$ years. This new direct measurement suggests that the half-life of $^{39}$Ar is significantly longer than the accepted value, with potential implications for measurements using this isotope's half-life as input.</description>
