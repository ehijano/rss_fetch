      <title>Topological phase transition through tunable nearest-neighbor interactions in a one-dimensional lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the phase diagram of a one-dimensional model of hardcore bosons or spinless fermions with tunable nearest-neighbor interactions. By introducing alternating repulsive and attractive interactions on consecutive bonds, we show that the system undergoes a transition from a bond-ordered (BO) phase to a charge-density wave-II (CDW-II) phase as the attractive interaction strength increases at a fixed repulsive interaction. For a specific interaction pattern, the BO phase exhibits topological properties, which vanish when the pattern is altered, leading to a transition from a topological BO phase to a trivial BO phase through a gap-closing point where both interactions vanish. We identify these phases using a combination of order parameters, topological invariants, edge-state analysis and Thouless charge pumping. By extending our analysis beyond half-filling, we explore the phase diagram across all densities and identify the superfluid (SF) and the pair-superfluid (PSF) phases, characterized by single-particle and bound-pair excitations at incommensurate densities. The proposed model is experimentally realizable in platforms such as Rydberg excited or ultracold atoms in optical lattices, offering a versatile framework to study such interplay between topology and interactions in low-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>Squashed quantum non-Markovianity: a measure of genuine quantum non-Markovianity in states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18323v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum non-Markovianity in tripartite quantum states $\rho_{ABC}$ represents a correlation between systems $A$ and $C$ when conditioned on the system $B$ and is known to have both classical and quantum contributions. However, a systematic characterization of the latter is missing. To address this, we propose a faithful measure for non-Markovianity of genuine quantum origin called squashed quantum non-Markovianity (sQNM). It is based on the quantum conditional mutual information and is defined by the left-over non-Markovianity after squashing out all non-quantum contributions. It is lower bounded by the squashed entanglement between non-conditioning systems in the reduced state and is delimited by the extendibility of either of the non-conditioning systems. We show that the sQNM is monogamous, asymptotically continuous, convex, additive on tensor-product states, and generally super-additive. We characterize genuine quantum non-Markovianity as a resource via a convex resource theory after identifying free states with vanishing sQNM and free operations that do not increase sQNM in states. We use our resource-theoretic framework to bound the rate of state transformations under free operations and to study state transformation under non-free operations; in particular, we find the quantum communication cost from Bob ($B$) to Alice ($A$) or Charlie ($C$) is lower bounded by the change in sQNM in the states. The sQNM finds operational meaning; in particular, the optimal rate of private communication in a variant of conditional one-time pad protocol is twice the sQNM. Also, the minimum deconstruction cost for a variant of quantum deconstruction protocol is given twice the sQNM of the state.</description>

      <title>On Acceleration of Highest-Energy Cosmic Rays in Novel Scenario of Magnetar Transient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19915v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transient phenomena in magnetars have been considered as possible acceleration sites of ultrahigh-energy cosmic-rays (CRs), whose energy reaches $\sim200$~EeV known as Amaterasu CR. However, the process of CR acceleration and the trigger mechanism of magnetar transients remains unclear. A recently suggested scenario for the activity predicts that the magnetar's rotation axis suddenly flips due to the `Dzhanibekov effect,' resulting in a sudden rise of the Euler force. The material in the outer layer plastically flows due to the force and finally fractures in this scenario. We study the possibilities of ion acceleration along with this scenario. If the degenerate electrons burst open from the fractured region like a balloon burst, the pair plasma formation can be ignited inside the crust. We find that such pair plasma can emit photons similar to the observed bursts from magnetars. We also find that the electron stream at the beginning of the burst phenomenon possibly induces a strong electric field for a moment, resulting in the acceleration of $\sim1$~ZeV ion within a timescale of $\sim1$~ps. The nuclear spallation reactions limit this timescale, and therefore, high-energy CR `neutrons' from the parenteral nuclei become proper observational predictions of this scenario: their arrival time and direction will be correlated with the bursting photon emissions of the host magnetars. The nuclear spallation of $\sim$~ZeV nuclei is preferred to explain $\gtrsim10$~PeV neutrino events observed by IceCube and KM3Net.</description>

      <title>Barkhausen noise in the columnar hexagonal organic ferroelectric BTA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12666v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Upon a polarization reversal within a ferroelectric material, one stable state changes into another which is typically described by a progression of switching events of smaller fractions of the material. These events give rise to crackling or Barkhausen noise and follow a characteristic distribution in their sizes. Barkhausen noise has been studied to better understand the switching processes of ferroelectrics and has been applied for inorganic ferroelectric materials and perovskites. In this work, we present results from kinetic Monte Carlo simulations investigating the switching process of the small organic molecular ferroelectric benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxamides (BTAs). For temperatures below 175 K and sufficiently strong structural disorder, the system exhibits self-organized critical behavior; for higher temperatures, a creep regime is entered. Our extracted power-law exponents are smaller than those typically measured in inorganic crystals and ceramics which indicates that in the more disordered material BTA larger spanning avalanches are possible. The system was experimentally investigated with a high-sensitivity setup. No Barkhausen noise was observed which is consistent with the simulated event sizes, lying several orders beneath the noise threshold of the experimental setup. This finding corroborates the notion that switching in BTA progresses along the 1D columns in the hexagonal liquid crystal lattice, with little coupling between the columns that could give rise to larger lateral avalanches.</description>
