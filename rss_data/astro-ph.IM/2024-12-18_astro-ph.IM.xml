      <title>SF2A Environmental Transition Commission: Towards a desirable future for research in astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During its annual conference in 2024, the French Society of Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics (SF2A) hosted a special session dedicated to discussing the environmental transition within the scope of our occupation. Since 2021, thinking on this subject has progressed significantly, both quantitatively and qualitatively. This year was an opportunity to take stock of the main areas of reflection that we need to keep in mind in order to implement a fair, collective and effective environmental transition. This proceeding summarizes the key points from the plenary session related to the environmental transition special session. The purpose of the messages disseminated here is to suggest ideas for reflection and inspiration, so as to initiate, stimulate, and foster discussions within the A&amp;A research community, towards the implementation of concrete measures to mitigate our environmental footprint.</description>

      <title>New Python-based Architecture for the Keck Observatory Archive</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the development of the Keck Observatory Archive (KOA) Data Discovery Service, a web-based dashboard that returns metadata for wide-area queries of the entire archive in seconds. Currently in beta, this dashboard will support exploration, visualization, and data access across multiple instruments. This effort is underpinned by an open-source, VO-compliant query infrastructure and will offer services that can be hosted on web pages or in Jupyter notebooks. The effort also informs the design of a new, modern landing page that meets the expectations of accessibility and ease of use.
  The new query infrastructure is based on nexsciTAP, a component-based, DBMS-agnostic Python implementation of the IVOA Table Access Protocol, developed at NExScI and integrated into the NASA Exoplanet Archive and the NEID Archive, and into the PyKOA Python client. This infrastructure incorporates R-tree spatial indexing, built as memory-mapped files as part of Montage, a software toolkit used to create composite astronomical images. Although R-trees are used most often in geospatial analysis, here they enable searches of the entire KOA archive, an eclectic collection of 100 million records of imaging and spectroscopic data, in 2 seconds, and they speed up spatial searches by x20. The front end is built on the open-source Plotly-Dash framework, which allows users to build an interactive user interface based on a single Python file.</description>

      <title>Virtual Realities: Is there only one advanced image display that astronomers need?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data visualisation is an essential ingredient of scientific analysis, discovery, and communication. Along with a human (to do the looking) and the data (something to look at), an image display device is a key component of any data visualisation workflow. For the purpose of this work, standard displays include combinations of laptop displays, peripheral monitors, tablet and smartphone screens, while the main categories of advanced displays are stereoscopic displays, tiled display walls, digital domes, virtual/mixed reality (VR/MR) head-mounted displays, and CAVE/CAVE2-style immersive rooms. We present the results of the second Advanced Image Displays for Astronomy (AIDA) survey, advertised to the membership of the Astronomical Society of Australia (ASA) during June-August 2021. The goal of this survey was to gather background information on the level of awareness and usage of advanced displays in astronomy and astrophysics research. From 17 complete survey responses, sampled from a population of ~750 ASA members, we infer that: (1) a high proportion of ASA members use standard displays but do not use advanced displays; (2) a moderate proportion have seen a VR/MR HMD, and may also have used one -- but not for research activities; and (3) there is a need for improved knowledge in general about advanced displays, along with relevant software or applications that can target specific science needs. We expect that this is compatible with the experiences of much of the international astronomy and astrophysics research community. We suggest that VR/MR head-mounted displays have now reached a level of technical maturity such that they could be used to replicate or replace the functionality of most other advanced displays.</description>

      <title>A Simplified Analytical Approach for Determining Eclipses of Satellites Occulted by a Celestial Body</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The primary objective of this paper is to construct an analytical model for determining the total duration of eclipse events of satellites. The approach assumes that the trace formed in the orbital plane, cutting body shadow under the classical conical shadow model, can be described as an ellipse. This allows for the derivation of its parameters through the use of classical orbital elements and solar position in the body-centric frame. Consequently, the problem of identifying satellite occultation events is simplified to searching for points of intersection between two ellipses: the satellite orbit and the shadow. The developed model has been demonstrated to be applicable for a wide range of inclinations, with the exception of cases where the orbital plane of the satellite motion coincides with that of the sun in the body-centric frame. It is shown that the shadow function constructed under the aforementioned assumptions can be simplified in the cylindrical shadow model. Several simplifications to the proposed model are presented in the study. The paper also considers extending the model to account for non-spherical shapes of celestial bodies, i.e., bodies with oblateness, and presents an algorithm that accounts for changes in eclipse duration due to the heliocentric motion of these celestial bodies. The model has been validated through numerous tests with a numerical algorithm and satellite real data, as well as with other analytical models.</description>

      <title>3D Free-Form Optical Lens -- Miniaturised Fibre Couplers for Astrophotonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In astronomy, multi-object spectrographs employ fibre positioning robots to couple the light from multiple astronomy sources (stars or galaxies) into multiple multi-mode fibres, which are distributed across the focal plane of the telescope. These fibres transport the celestial light to the entrance slit of a spectrograph (or bank of spectrographs) for analysis. For any multi-object system mm-scale opto-mechanical solutions are required to couple the telescope light efficiently into the fibre. We demonstrate a unique micro-optics solution to replace current optical fibre couplers. Specifically, we target technology on board the Keck telescope's FOBOS - Fibre-Optic Broadband Optical Spectrograph - which operates at UV to IR spectral ranges. For spectrally broad UV-IR band operation we use glass and crystals: fused silica, crystalline quartz (transparency 0.16 - 2 micrometers), sapphire Al2O3 (0.2 - 5 micrometers), CaF2 (0.2-7 micrometers), and BaF2 (0.2-10 micrometers). The miniaturised micro-coupler is monolithic, with the entire light path contained within glass or crystal, seamlessly extending to the fibre entrance, which is laser-machined and precisely aligned with the optical axis.</description>

      <title>ChronoFlow: A Data-Driven Model for Gyrochronology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gyrochronology is a technique for constraining stellar ages using rotation periods, which change over a star's main sequence lifetime due to magnetic braking. This technique shows promise for main sequence FGKM stars, where other methods are imprecise. However, models have historically struggled to capture the observed rotational dispersion in stellar populations. To properly understand this complexity, we have assembled the largest standardized data catalog of rotators in open clusters to date, consisting of ~7,400 stars across 30 open clusters/associations spanning ages of 1.5 Myr to 4 Gyr. We have also developed ChronoFlow: a flexible data-driven model which accurately captures observed rotational dispersion. We show that ChronoFlow can be used to accurately forward model rotational evolution, and to infer both cluster and individual stellar ages. We recover cluster ages with a statistical uncertainty of 0.06 dex ($\approx$ 15%), and individual stellar ages with a statistical uncertainty of 0.7 dex. Additionally, we conducted robust systematic tests to analyze the impact of extinction models, cluster membership, and calibration ages on our model's performance. These contribute an additional $\approx$ 0.06 dex of uncertainty in cluster age estimates, resulting in a total error budget of 0.08 dex. We estimate ages for the NGC 6709 open cluster and the Theia 456 stellar stream, and calculate revised rotational ages for M34, NGC 2516, NGC 1750, and NGC 1647. Our results show that ChronoFlow can precisely estimate the ages of coeval stellar populations, and constrain ages for individual stars. Furthermore, its predictions may be used to inform physical spin down models. ChronoFlow will be publicly available at https://github.com/philvanlane/chronoflow.</description>

      <title>CARMENES input catalogue of M dwarfs IX. Multiplicity from close spectroscopic binaries to ultra-wide systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiplicity studies greatly benefit from focusing on M dwarfs because they are often paired in a variety of configurations with both stellar and substellar objects, including exoplanets. We aim to address the observed multiplicity of M dwarfs by conducting a systematic analysis using the latest available astrophotometric data. For every star in a sample of 2214 M dwarfs from the CARMENES catalogue, we investigated the existence of resolved and unresolved physical companions in the literature and in all-sky surveys, especially in Gaia DR3 data products. We covered a very wide range of separations, from known spectroscopic binaries in tight arrangements $\sim$0.01 au to remarkably separated ultra-wide pairs ($\sim$10$^5$ au). We identified 835 M dwarfs in 720 multiple systems, predominantly binaries. Thus, we propose 327 new binary candidates based on Gaia data. If these candidates are finally confirmed, we expect the multiplicity fraction of M dwarfs to be 40.3$^{+2.1}_{-2.0}$ %. When only considering the systems already identified, the multiplicity fraction is reduced to 27.8$^{+1.9}_{-1.8}$ %. This result is in line with most of the values published in the literature. We also identified M-dwarf multiple systems with FGK, white dwarf, ultra-cool dwarf, and exoplanet companions, as well as those in young stellar kinematic groups. We studied their physical separations, orbital periods, binding energies, and mass ratios. We argue that based on reliable astrometric data and spectroscopic investigations from the literature (even when considering detection biases), the multiplicity fraction of M dwarfs could still be significantly underestimated. This calls for further high-resolution follow-up studies to validate these findings.</description>

      <title>Laboratory modeling of MHD accretion disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This review article summarizes two decades of laboratory research aimed at understanding the dynamics of accretion disks, with particular emphasis on magnetohydrodynamic experiments involving liquid metals and plasmas. First, the Taylor-Couette experiments demonstrated the generation of magnetorotational instability (MRI) in liquid metals, and highlighted how this instability is critically influenced by boundary conditions and the geometry of the applied magnetic field. These experiments also highlight the nonlinear transition to turbulence in accretion disks, and their link with other MHD instabilities in centrifugally-stable flows. A complementary approach, involving laboratory experiments with volumetric fluid driving rather than rotating boundaries, enables a quantitative study of angular momentum transport by Keplerian turbulence. Collectively, these various laboratory studies offer new constraints on the theoretical models designed to explain the dynamics of accretion disks. This is particularly true with regard to the role of Keplerian turbulence in protoplanetary disks, where recent observations from the ALMA telescope have considerably revised previously expected values of the magnitude of the turbulent fluctuations. Finally, the paper discusses outstanding questions and future prospects in laboratory modeling of accretion disks.</description>

      <title>Minute-cadence observations on Galactic plane with Wide Field Survey Telescope (WFST): Overview, methodology and early results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the time-domain survey telescope of the highest survey power in the northern hemisphere currently, Wide Field Survey Telescope (WFST) is scheduled to hourly/daily/semi-weekly scan northern sky up to ~23 mag in four optical (ugri) bands. Unlike the observation cadences in the forthcoming regular survey missions, WFST performed "staring" observations toward Galactic plane in a cadence of $\approx$1 minute for a total on-source time of about 13 hours, during the commissioning and pilot observation phases. Such an observation cadence is well applied in producing densely sampling light curves and hunting for stars exhibiting fast stellar variabilities. Here we introduce the primary methodologies in detecting variability, periodicity, and stellar flares among a half million sources from the minute-cadence observations, and present the WFST g-/r-band light curves generated from periodic variable stars and flaring stars. Benefit from high photometric precisions and deep detection limits of WFST, the observations have captured several rare variable stars, such as a variable hot white dwarf (WD) and an ellipsoidal WD binary candidate. By surveying the almost unexplored parameter spaces for variables, WFST will lead to new opportunities in discovering unique variable stars in the northern sky.</description>

      <title>Accelerating lensed quasars discovery and modeling with physics-informed variational autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strongly lensed quasars provide valuable insights into the rate of cosmic expansion, the distribution of dark matter in foreground deflectors, and the characteristics of quasar hosts. However, detecting them in astronomical images is difficult due to the prevalence of non-lensing objects. To address this challenge, we developed a generative deep learning model called VariLens, built upon a physics-informed variational autoencoder. This model seamlessly integrates three essential modules: image reconstruction, object classification, and lens modeling, offering a fast and comprehensive approach to strong lens analysis. VariLens is capable of rapidly determining both (1) the probability that an object is a lens system and (2) key parameters of a singular isothermal ellipsoid (SIE) mass model -- including the Einstein radius ($\theta_\mathrm{E}$), lens center, and ellipticity -- in just milliseconds using a single CPU. A direct comparison of VariLens estimates with traditional lens modeling for 20 known lensed quasars within the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) footprint shows good agreement, with both results consistent within $2\sigma$ for systems with $\theta_\mathrm{E}&lt;3$ arcsecs. To identify new lensed quasar candidates, we begin with an initial sample of approximately 80 million sources, combining HSC data with multiwavelength information from various surveys. After applying a photometric preselection aimed at locating $z&gt;1.5$ sources, the number of candidates is reduced to 710,966. Subsequently, VariLens highlights 13,831 sources, each showing a high likelihood of being a lens. A visual assessment of these objects results in 42 promising candidates that await spectroscopic confirmation. These results underscore the potential of automated deep learning pipelines to efficiently detect and model strong lenses in large datasets.</description>

      <title>How much earlier would LSST have discovered currently known long-period comets?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Among solar system objects, comets coming from the Oort Cloud are an elusive population, intrinsically rare and difficult to detect. Nonetheless, as the more pristine objects we can observe, they encapsulate critical cues on the formation of planetary systems and are the focus of many scientific investigations and science missions. The Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), which will start to operate from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory in 2025, is expected to dramatically improve our detection ability of these comets by performing regular monitoring of the Southern sky deep down to magnitude 24.5 with excellent astrometry. However, making straightforward predictions on future LSST detection rates is challenging due to our biased knowledge of the underlying population. This is because identifications to date have been conducted by various surveys or individual observers, often without detailed information on their respective selection functions. Recent efforts to predict incoming flux of Long Period Comets still suffer of the lack of systematic, well-characterized, homogeneous cometary surveys. Here, we adopt a different point of view by asking how much earlier~on known comets on long-period or hyperbolic orbits would have been discovered by a LSST-like survey if it was already in place 10 years prior to their perihelion epoch. In this case, we are not simulating a real flux of incoming comet, as all comets in our sample reach the perihelion simultaneously, but we can analyze the impact of a LSST-like survey on individual objects. We find that LSST would have found about 40% of comets in our sample at least 5 years prior to their perihelion epoch, and at double (at least) the distance at which they were actually discovered. Based on this approach, we find that LSST has the potentiality to at least twofold the current discovery rate of long-period and hyperbolic comets.</description>

      <title>CMB Polarisation Signal Demodulation with a Rotating Half-Wave Plate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.01860v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Several forthcoming Cosmic Microwave Background polarisation experiments will employ a Continuously Rotating Half-Wave Plate (CRHWP), the primary purpose of which is to mitigate instrumental systematic effects. The use of a CRHWP necessitates demodulating the time-ordered data during the early stages of data processing. The standard approach is to ``lock in'' on the polarisation signal using the known polarisation modulation frequency and use Fourier techniques to filter out the remaining unwanted components. However, an alternative, less well-studied option is to incorporate the demodulation directly into the map-making step. Using simulations, we compare the performance of these two approaches to determine which is most effective for $B$-mode signal recovery. Testing the two techniques in multiple experimental scenarios, we find that the lock-in technique performs best over the full multipole range explored. However, for the recovery of the largest angular scales (multipoles, $\ell &lt; 100$) we find essentially no difference in the recovery of the signal between the lock-in and map-making approaches, suggesting that a parallel analysis based on the latter approach could represent a powerful consistency check for primordial $B$-mode experiments employing a CRHWP. We also investigate the impact of a detector-differencing step, implemented prior to demodulation, finding that, in most scenarios, it makes no difference whether differencing is used or not. However, analysing detectors individually allows the point at which information from multiple detectors is combined to be moved to later stages in the analysis pipeline. This presents alternative options for dealing with additional instrumental systematic effects that are not mitigated by the CRHWP.</description>

      <title>Four years of wide-field search for nanosecond optical transients with the TAIGA-HiSCORE Cherenkov array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00159v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been previously demonstrated [Panov et al. Physics of Atomic Nuclei 84(2021)1037] that the TAIGA-HiSCORE Cherenkov array, originally built for cosmic ray physics and ultrahigh-energy gamma-ray astronomy studies using the extensive air shower method, can be used in conventional optical astronomy for wide-field searches for rare nanosecond optical transients of astrophysical origin. The FOV of the facility is on the scale of 1~ster, and it is capable of detecting very rare transients in the visible light range with fluxes greater than approximately 3000~quanta/m$^2$/10~ns (10~ns is the apparatus integration time) and pulse durations of 10\,ns. Among the potential sources of distant nanosecond optical transients are the evaporation of primary black holes, magnetic reconnection in the accretion disks of black holes, and signals from distant lasers of extraterrestrial civilizations. The paper describes the methods and results of the search for optical transients using the TAIGA-HiSCORE Cherenkov array from 2018 to 2022 (four winter seasons of data collection). No reliable astrophysical candidates for optical transients were found. We set an upper bound on the flux of the searched events as $\sim 1\times10^{-3}$\,events/ster/h.</description>

      <title>Africanus II. QuartiCal: calibrating radio interferometer data at scale using Numba and Dask</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10072v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Calibration of radio interferometer data ought to be a solved problem; it has been an integral part of data reduction for some time. However, as larger, more sensitive radio interferometers are conceived and built, the calibration problem grows in both size and difficulty.
  The increasing size can be attributed to the fact that the data volume scales quadratically with the number of antennas in an array. Additionally, new instruments may have up to two orders of magnitude more channels than their predecessors. Simultaneously, increasing sensitivity is making calibration more challenging: low-level RFI and calibration artefacts (in the resulting images) which would previously have been subsumed by the noise may now limit dynamic range and, ultimately, the derived science.
  It is against this backdrop that we introduce QuartiCal: a new Python package implementing radio interferometric calibration routines. QuartiCal improves upon its predecessor, CubiCal, in terms of both flexibility and performance. Whilst the same mathematical framework - complex optimization using Wirtinger derivatives - is in use, the approach has been refined to support arbitrary length chains of parameterized gain terms.
  QuartiCal utilizes Dask, a library for parallel computing in Python, to express calibration as an embarrassingly parallel task graph. These task graphs can (with some constraints) be mapped onto a number of different hardware configurations, allowing QuartiCal to scale from running locally on consumer hardware to a distributed, cloud-based cluster.
  QuartiCal's qualitative behaviour is demonstrated using MeerKAT observations of PSR J2009-2026. These qualitative results are followed by an analysis of QuartiCal's performance in terms of wall time and memory footprint for a number of calibration scenarios and hardware configurations.</description>

      <title>Africanus III. pfb-imaging -- a flexible radio interferometric imaging suite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10073v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The popularity of the CLEAN algorithm in radio interferometric imaging stems from its maturity, speed, and robustness. While many alternatives have been proposed in the literature, none have achieved mainstream adoption by astronomers working with data from interferometric arrays operating in the big data regime. This lack of adoption is largely due to increased computational complexity, absence of mature implementations, and the need for astronomers to tune obscure algorithmic parameters.
  This work introduces pfb-imaging: a flexible library that implements the scaffolding required to develop and accelerate general radio interferometric imaging algorithms. We demonstrate how the framework can be used to implement a sparsity-based image reconstruction technique known as (unconstrained) SARA in a way that scales with image size rather than data volume and features interpretable algorithmic parameters. The implementation is validated on terabyte-sized data from the MeerKAT telescope, using both a single compute node and Amazon Web Services computing instances.</description>

      <title>Africanus IV. The Stimela2 framework: scalable and reproducible workflows, from local to cloud compute</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10080v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stimela2 is a new-generation framework for developing data reduction workflows. It is designed for radio astronomy data but can be adapted for other data processing applications. Stimela2 aims at the middle ground between ease of development, human readability, and enabling robust, scalable and reproducible workflows. It represents workflows by linear, concise and intuitive YAML-format "recipes". Atomic data reduction tasks (binary executables, Python functions and code, and CASA tasks) are described by YAML-format "cab definitions" detailing each task's "schema" (inputs and outputs). Stimela2 provides a rich syntax for chaining tasks together, and encourages a high degree of modularity: recipes may be nested into other recipes, and configuration is cleanly separated from recipe logic. Tasks can be executed natively or in isolated environments using containerization technologies such as Apptainer. The container images are open-source and maintained through a companion package called cult-cargo. This enables the development of system-agnostic and fully reproducible workflows. Stimela2 facilitates the deployment of scalable, distributed workflows by interfacing with the Slurm scheduler and the Kubernetes API. The latter allows workflows to be readily deployed in the cloud. Previous papers in this series used Stimela2 as the underlying technology to run workflows on the AWS cloud.
  This paper presents an overview of Stimela2's design, architecture and use in the radio astronomy context.</description>

      <title>Africanus I. Scalable, distributed and efficient radio data processing with Dask-MS and Codex Africanus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12052v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: New radio interferometers such as MeerKAT, SKA, ngVLA, and DSA-2000 drive advancements in software for two key reasons. First, handling the vast data from these instruments requires subdivision and multi-node processing. Second, their improved sensitivity, achieved through better engineering and larger data volumes, demands new techniques to fully exploit it. This creates a critical challenge in radio astronomy software: pipelines must be optimized to process data efficiently, but unforeseen artefacts from increased sensitivity require ongoing development of new techniques. This leads to a trade-off among (1) performance, (2) flexibility, and (3) ease-of-development. Rigid designs often miss the full scope of the problem, while temporary research code is unsuitable for production. This work introduces a framework for developing radio astronomy techniques while balancing the above trade-offs. It prioritizes flexibility and ease-of-development alongside acceptable performance by leveraging Open Source data formats and software. To manage growing data volumes, data is distributed across multiple processors and nodes for parallel processing, utilizing HPC and cloud infrastructure. We present two Python libraries, Dask-MS and Codex Africanus, which enable distributed, high-performance radio astronomy software with Dask. Dask is a lightweight parallelization and distribution framework that integrates with the PyData ecosystem, addressing the "Big Data" challenges of radio astronomy.</description>

      <title>Toward a computationally-efficient follow-up pipeline for blind continuous gravitational-wave searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18934v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The sensitivity of continuous gravitational-wave (CW) searches for unknown neutron stars (NSs) is limited by their parameter space breadth. To fit within reasonable computing budgets, hierarchical schemes are used to identify interesting candidates using affordable methods. The resulting sensitivity depends on the number of candidates selected to follow-up. In this work, we present a novel framework to evaluate the effectiveness of stochastic CW follow-ups. Our results allow for a significant reduction of the computing cost of pyfstat, a well-established follow-up method. We also simplify the setup of multistage follow-ups by removing the need for parameter-space metrics. The study was conducted on Gaussian and real O3 Advanced LIGO data covering both isolated and binary sources. These results will have a positive impact on the sensitivity of all-sky searches in the forthcoming observing runs of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration.</description>

      <title>COMAP Pathfinder -- Season 2 results II. Updated constraints on the CO(1-0) power spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07511v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present updated constraints on the cosmological 3D power spectrum of carbon monoxide CO(1-0) emission in the redshift range $2.4$-$3.4$. The constraints are derived from the two first seasons of Carbon monOxide Mapping Array Project (COMAP) Pathfinder line-intensity mapping observations aiming to trace star-formation during the Epoch of Galaxy Assembly. These results improve on the previous Early Science (ES) results through both increased data volume and improved data processing methodology. On the methodological side, we now perform cross-correlations between groups of detectors (''feed-groups''), as opposed to cross-correlations between single feeds, and this new feed-group pseudo power spectrum (FGPXS) is constructed to be more robust against systematic effects. In terms of data volume, the effective mapping speed is significantly increased due to an improved observational strategy as well as better data selection methodology. The updated spherically- and field-averaged FGPXS, $\tilde{C}(k)$, is consistent with zero, at a probability-to-exceed of around $34\,\%$, with an excess of $2.7\,\sigma$ in the most sensitive bin. Our power spectrum estimate is about an order of magnitude more sensitive in our six deepest bins across ${0.09\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1} &lt; k &lt; 0.73\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}}$, as compared to the feed-feed pseudo power spectrum (FPXS) of COMAP ES. Each of these bins individually constrains the CO power spectrum to ${kP_\mathrm{CO}(k)&lt; 2400-4900\,\mathrm{\mu K^2 Mpc^{2}}}$ at $95\,\%$ confidence. To monitor potential contamination from residual systematic effects, we analyze a set of 312 difference-map null tests and find that these are consistent with the instrumental noise prediction. In sum, these results provide the strongest direct constraints on the cosmological 3D CO(1-0) power spectrum published to date.</description>

      <title>Neutrino flux sensitivity to the next galactic core-collapse supernova in COSINUS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09109v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While neutrinos are often treated as a background for many dark matter experiments, these particles offer a new avenue for physics: the detection of core-collapse supernovae. Supernovae are extremely energetic, violent and complex events that mark the death of massive stars. During their collapse stars emit a large number of neutrinos in a short burst. These neutrinos carry 99\% of the emitted energy which makes their detection fundamental in understanding supernovae. This paper illustrates how COSINUS (Cryogenic Observatory for SIgnatures seen in Next-generation Underground Searches), a sodium iodide (NaI) based dark matter search, will be sensitive to the next galactic core-collapse supernova. The experiment is composed of two separate detectors which will be sensitive to far and nearby supernovae. The inner core of the experiment will consist of NaI crystals operating as scintillating calorimeters, mainly sensitive to the Coherent Elastic Scattering of Neutrinos (CE$\nu$NS) against the Na and I nuclei. The low mass of the cryogenic detectors gives the experiment a sensitivity to close supernovae below 1kpc without pileup. They will see up to hundreds of CE$\nu$NS events from a supernova happening at 200pc. The crystals reside at the center of a cylindrical 230T water tank, instrumented with 30 photomultipliers. This tank acts as a passive and active shield able to detect the Cherenkov radiation induced by impinging charged particles from ambient and cosmogenic radioactivity. A supernova near the Milky Way Center (10kpc) will be easily detected inducing $\sim$60 measurable events, and the water tank will have a 3$\sigma$ sensitivity to supernovae up to 22kpc, seeing $\sim$10 events. This paper shows how, even without dedicated optimization, modern dark matter experiments will also play their part in the multi-messenger effort to detect the next galactic core-collapse supernova.</description>

      <title>Power of simultaneous X-ray and UV high-resolution spectroscopy for probing AGN outflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03493v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Black hole accretion in active galactic nuclei (AGN) is coupled to the evolution of their host galaxies. Outflowing winds in AGN can play an important role in this evolution through the resulting feedback mechanism. Multi-wavelength spectroscopy is key for probing the intertwined physics of inflows and outflows in AGN. However, with the current spectrometers, crucial properties of the ionized outflows are poorly understood, such as their coupling to the accretion rate, their launching mechanism, and their kinetic power. In this paper we discuss the need for simultaneous X-ray and UV high-resolution spectroscopy for tackling outstanding questions on these outflows in AGN. The instrumental requirements for achieving the scientific objectives are addressed. We demonstrate that these requirements would be facilitated by the proposed Arcus Probe mission concept. The multi-wavelength spectroscopy and timing by Arcus would enable us to establish the kinematics and ionization structure of the entire ionized outflow, extending from the vicinity of the accretion disk to the outskirts of the host galaxy. Arcus would provide key diagnostics on the origin, driving mechanism, and the energetics of the outflows, which are useful benchmarks for testing various theoretical models of outflows and understanding their impact in AGN.</description>

      <title>An instrument to link global positioning to the Universe -- Observing GNSS satellites with the Australian VLBI array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07020v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new instrument enabling a novel combination of Earth measuring techniques: direct observations with the radio astronomical instruments to satellites of the global navigation satellite systems. Inter-technique biases are a major error source in the terrestrial reference frame. Combining two major space-geodetic techniques, GNSS and VLBI, through observations to identical sensors has been considered infeasible due to their seemingly incompatible operating frequencies. The newly accessible L-band capability of the Australian VGOS telescopes is shown here, invalidating this prevailing opinion. A series of test observations demonstrates geodetic VLBI observations to GPS satellites for a continental-wide IVS telescope array, with the potential for observations at a critical scale. We anticipate immediate impact for the geodetic community, through first-ever inter-technique ties between VLBI and GNSS in the Australian region and via the opportunity for critical test observations towards the Genesis mission, geodesy's flagship project in the area of space ties set for launch in 2028.</description>
