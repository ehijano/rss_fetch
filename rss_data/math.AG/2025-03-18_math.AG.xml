      <title>Hochschild cohomology and extensions of triangulated categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define a notion of categorical first order deformations for (enhanced) triangulated categories. For a category $\mathcal{T}$, we show that there is a bijection between $\operatorname{HH}^2(\mathcal{T})$ and the set of categorical deformations of $\mathcal{T}$. We show that in the case of curved deformations of dg algebras considered in arXiv:2406.04945, the $1$-derived category of the deformation (introduced in arXiv:24020.8660) is a categorical deformation of the derived category of the base; the Hochschild class identified by this deformation is shown to restrict to the class defining the deformation of the algebra. As an application, we give a conceptual proof of the fact that (for a smooth base) the filtered derived category of a dg deformation yields a categorical resolution of the classical derived category.</description>

      <title>Complete flags on flat vector bundles in positive characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a connected, smooth, and projective curve of genus $g$ over an algebraically closed field of characteristic $p &gt;0$. This paper investigates a characteristic-$p$ analogue of a well-known fact concerning flat vector bundles in characteristic $0$. That is to say, we prove that the inequality $g \leq 1$ holds if and only if any flat vector bundle on $X$ admits a complete flag. We also explore a generalization of this result in a broader setting.</description>

      <title>Harmonic covers of skeleta</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The geometry of a toroidal scheme over a DVR is encoded in a $\mathbb{Z}$-PL space known as the dual polyhedral complex. Any such dual complex is a skeleton, i.e. a nonarchimedean analytic retract, and admits a combinatorial divisor theory via specialisation. These structures on the dual complex interact via a Poincar\'e-Lelong slope formula, which interprets specialisations of divisors as Laplacians of PL functions. The main result presented here shows that finite covers of toroidal schemes give harmonic morphisms of dual complexes, i.e. morphisms that preserve the tropical Laplace equation. A crucial ingredient is a balancing condition which is a variant of the tropical multiplicity formula for dual complexes. We apply these results to obtain a Riemann-Hurwitz formula for covers of skeleta in any dimension: the Laplacian of the different function is the tropical relative canonical divisor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We state a conjecture relating de Rham cohomology of a smooth rigid analytic variety to its compactly supported pro-\'etale cohomology. We prove the conjecture in the cases where the variety is a Stein curve of dimension one or a Stein space of higher dimension with low Frobenius slopes. The proof uses computation of the Galois cohomology of the almost de Rham period ring BdR[log(t)].</description>

      <title>Invariants of nested Hilbert and Quot schemes on surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(S,p)$ be a smooth pointed surface. In the first part of this paper we study motivic invariants of punctual nested Hilbert schemes attached to $(S,p)$ using the Hilbert-Samuel stratification. We compute two infinite families of motivic classes of punctual nested Hilbert schemes, corresponding to nestings of the form $(2,n)$ and $(3,n)$. As a consequence, we are able to give a lower bound for the number of irreducible components of $S_p^{[2,n]}$ and $S_p^{[3,n]}$.
  In the second part of this paper we characterise completely the generating series of Euler characteristics of all nested Hilbert and Quot schemes. This is achieved via a novel technique, involving differential operators modelled on the enumerative problem, which we introduce. From this analysis, we deduce that in the Hilbert scheme case the generating series is the product of a rational function by the celebrated Euler's product formula counting integer partitions. In higher rank, we derive functional equations relating the nested Quot scheme generating series to the rank one series, corresponding to nested Hilbert schemes.</description>

      <title>Weight filtration and generating level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the canonical mixed Hodge module structure associated to the $\mathscr{D}_X$-module $\mathscr{M}(f^{-\alpha}):=\mathscr{O}_X(*f)f^{-\alpha}$. We particularly focus on the weight filtration and extend many known results to the weighted setting. We obtain new relations between Hodge theory and birational geometry. We derive a general formula for the Hodge and weight filtrations on $\mathscr{M}(f^{-\alpha})$, and use this to obtain results concerning the largest weight of $\mathscr{M}(f^{-\alpha})$ and the generating level of weight filtration steps. Finally, we obtain expressions for several classes of divisor, including certain parametrically prime divisors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The manuscript at hand systematically studies K\"unneth formulas at a categorical level. We give criteria for an abstract six functor formalism to satisfy the categorical K\"unneth formula, and use this to formulate conjectures for categories of \'etale motives. As supporting evidence for these conjectures, we prove categorical K\"unneth formulas for adic sheaves and for cohomological motives, i.e., \'etale motives modulo the kernel of the adic realization.</description>

      <title>Quadratic Donaldson-Thomas invariants for $(\mathbb{P}^1)^3$ and some other smooth proper toric threefolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using virtual localization in Witt sheaf cohomology, we show that the generating series of quadratic Donaldson-Thomas invariants of $(\mathbb{P}^1)^3$, valued in the Witt ring of $\mathbb{R}$, $W(\mathbb{R})\cong \mathbb{Z}$, is equal to $M(q^2)^{-8}$, where $M(q)$ is the MacMahon function. This confirms a modified version of a conjecture of Viergever. We also show that a localized version of this conjecture holds for certain iterated blow-ups of $(\mathbb{P}^1)^3$ and other related smooth proper toric varieties.</description>

      <title>Codimension one foliations on adjoint varieties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we classify codimension one foliations on adjoint varieties with most positive anti-canonical class. We show that on adjoint varieties with Picard number one, these foliations are always induced by a pencil of hyperplane sections with respect to their minimal embedding. For adjoint varieties of Picard number two, there is more than one component of such foliations, and we describe each of them. As a tool for understanding these foliations, we introduce the concept of the degree of a foliation with respect to a family of rational curves, which may be of independent interest.</description>

Abstract: We introduce an analogue to Quasi-$F$-splittings, Quasi-$F$-purity, which is definable over rings that are not necessarily $F$-finite. We show that this property is equivalent to being Quasi-$F$-split in the complete local and $F$-finite case. We then exhibit that it is stable under completion, direct limit, and local/finite \'etale extension.</description>

      <title>Recursive Self-Similarity in Deep Weight Spaces of Neural Architectures: A Fractal and Coarse Geometry Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper conceptualizes the Deep Weight Spaces (DWS) of neural architectures as hierarchical, fractal-like, coarse geometric structures observable at discrete integer scales through recursive dilation. We introduce a coarse group action termed the fractal transformation, $T_{r_k} $, acting under the symmetry group $G = (\mathbb{Z}, +) $, to analyze neural parameter matrices or tensors, by segmenting the underlying discrete grid $\Omega$ into $N(r_k)$ fractals across varying observation scales $ r_k $. This perspective adopts a box count technique, commonly used to assess the hierarchical and scale-related geometry of physical structures, which has been extensively formalized under the topic of fractal geometry. We assess the structural complexity of neural layers by estimating the Hausdorff-Besicovitch dimension of their layers and evaluating a degree of self-similarity. The fractal transformation features key algebraic properties such as linearity, identity, and asymptotic invertibility, which is a signature of coarse structures. We show that the coarse group action exhibits a set of symmetries such as Discrete Scale Invariance (DSI) under recursive dilation, strong invariance followed by weak equivariance to permutations, alongside respecting the scaling equivariance of activation functions, defined by the intertwiner group relations. Our framework targets large-scale structural properties of DWS, deliberately overlooking minor inconsistencies to focus on significant geometric characteristics of neural networks. Experiments on CIFAR-10 using ResNet-18, VGG-16, and a custom CNN validate our approach, demonstrating effective fractal segmentation and structural analysis.</description>

      <title>Hasse norm principle for metacyclic extensions with trivial Schur multiplier</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $k$ be a global field, $K/k$ be a finite separable field extension and $L/k$ be the Galois closure of $K/k$ with Galois groups $G={\rm Gal}(L/k)$ and $H={\rm Gal}(L/K)\lneq G$. In 1931, Hasse proved that if $G$ is cyclic, then the Hasse norm principle holds for $K/k$. We show that if $G$ is metacyclic with trivial Schur multiplier $M(G)=0$, then the Hasse norm principle holds for $K/k$. Some examples of metacyclic, dihedral, quasidihedral, modular, generalized quoternion, extraspecial groups and $Z$-groups $G$ with trivial Schur multiplier $M(G)=0$ are given. As a consequence, we get the Tamagawa number $\tau(T)=|G^{ab}|/|H^{ab}|$ of the norm one tori $T=R^{(1)}_{k/k}(G_m)$ of $K/k$ via Ono's formula $\tau(T)=|H^1(k,\widehat{T})|/|Sha(T)|$ where $G^{ab}$ and $H^{ab}$ are the abelianizations of $G$ and $H$ respectively, $\widehat{T}={\rm Hom}(T,G_m)$ is the character module of $T$ and $Sha(T)$ is the Shafarevich-Tate group of $T$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $A$ and $B$ be non-constant rational functions over $\mathbb{C}$, and let $K \subset \mathbb{P}^1(\mathbb{C})$ be an infinite set. Using height functions, we prove that the inclusion $ A^{-1}(K) \subseteq B^{-1}(K) $ implies the inequality $ {\rm deg} B \geq {\rm deg} A $ in the following two cases: the set $K$ is contained in $\mathbb{P}^1(k)$, where $ k$ is a finitely generated subfield of $\mathbb{C}$, or the set $K$ is discrete in $\mathbb{C}$, and $A$ and $B$ are polynomials. In particular, this implies that for $A$, $B$, and $K$ as above, the equality $ A^{-1}(K) = B^{-1}(K) $ is impossible, unless $ {\rm deg} B = {\rm deg} A $.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Derived geometry provides powerful tools to handle non-transverse intersections and singular moduli problems arising in geometry and theoretical physics. While derived algebraic geometry has been extensively developed, classical field theories -- formulated as variational problems involving sections of smooth fiber bundles over manifolds -- naturally require the language of differential geometry, infinite-dimensional analysis (e.g., Fr\'echet manifolds), and additional geometric structures on spacetime, such as smooth metrics. Moreover, field theories incorporating fermionic matter fields necessitate extending the framework to include supermanifolds. This article is the first in a sequence aimed at rigorously modeling the derived space of solutions to the field equations of Lagrangian gauge theories as derived $\Ci$-stacks.
  While this article does not explicitly discuss physics or field theory, it develops foundational aspects of derived differential geometry which are useful in their own right and contribute to the further development of the field. Moreover, these results provide essential groundwork for subsequent papers rigorously constructing derived spaces of solutions to Euler-Lagrange equations. We establish foundational results extending existing work on derived manifolds into supergeometric and infinite-dimensional contexts, and explicitly relate these constructions to differential operators and PDE theory. This paper an excerpt from a larger manuscript currently in preparation and is made available now to disseminate key foundational developments.</description>

      <title>Smooth profinite groups, I: geometrizing Kummer theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2009.11130v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this series of three papers, we introduce and study cyclotomic pairs and smooth profinite groups. They are a geometric axiomatisation of Kummer theory for fields, with coefficients $p$-primary roots of unity, for a prime $p$. These coefficients are enhanced, to $G$-linearized line bundles in Witt vectors, over $G$-schemes of characteristic $p$. In the second paper, this upgrade is pushed even further, to the scheme-theoretic setting.
  In this first article, we introduce cyclotomic pairs, smooth profinite groups and $(G,S)$-cohomology. We prove a first lifting theorem for $G$-linearized torsors under line bundles (Theorem A). With the help of the algebro-geometric tools developed in the second article, this formalism is applied in the third one, to prove the Smoothness Theorem, whose essence reads as follows. Let $G$ be profinite group. Assume that, for every open subgroup $H \subset G$, and for $n=1$, the natural arrow $H^n(H,\mathbb{Z}/p^2) \to H^n(H,\mathbb{Z}/p)$ is surjective. Then, it is also surjective for every such $H$, and every $n \geq 2$. Applied to absolute Galois groups, the Smoothness Theorem provides a new proof of the Norm Residue Isomorphism Theorem, entirely disjoint from motivic cohomology.</description>

      <title>Smooth profinite groups, II: the Uplifting Pattern</title>

      <description>arXiv:2009.11140v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This text presents a scheme-theoretic enhancement of the theory of smooth profinite groups and cyclotomic pairs, introduced in the paper `Smooth profinite groups, I'. To do so, our main technical tools are Hochschild cohomology of affine group schemes and lifting frobenius of vector bundles. The main contribution of this work is the Uplifting Pattern. It is a natural process, to lift a given equivariant extension of vector bundles, to its $\mathbf W_2$-counterpart, upon a `reasonable' combination of base-change and group-change. This is the key ingredient to prove the Smoothness Theorem, in the paper `Smooth profinite groups, III'.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2012.11027v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $p$ be a prime. In this article, we prove the Smoothness Theorem, which asserts that a $(1,1)$-cyclotomic pair is $(n,1)$-cyclotomic, for all $n \geq 1$. In the particular case of Galois cohomology, the Smoothness Theorem provides a new proof of the Norm Residue Isomorphism Theorem, entirely disjoint from motivic cohomology. A byproduct of this approach, is that the latter Theorem follows from mod $p^2$ Kummer theory for fields alone. We moreover extend it, from absolute Galois groups of fields, to algebraic fundamental groups of (not necessarily smooth, nor proper) curves over algebraically closed fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.05166v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by recent work of Lawrence-Venkatesh and Lawrence-Sawin, we show that non-isotrivial families of subvarieties in abelian varieties have big monodromy when twisted by generic rank one local systems. While Lawrence-Sawin discuss the case of subvarieties of codimension one, our results hold for subvarieties of codimension at least half the dimension of the ambient abelian variety. For the proof, we use a combination of geometric arguments and representation theory to show that the Tannaka groups of intersection complexes on such subvarieties are big.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.13456v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore generalizations of the $p$-adic Simpson correspondence on smooth proper rigid spaces to principal bundles under rigid group varieties $G$. For commutative $G$, we prove that such a correspondence exists if and only if the Lie group logarithm is surjective. Second, we treat the case of general $G$ when $X$ is itself an ordinary abelian variety, in which case we prove a generalisation of Faltings' ``small'' correspondence to general rigid groups. On abeloid varieties, we also prove an analog of the classical Corlette-Simpson correspondence for principal bundles under linear algebraic groups.</description>

      <title>On proper splinters in positive characteristic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02511v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While the splinter property is a local property for Noetherian schemes in characteristic zero, Bhatt observed that it imposes strong conditions on the global geometry of proper schemes in positive characteristic. We show that if a proper scheme over a field of positive characteristic is a splinter, then its Nori fundamental group scheme is trivial and its Kodaira dimension is negative. In another direction, Bhatt also showed that any splinter in positive characteristic is a derived splinter. We ask whether the splinter property is a derived invariant for projective varieties in positive characteristic and give a positive answer for normal Gorenstein projective varieties with big anticanonical divisor. We also show that global F-regularity is a derived invariant for normal Gorenstein projective varieties in positive characteristic.</description>

Abstract: We prove the Shafarevich conjecture for very irregular varieties of dimension less than half the dimension of their Albanese variety, subject to some mild numerical conditions. Our proof relies on the Lawrence-Venkatesh method as in the work of Lawrence-Sawin, together with the big monodromy criterion from our work with Javanpeykar and Lehn.</description>

Abstract: We compute the Hochschild and negative cyclic homology of the nodal curves, and we show that the (noncommutative) Hodge to de Rham spectral sequence degenerates at the second page. We also classify all the Hochschild classes that can be lifted to negative cyclic homology. In particular, the result in the nodal cubic curve case is important for computation of categorical enumerative invariants.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07401v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that under mild assumptions, the Fano surfaces of lines on smooth cubic threefolds are the only smooth subvarieties of abelian varieties whose Tannaka group for the convolution of perverse sheaves is an exceptional simple group. This in particular leads to a considerable strengthening of our previous work on the Shafarevich conjecture. A key idea is to control the Hodge decomposition on cohomology by a cocharacter of the Tannaka group of Hodge modules, and to play this off against an improvement of the Hodge number estimates for irregular varieties by Lazarsfeld-Popa and Lombardi.</description>

      <title>Basic representations of genus zero nonabelian Hodge spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12864v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In some previous work, we defined an invariant of genus zero nonabelian Hodge spaces taking the form of a diagram. Here, enriching the diagram by fission data to obtain a refined invariant, the enriched tree, including a partition of the core diagram into $k$ subsets, we show that this invariant contains sufficient information to reconstruct $k$+1 different classes of admissible deformations of wild Riemann surfaces, that are all representations of one single nonabelian Hodge space, so that the isomonodromy systems defined by these representations are expected to be isomorphic. This partially generalises to the case of arbitrary singularity data the picture of the simply-laced case featuring a diagram with a complete $k$-partite core. We illustrate this framework by discussing different Lax representations for Painlev\'e equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01043v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a method for constructing cohomology theories of logarithmic schemes with strict normal crossing boundaries by employing techniques from logarithmic motivic homotopy theory over $\mathbb{F}_1$. This method recovers the K-theory of the open complement of a strict normal crossing divisor from the K-theory of schemes as well as logarithmic topological Hochschild homology from the topological Hochschild homology of schemes. In our applications, we establish that the K-theory of non-regular schemes is representable in the logarithmic motivic homotopy category, and we introduce the logarithmic cyclotomic trace for the regular log regular case.</description>

Abstract: We generalize the classification of isomorphism classes of Schubert varieties from complete flag varieties G/B to a class of partial flag varieties G/P. In particular, we classify all Schubert varieties in G/P where P is a minimal parabolic subgroup, and all Schubert surfaces which are two-dimensional Schubert varieties. We also obtain several classes of isomorphisms of Schubert varieties in flag varieties G/P where P is a maximal parabolic subgroup. In particular, we find an upper bound of the number of isomorphism classes of Schubert threefolds which are three-dimensional Schubert varieties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08002v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superstring compactifications have been vigorously studied for over four decades, and have flourished involving an active iterative feedback between physics and (complex) algebraic geometry. This led to an unprecedented wealth of constructions, virtually all of which are "purely" algebraic. Recent developments however indicate many more possibilities to be afforded by including certain generalizations that, at first glance at least, are not algebraic -- yet fit remarkably well within an overall mirror-symmetric framework and are surprisingly amenable to standard computational analysis upon certain mild but systematic modifications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19910v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend Tate duality for Galois cohomology of abelian varieties to $1$-motives over a $p$-adic field, improving a result of Harari and Szamuely. To do this, we replace Galois cohomology with the condensed cohomology of the Weil group. This is a topological cohomology theory defined in a previous work, which keeps track of the topology of the $p$-adic field. To see $1$-motives as coefficients of this cohomology theory, we introduce their condensed Weil-\'etale realisation. Our duality takes the form of a Pontryagin duality between locally compact abelian groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08957v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We answer in the negative the long-standing open question of whether biholomorphic equivalence implies algebraic equivalence for germs of real algebraic manifolds in $\mathbb C^n$. More precisely we give an example of two germs of real algebraic surfaces in $\mathbb C^2$ that are biholomorphic, but not via an algebraic biholomorphism. In fact we even prove that the components of any biholomorphism between these two surfaces are never solutions of polynomial differential equations. The proof is based on enumerative combinatorics and differential Galois Theory results concerning the nature of the generating series of walks restricted to the quarter plane.</description>

      <title>Analytic diffeomorphisms of the circle and topological Riemann-Roch theorem for circle fibrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10517v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the group $\mathcal G$ which is the semidirect product of the group of analytic functions with values in ${\mathbb C}^*$ on the circle and the group of analytic diffeomorphisms of the circle that preserve the orientation. Then we construct the central extensions of the group $\mathcal G$ by the group ${\mathbb C}^*$. The first central extension, so-called the determinant central extension, is constructed by means of determinants of linear operators acting in infinite-dimensional locally convex topological $\mathbb C$-vector spaces. Other central extensions are constructed by $\cup$-products of group $1$-cocycles with the application to them the map related with algebraic $K$-theory. We prove in the second cohomology group, i.e. modulo of a group $2$-coboundary, the equality of the $12$th power of the $2$-cocycle constructed by the first central extension and the product of integer powers of the $2$-cocycles constructed above by means of $\cup$-products (in multiplicative notation). As an application of this result we obtain the new topological Riemann-Roch theorem for a complex line bundle $L$ on a smooth manifold $M$, where $\pi :M \to B$ is a fibration in oriented circles. More precisely, we prove that in the group $H^3(B, {\mathbb Z})$ the element $12 \, [ {\mathcal Det} (L)]$ is equal to the element $6 \, \pi_* ( c_1(L) \cup c_1(L))$, where $[{\mathcal Det} (L)]$ is the class of the determinant gerbe on $B$ constructed by $L$ and the determinant central extension.</description>
