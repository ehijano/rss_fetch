      <title>Smooth approximations for constant-mean-curvature hypersurfaces with isolated singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a CMC hypersurface with an isolated singular point at which the tangent cone is regular, and such that, in a neighbourhood of said point, the hypersurface is the boundary of a Caccioppoli set that minimises the standard prescribed-mean-curvature functional. We prove that in a ball centred at the singularity there exists a sequence of smooth CMC hypersurfaces, with the same prescribed mean curvature, that converge to the given one. Moreover, these hypersurfaces arise as boundaries of minimisers. In ambient dimension $8$ the condition on the cone is redundant. (When the mean curvature vanishes identically, the result is the well-known Hardt--Simon approximation theorem.)</description>

      <title>Zero entropy on entire Grauert tubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On a real analytic Riemannian manifold a Grauert tube is an uniquely adapted complex structure defined on the tangent bundle. It is called entire if it may be defined on the whole tangent bundle. Here, we show that the geodesic flow of an analytic manifold with entire Grauert tube has zero topological entropy. Several consequences then follow. We find that Grauert tubes of convex analytic hypersurfaces of ${\bf R}^3$ are generically finite. We give a complete classification of 3-manifolds with entire Grauert tube, showing that these are precisely the 3-manifolds that admit good complexifications. Assuming a manifold has entire Grauert tube, we offer classification statements for several families of smooth 4-manifolds, determine all such simply connected 5-manifolds, and offer new topological restrictions for certain manifolds with infinite fundamental groups. Using these results we present an example of a simply connected and rationally elliptic 5-manifold which nonetheless does not admit any metric with entire Grauert tube.</description>

      <title>Free boundary minimal M\"obius bands in toroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that strictly mean convex toroids contain infinitely many (geometrically distinct) embedded free boundary minimal M\"obius bands as well as infinitely many embedded free boundary minimal annuli. The surfaces in both families are constructed by means of equivariant variational methods and their areas grow linearly with the order of their symmetry groups.</description>

      <title>$L^2$-Gamma index theorem for spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish an $L^2$-Gamma index theorem for the Dirac operator on a globally hyperbolic manifold $M$ with Cauchy hypersurface $\Sigma$ being a Galois covering of a compact smooth manifold with Galois group $\Gamma$. Our argument rewrites the $L^2$-Gamma index in terms of the spectral flow, which is then connected to the usual geometric expressions. This extends the work of B\"ar and Strohmaier to some non-compact Cauchy hypersurfaces. The analysis here is based on intermediate results by the first author on $L^2$-Gamma Fredholm properties of the Dirac operator.</description>

      <title>The Segal-Neretin semigroup of annuli</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lie algebra of vector fields on $S^1$ integrates to the Lie group of diffeomorphisms of $S^1$. It is well known since the work of Segal and Neretin that there is no Lie group whose Lie algebra is the complexification of vector fields on $S^1$. A substitute for that non-existent group is provided by the complex semigroup whose elements are annuli: genus zero Riemann surfaces with two boundary circles parametrized by $S^1$. The group $\mathrm{Diff}(S^1)$ sits at the boundary of that semigroup, and can be thought of as annuli which are completely thin, i.e. with empty interior.
  In this paper, we consider an enlargement of the semigroup of annuli, denoted $\mathrm{Ann}$, where the annuli are allowed to be partially thin: their two boundary circles are allowed to touch each other along an arbitrary closed subset. We prove that every (partially thin) annulus $A\in \mathrm{Ann}$ is the time-ordered exponential of a path with values in the cone of inward pointing complexified vector fields on $S^1$, and use that fact to construct a central extension \[ 0\to \mathbb{C} \times \mathbb{Z} \to \tilde{\mathrm{Ann}} \to \mathrm{Ann} \to 0 \] that integrates the universal (Virasoro) central extension of the Lie algebra of vector fields on $S^1$.
  In later work, we will prove that every unitary positive energy representations of the Virasoro algebra integrates to a holomorphic representation of $\tilde{\mathrm{Ann}}$ by bounded operators on a Hilbert space.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that curves of constant torsion satisfy the $C^1$-dense h-principle in the space of immersed curves in Euclidean space. In particular, there exists a knot of constant torsion in each isotopy class. Our methods, which involve convex integration and degree theory, quickly establish these results for curves of constant curvature as well.</description>

      <title>Stability of reverse isoperimetric inequalities in the plane: area, Cheeger, and inradius</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present sharp stability results for various reverse isoperimetric problems in $\mathbb R^2$. Specifically, we prove the stability of the reverse isoperimetric inequality for $\lambda$-convex bodies -- convex bodies with the property that each of their boundary points $p$ supports a ball of radius $1/\lambda$ so that the body lies inside the ball in a neighborhood of $p$. For convex bodies with smooth boundaries, $\lambda$-convexity is equivalent to having the curvature of the boundary bounded below by $\lambda &gt; 0$. Additionally, within this class of convex bodies, we establish stability for the reverse inradius inequality and the reverse Cheeger inequality. Even without its stability version, the sharp reverse Cheeger inequality is new in dimension $2$.</description>

      <title>On double brackets for marked surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a construction of a double quasi-Poisson bracket on the group algebra associated to the twisted fundamental group of a marked oriented surface $(S,P)$ with boundary, where $P$ is a finite set of marked points on the boundary of the surface $S$ such that on every boundary component there is at least one point of $P$. We show that this double bracket is a noncommutative generalization of the well-known Goldman bracket, defined on the space of free homotopy classes of loops on $S$. For an algebra $A$ without polynomial identities, we construct a double bracket on the space of decorated twisted $\mathrm{GL}_n(A)$-, symplectic and indefinite orthogonal local systems.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic circularity of immortal area-preserving curvature flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a class of area-preserving curvature flows of closed planar curves, we prove that every immortal solution becomes asymptotically circular without any additional assumptions on initial data. As a particular corollary, every solution of zero enclosed area blows up in finite time. This settles an open problem posed by Escher--Ito in 2005 for Gage's area-preserving curve shortening flow, and moreover extends it to the surface diffusion flow of arbitrary order. We also establish a general existence theorem for nontrivial immortal solutions under almost circularity and rotational symmetry.</description>

      <title>Conformal Scalar-flat Metrics With Prescribed Boundary Mean Curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(M, g)$ be a compact Riemannian manifold with boundary $\partial M$. Given a function $f$ on $\partial M$, we consider the problem of finding a conformal metric of $g$ with zero scalar curvature in $M$ and prescribed mean curvature $f$ on $\partial M$. Through the construction of local test functions, we resolve most of the remaining open cases from Escobar's work \cite{article15} and establish new solvability conditions.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by a conjecture of Donaldson and Segal on the counts of monopoles and special Lagrangians in Calabi-Yau 3-folds, we prove a compactness theorem for Fueter sections of charge 2 monopole bundles over 3-manifolds: Let $u_k$ be a sequence of Fueter sections of the charge 2 monopole bundle over a closed oriented Riemannian 3-manifold $(M,g)$, with $L^\infty$-norm diverging to infinity. Then a renormalized sequence derived from $u_k$ subsequentially converges to a non-zero $\mathbb{Z}_2$-harmonic 1-form $\mathcal{V}$ on $M$ in the $W^{1,2}$-topology.</description>

      <title>Holonomy and the Ricci curvature of complex Hermitian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove two results on geometric consequences of the representation of restricted holonomy group of a Hermitian connection. The first result concerns when such a Hermitian manifold is K\"ahler in terms of the torsion and the irreducibility of the holonomy action. As a consequence we obtain a criterion of when a Hermitian manifold (and connection) is a generalized Calabi-Yau (in the sense that the Chern Ricci vanishes or equivalently that the restricted holonomy is inside $\mathsf{SU}(m)$). The second result concerns when a compact K\"ahler manifold with a generic restricted holonomy group is projective.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we classify rotationally symmetric conformally flat admissible solitons to the $k$-Yamabe flow, a fully non-linear version of the Yamabe flow. For $n\geq 2k$ we prove existence of complete expanding, steady and shrinking solitons and describe their asymptotic behavior at infinity. For $n&lt;2k$ we prove that steady and expanding solitons are not admissible. The proof is based on the careful analysis of an associated dynamical system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we give an explicit construction of families of $\mathbb{Z}_2$-harmonic 1-forms that degenerate to manifolds with cylindrical ends. We do this by considering certain linear combinations of $L^2$-bounded $\mathbb{Z}_2$-harmonic 1-forms and by modifying the metric near the link. This construction can always be done if the homology group that counts $L^2$-bounded $\mathbb{Z}_2$-harmonic 1-forms is sufficiently large. This has the consequence that every smooth link can be obtained as the singular set of a $\mathbb{Z}_2$-harmonic 1-form on some 3-manifold.</description>

Abstract: We study metric properties of manifolds with conic singularities and present a natural interplay between metrically conic and metrically asymptotically conic behaviour. As a consequence, we prove that a singular sub-manifold is Lipschitz normally embedded, i.e. its inner and outer metric structures are equivalent, in an ambient singular manifold, wheneverthe singularities are conic and the ends of the manifold are asymptotically conic, which answers positively a question raised in our last work.</description>

Abstract: The Mikami-Weinstein theorem is a generalization of the classical Marsden-Weinstein-Meyer symplectic reduction theorem to the case of symplectic groupoid actions. In this paper, we introduce the notion of a cosymplectic groupoid action on a cosymplectic manifold and prove a theorem which is a natural analogue of the Mikami-Weinstein theorem.</description>

      <title>Holomorphic dependence for the Beltrami equation in Sobolev spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that, given a path of Beltrami differentials on $\mathbb C$ that live in and vary holomorphically in the Sobolev space $W^{l,\infty}_{loc}(\Omega)$ of an open subset $\Omega\subset \mathbb C$, the canonical solutions to the Beltrami equation vary holomorphically in $W^{l+1,p}_{loc}(\Omega)$ for admissible $p &gt; 2$. This extends a foundational result of Ahlfors and Bers (the case $l = 0$). As an application, we deduce that Bers metrics on surfaces depend holomorphically on their input data.</description>

      <title>Remarks on Lang's Conjectural Characterisation of Hyperbolicity of Projective Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: S. Lang conjectured that the only obstructions to a projective manifold being hyperbolic come from the presence of rational curves or Abelian varieties. We show that this conjecture follows from the abundance conjecture and the conjectural existence of enough rational curves on terminal Calabi--Yau and hyperk\"ahler varieties. Assuming, in addition, Lang's second conjecture on the absence of Zariski dense entire curves on general type manifolds, we show that a weakly special manifold with no rational curves is an \'etale quotient of an Abelian variety. We then illustrate Lang's first conjecture by producing examples of canonically polarised submanifolds of abelian varieties containing no subvariety of general type, except for a finite number of disjoint copies of some simple abelian variety, which can be chosen arbitrarily. We also show, more generally, that any projective manifold containing a Zariski dense entire curve appears as the `exceptional set' in Lang's sense of some general type manifold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give explicit formulas and asymptotics for the distribution of the index of the Brownian loop in the following geometrical settings: the complex projective line from which two points have been removed; the complex hyperbolic line from which one point has been removed; the odd dimensional spheres from which a great hypersphere has been removed; and the complex anti-de Sitter spaces. Our analysis is based on the geometry of the Hopf and anti-de Sitter fibrations, and on the relationship between winding and area forms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2204.11977v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove several results concerning the existence of surfaces of section for the geodesic flows of closed orientable Riemannian surfaces. The surfaces of section $\Sigma$ that we construct are either Birkhoff sections, meaning that they intersect every sufficiently long orbit segment of the geodesic flow, or at least they have some hyperbolic components in $\partial\Sigma$ as limit sets of the orbits of the geodesic flow that do not return to $\Sigma$. In order to prove these theorems, we provide a study of configurations of simple closed geodesics of closed orientable Riemannian surfaces, which may have independent interest. Our arguments are based on the curve shortening flow.</description>

      <title>Laplacians in spinor bundles over translation surfaces: self-adjoint extentions and regularized determinants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12529v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the regularized determinants ${\rm det}\, \Delta$ of various self-adjoint extensions of symmetric Laplacians acting in spinor bundles over compact Riemann surfaces with flat singular metrics $|\omega|^2$, where $\omega$ is a holomorphic one form on the Riemann surface. We find an explicit expression for ${\rm det}\, \Delta$ for the so-called self-adjoint Szeg\"o extension through the Bergman tau-function on the moduli space of Abelian differentials and the theta-constants (corresponding to the spinor bundle). This expression can be considered as a version of the well-known spin-$1/2$ bosonization formula of Bost-Nelson for the case of flat conformal metrics with conical singularities and a higher genus generalization of the Ray-Singer formula for flat elliptic curves. We establish comparison formulas for the determinants of two different extensions (e. g., the Szeg\"o extension and the Friedrichs one). The paper answers a question raised by D'Hoker and Phong \cite{DH-P} more than thirty years ago. We also reconsider the results from \cite{DH-P} on the regularization of diverging determinant ratio for Mandelstam metrics (for any spin) proposing (and computing) a new regularization of this ratio.</description>

      <title>Generalized positive scalar curvature on spin$^c$ manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00703v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $(M,L)$ be a (compact) non-spin spin$^c$ manifold. Fix a Riemannian metric $g$ on $M$ and a connection $A$ on $L$, and let $D_L$ be the associated spin$^c$ Dirac operator. Let $R^{tw}_{(g,A)}:=R_g + 2ic(\Omega)$ be the twisted scalar curvature (which takes values in the endomorphisms of the spinor bundle), where $R_g$ is the scalar curvature of $g$ and $2ic(\Omega)$ comes from the curvature $2$-form $\Omega$ of the connection $A$. Then the Lichnerowicz-Schr\"odinger formula for the square of the Dirac operator takes the form $D_L^2 =\nabla^*\nabla+\frac{1}{4}R^{tw}_{(g,A)}$. In a previous work we proved that a closed non-spin simply-connected spin$^c$-manifold $(M,L)$ of dimension $n\geq 5$ admits a pair $(g,A)$ such that $R^{tw}_{(g,A)}&gt;0$ if and only if the index $\alpha^c(M,L):=\text{ind}\, D_L$ vanishes in $K_n$. In this paper we introduce a scalar-valued generalized scalar curvature $R^{gen}_{(g,A)}:=R_g - 2|\Omega|_{op}$, where $|\Omega|_{op}$ is the pointwise operator norm of Clifford multiplication $c(\Omega)$, acting on spinors. We show that the positivity condition on the operator $R^{tw}_{(g,A)}$ is equivalent to the positivity of the scalar function $R^{gen}_{g,A}$. We prove a corresponding trichotomy theorem concerning the curvature $R^{gen}_{(g,A)}$, and study its implications. We also show that the space $\mathcal{R}^{gen+}(M,L)$ of pairs $(g,A)$ with $R^{gen}_{(g,A)}&gt;0$ has non-trivial topology, and address a conjecture about non-triviality of the ``index difference'' map.</description>

      <title>A Variational Theory for The Area of Legendrian Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06955v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a new notion of critical point for the area of surfaces under the Legendrian constraint, called parametrized Hamiltonian stationary Legendrian varifolds (PHSLVs). We establish several fundamental properties of these objects, including their sequential compactness and an optimal regularity result, showing that they are smooth immersions away from a locally finite set of branch points and Schoen Wolfson conical singularities. This generalizes in particular the regularity theory of Schoen Wolfson for minimizers to general critical points. This theory can be used to show two new variational results: every minmax operation with the area of (closed, immersed) Legendrian surfaces in a closed Sasakian 5-dimensional manifold is achieved by a Hamiltonian stationary map with this regularity; also, the minimal area in any given exact isotopy class of Legendrian immersions of $S^2$ is realized by such a map. Along the way, we prove an effective monotonicity formula for general two-dimensional stationary varifolds in the Legendrian setting, as well as the closure of integral stationary varifolds among rectifiable ones, in spite of the lack of compactness of the latter.</description>

Abstract: We study the Brunn-Minkowski and Borell-Brascamp-Lieb inequalities on a Riemannian manifold endowed with an exact magnetic field, replacing geodesics by minimizers of an action functional given by the length minus the integral of the magnetic potential. We prove that nonnegativity of a suitably defined magnetic Ricci curvature is equivalent to a magnetic Brunn-Minkowski inequality. More generally, given an arbitrary volume form on the manifold, we introduce a weighted magnetic Ricci curvature, and prove a magnetic version of the Borell-Brascamp-Lieb inequality.</description>

      <title>Streets-Tian Conjecture on several special types of Hermitian manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09425v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Hermitian-symplectic metric is a Hermitian metric whose K\"ahler form is given by the $(1,1)$-part of a closed $2$-form. Streets-Tian Conjecture states that a compact complex manifold admitting a Hermitian-symplectic metric must be K\"ahlerian (i.e., admitting a K\"ahler metric). The conjecture is known to be true in dimension $2$ but is still open in dimensions $3$ or higher. In this article, we confirm the conjecture for some special types of compact Hermitian manifolds, including non-balanced Bismut torsion parallel (BTP) manifolds, and compact quotients of Lie groups whose Lie algebra contains a $J$-invariant abelian ideal of a codimension $2$, a natural generalization to the almost abelian case. The non-balanced BTP case contains all Vaisman manifolds and all Bismut K\"ahler-like manifolds as subsets. These results extend some of the earlier works on the topic by Fino, Kasuya, Vezzoni, Angella, Otiman, Paradiso, and others. Our approach is elementary in nature, by giving explicit descriptions of Hermitian-symplectic metrics on such spaces as well as the pathways of deforming them into K\"ahler ones, aimed at illustrating the algebraic complexity and subtlety of Streets-Tian Conjecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.19033v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spectral invariants are quantitative measurements in symplectic topology coming from Floer homology theory. We study their dependence on the choice of coefficients in the context of Hamiltonian Floer homology. We discover phenomena in this setting which hold for $\mathbb{Z}$-coefficients and fail for all field coefficients. For example, we prove that the spectral norm, an important metric derived from spectral invariants, is unbounded over $\mathbb{Z}$ for complex projective spaces, while it is uniformly bounded over all fields. This allows us to answer a symplectic version of a question of Hingston, originally asked in the setting of the energy functional on the loop space. We also provide applications to Hamiltonian dynamics and Hofer's geometry.</description>

We identify a subset of solutions of the differential inclusion, satisfying two endpoints and periodic boundary conditions, which are homotopy equivalent in the $W^{1,p}$-topology, for any $p\in [1,+\infty)$, to the based loop space and the free loop space respectively.</description>

      <title>On Constructions of Fractal Spaces Using Replacement and the Combinatorial Loewner Property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08062v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The combinatorial Loewner property was introduced by Bourdon and Kleiner as a quasisymmetrically invariant substitute for the Loewner property for general fractals and boundaries of hyperbolic groups. While the Loewner property is somewhat restrictive, the combinatorial Loewner property is very generic -- Bourdon and Kleiner showed that many familiar fractals and group boundaries satisfy it. If $X$ is quasisymmetric to a Loewner space, it has the combinatorial Loewner property. Kleiner conjectured in 2006 that the converse to this holds for self-similar fractals -- the hope being that this would lead to the existence of many exotic Loewner spaces. We disprove this conjecture and give the first examples of spaces which are self-similar, combinatorially Loewner and which are not quasisymmetric to Loewner spaces.
  In the process we introduce a self-similar replacement rule, called iterated graph systems (IGS), which is inspired by the work of Laakso. This produces a new rich class of fractal spaces, where closed form computations of potentials and their conformal dimensions are possible. These spaces exhibit a rich class of behaviors from analysis on fractals in regards to diffusions, Sobolev spaces, energy measures and conformal dimensions. These behaviors expand on the known examples of Cantor sets, gaskets, Vicsek sets, and the often too difficult carpet-like spaces. Especially the counterexamples to Kleiner's conjecture that arise from this construction are interesting, since they open up the possibility to study the new realm of combinatorially Loewner spaces that are not quasisymmetric to Loewner spaces.</description>

Abstract: Let $M$ be a holomorphically symplectic manifold, equipped with a Lagrangian fibration $\pi:\; M \to X$. A degenerate twistor deformation (sometimes also called ``a Tate-Shafarevich twist'') is a family of holomorphically symplectic structures on $M$ parametrized by $H^{1,1}(X)$. All members of this family are equipped with a holomorphic Lagrangian projection to $X$, and their fibers are isomorphic to the fibers of $\pi$. Assume that $M$ is a compact hyperkahler manifold of maximal holonomy, and the general fiber of the Lagrangian projection $\pi$ is primitive (that is, not divisible) in integer homology. We prove that $M$ has a degenerate twistor deformation $M'$ such that the Lagrangian projection $\pi:\; M' \to X$ admits a meromorphic section.</description>

Abstract: We employ the curve shortening flow to establish three new results on the dynamics of geodesic flows of closed Riemannian surfaces. The first one is the stability, under $C^0$-small perturbations of the Riemannian metric, of certain flat links of closed geodesics. The second one is a forced existence theorem for orientable closed Riemannian surfaces: for surfaces of positive genus, the existence of a contractible simple closed geodesic $\gamma$ forces the existence of infinitely many closed geodesics intersecting $\gamma$ in every primitive free homotopy class of loops; for the 2-sphere, the existence of two disjoint simple closed geodesics forces the existence of a third one intersecting both. The final result asserts the existence of Birkhoff sections for the geodesic flow of any closed orientable Riemannian surface.</description>
