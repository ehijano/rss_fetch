Abstract: The aim of this study is to estimate the implications for the reference rate and for the distribution of the tax burden among households from the consumption tax reform as outlined in the version of the Projeto de Lei Complementar (PLP) 68 approved by the Brazilian Chamber of Deputies in July 2024.</description>

      <title>Procompetitive effects of vertical takeovers. Evidence from the European Union</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rising market power threatens competition and decreases consumers' welfare. To date, a few works have shown how global firm-level markups increase, but there is scant evidence about the channels of such a change. This study investigates the causal impact of takeovers on markups and related firm-level outcomes on European manufacturing in 2007- 2021. Interestingly, findings suggest that takeovers aimed at vertical integration strategies are procompetitive because they result in lower markups (0.7%) and more sales (2.9%). The effects are higher as time passes from the takeover event, and they increase with the parents' number of already integrated subsidiaries. Notably, we do not find a significant impact on markups in horizontal integration strategies after we control for cherry-picking by acquirers. Eventually, we emphasize that our results on vertical takeovers point to strategies aimed at eliminating double profit margins on the input markets; thus, lower markups increase sales, spreading fixed costs and benefiting from economies of scale. Several checks on methods and sample composition effects confirm our central tenets. Finally, we reconnect with the debate initiated by the U.S. Vertical Merger Guidelines (2020; 2023), where the presumption of harm after vertical deals has been softened, thus considering procompetitive effects, but the discussion of potential</description>

      <title>During and after COVID-19: What happened to the home advantage in Germany's first football division?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well-established that the home advantage (HA), the phenomenon that on average the local team performs better than the visiting team, exists in many sports. In response to the COVID-19 outbreak, spectators were banned from football stadiums, which we leverage as a natural experiment to examine the impact of stadium spectators on HA. Using data from the first division of the German Bundesliga for seasons 2016/17 to 2023/24, we are the first to focus on a longer time horizon and consider not only the first but all three seasons subject to spectator regulations as well as two subsequent seasons without. We confirm previous studies regarding the disappearance of the HA in the last nine matches of season 2019/20. This drop materialised almost entirely through a reduction of home goals. The HA in season 2020/21 (with spectator ban during most matches) was very close to the pre-COVID-19 season 2018/19, indicating that teams became accustomed to the absence of spectators. For season 2021/22, with varying spectator regulations, we detect a U-shaped relationship between HA and the stadium utilisation rate, where HA increases considerably for matches with medium stadium utilisation which is associated with a larger difference in running distance between the home and away teams.</description>

      <title>Germany's Tax Revenue and its Total Administrative Cost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tax administrative cost reduction is an economically and socially desirable goal for public policy. This article proposes total administrative cost as percentage of total tax revenue as a vivid measurand, also useful for cross-jurisdiction comparisons. Statistical data, surveys and a novel approach demonstrate: Germany's 2021 tax administrative costs likely exceeded 20% of total tax revenue, indicating need for improvement of Germany's taxation system - and for the many jurisdictions with similar tax regimes. In addition, this article outlines possible reasons for and implications of the seemingly high tax administrative burden as well as solutions.</description>

      <title>The Distributional Effects of Economic Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the distributional implications of uncertainty shocks by developing a model that links macroeconomic aggregates to the US distribution of earnings and consumption. We find that: initially, the fraction of low-earning workers decreases, while the share of households reporting low consumption increases; at longer horizons, the fraction of low-income workers increases, but the consumption distribution reverts to its pre-shock shape. While the first phase reduces income inequality and increases consumption inequality, in the second stage income inequality rises, while the effects on consumption inequality dissipate. Finally, we introduce Functional Local Projections and show that they yield similar results.</description>

      <title>The Role of Accuracy and Validation Effectiveness in Conversational Business Analytics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12128v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study examines conversational business analytics, an approach that utilizes AI to address the technical competency gaps that hinder end users from effectively using traditional self-service analytics. By facilitating natural language interactions, conversational business analytics aims to empower end users to independently retrieve data and generate insights. The analysis focuses on Text-to-SQL as a representative technology for translating natural language requests into SQL statements. Developing theoretical models grounded in expected utility theory, the study identifies conditions under which conversational business analytics, through partial or full support, can outperform delegation to human experts. The results indicate that partial support, focusing solely on information generation by AI, is viable when the accuracy of AI-generated SQL queries leads to a profit that surpasses the performance of a human expert. In contrast, full support includes not only information generation but also validation through explanations provided by the AI, and requires sufficiently high validation effectiveness to be reliable. However, user-based validation presents challenges, such as misjudgment and rejection of valid SQL queries, which may limit the effectiveness of conversational business analytics. These challenges underscore the need for robust validation mechanisms, including improved user support, automated processes, and methods for assessing quality independently of end users' technical competencies.</description>
