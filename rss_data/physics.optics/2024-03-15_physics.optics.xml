      <title>Microwave photonic transversal filters based on microcombs with feedback control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Feedback control plays a crucial role in improving system accuracy and stability for a variety of scientific and engineering applications. Here, we theoretically and experimentally investigate the implementation of feedback control in microwave photonic (MWP) transversal filter systems based on optical microcomb sources, which offer advantages in achieving highly reconfigurable processing functions without requiring changes to hardware. We propose four different feedback control methods including (1) one stage spectral power reshaping, (2) one stage impulse response reshaping, (3) two stage spectral power reshaping, and (4) two stage synergic spectral power reshaping and impulse response reshaping. We experimentally implement these feedback control methods and compare their performance. The results show that the feedback control can significantly improve not only the accuracy of comb line shaping as well as temporal signal processing and spectral filtering, but also the systems long term stability. Finally, we discuss the current limitations and future prospects for optimizing feedback control in microcomb based MWP transversal filter systems implemented by both discrete components and integrated chips. Our results provide a comprehensive guide for the implementation of feedback control in microcomb based MWP filter systems in order to improve their performance for practical applications.</description>

      <title>Dual-polarization RF Channelizer Based on Kerr Soliton Microcomb Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a dual-polarization radio frequency (RF) channelizer based on microcombs. With the tailored mismatch between the FSRs of the active and passive MRRs, wideband RF spectra can be channelized into multiple segments featuring digital compatible bandwidths via the Vernier effect. Due to the use of dual polarization states, the number of channelized spectral segments, and thus the RF instantaneous bandwidth (with a certain spectral resolution), can be doubled. In our experiments, we used 20 microcomb lines with 49 GHz FSR to achieve 20 channels for each polarization, with high RF spectra slicing resolutions at 144 MHz (TE) and 163 MHz (TM), respectively; achieving an instantaneous RF operation bandwidth of 3.1 GHz (TE) and 2.2 GHz (TM). Our approach paves the path towards monolithically integrated photonic RF receivers (the key components active and passive MRRs are all fabricated on the same platform) with reduced complexity, size, and unprecedented performance, which is important for wide RF applications with digital compatible signal detection.</description>

      <title>Temporal Signal Processing with Nonlocal Optical Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlocal metasurfaces have recently enabled an ultra-compact, low-power and high-speed platform to perform analog image processing. While several computational tasks have been demonstrated based on this platform, most of the previous studies have focused only on spatial operations, such as spatial differentiation and edge detection. Here, we demonstrate that metasurfaces with temporal nonlocalities - that is, with a tailored dispersive response - can be used to implement time-domain signal processing in deeply subwavelength footprints. In particular, we show a passive metasurface performing first-order differentiation of an input signal with high-fidelity and high-efficiency. We also demonstrate that this approach is prone to scalability and cascaded computation. Our work paves the way to a new generation of ultra-compact, passive devices for all-optical computation, with applications in neural networks and neuromorphic computing.</description>

      <title>Broadband NIR photon upconversion generates NIR persistent luminescence for bioimaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Upconversion persistent luminescence (UCPL) phosphors that can be directly charged by near-infrared (NIR) light have gained considerable attention due to their promising applications ranging from photonics to biomedicine. However, current lanthanide-based UCPL phosphors show small absorption cross-sections and low upconversion charging efficiency. The development of UCPL phosphors faces challenges of lacking flexible upconversion charging pathways and poor design flexibility. Herein, we discovered a new lattice defect-mediated broadband photon upconversion process and the accompanied NIR-to-NIR UCPL in Cr-doped zinc gallate nanoparticles. The zinc gallate nanoparticles can be directly activated by broadband NIR light in the 700-1000 nm range to produce persistent luminescence at about 700 nm, which is also readily enhanced by rationally tailoring the lattice defects in the phosphors. This proposed UCPL phosphors achieved a signal-to-background ratio of over 200 in bioimaging by efficiently avoiding interference from autofluorescence and light scattering. Our findings reported the lattice defect-mediated photon upconversion for the first time, which significantly expanded the horizons for the flexible design of NIR-to-NIR UCPL phosphors toward broad applications.</description>

      <title>Optical Calibration of Holographic Acoustic Tweezers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, acoustic tweezers based on an array of ultrasonic transducers have been reported taking inspiration from holographic optical tweezers. In the latter technique, the calibration of the optical trap is an essential procedure to obtain the trap stiffnesses. On the contrary, in the case of acoustic tweezers the calibration of the acoustic forces is seldom carried out. To cover this gap, in this work, we adapt the calibration protocols employed in optical tweezers to acoustic tweezers based on arrays of ultrasonic transducers. We measure trap stiffnesses in the mN/m range that are consistent with theoretical estimates obtained by calculations of the acoustic radiation forces based on the Gorkov potential. This work gives a common framework to the optical and acoustic manipulation communities, paving the way to a consistent calibration of hybrid acoustooptical setups.</description>

      <title>Partially coherent beam: Theory and simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the development of lasers, we have continuously sought to advance techniques and theory to obtain beams with a high degree of coherence, as natural light sources provide incoherent light. However, there are applications where it is advantageous to use partially coherent (PC) beams in a controlled manner, such as in propagation through turbulent media. To generate a PC beam in the laboratory or in simulations, specific theories and methods are required. In this article, we provide an introduction to PC beam theory, describing how to generate them through modal decompositions and a step-by-step guide for simulating and analyzing beam generation inspired by experiments. To illustrate the methods, we present Gaussian Schell-Model beams as an example.</description>

      <title>Selective Excitation of Vibrations in a Single Molecule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The capability to excite, probe, and manipulate vibrational modes is essential for understanding and controlling chemical reactions at the molecular level. Recent advancements in tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopies have enabled the probing of vibrational fingerprints in a single molecule with Angstrom-scale spatial resolution. However, achieving controllable excitation of specific vibrational modes in individual molecules remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate the selective excitation and probing of vibrational modes in single deprotonated phthalocyanine molecules utilizing resonance Raman spectroscopy in a scanning tunneling microscope. Selective excitation is achieved by finely tuning the excitation wavelength of the laser to be resonant with the vibronic transitions between the molecular ground electronic state and the vibrational levels in the excited electronic state, resulting in the state-selective enhancement of the resonance Raman signal. Our approach sets the stage for steering chemical transformations in molecules on surfaces by selective excitation of molecular vibrations.</description>

      <title>Quality factor of dielectric optical resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show analytically that the quality ($Q$) factor of magnetic and electric Mie modes in a lossless dielectric spherical resonator with high refractive index ($n \gg 1$) scales as $n^{2j+1}$ and $n^{2j+3}$ respectively, where $j$ denotes the multipolar order. We numerically validate these results and show that our high-$n$ analytical relation is accurate for the dipolar modes when $n&gt;5$. For higher multipolar orders, the analytical relation becomes valid for increasingly lower $n$. We study the dependence of the $Q$ factor on absorption losses and determine a general functional form that describes the $Q$ factor for all Mie modes for any complex refractive index. Finally, we observe that this functional form predicts a multipolar-dependent singular value of optical gain which gives rise to a lasing condition with an infinite $Q$ factor.</description>

      <title>A hollow-core fiber based stand-alone multimodal (2-photon, 3-photon, SHG, THG) nonlinear flexible imaging endoscope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal nonlinear endoscopes have been a topic of intense research over the past two decades, enabling sub-cellular and label-free imaging in areas not reachable with table-top microscopes. They are sophisticated systems that can be implemented on an optical table in a lab environment, but they cannot be easily moved within or out of the lab. We present here a multimodal and flexible nonlinear endoscope system able to perform two photon excited fluorescence and second harmonic generation imaging with a stand-alone and moveable kart integrating a compact ultrashort laser source. In addition, the system can perform three photon excited fluorescence and third harmonic generation thanks to a delivery optical fiber used to deliver ultrashort pulses from massive and not movable laser systems into the stand-alone kart. The endoscopic fiber probes and delivery optical fibers are based on functionalized negative curvature hollow core fibers. The endoscope distal head has a diameter &lt;2.2mm and can perform nonlinear imaging at max 10 frames/s over a field of view up to 600 $\mu$m with a ~1 $\mu$m spatial resolution.</description>

      <title>Deep-learning-assisted optical communication with discretized state space of structural light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rich structure of the transverse spatial mode of structural light has facilitated its applications in quantum information and optical communication. The Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) modes, with azimuthal and radial indexes, consist of a complete orthogonal basis to describe the transverse spatial mode of light. The azimuthal index is often endowed with the orbital angular momentum (OAM), a high dimensional degree of freedom. The advent of OAM in optical science marks a pivotal advancement, surpassing traditional optical techniques in light manipulation for advanced data encoding and signal transmission. Here, we present a scheme that utilizes the advanced deep learning technique for LG modes recognition. By discretizing the state space of the LG modes, a neural network model is trained to classify the given samples. A proof-of-principle experiment is performed to show that our scheme requires less samples for model training, while increasing the channel capacity within limited OAM number. We further apply our scheme to an image transmission task, demonstrating the ability to encode large data with low OAM number. Our work opens a new avenue for high capacity optical communication based on structural light.</description>

      <title>Compute-first optical detection for noise-resilient visual perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of visual perception, the optical signal from a scene is transferred into the electronic domain by detectors in the form of image data, which are then processed for the extraction of visual information. In noisy and weak-signal environments such as thermal imaging for night vision applications, however, the performance of neural computing tasks faces a significant bottleneck due to the inherent degradation of data quality upon noisy detection. Here, we propose a concept of optical signal processing before detection to address this issue. We demonstrate that spatially redistributing optical signals through a properly designed linear transformer can enhance the detection noise resilience of visual perception tasks, as benchmarked with the MNIST classification. Our idea is supported by a quantitative analysis detailing the relationship between signal concentration and noise robustness, as well as its practical implementation in an incoherent imaging system. This compute-first detection scheme can pave the way for advancing infrared machine vision technologies widely used for industrial and defense applications.</description>

      <title>Does one still need to "shut up and calculate"?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In learning quantum mechanics, an essential question has always been: How does one go about developing a "physical feel" for quantum phenomena? Naturally, one needs a basis or ground zero to start from, and that basis must be unlike anything with which we are already familiar in consequence of our experiences with the world of classical physics. We argue (channeling Richard Feynman) that the most elementary and the least cumbersome concept to build upon is the existence of complex probability amplitudes for physical events. An event that can take place in multiple alternative ways should be treated by adding the corresponding amplitudes when the paths are, in principle, indistinguishable, and by adding the probabilities themselves when the paths are distinguishable. Once we accept this principle and hone our intuition by examining quantum phenomena in its light, we will be on the path to "understanding" quantum mechanics. Elementary examples from the field of quantum optics demonstrate how adherence to Feynman's principle could lead to a better, more "intuitive" appreciation for the magic of quantum mechanics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Carbon-based black pigments, a widely used class of pigments, are difficult to differentiate with the noninvasive techniques currently used in cultural heritage science. We utilize pump-probe microscopy to distinguish four common carbon-based black pigments as pure pigments, as two-component black pigment mixtures, and as a mixture of a black and a colorful pigment. This work also demonstrates that even nominally homogeneous pigments present remarkable, and useful, heterogeneity in pump-probe microscopy.</description>

      <title>Quantum emitters in van der Waals {\alpha}-MoO3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum emitters in solid-state materials are highly promising building blocks for quantum information processing and communication science. Recently, single-photon emission from van der Waals materials has been reported in transition metal dichalcogenides and hexagonal boron nitride, exhibiting the potential to realize photonic quantum technologies in two-dimensional materials. Here, we report the observation of single-photon generation from exfoliated and thermally annealed single crystals of van der Waals {\alpha}-MoO3. The second-order correlation function measurement displays a clear photon antibunching, while the luminescence intensity exceeds 100 kcounts/s and remains stable under laser excitation. Also, the zero-phonon lines of these emitters are distributed in a spectrally narrow energy range. The theoretical calculation suggests that an oxygen vacancy defect is a possible candidate for the observed emitters. Together with photostability and brightness, quantum emitters in {\alpha}-MoO3 provide a new avenue to realize photon-based quantum information science in van der Waals materials.</description>

      <title>Virtual birefringence imaging and histological staining of amyloid deposits in label-free tissue using autofluorescence microscopy and deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Systemic amyloidosis is a group of diseases characterized by the deposition of misfolded proteins in various organs and tissues, leading to progressive organ dysfunction and failure. Congo red stain is the gold standard chemical stain for the visualization of amyloid deposits in tissue sections, as it forms complexes with the misfolded proteins and shows a birefringence pattern under polarized light microscopy. However, Congo red staining is tedious and costly to perform, and prone to false diagnoses due to variations in the amount of amyloid, staining quality and expert interpretation through manual examination of tissue under a polarization microscope. Here, we report the first demonstration of virtual birefringence imaging and virtual Congo red staining of label-free human tissue to show that a single trained neural network can rapidly transform autofluorescence images of label-free tissue sections into brightfield and polarized light microscopy equivalent images, matching the histochemically stained versions of the same samples. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method with blind testing and pathologist evaluations on cardiac tissue where the virtually stained images agreed well with the histochemically stained ground truth images. Our virtually stained polarization and brightfield images highlight amyloid birefringence patterns in a consistent, reproducible manner while mitigating diagnostic challenges due to variations in the quality of chemical staining and manual imaging processes as part of the clinical workflow.</description>

Abstract: Purines and pyrimidines, crucial building blocks in biological systems, have attracted significant interest across molecular physics, biochemistry, pharmacology, and chemistry. Extensive spectroscopies have been employed for characterization, while the temperature and potential tautomeric effects can complicate the interpretation of underlying physics and chemistry. Here, we conducted first-principles simulations to analyze the vibrationally-resolved O1s X-ray photoelectron spectra of 6 common biomolecules at different temperatures, comprising 3 purine (xanthine, caffeine, and hypoxanthine) and 3 pyrimidine (thymine, 5F-uracil, and uracil) derivatives, and the tautomeric effect of hypoxanthine at varying temperatures. Using both time-independent (TI) and time-dependent (TD) methods under the Franck-Condon approximation, we obtained theoretical spectra that exhibited excellent agreement with experiments. Our analysis of these systems, all featuring carbonyl oxygens, unveiled distinctive characteristics of oxygen in N-CO-N (O2) compared to that within a N-CO-C structure (O1), showcasing higher O1s binding energy and total vibrational reorganization energy. We observed small differences in the zero-point vibration energies between the core-ionized and ground states, indicating a weak Duschinsky rotation effect. We consistently found that O1s ionization resulted in elongation of the O*=C bond length. The TI method facilitated the assignment of experimental spectra to different atoms or tautomers, where the atom-specific vibronic profiles of all 6 molecules exhibited similarity, with the 0-2 transitions dominating. TD enabled a more comprehensive exploration of the temperature effect, and the tautomeric effect of hypoxanthine by incorporating the Boltzmann population ratios of tautomers. We observed significant temperature dependence in the vibronic features present in these spectra.</description>

      <title>Classical Approaches to Chiral Polaritonics</title>

Abstract: We provide a theoretical framework based on classical electromagnetism, to describe optical properties of Fabry-P\'erot cavities, filled with multilayered and linear chiral materials. We find a formal link between transfer-matrix, scattering-matrix and Green-function approaches to compute the polarization-dependent optical transmission, and cavity-modified circular dichroism signals. We show how general symmetries like Lorentz reciprocity and time-reversal symmetry constrain the modelling of such cavities. We apply this approach to investigate numerically and analytically the properties of various Fabry-P\'erot cavities, made of either metallic or helicity-preserving dielectric photonic crystal mirrors. In the latter case, we analyze the onset of chiral cavity-polaritons in terms of partial helicity-preservation of electromagnetic waves reflected at the mirrors interfaces. Our approach is relevant for designing innovative Fabry-P\'erot cavities for chiral-sensing, and for probing cavity-modified stereochemistry.</description>

      <title>Design and Analysis of Pseudospin-Polarized Ultra-Wideband Waveguide Supporting Hybrid Spoof Surface Plasmon Polaritons</title>

Abstract: In this study, novel low-loss waveguides and power dividers for ultra-broadband surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) are introduced. This article uses complementary metasurfaces in place of traditional SPP, which are typically produced as metasurface unit cells on the dielectric sublayer. It has been demonstrated that the use of complementary metasurfaces considerably improves wave confinement and inhibits wave propagation. Because of this, it is anticipated that waveguides and power dividers made from these complimentary unit cells will have significantly lower losses and greater bandwidth than SPP used in traditional devices. In the frequency range of 0 GHz to 100 GHz, waveguides and bent waveguides with complementary metasurface unit cells exhibit insertion loss greater than 0.5 dB. Utilizing complementary metasurfaces, symmetric and asymmetric power dividers have been created and researched. The results of the simulation have shown that using this type of unit cell in the construction of microwave devices is advantageous.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07038v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The highly energetic photons of ultraviolet light drive electronic and rovibronic transitions in all molecular species. This radiation is thus a prime tool for strongly selective spectroscopic fingerprinting and real-time environmental monitoring if broad spectral coverage, short acquisition times and high spectral resolution is achieved - requirements that are in mutual competition in traditional applications. As a novel approach with intrinsic potency in all three aspects, here we introduce ultraviolet dual comb spectroscopy using two broadband ultraviolet frequency combs centered at 871 THz and covering a spectral bandwidth of 35.7 THz. Within a 100 us acquisition time window, we obtain rotational state-resolved absorption spectra of formaldehyde, a prototype molecule with high relevance for laser spectroscopy and environmental sciences. This is the first realization of broadband dual comb spectroscopy in the ultraviolet spectral region and a pioneering tool to allow for real-time monitoring of rovibronic transitions.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of a low loss, highly stable and re-useable edge coupler for high heralding efficiency and low g^(2) (0) SOI correlated photon pair sources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17464v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report a stable, low loss method for coupling light from silicon-on-insulator (SOI) photonic chips into optical fibers. The technique is realized using an on-chip tapered waveguide and a cleaved small core optical fiber. The on-chip taper is monolithic and does not require a patterned cladding, thus simplifying the chip fabrication process. The optical fiber segment is composed of a centimeter-long small core fiber (UHNA7) which is spliced to SMF-28 fiber with less than -0.1 dB loss. We observe an overall coupling loss of -0.64 dB with this design. The chip edge and fiber tip can be butt coupled without damaging the on-chip taper or fiber. Friction between the surfaces maintains alignment leading to an observation of +-0.1 dB coupling fluctuation during a ten-day continuous measurement without use of any adhesive. This technique minimizes the potential for generating Raman noise in the fiber, and has good stability compared to coupling strategies based on longer UHNA fibers or fragile lensed fibers. We also applied the edge coupler on a correlated photon pair source and observed a raw coincidence count rate of 1.21 million cps and raw heralding efficiency of 21.3%. We achieved an auto correlation function g^(2) (0) as low as 0.0004 at the low pump power regime.</description>

      <title>Soliton Frequency Combs in Elastomer Membrane-Cavity Optomechanics</title>

Abstract: Solitons, arising from nonlinear wave-matter interactions, stand out for their intrinsic stability during wave propagation and exceptional spectral characteristics. Their applications span diverse physical systems, including telecommunications, atomic clocks, and precise measurements. In recent years, significant strides have been made in developing cavity-optomechanics based approaches to generate optical frequency combs (FCs). In this study, we present an innovative approach, never explored before, that leverages elastomer membrane (EM)-cavity optomechanics to achieve the generation of soliton FCs, a highly sought-after phenomenon in the realm of nonlinear wave-matter interactions. Our method represents a significant breakthrough due to its streamlined simplicity, relying on a single continuous-wave (CW) laser pump and an externally applied acoustic wave exciting an EM-cavity, which gives rise to phonons, quantized vibrational energy states intrinsic to the elastomer's crystalline lattice structure. The mechanical resonator and electromagnetic cavity resonance are parametrically coupled within the microwave frequency range, collectively orchestrate the process of soliton FCs formation with remarkable efficiency. Numerical simulations and experimental observations demonstrate the emergence of multiple stable localized opto-mechanical wave packets, characterized by a narrow pulses time-domain response. Crucially, by setting the acoustic wave frequency to match the natural frequency of the EM resonator, the solitons' teeth are precisely spaced, and the EM's motion is significantly amplified, giving rise to a Kerr medium. The successful realization of optomechanical stable solitons represents a monumental advancement with transformative potential across various fields, including quantum computing and spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Computational Imaging for Machine Perception: Transferring Semantic Segmentation beyond Aberrations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.11257v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semantic scene understanding with Minimalist Optical Systems (MOS) in mobile and wearable applications remains a challenge due to the corrupted imaging quality induced by optical aberrations. However, previous works only focus on improving the subjective imaging quality through the Computational Imaging (CI) technique, ignoring the feasibility of advancing semantic segmentation. In this paper, we pioneer the investigation of Semantic Segmentation under Optical Aberrations (SSOA) with MOS. To benchmark SSOA, we construct Virtual Prototype Lens (VPL) groups through optical simulation, generating Cityscapes-ab and KITTI-360-ab datasets under different behaviors and levels of aberrations. We look into SSOA via an unsupervised domain adaptation perspective to address the scarcity of labeled aberration data in real-world scenarios. Further, we propose Computational Imaging Assisted Domain Adaptation (CIADA) to leverage prior knowledge of CI for robust performance in SSOA. Based on our benchmark, we conduct experiments on the robustness of classical segmenters against aberrations. In addition, extensive evaluations of possible solutions to SSOA reveal that CIADA achieves superior performance under all aberration distributions, bridging the gap between computational imaging and downstream applications for MOS.

      <title>Exponentially localised interface eigenmodes in finite chains of resonators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09667v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies wave localisation in chains of finitely many resonators. There is an extensive theory predicting the existence of localised modes induced by defects in infinitely periodic systems. This work extends these principles to finite-sized systems. We consider finite systems of subwavelength resonators arranged in dimers that have a geometric defect in the structure. This is a classical wave analogue of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. We prove the existence of a spectral gap for defectless finite dimer structures and find a direct relationship between eigenvalues being within the spectral gap and the localisation of their associated eigenmode. Then we show the existence and uniqueness of an eigenvalue in the gap in the defect structure, proving the existence of a unique localised interface mode. To the best of our knowledge, our method, based on Chebyshev polynomials, is the first to characterise quantitatively the localised interface modes in systems of finitely many resonators.</description>

      <title>Long-lived collective Rydberg excitations in atomic gas achieved via ac-Stark lattice modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06513v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collective Rydberg excitations provide promising applications ranging from quantum information processing, and quantum computing to ultra-sensitive electrometry. However, their short lifetime is an immense obstacle in real-life scenarios. The state-of-the-art methods of prolonging the lifetime were mainly implemented for ground-state quantum memories and would require a redesign to effectively work on different atomic transitions. We propose a protocol for extending the Rydberg excitation lifetime, which in principle can freeze the spin-wave and completely cancel the effects of thermal dephasing. The protocol employs off-resonant ac-Stark lattice modulation of spin waves by interfering two laser beams on the atomic medium. Our implementation showed that the excitation lifetime can be extended by an order of magnitude, paving the way towards more complex protocols for collective Rydberg excitations.</description>
