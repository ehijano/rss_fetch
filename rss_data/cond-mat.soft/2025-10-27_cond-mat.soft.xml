      <title>Study of the Molecular Level Mechanism of Nanoscale Alternating Current Electrohydrodynamic Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the molecular-level mechanism of Alternating Current Electrohydrodynamic (AC-EHD) flow in nanopores under high-frequency conditions, using molecular dynamics simulations. A gold-NaCl system with symmetric and asymmetric electrode configurations is used to analyze the flow patterns under high-frequency AC potentials. Our findings reveal localized heat generation near the electrode leading to a steep temperature gradient. An order parameter analysis explained that the heat generation is due to the periodic change in the alignment of water molecules under AC potential and that at these high frequencies the influence of Na$^+$ and Cl$^-$ ions are negligible. The heat generation and temperature gradient are found to increase with the applied AC frequency. Three different electrode configurations were studied by varying the size and distance between the electrodes. A net directional flow develops in the asymmetric electrode structures. A possible mechanism for this is proposed by analyzing the flow patterns using velocity and temperature profiles, order parameters, streamline plots and mean square displacements. Different forces acting on the fluid were identified such as buoyancy-driven convection due to temperature gradient, electrothermal effects influenced by the temperature-dependent properties of water, and Maxwell stress due to the non-uniform electric field. Moreover, the asymmetric electrode structure created an imbalance in these forces and generated a net directional flow. These findings suggest the existence of a form of nanoscale AC-EHD flow that operates in a frequency regime above that of conventional electroosmotic and electrothermal mechanisms and that, unlike these mechanisms, occurs independently of ionic concentration. Thereby this work provides insights for optimizing AC-EHD flow in nanoscale systems where precise fluid manipulation is critical.</description>

      <title>Beyond mechanochromism: Programmable multimodal actuation in cholesteric liquid crystal elastomer hollow fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cholesteric liquid crystal elastomers (CLCEs) change color under strain, offering attractive prospects for smart textiles, soft robotics, and photonic devices. However, the helical structure of CLCEs averages out the exceptional anisotropy and soft elasticity of their nematic parents, leaving little scope for also using the director orientation to program their thermal or mechanical actuation. Here, we develop programmable CLCE hollow fibers via an anisotropic deswelling-assisted template method. By integrating dynamic boronic ester bond exchange with mechanical force/pneumatic pressure-induced liquid crystal mesogen orientation, we are able to make CLCE fibers with overall longitudinal, circumferential, and twisted directors, while preserving enough residual periodicity to maintain their structural color. Inflation of these fibers then yields a range of motions (expansion, contraction, elongation, and twisting) accompanied by synchronous adaptive color changes. To explain these motions, we derive a membrane balloon model based on the non-ideal neo-classical LCE energy with suitable CLCE director profiles. The model successfully captures all the key mechanical features, including non-monotonicity and sub-criticality as a function of inflationary pressure. We thus confirm that the fiber's rich mechanochromic behavior originates from the combination of cholesteric color and nematic-like programmed soft elasticity. Our study thus transcends the limitations of traditional CLCE fibers by combining orientation encoding, soft elasticity, and pneumatic actuation to provide a new paradigm for the development of systems that change both shape and color in a bespoke and versatile way.</description>

      <title>Aggregates in fluidized beds: the effect of bonding angles on fluidization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluidized beds consist of solid particles suspended in a tube by an ascending fluid. In liquids, it is not rare that particles adhere to each other, decreasing the solid-liquid contact area and the ratio between the tube and grain diameters, deteriorating fluidization. We inquire into this problem by carrying out experiments with trios of spheres fluidized by water flows, the spheres being glued in predefined angles. In our tests, we used a 25.4-mm-ID (internal diameter) tube and 5.95-mm-diameter spheres, and we varied the angle of trios within 60$^{\circ}$ and 180$^\circ$ and water velocities within 0.027 and 0.210 m/s. Due to the small ratio between the diameters of the tube and spheres (approximately 4.3), the bed is prone to the formation of plugs and clogs. Our experiments show that elutriation, fluidization with plugs, glass transitions (amorphous static structures), packed beds, clogging, and a transitional clogged-plug regime can appear in the bed, depending on the bonding angles and water velocities. We report the relations between the bed height, bonding angles, and flow velocity, and show that they correlate with the granular temperature. We also show that an angle of 90$^\circ$ maximizes fluidization for a given fluid velocity, and we propose a regime map that organizes the different patterns based on the bonding angle and flow velocity. The proposed map can serve as a guide for selecting the fluid velocities in order to keep the bed fluidized at all times, helping in the design and operation of fluidized beds.</description>

      <title>Laser Patterning of Superhydrophobic transparent glass surfaces with anti-fogging and anti-icing applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work addresses the fabrication of transparent glass surfaces with superior water-repellence (i.e., superhydrophobicity), and related functional properties such as omniphobicity, anti-fogging and anti-icing responses. Surfaces have been processed by means of mild femtosecond laser patterning combined with the grafting of fluorinated tethered molecules. Controlling the laser scan and ablation conditions permits the fabrication of under-design grooves with cross and lineal morphologies and separations between 10 and 500 um. These patterns provide a high transparency and repellence to liquids and ice over large areas. The best performance is obtained for cross or parallel line patterned glass with microgrooves separated by 100 um and 15 um depth thanks to 5 laser scanning repetitions. These surfaces present a stable Cassie-Baxter wetting state and very low ice-adhesion strength while keeping up to 80 % of optical transmittance in the visible region. Anti-fouling tests, along with freezing and thawing cycles on these surfaces, have demonstrated a remarkable and durable self-cleaning response, even under environmentally stressful conditions. Water condensation experiments conducted under atmospheric conditions, as well as in an environmental electron scanning microscope, have revealed important issues related to the formation of supercooled water droplets. These experiments show that the patterned breakdown of surface properties effectively prevents extensive fogging and water accumulation. This feature is particularly crucial for outdoors and low temperature applications where the preservation of transparency is essential.</description>

      <title>Emergent Microrobotic Behavior of Active Flexicles in Complex Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collections of simple, self-propelled colloidal particles exhibit complex, emergent dynamical behavior, with promising applications in microrobotics. When confined within a deformable vesicle, self-propelled rods cluster and align, propelling the vesicle and inducing changes in the vesicle shape. We explore potential microrobotic capabilities of such vesicle-encapsulated particles, which form a composite particle system termed a `flexicle'. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that the alignment of rods enables flexicles to locomote and respond adaptively to their physical environment. When encountering solid boundaries or obstacles, the rods reorient at the interface, triggering novel emergent behaviors such as crawling, corner-preferencing, wall climbing, and object-latching. These interactions and accompanying internal rod re-arrangement lead to spontaneous, temporary differentiation of the rods into `latchers' and `navigators'. This division of labor among the rods enables coordinated locomotion and environmental response. Our findings establish flexicles as a versatile platform for programmable, geometry-sensitive microrobotic behavior, offering a step toward autonomous colloidal robotics.</description>

      <title>Reciprocal swimming in granular media: the role of jamming and swimmer inertia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use particle simulations to reveal two distinct propulsion mechanisms for a scallop-like swimmer to locomote itself in granular media by reciprocally flapping its wings. Based on the discrete element method, we examine the kinematics and contact forces of particles near the swimmer to identify jamming effects induced by the swimmer in a frictional granular medium, which are less intense during the opening stroke than the closing. This broken symmetry is quantified by the difference in the number of strong particle contact forces formed during opening and closing, which shows a linear relation with the swimmer's net displacement across various swimmer and medium configurations, all favoring the opening stroke. We identify a secondary propulsion mechanism in a dynamic regime with significant swimmer inertia, as the flapping period approaches the coasting time for a moving swimmer to come to rest under the medium resistance. In this case, the swimmer's net displacement is correlated to the ratio between these two time scales, and the swimming direction favors the closing stroke due to the smaller medium resistance as the swimmer coasts with closed wings.</description>

      <title>Wertheim association theory for ion pairing in electrolytes: effect of neutral clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the problem of the vapor-liquid phase transition in the restricted primitive model (RPM) using Wertheim's statistical associating fluid theory to capture the effects of ion pairing which dominate the low-temperature vapor phase. For this we employ a reference system in which ion-pairing is suppressed by a judicious modification of the interaction between unlike charges from 1/r to erf(kappa r)/r, where kappa is a state-dependent parameter chosen so that the Helmholtz free energy A is at a null point (dA/d(kappa) = 0). Unlike the original RPM, this reference fluid admits real solutions to the hypernetted-chain (HNC) closure of the Ornstein-Zernike equations over a wide range of densities and temperatures. In the present study, we go beyond previous work [M. Li, Ph.D. thesis, University of Manchester (2011)] to allow for isodesmic assembly of ion pairs into neutral clusters. We find this has the potential to improve significantly the agreement with the Monte-Carlo results for the RPM vapor phase boundary. We can also match recent results on anomalous underscreening in the RPM [H\"artel et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 108202 (2023)] assuming that only the free ions contribute to the screening length.</description>

      <title>Mastering energy landscapes via liquid liquid phase separation to program active supramolecular coassembly from the nano to macro scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The energy landscape dictates pathways and outcomes in supramolecular selfassembly, yet harnessing it from the nano to the macro scales remains a major challenge. Here, we demonstrate liquid liquid phase separation (LLPS) as a powerful tool to navigate and engineer the energy landscapes of coassembly systems comprising disordered proteins and peptides. We quantitatively map the energy barriers and transition states governing structural transitions, enabling predictive on off control of assembly and hierarchical order from nano to macro scales. By integrating supramolecular biofabrication, we achieve spatially organized architectures with life like non equilibrium behaviour. Crucially, assembly stability and scalable selfsorting are shown to depend on accessing minimum energy states, regardless of whether the co assembled structures are disordered or ordered. This work establishes energy landscape mediation via LLPS as a general framework for designing lifelike, hierarchically structured materials.</description>

      <title>Robust and tuneable ion selectivity in vermiculite membranes intercalated with unexchangeable ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Membranes selective to ions of the same charge are increasingly sought for wastewater processing and valuable element recovery. However, while narrow channels are known to be essential, other membrane parameters remain difficult to identify and control. Here we show that Zr$^{4+}$, Sn$^{4+}$, Ir$^{4+}$, and La$^{3+}$ ions intercalated into vermiculite laminate membranes become effectively unexchangeable, creating stable channels, one to two water layers wide, that exhibit robust and tuneable ion selectivity. Ion permeability in these membranes spans five orders of magnitude, following a trend dictated by the ions' Gibbs free energy of hydration. Unexpectedly, different intercalated ions lead to two distinct monovalent ion selectivity sequences, despite producing channels of identical width. The selectivity instead correlates with the membranes' stiffness and the entropy of hydration of the intercalated ions. These results introduce a new ion selectivity mechanism driven by entropic and mechanical effects, beyond classical size and charge exclusion.</description>

      <title>Tuning laser-induced optical breakdown and cavitation through the ionic environment in aqueous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Laser-induced cavitation in liquids originates from optical breakdown processes that depend sensitively on both laser-plasma dynamics and the chemical microenvironment of the solvent. Herein, we experimentally decouple the effects of ionic strength and ion specificity on cavitation inception in aqueous electrolytes spanning neutral, acidic, and alkaline regimes. Using focused nanosecond laser pulses, we show that increasing ionic strength universally lowers the cavitation threshold by enhancing charge screening and seed-electron availability. However, under constant ionic strength, strongly asymmetric behavior emerges: acidic (hydrogen chloride, HCl) solutions inhibit cavitation, whereas alkaline (sodium hydroxide, NaOH) solutions enhance it. This asymmetry arises from hydrated-electron kinetics that depends on the ion specificity. In acidic solutions, hydronium ions act as diffusion-limited scavengers of hydrated electrons, quenching their lifetime and inhibiting avalanche ionization. In contrast, hydroxide ions reduce hydronium availability and extend electron survival, promoting more efficient plasma formation. Despite large discrepancies in breakdown thresholds, electrical conductivity remains nearly constant, demonstrating that microscopic electron chemistry, rather than bulk charge transport, governs cavitation onset. These results establish a mechanism connection between electrolyte chemistry and optical breakdown, showing that ion-specific reaction dynamics fundamentally control laser-induced cavitation in aqueous environments.</description>

      <title>Machine-learning-derived protocols for information-based work extraction from active particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose and analyze a process that extracts useful work from a single active particle maintained at constant temperature in a harmonic potential by measuring the relative sign of the self-propulsion and the confining force and then adjusting the stiffness of the potential. First, we show analytically that useful work can be extracted by stepwise changes of the stiffness. Then, we use a machine learning procedure to find time-dependent stiffness change protocols. We find that these protocols involve discontinuous initial changes of the stiffness opposite to the expected direction resembling the jumps analytically found by Garcia-Millan et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 135, 088301 (2025)] in a different information-based work extraction process. The learned protocols allow to extract significantly larger amounts of useful work. The work extracted exceeds that allowed by the second law for feedback processes, which can be rationalized by the non-equilibrium character of the system considered.</description>

      <title>Revealing Liquid-Gas Transitions with Finite-Size Scaling in Confined Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The application of an external field often renders empirical criteria for identifying liquid-gas phase transitions ambiguous. Here, we demonstrate that the finite-size scaling of the density profile provides a definitive criterion to distinguish liquid-gas coexistence from a single fluid phase in field-confined systems. Our scaling method collapses the density profiles of different system sizes onto a single master curve for a one-phase system, while causing the profiles to intersect at the interface in a two-phase system. We validate this theoretical proposal through experiments and simulations of two model systems: colloidal suspensions under gravity and/or two-dimensional complex plasmas confined by a central potential. Our method is broadly applicable for detecting liquid-gas phase transitions in laboratory systems where external fields are inherent.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nowadays a bit is no longer a mere abstraction but a physical quantity whose manipulation governs both operation of modern technologies and theoretical frontiers of fundamental science. In this work we propose a setup in which the memory time can be utilized to control the generation and storage of binary information. In particular, we consider a nonequilibrium Brownian particle immersed in a viscoelastic environment and dwelling in a spatially periodic potential. We interpret its average velocity as a bit and show that depending on the memory time characterizing the viscoelastic bath the particle can be either in one of two stable states representing the bit values or in a chaotic state in which the information is erased and a new bit can be generated. We analyze randomness of the so obtained bit sequence and assess the stability of the produced values.

      <title>Genetic interfaces at the frontier of expanding microbial colonies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the genetic interfaces between two species of an expanding colony that consists of individual microorganisms that reproduce and undergo diffusion, both at the frontier and in the interior. Within the bulk of the colony, the genetic interface is controlled in a simple way via interspecies interactions. However, at the frontier of the colony, the genetic interface width saturates at finite values for long times, both for neutral strains and interspecies interactions such as antagonism. This finite width arises from geometric effects: genetic interfaces drift toward local minima at an undulating colony frontier, where a focusing mechanism induced by curvature impedes diffusive mixing. Numerical simulations support a logarithmic dependence of the genetic interface width on the strength of the number fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Yielding in amorphous solids reveals an age-dependent intrinsic lengthscale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.04917v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding how amorphous solids yield under shear is central to predicting material failure, yet prescribing reliable local yielding criteria remains a fundamental challenge. Here, through a mesoscale analysis of localized yielding, we reveal an intrinsic length scale (\zeta) that governs local failure, and demonstrate that \zeta grows with the age of the system. The age dependence shows up not only in the features of the distribution of local yield stress but also in the pseudogap exponent \theta, which provides a measure of marginal stability of the amorphous solids. These insights are made possible by a new method, termed the soft matrix approach, that allows local regions of an amorphous solid to yield within a minimally constrained, elastically coupled environment. By overcoming key limitations of earlier techniques, our approach provides a robust platform for probing failure mechanisms, particularly in soft disordered materials and paves the way for improved elastoplastic modeling of disordered solids.</description>

      <title>Stabilization of active tissue deformation by a dynamic signaling gradient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15774v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A key process during animal morphogenesis is oriented tissue deformation, which is often driven by internally generated active stresses. Yet, such active oriented materials are prone to well-known instabilities, raising the question of how oriented tissue deformation can be robust during morphogenesis. Here we study under which conditions active oriented deformation can be stabilized by the concentration pattern of a signaling molecule, which is secreted by a localized source region, diffuses across the tissue, and degrades. Consistent with earlier results, we find that oriented tissue deformation is always unstable in the gradient-contractile case, i.e. when active stresses act to contract the tissue along the direction of the signaling gradient, and we now show that this is true even in the limit of large diffusion. However, active deformation can be stabilized in the gradient-extensile case, i.e. when active stresses act to extend the tissue along the direction of the signaling gradient. Specifically, we show that gradient-extensile systems can be stable when the tissue is already elongated in the direction of the gradient. We moreover point out the existence of a formerly unknown, additional instability of the tissue shape change. This instability results from the interplay of active tissue shear and signal diffusion, and it indicates that some additional feedback mechanism may be required to control the target tissue shape. Taken together, our theoretical results provide quantitative criteria for robust active tissue deformation, and explain the lack of gradient-contractile systems in the biological literature, suggesting that the active matter instability acts as an evolutionary selection criterion.</description>

      <title>Simulation of the thermocapillary assembly of a colloidal cluster during the evaporation of a liquid film in an unevenly heated cell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03991v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The control of the thermocapillary assembly of colloidal particle clusters is important for a variety of applications, including the creation of photonic crystals for microelectronics and optoelectronics, membrane formation for biotechnology, and surface cleaning for laboratory-on-chip devices. It is important to understand the main mechanisms that influence the formation of such clusters. This article considers a two-dimensional mathematical model describing the transfer of particles by a thermocapillary flow in an unevenly heated cell during the evaporation of a liquid. This gave us the opportunity to study one of the main processes that triggers the formation of a particle cluster. Whether the particle will move with the flow or stop at the heater, becoming the basis for the cluster, is determined by the ratio between gravity and the drag force. The results of numerical calculations show that, for small particle concentrations, their fraction entering the cluster decreases as the volumetric heat flux density $Q$ increases. The reason for this is an increase in the thermocapillary flow with an increase in the volumetric heat flux $Q$. It reduces the probability of particles entering the cluster.</description>

      <title>Active Hydrodynamic Theory of Euchromatin and Heterochromatin</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20964v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The genome contains genetic information essential for cell's life. The genome's spatial organization inside the cell nucleus is critical for its proper function including gene regulation. The two major genomic compartments -- euchromatin and heterochromatin -- contain largely transcriptionally active and silenced genes, respectively, and exhibit distinct dynamics. In this work, we present a hydrodynamic framework that describes the large-scale behavior of euchromatin and heterochromatin, and accounts for the interplay of mechanical forces, active processes, and nuclear confinement. Our model shows contractile stresses from cross-linking proteins lead to the formation of heterochromatin droplets via mechanically driven phase separation. These droplets grow, coalesce, and in nuclear confinement, wet the boundary. Active processes, such as gene transcription in euchromatin, introduce non-equilibrium fluctuations that drive long-range, coherent motions of chromatin as well as the nucleoplasm, and thus alter the genome's spatial organization. These fluctuations also indirectly deform heterochromatin droplets, by continuously changing their shape. Taken together, our findings reveal how active forces, mechanical stresses and hydrodynamic flows contribute to the genome's organization at large scales and provide a physical framework for understanding chromatin organization and dynamics in live cells.</description>

      <title>Dual Cross-Linked Hydrogels: Linear Rheology and Fractional Calculus Modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02219v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hydrogels are increasingly recognized as a versatile platform for applications spanning from tissue engineering to soft robotics or flexible electronics. Recent efforts have focused on enhancing and tailoring their mechanical performance to meet application-specific demands. However, the intricate viscoelastic response of hydrogels remains challenging to capture using conventional phenomenological models. In this study, we prepared a series of tough dual crosslinked hydrogels -- poly(methacrylamide-co-acrylic acid)-Fe3+ and systematically tuned their mechanical properties by leveraging the salting-out effect. The viscoelastic behavior of the hydrogels was characterized under shear deformations, and a four-parameter Fractional Maxwell Model (FMM) was constructed to quantitatively describe oscillatory shear, creep, and stress relaxation responses. The influence of salt concentration on each FMM parameter was analyzed and correlated with bulk mechanical performance. This framework provides a first step toward capturing the complex viscoelastic nature of the advanced hydrogels and lays the foundation for developing more comprehensive nonlinear constitutive models.</description>

      <title>Digitization Can Stall Swarm Transport: Commensurability Locking in Quantized-Sensing Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17117v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a minimal model for autonomous robotic swarms in one- and higher-dimensional spaces, where identical, field-driven agents interact pairwise to self-organize spacing and independently follow local gradients sensed through quantized digital sensors. We show that the collective response of a multi-agent train amplifies sensitivity to weak gradients beyond what is achievable by a single agent. We discover a fractional transport phenomenon in which, under a uniform gradient, collective motion freezes abruptly whenever the ratio of intra-agent sensor separation to inter-agent spacing satisfies a number-theoretic commensurability condition. This commensurability locking persists even as the number of agents tends to infinity. We find that this condition is exactly solvable on the rationals -- a dense subset of real numbers -- providing analytic, testable predictions for when transport stalls. Our findings establish a surprising bridge between number theory and emergent transport in swarm robotics, informing design principles with implications for collective migration, analog computation, and even the exploration of number-theoretic structure via physical experimentation.</description>

      <title>Universal framework for anisotropic particles with resonance laws and splitting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03378v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nanophotonics enables unprecedented control over light-matter interactions, yet conventional isotropic materials limit the spectral range and richness of mode responses in subwavelength structures. Anisotropic subwavelength particles -- ubiquitous in natural and engineered systems -- offer new degrees of freedom that couple geometry and material properties, unlocking previously inaccessible spectral regions. Here, we establish a universal quasistatic framework describing the eigenmodes and resonance conditions of uniaxial and biaxial nanoparticles. Closed-form solutions reveal axial-permittivity sum rules and a fundamental material-anisotropy-induced symmetry breaking, manifesting as resonance splitting and novel radiation patterns. Generalizing the theory to ellipsoids provides geometric tunability of the multispectral response, while analytic predictions of quality factors elucidate how anisotropy governs mode localization and energy loss. Full-wave simulations of h-BN and $\alpha$-MoO$_3$ nanoparticles confirm the theory and highlight its predictive power. This framework unifies the understanding of anisotropic nanostructures across optics, thermal transport, and magnetism, opening pathways to a new generation of photonic devices with tunable multispectral response and controlled emission patterns, including directional detectors and spectrally selective mid infrared sensors.</description>

      <title>Integer Lattice Gas with a sampling collision operator for the fluctuating Navier-Stokes Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18659v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper constitutes a step in the direction of developing integer lattice gas methods as an attractive alternative to lattice Boltzmann methods. Here we show that to Boltzmann limit the one dimensional Blommel integer lattice gas is very close to entropic lattice Boltzmann. More interestingly the integer lattice gas retains additional correlations that prevent the existence of a well defined Boltzmann limit. In the analysis of the decaying sine wave we will see that in some situations the bulk viscosity can crucially depend on such correlations beyond the Boltzmann limit. A sampling collision operator, introduced here, can speed up the execution time to make the algorithm obtain comparable computational efficiency to entropic lattice Boltzmann methods.</description>

      <title>General Two-Parameter Model of Alpha-Relaxation in Glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17490v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the vicinity of the glass transition, the characteristic relaxation time (e.g., the alpha-relaxation time in dielectric spectroscopy) of a glass-former exhibits a strongly super-Arrhenius temperature dependence, as compared to the classical Arrhenius behavior at high temperatures. A comprehensive description of both regions thus requires five parameters. Here, we demonstrate that many glass-formers exhibit a universal scaling, with only two material-specific parameters setting the timescale and the temperature scale; the other three being universal constants. Furthermore, we show that the master curve can be described by the recently developed two-state, two-(time) scale (TS2) theory (Soft Matter 2020, 16, 810) and regress the universal TS2 parameters. We also show the connection between the TS2 model and the Hall-Wolynes elastic relaxation theory.</description>
