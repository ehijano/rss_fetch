      <title>Benchmarking Hadronic Models in Geant4 for Detector Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The construction of modern detectors used in high-energy physics experiments is typically guided by modeling with the Geant4 toolkit to evaluate detector performance in terms of geometrical acceptance and detection efficiency. Several hadronic models are available in Geant4 for modeling nuclear reactions induced by fast nucleons. It is shown that they result in different multiplicity and charge distributions of secondary particles and nuclear fragments. The impact of these differences on modeling the Highly-Granular Neutron Detector (HGND) prototype for the BM@N experiment at Nuclotron-based Ion Collider fAcility (NICA) is evaluated.</description>

      <title>Multispectral UV Imaging on Capacitive CMOS Arrays Enabled by Solution-Processed Metal-Oxide Nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultraviolet (UV) imagers are important for a variety of applications, such as quality inspection in the semiconductor industry, forensics and food quality inspection, but are often costly because they require dedicated semiconductor process flows. Here, an imaging chip is introduced that has been fabricated using standard 40 nm complementary metal-oxidesemiconductor (CMOS) technology. Instead of using a conventional charge-based photodetection principle, the imager uses a capacitive operation principle where UV-light causes capacitance changes via the photodielectric effect in a functionalization layer, which are measured by the underlying CMOS circuitry. This spin-coated or inkjet-printed functionalization layer consists of solution-processed, wide-bandgap, semiconducting metaloxide nanoparticles, and facilitates multispectral imaging. The sensors exhibit low noiseequivalent powers (17-138 fW Hz^-1/2) across the UV bands. Unlike conventional silicon CMOS imagers, the present capacitive-CMOS platform is inherently visible-blind, providing selective UV detection. This work positions late-functionalized capacitive-CMOS arrays as a route toward reducing the cost of UV imagers, which can lead to their more widespread implementation in consumer and low-volume application-specific products.</description>

      <title>Terrestrial Test of Shapiro Time Delay: Forth test of Einstein General Theory of Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Shapiro time delay is one of the four classical tests of Einstein general theory of relativity and is commonly interpreted as a constrain on the parametrized post Newtonian (PPN) parameter gamma, which is exactly unity in general relativity. To date all measurement of the Shapiro time delay have been confined to astrophysical and solar system observations, yielding constrains on the PPN parameter gamma at the 10-5 level. In this work, we propose a fiber based Sagnac interferometer for precision terrestrial measurements of the Shapiro time delay, enabling a laboratory scale determination of gamma with an intrinsic sensitivity approaching 10-9. This approach provides an independent test of general relativity in a previously unexplored regime.</description>

      <title>Fisher-Information-Driven Adaptive Acquisition for Photon-Efficient FLIM: A Dual-Implementation Framework for TCSPC and Programmable Time-Gating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a Fisher-information (FI) framework for photon-efficient fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) that treats temporal sampling as a controllable design variable under a fixed photon (dose) budget. Starting from a Poisson photon-counting model for bi-exponential fluorescence decays convolved with a finite instrument response function (IRF) and including additive background, we derive FI for both time-binned TCSPC histograms and programmable time-gated acquisitions. To ensure robustness when nuisance parameters such as IRF width, temporal offset, and background level are uncertain, we compute an effective FI using a Schur-complement marginalization and select hardware-feasible temporal designs by maximizing D-optimal criteria over candidate libraries. Across instrument-agnostic simulations spanning IRF broadening and increasing background fractions, FI-driven temporal designs consistently improve photon efficiency relative to uniform sampling, while nuisance-aware planning yields more stable gains under mismatch than naive optimization. Monte Carlo studies with maximum-likelihood estimation confirm that higher effective FI translates into reduced estimator variance and improved parametric map quality at fixed photon budgets. Finally, we map the same FI core to two practical deployment pathways: adaptive re-binning for TCSPC FLIM and adaptive gate placement/width selection for time-gated FLIM, enabling information-theoretic acquisition without hardware modification.</description>

      <title>Towards a temperature-insensitive composite diamond clock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Frequency references based on solid state spins promise simplicity, compactness, robustness, multifunctionality, ease of integration, and high densities of emitters. Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are a natural candidate, but the electronic zero-field splitting exhibits a large fractional temperature dependence, which has precluded its use as a stable clock transition. Here we show that this limitation can be overcome by forming a composite frequency reference that combines measurements of the electronic splitting D with the nuclear quadrupole splitting of the $^{14}$N nuclear spin intrinsic to the NV center. We further benchmark this composite approach against alternative strategies for mitigating temperature sensitivity. By implementing a specially designed pulse sequence with an eight-phase control scheme that suppresses pulse imperfections, we interleave measurements of D and Q in a high-density NV ensemble and demonstrate a temperature-compensated composite frequency reference. The stability of this composite diamond clock is characterized over a 10-day period at room temperature through a comparison to a Rb vapor-cell clock, yielding a fractional instability below $5 \times 10^{-9}$ for an averaging time of $\tau = 200$ s and below $1 \times 10^{-8}$ at $\tau = 2 \times 10^5$ s, corresponding to measured improvements by a factor of 4 and 200, respectively, over a clock based purely on the single frequency D for the same periods. By characterizing the residual sensitivity to magnetic fields, optical power, and radio-frequency drive amplitudes, we find that temperature is no longer the dominant source of instability. These results establish complementary electron- and nuclear-spin transitions in diamond as a viable route to thermally robust frequency metrology, providing a pathway toward compact, multifunctional solid-state clocks and quantum sensors.</description>

      <title>Distributed network of smartphone sensors: a new tool for scientific field measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04886v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Smartphones sensors are now commonly used by a worldwide audience thanks to their availability, high connectivity, and versatility. Here, we present a methodology to use a collection of smartphones, namely a fleet, as a distributed network of time-synchronized mechanical sensors. We first present the mechanical tests we develop to evaluate the smartphone sensor accuracy. We then describe how to use efficiently a distributed network of smartphones as autonomous sensors. We use a combination of an Android application hosted on each phone (Gobannos), and a server application (Phonefleet) on a controlling host to perform the tasks in parallel remotely. We implement in particular a time synchronization protocol based on UDP communication. We achieved an accuracy of the smartphone clock synchronisation of 60 microseconds. Using two test cases in realistic outdoor conditions, we eventually prove the reliability of a smartphone fleet to measure mechanical wave measurements in field conditions.</description>
