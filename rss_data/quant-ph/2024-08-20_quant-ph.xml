      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimization of quantum circuits for a given problem is very important in order to achieve faster calculations as well as reduce errors due to noise. Optimization has to be achieved while ensuring correctness at all times. In this survey paper, recent advancements in quantum circuit optimization are explored. Both hardware independent as well as hardware dependent optimization are presented. State-of-the-art methods for optimizing quantum circuits, including analytical algorithms, heuristic algorithms, machine learning-based algorithms, and hybrid quantum-classical algorithms are discussed. Additionally, the advantages and disadvantages of each method and the challenges associated with them are highlighted. Moreover, the potential research opportunities in this field are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Fault-tolerant optical interconnects for neutral-atom arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the use of photonic links to enable large-scale fault-tolerant connectivity of locally error-corrected modules based on neutral atom arrays. Our approach makes use of recent theoretical results showing the robustness of surface codes to boundary noise and combines recent experimental advances in atom array quantum computing with logical qubits with optical quantum networking techniques. We find the conditions for fault-tolerance can be achieved with local two-qubit Rydberg gate and non-local Bell pair errors below 1% and 10%, respectively, without requiring distillation or space-time overheads. Realizing the interconnects with a lens, a single optical cavity, or an array of cavities enables a Bell pair generation rate in the 1-50 MHz range. When directly interfacing logical qubits, this rate translates to error-correction cycles in the 25-2000 kHz range, satisfying all requirements for fault tolerance and in the upper range fast enough for 100 kHz logical clock cycles.</description>

      <title>Quantum paving: When sphere packings meet Gabor frames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the new problems of quantum packing, quantum covering, and quantum paving. These problems arise naturally when considering an algebra of non-commutative operators that is deeply rooted in quantum physics as well as in Gabor analysis. Quantum packing and quantum covering show similarities with energy minimization and the dual problem of polarization. Quantum paving, in turn, aims to simultaneously optimize both quantum packing and quantum covering. Classical sphere packing and covering hint the optimal configurations for our new problems. We present solutions in certain cases, state several conjectures related to quantum paving and discuss some applications.</description>

      <title>Separability criterion for n-particle states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research introduces the concept of the purity number, which represents the number of separable s-particle sub-states within an n-particle state ($s&lt;n$ ). It establishes that, for any , achieving the maximum purity number is both a necessary and sufficient condition for the separability of n-particle pure states, and a necessary condition for the separability of n-particle mixed states. Subsequently, the study delves into the concept of entanglement rate in n-particle pure states. The entanglement rate of an n-particle pure state, in which all entangled sub-states are maximally entangled, can be considered as a measure of entanglement.</description>

      <title>Quantum Game Jam -- Making Games with Quantum Physicists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore Quantum Game Jam (QGJ) as a method for facilitating interdisciplinary collaboration and creating science game prototypes. QGJ was a series of game development events, science game jams, organized five times 2014-2019. In these events game makers and quantum physicists created games about quantum mechanics, games for quantum research and games utilizing quantum computers. QGJ has worked as a platform for multidisciplinary and collaborative exploration and learning: through creating 68 game prototypes throughout the years the participants have networked and learned from each other. In addition to this, at least three prototypes have been taken into further development. In this paper we evaluate how the format of QGJ performed. We discuss both the organizing of the events as well as the utility of the game prototypes. In addition to our observations on the jams, we have evaluated the game submissions of all events (2014-2019) and gathered survey data from the participants of the fifth event (2019).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents and discusses the online version of Quantum Game Jams, events where quantum physics related games are created. It consists of a two-part investigation into online Quantum Game Jams. The first part involves examining three events that took place between 2020 and 2021. The second part provides a detailed account of organising the Global Quantum Game Jam from 2021 to 2022, evaluating its outcomes based on participant feedback and experiences. Additionally, it examines the backgrounds of the participants in the global events of 2021 and 2022. Based on the findings, this paper proposes a set of guidelines for organising future online Quantum Game Jams, which can also be applicable to game jams and science game jams in general</description>

      <title>Spectral response of a nonlinear Jaynes-Cummings model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Jaynes-Cummings quantum optics model allows us to understand the dialogue between light and matter at its most fundamental level, which is crucial for advancements in quantum science and technology. Several generalizations of the model have long been proposed, emphasizing their dynamic behavior but paying less attention to their spectroscopy. Here, we obtain analytical expressions of the time-dependent spectral response of a nonlinear Jaynes-Cummings model based on deformed field operators. We show that the long-time response of the resulting nonlinear cavity field resembles the one experimentally obtained in the strong-dispersive regime of circuit quantum electrodynamics. The spectrum is intrinsically asymmetric with the nonlinear coupling, a signature of the impossibility of getting resonant conditions for finite field excitations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The uncertainty relation reveals the intrinsic difference between the classical world and the quantum world. We investigate the quantum uncertainty relation of quantum channel in qubit systems. Under two general measurement bases, we first derive the quantum uncertainty relation for quantum channels with respect to the relative entropy of coherence. Then we obtain the quantum uncertainty relation for unitary channels with respect to the $l_1$ norm of coherence. Some examples are given in detail.</description>

      <title>Imaginary Hamiltonian variational ansatz for combinatorial optimization problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Obtaining exact solutions to combinatorial optimization problems using classical computing is computationally expensive. The current tenet in the field is that quantum computers can address these problems more efficiently. While promising algorithms require fault-tolerant quantum hardware, variational algorithms have emerged as viable candidates for near-term devices. The success of these algorithms hinges on multiple factors, with the design of the ansatz having the utmost importance. It is known that popular approaches such as quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) and quantum annealing suffer from adiabatic bottlenecks, that lead to either larger circuit depth or evolution time. On the other hand, the evolution time of imaginary time evolution is bounded by the inverse energy gap of the Hamiltonian, which is constant for most non-critical physical systems. In this work, we propose imaginary Hamiltonian variational ansatz ($i$HVA) inspired by quantum imaginary time evolution to solve the MaxCut problem. We introduce a tree arrangement of the parametrized quantum gates, enabling the exact solution of arbitrary tree graphs using the one-round $i$HVA. For randomly generated $D$-regular graphs, we numerically demonstrate that the $i$HVA solves the MaxCut problem with a small constant number of rounds and sublinear depth, outperforming QAOA, which requires rounds increasing with the graph size. Furthermore, our ansatz solves MaxCut exactly for graphs with up to 24 nodes and $D \leq 5$, whereas only approximate solutions can be derived by the classical near-optimal Goemans-Williamson algorithm. We validate our simulated results with hardware experiments on a graph with 63 nodes.</description>

      <title>Quantum encryption design overcomes Shannon's theorem to achieve perfect-secrecy with reusable keys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shannon's perfect-secrecy theorem states that a perfect encryption system that yields zero information to the adversary must be a one-time-pad (OTP) with the keys randomly generated and never reused. However, recently discovered exotic properties of quantum entanglement have motivated us to re-consider Shannon's theorem in the quantum regime. In this work we make a bold attempt to design a quantum encryption method that overcomes Shannon's theorem to achieve perfect-secrecy with reusable keys. The mechanism used is fundamentally quantum, demonstrating subtle but critical differences in how information is processed in quantum versus classical systems.</description>

      <title>Group-invariant estimation of symmetric states generated by noisy quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of quantum state estimation is crucial in the development of quantum technologies. In particular, the use of symmetric quantum states is useful in many relevant applications. In this work, we analyze the task of reconstructing the density matrices of symmetric quantum states generated by a quantum processor. For this purpose, we take advantage of an estimation technique that results to be equivalent to the quantum Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) estimation, and which was recently adapted to quantum states with arbitrary symmetries. The smart use of prior knowledge of the quantum state symmetries allows for a reduction in both, the number of measurements that need to be made on the system, and the size of the computational problem to store and process the data, resulting in a better overall performance of the estimator as well. After performing numerical simulations, we implement some examples of symmetric states in IonQ quantum processors, and estimate them using the proposed technique. The results are in a good agreement with numerical simulations, showing that the proposed method is a good estimator that allows to save both, experimental and computational resources.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically Good Quantum Codes with Transversal Non-Clifford Gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct quantum codes that support transversal $CCZ$ gates over qudits of arbitrary prime power dimension $q$ (including $q=2$) such that the code dimension and distance grow linearly in the block length. The only previously known construction with such linear dimension and distance required a growing alphabet size $q$ (Krishna &amp; Tillich, 2019). Our codes imply protocols for magic state distillation with overhead exponent $\gamma=\log(n/k)/\log(d)\rightarrow 0$ as the block length $n\rightarrow\infty$, where $k$ and $d$ denote the code dimension and distance respectively. It was previously an open question to obtain such a protocol with a contant alphabet size $q$.
  We construct our codes by combining two modular components, namely,
  (i) a transformation from classical codes satisfying certain properties to quantum codes supporting transversal $CCZ$ gates, and
  (ii) a concatenation scheme for reducing the alphabet size of codes supporting transversal $CCZ$ gates. For this scheme we introduce a quantum analogue of multiplication-friendly codes, which provide a way to express multiplication over a field in terms of a subfield.
  We obtain our asymptotically good construction by instantiating (i) with algebraic-geometric codes, and applying a constant number of iterations of (ii). We also give an alternative construction with nearly asymptotically good parameters ($k,d=n/2^{O(\log^*n)}$) by instantiating (i) with Reed-Solomon codes and then performing a superconstant number of iterations of (ii).</description>

      <title>Understanding and mitigating noise in molecular quantum linear response for spectroscopic properties on quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The promise of quantum computing to circumvent the exponential scaling of quantum chemistry has sparked a race to develop chemistry algorithms for quantum architecture. However, most works neglect the quantum-inherent shot noise, let alone the effect of current noisy devices. Here, we present a comprehensive study of quantum linear response (qLR) theory obtaining spectroscopic properties on simulated fault-tolerant quantum computers and present-day near-term quantum hardware. This work introduces novel metrics to analyze and predict the origins of noise in the quantum algorithm, proposes an Ansatz-based error mitigation technique, and highlights the significant impact of Pauli saving in reducing measurement costs and noise. Our hardware results using up to cc-pVTZ basis set serve as proof-of-principle for obtaining absorption spectra on quantum hardware in a general approach with the accuracy of classical multi-configurational methods. Importantly, our results exemplify that substantial improvements in hardware error rates and measurement speed are necessary to lift quantum computational chemistry from proof-of-concept to an actual impact in the field.</description>

      <title>Practical security of twin-field quantum key distribution under wavelength-switching attack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The twin-field class quantum key distribution (TF-class QKD) has experimentally demonstrated the ability to surpass the fundamental rate-distance limit without requiring a quantum repeater, as a revolutional milestone. In TF-class QKD implementation, an optical phase-locked loop (OPLL) structure is commonly employed to generate a reference light with correlated phase, ensuring coherence of optical fields between Alice and Bob. In this configuration, the reference light, typically located in the untrusted station Charlie, solely provides wavelength reference for OPLL and does not participate in quantum-state encoding. However, the reference light may open a door for Eve to enter the source stations that are supposed to be well protected. Here, by identifying vulnerabilities in the OPLL scheme, we propose and demonstrate a wavelength-switching attack on a TF-class QKD system. This attack involves Eve deliberately manipulating the wavelength of the reference light to increase mean photon number of prepared quantum states, while maintaining stable interference between Alice and Bob as required by TF-class QKD protocols. The maximum observed increase in mean photon number is 8.7%, which has been theoretically proven to compromise the security of a TF-class QKD system. Moreover, we have shown that with well calibration of the modulators, the attack can be eliminated. Through this study, we highlight the importance of system calibration in the practical security in TF-class QKD implementation.</description>

      <title>Squeezed Light via Exciton-Phonon Cavity QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Squeezed light is a particularly useful quantum resource, which finds broad applications in quantum information processing, quantum metrology and sensing, and biological measurements. It has been successfully generated in various physical systems. Here we introduce a new mechanism and system to produce squeezed light using an exciton-phonon cavity-QED system. Specifically, we adopt a semiconductor microcavity embedded with a quantum well, which supports both linear and nonlinear interactions among excitons, phonons, and cavity photons. We show that the strong exciton-phonon nonlinear interaction can induce a quadrature-squeezed cavity output field, and reveal an important role of the exciton-photon coupling in engineering the squeezing spectrum and improving the robustness of the squeezing against thermal noise. Our results indicate that room-temperature squeezing of light is possible for materials with high exciton binding energy.</description>

      <title>Proposal to experimentally evaluate the adiabatic condition of quantum annealing in coupled systems of Kerr parametric oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum annealing (QA) is an algorithm to find the ground state of the problem Hamiltonian by using an adiabatic time evolution. An approach to evaluate adiabaticity in the experiment by applying spectroscopic techniques has recently been suggested. However, this method requires temporal oscillation of interaction strength during QA, posing challenges for experimental demonstration. Here, we propose an experimental method for evaluating adiabaticity when performing QA with a parametric oscillator with Kerr nonlinearity (KPO). Importantly, our proposal offers a significant advantage by eliminating the need for temporal oscillation of interactions during QA. We investigate its performance through numerical simulations, and we show the feasibility of our method.</description>

      <title>Error minimization for fidelity estimation of GHZ states with arbitrary noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fidelity estimation is a crucial component for the quality control of entanglement distribution networks. This work studies a scenario in which multiple nodes share noisy Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states. Due to the collapsing nature of quantum measurements, the nodes randomly sample a subset of noisy GHZ states for measurement and then estimate the average fidelity of the unsampled states conditioned on the measurement outcome. By developing a fidelity-preserving diagonalization operation, analyzing the Bloch representation of GHZ states, and maximizing the Fisher information, the proposed estimation protocol achieves the minimum mean squared estimation error in a challenging scenario characterized by arbitrary noise and the absence of prior information. Additionally, this protocol is implementation-friendly as it only uses local Pauli operators according to a predefined sequence. Numerical studies demonstrate that, compared to existing fidelity estimation protocols, the proposed protocol reduces estimation errors in both scenarios involving independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) noise and correlated noise.</description>

      <title>Laser cooling a 1-milligram torsional pendulum to 240 microkelvins</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Milligram-scale mechanical oscillators hold potential for testing fundamental physical phenomena on various fronts, including laboratory-scale effects at the interface of quantum mechanics and gravity. Nevertheless, experimental realizations supporting this potential have thus far been lacking. Here, we present a new level of control over a 1-milligram torsional pendulum, demonstrating laser feedback cooling of its torsional motion from room temperature to 240 microkelvins, establishing the coldest mechanical motion in the microgram-to-kilogram mass window -- a factor of 25 beyond prior art. The developed system shows a unique torque sensing capability, reaching $1.2\times10^{-18}$ N$\cdot$m/$\sqrt{\textrm{Hz}}$ thermal-noise-limited sensitivity -- a factor of 10 below the state of the art for the milligram scale. With readily feasible improvements in the pendulum suspension, a further 100-fold reduction in both achievable temperatures and torque sensitivities is foreseen, pushing towards operation in the quantum regime at such large mass scales.</description>

      <title>Numerical analysis of a superradiance-sideband-assisted laser with a zero frequency pulling and a narrow linewidth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical simulations based on the quantum Langevin equations have been performed for a large number of two-level atoms in a beam interacting with a low-Q cavity with the atomic initial superposition states close to the north pole of the Bloch sphere. When the pump Rabi frequency was modulated at $\Delta_{pa}$ with zero pump-atom detuning for various cavity-atom detunings, we obtained a lasing peak at the atomic resonance and superradiant lasing peaks at $\pm\Delta_{pa}$ simultaneously while the central peak exhibiting a zero frequency pulling coefficient. The linewidth of the central peak was reduced beyond the gain narrowing as the mean number of atoms was increased, resulting in a minimum linewidth as small as a millionth of the atomic or cavity linewdith. A pump carrier detuning caused asymmetric heights for the side superradiant peaks, the height difference of which can be used to lock the pump laser to the atom within the linewidth of the central lasing peak. Our results may lead to development of a new type of ultra-stable active optical clocks for future frequency standards when applied to proper atomic systems.</description>

      <title>Closed-Form Expressions for Two- and Three-Colorable States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph states are a class of multi-partite entangled quantum states, where colorability, a property rooted in their mathematical foundation, has significant implications for quantum information processing. In this study, we investigate the colorability of graph states in qudit systems to simplify their representation and enhance their practical applications. We present closed-form expressions for all two-colorable graph states. Our findings show that the closed-form expression of these states is tightly linked to the graph structure and the distribution of particles in red ($n_R$) and blue ($n_B$). Additionally, we explore a broad family of three-colorable graph states constructed from two two-colorable graph states. The closed-form expression for these states is in the form of one two-colorable state tensor product with the graph basis formed from another two-colorable state. Our approach systematically reduces the number of terms required to represent these states. Furthermore, we demonstrate that many well-known mathematical graphs, including friendship graphs, fit within our formalism. Finally, we discuss the LU/SLOCC (Local Unitary/Stochastic Local Operation and Classical Communication) equivalence between two- and three-colorable graph states. Our findings have broad implications for characterizing the LU/SLOCC equivalence of graph state classes and pave the way for future research.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Quantum Memory Lifetime with Measurement-Free Local Error Correction and Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable quantum computation requires systematic identification and correction of errors that occur and accumulate in quantum hardware. To diagnose and correct such errors, standard quantum error-correcting protocols utilize $\textit{global}$ error information across the system obtained by mid-circuit readout of ancillary qubits. We investigate circuit-level error-correcting protocols that are measurement-free and based on $\textit{local}$ error information. Such a local error correction (LEC) circuit consists of faulty multi-qubit gates to perform both syndrome extraction and ancilla-controlled error removal. We develop and implement a reinforcement learning framework that takes a fixed set of faulty gates as inputs and outputs an optimized LEC circuit. To evaluate this approach, we quantitatively characterize an extension of logical qubit lifetime by a noisy LEC circuit. For the 2D classical Ising model and 4D toric code, our optimized LEC circuit performs better at extending a memory lifetime compared to a conventional LEC circuit based on Toom's rule in a sub-threshold gate error regime. We further show that such circuits can be used to reduce the rate of mid-circuit readouts to preserve a 2D toric code memory. Finally, we discuss the application of the LEC protocol on dissipative preparation of quantum states with topological phases.</description>

      <title>Parameter Setting Heuristics Make the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm Suitable for the Early Fault-Tolerant Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is one of the most promising quantum heuristics for combinatorial optimization. While QAOA has been shown to perform well on small-scale instances and to provide an asymptotic speedup over state-of-the-art classical algorithms for some problems, fault-tolerance is understood to be required to realize this speedup in practice. The low resource requirements of QAOA make it particularly suitable to benchmark on early fault-tolerant quantum computing (EFTQC) hardware. However, the performance of QAOA depends crucially on the choice of the free parameters in the circuit. The task of setting these parameters is complicated in the EFTQC era by the large overheads, which preclude extensive classical optimization. In this paper, we summarize recent advances in parameter setting in QAOA and show that these advancements make EFTQC experiments with QAOA practically viable.</description>

      <title>Security Concerns in Quantum Machine Learning as a Service</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) is a category of algorithms that employ variational quantum circuits (VQCs) to tackle machine learning tasks. Recent discoveries have shown that QML models can effectively generalize from limited training data samples. This capability has sparked increased interest in deploying these models to address practical, real-world challenges, resulting in the emergence of Quantum Machine Learning as a Service (QMLaaS). QMLaaS represents a hybrid model that utilizes both classical and quantum computing resources. Classical computers play a crucial role in this setup, handling initial pre-processing and subsequent post-processing of data to compensate for the current limitations of quantum hardware. Since this is a new area, very little work exists to paint the whole picture of QMLaaS in the context of known security threats in the domain of classical and quantum machine learning. This SoK paper is aimed to bridge this gap by outlining the complete QMLaaS workflow, which encompasses both the training and inference phases and highlighting significant security concerns involving untrusted classical or quantum providers. QML models contain several sensitive assets, such as the model architecture, training/testing data, encoding techniques, and trained parameters. Unauthorized access to these components could compromise the model's integrity and lead to intellectual property (IP) theft. We pinpoint the critical security issues that must be considered to pave the way for a secure QMLaaS deployment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the implications of relaxing the measurement independence assumption in Bell's theorem by introducing a new class of local deterministic models that account for both particle preparation and measurement settings. Our model reproduces the quantum mechanical predictions under the assumption of relaxed measurement independence, demonstrating that the statistical independence of measurement settings does not necessarily preclude underlying correlations. Our findings highlight the nuanced relationship between local determinism and quantum mechanics, offering new insights into the nature of quantum correlations and hidden variables.</description>

      <title>Coherent expansion of the motional state of a massive nanoparticle beyond its linear dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum mechanics predicts that massive particles exhibit wave-like behavior. Matterwave interferometry has been able to validate such predictions through ground-breaking experiments involving microscopic systems like atoms and molecules. The wavefunction of such systems coherently extends over a distance much larger than their size, an achievement that is incredibly challenging for massive and more complex objects. Yet, reaching similar level of coherent diffusion will enable tests of fundamental physics at the genuinely macroscopic scale, as well as the development of quantum sensing apparata of great sensitivity. We report on experimentally achieving an unprecedented degree of position diffusion in a massive levitated optomechanical system through frequency modulation of the trapping potential. By starting with a pre-cooled state of motion and employing a train of sudden pulses yet of mild modulation depth, we surpass previously attained values of position diffusion in this class of systems to reach diffusion lengths that exceed the physical dimensions of the trapped nanoparticle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unitary transformations play a fundamental role in many-body physics, and except for special cases, they are not expressible in closed form. We present closed-form expressions for unitary transformations generated by a single fermionic operator for Hermitian and anti-Hermitian generators. We demonstrate the usefulness of these expressions in formal analyses of unitary transformations and numerical applications involving block-diagonalization and Heisenberg dynamics. This work paves the way for new analytical treatments of unitary transformations and numerical many-body methods for fermions.</description>

      <title>On the non-Markovian quantum control dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study both open-loop control and closed-loop measurement feedback control of non-Markovian quantum dynamics resulting from the interaction between a quantum system and its environment. We use the widely studied cavity quantum electrodynamics (cavity-QED) system as an example, where an atom interacts with the environment composed of a collection of oscillators. In this scenario, the stochastic interactions between the atom and the environment can introduce non-Markovian characteristics into the evolution of quantum states, differing from the conventional Markovian dynamics observed in open quantum systems. As a result, the atom's decay rate to the environment varies with time and can be described by nonlinear equations. The solutions to these nonlinear equations can be analyzed in terms of the stability of a nonlinear control system. Consequently, the evolution of quantum state amplitudes follows linear time-varying equations as a result of the non-Markovian quantum transient process. Additionally, by using measurement feedback through homodyne detection of the cavity output, we can modulate the steady atomic and photonic states in the non-Markovian process. When multiple coupled cavity-QED systems are involved, measurement-based feedback control can influence the dynamics of high-dimensional quantum states, as well as the resulting stable and unstable subspaces.</description>

      <title>Character Complexity: A Novel Measure for Quantum Circuit Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09641v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of quantum computing, quantifying circuit complexity remains a critical challenge. This paper introduces Character Complexity, a novel measure that bridges Group-theoretic concepts with practical quantum computing concerns. By leveraging tools from representation theory, I prove several key properties of character complexity and establish a surprising connection to the classical simulability of quantum circuits. This new measure offers a fresh perspective on the complexity landscape of quantum algorithms, potentially reshaping our understanding of quantum-classical computational boundaries. I present innovative visualization methods for character complexity, providing intuitive insights into the structure of quantum circuits. The empirical results reveal intriguing scaling behaviors with respect to qubit and gate counts, opening new avenues for quantum algorithm design and optimization. This work not only contributes to the theoretical foundations of quantum complexity but also offers practical tools for the quantum computing community. As quantum hardware continues to advance, character complexity could play a crucial role in developing more efficient quantum algorithms and in exploring the fundamental limits of quantum computation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that a quantum spin system has an exact free-parafermion solution if its frustration graph is an oriented indifference graph. Further, we show that if the frustration graph of a model can be dipath oriented via switching operations, then the model is integrable in the sense that there is a family of commuting independent set charges. Additionally, we establish an efficient algorithm for deciding whether this is possible. Our characterisation extends that given for free-fermion solvability. Finally, we apply our results to solve three qudit spin models.</description>

Abstract: We apply the Wigner-Yanase skew information, as a quantum information quantifier of atomic non-classicality in the dynamics generated by the anti-Jaynes-Cummings (AJC) Hamiltonian when a two-level atom in an initial atomic ground state, couples to a single mode of squeezed coherent light. We investigate the effect of variation of squeeze parameter, field intensity, and coupling strength parameter, on the dynamics of the Wigner-Yanase skew information. We observe that time-evolution of the Wigner-Yanase skew information records mixed state values for all variations of squeeze parameter, field intensity and coupling strength parameter, congruent with squeezing effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09783v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The comprehension of quantum phase transitions (QPTs) is considered as a critical foothold in the field of many-body physics. Developing protocols to effectively identify and understand QPTs thus represents a key but challenging task for present quantum simulation experiments. Here, we establish a dynamical quench-interferometric framework to probe a zero-temperature QPT, which utilizes the evolved state by quenching the QPT Hamiltonian as input of a unitary interferometer. The metrological capability quantified by the quantum Fisher information captivatingly shows an unique peak in the vicinity of the quantum critical point, allowing us to probe the QPT without cooling the system to its ground state. We show that the probing can be implemented by extracting quantum fluctuations of the interferometric generator as well as parameter estimation uncertainty of the interferometric phase, and subsequently allows identifying the boundary of the phase diagram. Our results establish an important link between QPTs and quantum metrology, and enrich the toolbox of studying non-equilibrium many-body physics in current quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Sustainability of distribution of entanglement in tripartite systems under dephasing environment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Preserving multipartite entanglement amidst decoherence poses a pivotal challenge in quantum information processing. Also the measurement of multipartite entanglement in mixed states amid decoherence presents a formidable task. Employing reservoir memory offers a means to attenuate the decoherence dynamics impacting multipartite entanglement, slowing its degradation. In this work, we investigate the distribution of entanglement in tripartite systems for both pure and mixed states under a structured dephasing environment at finite temperature under both Markovian and Non-Markovian dynamics. Here, we consider situation where the three qubits in a common reservoir and also the situation where each qubit is in a local bosonic reservoir. We have also shown that the robustness of a quantum system to decoherence depends on the distribution of entanglement and its interaction with the different configurations of the bath. When each qubit has its own local environment, the system exhibits different dynamics compared to when all three qubits share a common environment. Furthermore, in the presence of the reservoir memory, the sustainability of distribution of entanglement in a tripartite system under dephasing dynamics is significantly enhanced.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most general dynamics of an open quantum system is commonly represented by a quantum channel, which is a completely positive trace-preserving map (CPTP or Kraus map). Well-known are the representations of quantum channels by Choi matrices and by Kraus operator-sum representation (OSR). As was shown before, one can use Kraus OSR to parameterize quantum channels by points of a suitable quotient under the action of the unitary group of some complex Stiefel manifold. In this work, we establish a continuity relation (homeomorphism) between the topological space of quantum channels and the quotient of the complex Stiefel manifold. Then the metric on the set of quantum channels induced by the Riemannian metric on the Stiefel manifold is defined. The established relation can be applied to various quantum optimization problems. As an example, we apply it to the analysis of extrema points for a wide variety of quantum control objective functionals defined on the complex Stiefel manifolds, including mean value, generation of quantum gates, thermodynamic quantities involving entropy, etc.</description>

      <title>Unconventional and robust light-matter interactions based on the non-Hermitian skin effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lattice models featuring the non-Hermitian skin effect have attracted rapidly growing interest due to the nontrivial topology associated with their complex energy spectra. Such non-Hermitian lattices are promising paradigms for engineering exotic light-matter interactions which benefit from the intrinsic chirality and unconventional (non-Bloch) band theory. Here we study a series of unconventional light-matter interactions between quantum emitters and the prototypical Hatano--Nelson model as well as an extended lattice model dubbed the bosonic Kitaev chain. We focus on the robustness of the dynamics to various imperfections and elucidate the underlying mechanisms. We consider both small emitters, which interact with the lattice at single sites, and giant emitters coupling at multiple sites. The latter exhibit an exclusive amplification mechanism, which we find enables decoherence-free dynamics even in the presence of extra dissipation in the system. The protection from dissipation arises from a cooperation of the non-Hermiticity and the self-interference effect, and is therefore lacking for small emitters. These results not only provides a deeper insight into the interplay of non-Hermiticity and various interference effects, but also have potential applications in engineering exotic spin Hamiltonians and quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Enhancing quantum phase synchronization through squeezed-reservoir engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the enhancement of quantum phase synchronization in a two-level system (TLS) coupled to a squeezed reservoir. Our study reveals that the squeezed reservoir induces a stable limit cycle in the TLS, enhancing the quantum phase synchronization. We utilize the Husimi $Q$-function to describe the phase portrait of the driven TLS, and the $S$-function to quantitatively illustrate the effects of signal strength and detuning on phase synchronization. Remarkably, we demonstrate that the squeezed reservoir imparts its squeezing characteristics to the TLS, leading to a more localized and pronounced synchronization. Additionally, we observe typical features of the Arnold tongue in the synchronization regions. The experimental feasibility of our findings is discussed in the context of a circuit QED system, suggesting that squeezed-reservoir engineering is an effective approach for achieving quantum phase synchronization.</description>

      <title>Space-time correlations in monitored kinetically constrained discrete-time quantum dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State-of-the-art quantum simulators permit local temporal control of interactions and midcircuit readout. These capabilities open the way towards the exploration of intriguing nonequilibrium phenomena. We illustrate this with a kinetically constrained many-body quantum system that has a natural implementation on Rydberg quantum simulators. The evolution proceeds in discrete time and is generated by repeatedly entangling the system with an auxiliary environment that is monitored and reset after each time-step. Despite featuring an uncorrelated infinite-temperature average stationary state, the dynamics displays coexistence of fast and slow space-time regions in stochastic realizations of the system state. The time-record of measurement outcomes on the environment serves as natural probe for such dynamical heterogeneity, which we characterize using tools from large deviation theory. Our work establishes the large deviation framework for discrete-time open quantum many-body systems as a means to characterize complex dynamics and collective phenomena in quantum processors and simulators.</description>

      <title>Realization of Landau-Zener Rabi Oscillations on optical lattice clock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Manipulating quantum states is at the heart of quantum information processing and quantum metrology. Landau-Zener Rabi oscillation (LZRO), which arises from a quantum two-level system swept repeatedly across the avoided crossing point in the time domain, has been suggested for widespread use in manipulating quantum states. Cold atom is one of the most prominent platforms for quantum computing and precision measurement. However, LZRO has never been observed in cold atoms due to its stringent requirements. By compensating for the linear drift of the clock laser and optimizing experimental parameters, we successfully measured LZRO on the strontium atomic optical clock platform under both fast and slow passage limits within $4$ to $6$ driving periods. Compared to previous results on other platforms, the duration of the plateau is $10^4$ times longer in the optical lattice clock. The experimental data also suggest that destructive Landau-Zener interference can effectively suppress dephasing effects in the optical lattice clock, paving the way for manipulating quantum states against various environmental effects in cold atomic systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dawning of the quantum age makes quantum key distribution (QKD) an indispensable necessity for our global communication infrastructure. The realization of an all-silicon QKD transmitter supplied by a light source that is native to silicon integration platforms is seen as a disruptive step towards the pervasive introduction of QKD in new applications, which up to now have not been explored due to the missing credentials of quantum optics as a cost-effective and highly miniaturized technology.</description>

      <title>The curse of random quantum data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning, which involves running machine learning algorithms on quantum devices, may be one of the most significant flagship applications for these devices. Unlike its classical counterparts, the role of data in quantum machine learning has not been fully understood. In this work, we quantify the performances of quantum machine learning in the landscape of quantum data. Provided that the encoding of quantum data is sufficiently random, the performance, we find that the training efficiency and generalization capabilities in quantum machine learning will be exponentially suppressed with the increase in the number of qubits, which we call "the curse of random quantum data". Our findings apply to both the quantum kernel method and the large-width limit of quantum neural networks. Conversely, we highlight that through meticulous design of quantum datasets, it is possible to avoid these curses, thereby achieving efficient convergence and robust generalization. Our conclusions are corroborated by extensive numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Relaxing towards generalized one-body Boltzmann states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Isolated quantum systems follow the reversible unitary evolution; if we focus on the dynamics of local states and observables, they exhibit the irreversible relaxation behaviors. Here we study the local relaxation process in an isolated chain consisting of \emph{N} three level systems. Though the entropy of the full many body state keeps a constant, it turns out the total correlation of this system approximately exhibits a monotonically increasing behavior. More importantly, a variation analysis shows that, the total correlation entropy would achieve its theoretical maximum when each site stays in a generalized one-body Boltzmann state, which is not solely determined by the energy but also depends on the spin value of each onsite level. It turns out such a theoretical correlation maximum is highly coincident with the result obtained from the exact time dependent evolution. In this sense, the total correlation entropy well serves as an indicator for the dynamical irreversibility of the nonequilibrium relaxation in this isolated system.</description>

      <title>Quantum Monte Carlo and Stabilizer States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Quantum-Monte-Carlo technique known as the Stochastic Series Expansion (SSE) relies on a crucial no-branching condition: the SSE sampling is carried out in the computational basis, and the no-branching assumption ensures that superpositions of basis-states do not appear when operators are applied. Without this proviso, the number of complex amplitudes would grow exponentially with the number of qubits and would eventually overwhelm the memory and processing power of a classical computer. However, the action of Clifford group elements on stabilizer states can be very efficiently described without resorting to an amplitude description. We explore how stabilizer states allow an extension of the SSE technique, and we give an example of a toy model that can be studied in this way.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a quantum memory based on the pre-created long-lived macroscopic quantum coherence. It is shown that the proposed approach provides new physical properties and methods for retrieval of the signal light fields and improvement of the basic parameters of quantum memory. We demonstrate how the pre-created coherence can enable quantum storage with low quantum noise, programmable and on demand retrieval of signal light fields in atomic ensembles with natural inhomogeneous broadening. The feasibility of implementing this proposal in various crystals doped with rare earth ions, as well as in atomic gases with a Raman transition indicates a new way for the development of optical quantum memory.</description>

      <title>Coprime Bivariate Bicycle Codes and their Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work (1) proposes a novel numerical algorithm to accelerate the search process for good Bivariate Bicycle (BB) codes and (2) defines a new variant of BB codes suitable for quantum error correction. The proposed acceleration search algorithm reduces the search space by excluding some equivalent codes from the search space, as well as setting thresholds to drop bad codes at an early stage. A number of new BB codes found by this algorithm are reported. The proposed variant of BB codes employs coprimes to construct groups via polynomials as the basis for the BB code, rather than using the standard BB codes with unconstrained constructors. In contrast to vanilla BB codes, where parameters remain unknown prior to code discovery, the rate of the proposed code can be determined beforehand by specifying a factor polynomial as an input to the numerical search algorithm. Using this coprime BB construction, we found a number of surprisingly short to medium-length codes that were previously unknown.</description>

      <title>Quantum Register Machine: Efficient Implementation of Quantum Recursive Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum recursive programming has been recently introduced for describing sophisticated and complicated quantum algorithms in a compact and elegant way. However, implementation of quantum recursion involves intricate interplay between quantum control flows and recursive procedure calls. In this paper, we aim at resolving this fundamental challenge and develop a series of techniques to efficiently implement quantum recursive programs. Our main contributions include:
  1. We propose a notion of quantum register machine, the first purely quantum architecture (including an instruction set) that supports quantum control flows and recursive procedure calls at the same time.
  2. Based on quantum register machine, we describe the first comprehensive implementation process of quantum recursive programs, including the compilation, the partial evaluation of quantum control flows, and the execution on the quantum register machine.
  3. As a bonus, our efficient implementation of quantum recursive programs also offers automatic parallelisation of quantum algorithms. For implementing certain quantum algorithmic subroutine, like the widely used quantum multiplexor, we can even obtain exponential parallel speed-up (over the straightforward implementation) from this automatic parallelisation. This demonstrates that quantum recursive programming can be win-win for both modularity of programs and efficiency of their implementation.</description>

Abstract: We consider the computational model of IQP circuits (in which all computational steps are X-basis diagonal gates), supplemented by intermediate X- or Z-basis measurements. We show that if we allow non-adaptive or adaptive X-basis measurements, or allow non-adaptive Z-basis measurements, then the computational power remains the same as that of the original IQP model; and with adaptive Z-basis measurements the model becomes quantum universal. Furthermore we show that the computational model having circuits of only CZ gates and adaptive X-basis measurements, with input states that are tensor products of 1-qubit states from the set |+&gt;, |-&gt;, |0&gt;+i|1&gt; and |0&gt;+ e^{i pi/4}|1&gt; (each normalised), is quantum universal.</description>

      <title>Arbitrary order transfer matrix exceptional points and van Hove singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In lattice models with quadratic finite-range Hermitian Hamiltonians, the inherently non-Hermitian transfer matrix (TM) governs the band dispersion. The van Hove singularities (VHSs) are special points in the band dispersion where the density of states (DOS) diverge. Considering a lattice chain with hopping of a finite range $n$, we find a direct fundamental connection between VHSs and exceptional points (EPs) of TM, both of arbitrary order. In particular, we show that VHSs are EPs of TM of the same order, thereby connecting two different types of critical points usually studied in widely different branches of physics. Consequently, several properties of band dispersion and VHSs can be analyzed in terms of spectral properties of TM. We further provide a general prescription to generate any order EP of the TM and therefore corresponding VHS. For a given range of hopping $n$, our analysis provides restrictions on allowed orders of EPs of TM. Finally, we exemplify all our results for the case $n=3$.</description>

Abstract: We review the correspondence between a synchronous game and its associated game algebra. We slightly develop the work of Helton et al.[HMPS17] by proposing results on algebraic and locally commuting graph identities. Based on the theoretical works on noncommutative Nullstellens\"atze [BWHK23], we build computational tools involving Gr\"obner basis method and semidefinite programming to check the existence of perfect strategies with specific models. We prove the equivalence between the hereditary and $C^*$ models proposed in [HMPS17]. We also extend Ji's reduction $\texttt{3-Coloring}^* \leq_p \texttt{3-SAT}^*$ [Ji13] and exhibit another instance of quantum-version NP-hardness reduction $\texttt{Clique}^* \leq_p \texttt{3-SAT}^*$.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous polarized phase transitions and symmetry breaking of an ultracold atomic ensemble in a Raman-assisted cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the ground-state properties and quantum phase transitions of an ensemble consisting of $N$ four-level atoms within an optical cavity coupled to the single cavity mode and external laser fields. The system is described by an extended imbalanced Dicke model, in which the co- and counterrotating coupling terms are allowed to have different coupling strengths. Some novel polarized phases characterized by the phase differences between the cavity field or the atomic spin excitation and the Raman laser are found analytically. Meanwhile, the full phase diagram and quantum phase transitions are also revealed. Finally, the breaking or restoration of the intrinsic symmetry in this system is addressed. It is found that besides the continuous $U(1)$ and discrete $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetries, the system also exhibits two reflection symmetries $\sigma_v$s, a central symmetry $C_2$ in the abstract position-momentum representation, and a discrete reflection parity-time ($\mathcal{PT}$) symmetry, a parameter exchange symmetry $\mathcal{T}_\mathrm{ex}$ in the parameters space. These additional symmetries are governed by two Coxeter groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give an asymptotically good family of quantum CSS codes on qubits with a transversal CCZ gate, meaning that the parallel logical CCZ on all logical qubits is performed by parallel physical CCZs on (a subset of) physical qubits. Our construction is based on the observation that any classical code satisfying a multiplication property can be used to construct a quantum CSS code with transversal (qudit) CCZ. To obtain a constant-rate and linear-distance family, we instantiate this construction with a classical good family of algebraic-geometry codes on a non-binary, but constant-sized, alphabet. We then use a technique from the arithmetic secret sharing literature to reduce the alphabet to binary. As a corollary, our code family provides a constant-overhead magic state distillation scheme.</description>

      <title>Atlas: Hierarchical Partitioning for Quantum Circuit Simulation on GPUs (Extended Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents techniques for theoretically and practically efficient and scalable Schr\"odinger-style quantum circuit simulation. Our approach partitions a quantum circuit into a hierarchy of subcircuits and simulates the subcircuits on multi-node GPUs, exploiting available data parallelism while minimizing communication costs. To minimize communication costs, we formulate an Integer Linear Program that rewards simulation of "nearby" gates on "nearby" GPUs. To maximize throughput, we use a dynamic programming algorithm to compute the subcircuit simulated by each kernel at a GPU. We realize these techniques in Atlas, a distributed, multi-GPU quantum circuit simulator. Our evaluation on a variety of quantum circuits shows that Atlas outperforms state-of-the-art GPU-based simulators by more than 2$\times$ on average and is able to run larger circuits via offloading to DRAM, outperforming other large-circuit simulators by two orders of magnitude.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semi-heavy water (HOD) is one of the simplest molecules in which the bonds are labelled by isotope. We demonstrate that a pair of intense few-femtosecond infrared laser pulses can be used to selectively tunnel ionize along one of the two bonds. The first pulse doubly ionizes HOD, inducing rapid bond stretching and unbending. Femtoseconds later, the second pulse arrives and further ionization is selectively enhanced along the OH bond. These conclusions arise from 3D time-resolved measurements of H$^+$, D$^+$, and O$^+$ momenta following triple ionization.</description>

      <title>Bethe-ansatz diagonalization of steady state of boundary driven integrable spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We find that the non-equilibrium steady state (NESS) of integrable spin chains undergoing boundary dissipation, can be described in terms of quasiparticles, with renormalized -- dissipatively dressed -- dispersion relation. The spectrum of the NESS is then fully accounted for by Bethe ansatz equations for a related coherent system, described by a dissipation-projected Hamiltonian of the original system. We find explicit analytic expressions for the dressed energies of $XXX$ and $XXZ$ models with effective, i.e., induced by the dissipation, diagonal boundary fields, which are U(1) invariant, as well as XXZ and XYZ models with effective non-diagonal boundary fields. In all cases, the dissipative dressing generates an extra singularity in the dispersion relation, which strongly modifies the nonequilibrium steady state spectrum with respect to the spectrum of the corresponding coherent model. This leads, in particular, to a dissipation-assisted entropy reduction, due to the suppression in the NESS spectrum of plain wave-type Bethe states in favor of Bethe states localized at the boundaries.</description>

      <title>Application of the Variational R-matrix Method for the Dirac Equation to the Be Atom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an implementation of the non-iterative eigenchannel R-matrix method for the Dirac equation. It includes a brief introduction, implementation details, and results for the photoionization cross-section of the beryllium atom. Beryllium is a convenient test due to small but significant relativistic effects. The current calculation aligns with other R-matrix calculations and experiments. It observes the change in the Fano line shape of the (2pnd)1P series and, reveals a previously unnoticed coupling between triplet and singlet series observable in the ground state photoionization cross-section.</description>

      <title>Dynamical response and time correlation functions in random quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-dependent response and correlation functions are studied in random quantum systems composed of infinitely many parts without mutual interaction and defined with statistically independent random matrices. The latter are taken within the three Wigner-Dyson universality classes. In these systems, the response functions are shown to be exactly given by statistical averages over the random-matrix ensemble. Analytical results are obtained for the time dependence of the mean response and correlation functions at zero and positive temperatures. At long times, the mean correlation functions are shown to have a power-law decay for GOE at positive temperatures, but for GUE and GSE at zero temperature. Otherwise, the decay is much faster in time. In relation to these power-law decays, the associated spectral densities have a dip around zero frequency. The diagrammatic method is developed to obtain higher-order response functions and the third-order response function is explicitly calculated. The response to impulsive perturbations is also considered. In addition, the quantum fluctuations of the correlation function in individual members of the ensemble are characterised in terms of their probability distribution, which is shown to change with the temperature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum walks, mathematical models referred to as the quantum counterparts of random walks, have garnered significant attention in recent years with the advancement of quantum computing. The weak limit theorem for quantum walks, analogous to the central limit theorem for random walks, is one of the most important theorems in this field. In this study, we investigated the weak limit theorem for a two-state discrete-time quantum walk on a two-dimensional square lattice. As a result, we derived a two-dimensional probability distribution whose support is the intersection of two ellipses. The probability distribution we obtained resembles the distribution of one-dimensional quantum walks while possessing a unique form specific to two dimensions.</description>

      <title>Second-Order Moment Quantum Fluctuations and Quantum Equivalence Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The second-order moment quantum fluctuations or uncertainties are mass-dependent, the incompatibility between the quantum uncertainty principle and the equivalence principle is at the second-order moment (variation) level, but the first-order moment (mean) level. To reconcile the two fundamental principles, we find that the second-order moment quantum fluctuations are actually distinguished into two parts: a dynamic part and a geometric part. The dynamic part is indeed mass-dependent and governed by a non-zero Hamiltonian in a non-general-covariant inertial frame, and the geometric part is mass-independent and comes from coarse-graining and/or geometric effects. The dynamic part is coordinate dependent, it can be canceled away by a coordinate transformation, and hence it plays no role in general covariant theories whose Hamiltonian automatically vanishes. However, the geometric part is valid for general coordinate, and it can not be eliminated by a coordinate transformation. On the contrary, the geometric part of second-order moment fluctuation of quantum spacetime leads to coordinate transformation anomaly, which induces an effective Einstein's gravity theory. The geometric part is mass-independent and universal, so it is only this part measures the universal second-order moment quantum fluctuation of the spacetime, while the dynamic part plays no role in the general covariant description. The observation generalizes the classical equivalence principle to the quantum level. And according to the principle, a general covariant theory with only geometric part quantum fluctuation, i.e. a non-linear sigma model, is proposed as a theory of a material quantum reference frame system. The effects of the universal second-order moment quantum fluctuations in the material quantum reference system and its implications to an effective gravity theory are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Low frequency communication based on Rydberg-atom receiver</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low frequency communication has a wide range of applications in the fields of satellite detection, underground mining, disaster relief. Rydberg atom sensor has rapidly developed in recent years, capitalizing on its calibration-free SI-traceability, large polarizabilities and transition dipole moments. A Rydberg atom sensor is capable of sensitively detecting electric field signals from DC to THz. In this work, we demonstrate low frequency communication using Rydberg atoms in a vapor cell with two parallel electrode plates inside. Three modulations, BPSK, OOK, and 2FSK, are used for the communication by Rydberg atom receiver near 100kHz. We have measured the SNR of the modulated low frequency signal received by Rydberg atoms at various emission voltages. Meanwhile, we have demonstrated IQ constellation diagram, EVM and eye diagram of the demodulated signal at different symbol rate. The EVM is measured to be 8.8% when the symbol rate is 2Kbps, 9.4% when the symbol rate is 4Kbps, and 13.7% when the symbol rate is 8Kbps. The high-fidelity digital color image transmission resulted in a peak signal-to-noise ratio of 70dB. This study proves that Rydberg-atom receiver can finely work in low frequency communication.</description>

We describe isometries with respect to the symmetric quantum Wasserstein divergence $d_{sym}$, the divergence induced by all of the Pauli matrices.

      <title>Gapless spin excitations in nanographene-based antiferromagnetic spin-1/2 Heisenberg chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Haldane's seminal work established two fundamentally different types of excitation spectra for antiferromagnetic Heisenberg quantum spin chains: gapped excitations in integer-spin chains and gapless excitations in half-integer-spin chains. In finite-length half-integer spin chains, quantization, however, induces a gap in the excitation spectrum, with the upper bound given by the Lieb-Schulz-Mattis (LSM) theorem. Here, we investigate the length-dependent excitations in spin-1/2 Heisenberg chains obtained by covalently linking olympicenes--Olympic rings shaped nanographenes carrying spin-1/2--into one-dimensional chains. The large exchange interaction (J~38 mV) between olympicenes and the negligible magnetic anisotropy in these nanographenes make them an ideal platform for studying quantum spin excitations, which we directly measure using inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy. We observe a power-law decay of the lowest excitation energy with increasing chain length L, remaining below the LSM boundary. In a long chain with L = 50, a nearly V-shaped excitation continuum is observed, reinforcing the system's gapless nature in the thermodynamic limit. Finally, we visualize the standing wave of a single spinon confined in odd-numbered chains using low-bias current maps. Our results provide compelling evidence for the realization of a one-dimensional analog of a gapless spin liquid.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulating nonequilibirum dynamics of a quantum many-body system is one of the promising applications of quantum computing. We simulate the time evolution of one-dimensional ${\bf Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory on IBM's superconducting 156-qubit device ibm\_fez. We consider the Floquet circuit made of the Trotter decomposition of Hamiltonian evolution and focus on its dynamics toward thermalization. Quantum simulation with the help of error mitigation is successful in running the Floquet circuit made of $38$ and $116$ qubits up to $10$ Trotter steps in the best case. This is enough to reach the early stage of prethermalization. Our work would be a benchmark for the potential power of quantum computing for high-energy physics problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multilayer nanoscale systems incorporating buried ultrathin tunnel oxides, 2D materials, and solid electrolytes are crucial for next-generation logics, memory, quantum and neuro-inspired computing. Still, an ultrathin layer control at angstrom scale is challenging for cutting-edge applications. Here we introduce a scalable approach utilizing focused ion-beam annealing for buried ultrathin oxides engineering with angstrom-scale thickness control. Our molecular dynamics simulations of Ne+ irradiation on Al/a-AlOx/Al structure confirms the pivotal role of ion generated crystal defects. We experimentally demonstrate its performance on Josephson junction tunning in the resistance range of 2 to 37% with a standard deviation of 0.86% across 25x25 mm chip. Moreover, we showcase +-17 MHz frequency control (+-0.172 A tunnel barrier thickness) for superconducting transmon qubits with coherence times up to 500 us, which is promising for useful fault-tolerant quantum computing. This work ensures ultrathin multilayer nanosystems engineering at the ultimate scale by depth-controlled crystal defects generation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we explore in detail, the time evolution of Krylov complexity. We demonstrate, through analytical computations, that in finite many-body systems, while ramp and plateau are two generic features of Krylov complexity, the manner in which complexity saturates reveals the chaotic nature of the system. In particular, we show that the dynamics towards saturation precisely distinguish between chaotic and integrable systems. For chaotic models, the saturation value of complexity reaches its infinite time average at a finite saturation time. In this case, depending on the initial state, it may also exhibit a peak before saturation. In contrast, in integrable models, complexity approaches the infinite time average value from below at a much longer timescale. We confirm this distinction using numerical results for specific spin models.</description>

Abstract: The approach by Ettore Majorana for non-adiabatic transitions between two quasi-crossing levels is revisited. We rederive the transition probability, known as the Landau-Zener-St\"{u}ckelberg-Majorana formula, and introduce Majorana's approach to modern readers. This result typically referred as the Landau-Zener formula, was published by Majorana before Landau, Zener, St\"{u}ckelberg. Moreover, we obtain the full wave function, including its phase, which is important nowadays for quantum control and quantum information. The asymptotic wave function correctly describes dynamics far from the avoided-level crossing, while it has limited accuracy in that region.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.07410v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement is a fundamental property commonly used in various quantum information protocols and algorithms. Nonetheless, the problem of identifying entanglement has still not reached a general solution for systems larger than $2\times3$. In this study, we use deep convolutional NNs, a type of supervised machine learning, to identify quantum entanglement for any bipartition in a 3-qubit system. We demonstrate that training the model on synthetically generated datasets of random density matrices excluding challenging positive-under-partial-transposition entangled states (PPTES), which cannot be identified (and correctly labeled) in general, leads to good model accuracy even for PPTES states, that were outside the training data. Our aim is to enhance the model's generalization on PPTES. By applying entanglement-preserving symmetry operations through a triple Siamese network trained in a semi-supervised manner, we improve the model's accuracy and ability to recognize PPTES. Moreover, by constructing an ensemble of Siamese models, even better generalization is observed, in analogy with the idea of finding separate types of entanglement witnesses for different classes of states.</description>

Abstract: The problem of a spin-free electron with mass $m$, charge $e$ confined onto a ring of radius $R_0$ and with an attractive Dirac delta potential with scaling factor (depth) $\kappa$ in non-relativistic theory has closed form analytical solutions. The single bound state function is of the form of a hyperbolic cosine that however contains a parameter $d&gt;0$ which is the single positive real solution of the transcendental equation $\coth(d) = \lambda d$ for non zero real $\lambda=\frac{2}{\pi\kappa}$. The energy eigenvalue of the bound state $\varepsilon=-\frac{d^2}{2\pi^2}\approx \frac{q e m R_0}{2 \hbar^2}$. In addition a discretly infinite set of unbounded solutions exists, formally these solutions are obtained from the terms for the bound solution by substituting $d \to i d $ yielding $\cot(d) = \lambda d$ as characteristic equation with the corresponding set of solutions $d_k, k\in\mathbb{N}$, the respective state functions can be obtained via $\cosh(x)\overset{x \to i x}{\longrightarrow}\cos(x)$.</description>

Abstract: Redfield master equation was applied to study the dynamics of an ensemble of interacting pairs of unlike spins at room temperature. This spin quantum system is a workbench quantum model to analyze the relaxation dynamics of a heteronuclear two-level spin system interacting by a pure dipole-dipole coupling. Expressions for the density matrix elements and their relaxation rate constants of each coherence order were computed. In addition, the solutions were evaluated considering three initial quantum states, and the theoretical predictions, such as multi-exponential evolutions and enhancement, are behaviors that the solutions preserve and agree with previous studies performed for magnetization time evolutions. Moreover, the solutions computed to predict the dynamics of the longitudinal magnetization avoid the disagreement reported by I. Solomon.</description>

Abstract: We prove fundamental rigorous bounds on the speed of quantum evolution for a quantum system coupled to a thermal bath. The bounds are formulated in terms of expectation values of few-body observables derived from the system-bath Hamiltonian.

      <title>Scalable noisy quantum circuits for biased-noise qubits</title>

Abstract: In this work, we consider biased-noise qubits affected only by bit-flip errors, which is motivated by existing systems of stabilized cat qubits. This property allows us to design a class of noisy Hadamard-tests involving entangling and certain non-Clifford gates, which can be conducted reliably with only a polynomial overhead in algorithm repetitions. On the flip side we also found classical algorithms able to efficiently simulate both the noisy and noiseless versions of our specific variants of Hadamard test. We propose to use these algorithms as a simple benchmark of the biasness of the noise at the scale of large circuits. The bias being checked on a full computational task, it makes our benchmark sensitive to crosstalk or time-correlated errors, which are usually invisible from individual gate tomography. For realistic noise models, phase-flip will not be negligible, but in the Pauli-Twirling approximation, we show that our benchmark could check the correctness of circuits containing up to $10^6$ gates, several orders of magnitudes larger than circuits not exploiting a noise-bias. Our benchmark is applicable for an arbitrary noise-bias, beyond Pauli models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.19326v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The survival probability of an initial Coherent Gibbs State (CGS) is a natural extension of the Spectral Form Factor (SFF) to open quantum systems. To quantify the interplay between quantum chaos and decoherence away from the semi-classical limit, we investigate the relation of this generalized SFF with the corresponding $l_1$-norm of coherence. As a working example, we introduce Parametric Quantum Channels (PQC), a discrete-time model of unitary evolution mixed with the effects of measurements or transient interactions with an environment. The Energy Dephasing (ED) dynamics arises as a specific case in the Markovian limit. We demonstrate our results in a series of random matrix models.</description>

      <title>Atomic clock locking with Bayesian quantum parameter estimation: scheme and experiment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.06608v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Atomic clocks are crucial for science and technology, but their sensitivity is often restricted by the standard quantum limit. To surpass this limit, correlations between particles or interrogation times must be leveraged. Although the sensitivity can be enhanced to the Heisenberg limit using quantum entanglement, it remains unclear whether the scaling of sensitivity with total interrogation time can achieve the Heisenberg scaling. Here, we design an adaptive Bayesian quantum frequency estimation protocol that approaches the Heisenberg scaling and experimentally demonstrate its validity with a cold-atom coherent-population-trapping (CPT) clock. In further, we achieve robust and high-precision closed-loop locking of the cold-atom CPT clock by utilizing our Bayesian quantum frequency estimation protocol. In comparison to the conventional proportional-integral-differential locking, our Bayesian locking scheme not only yields an improvement of 5.1(4) dB in fractional frequency stability, but also exhibits better robustness against technical noises. Our findings not only provide a robust and high-precision approach to lock atomic clocks, but also hold promising applications in various interferometry-based quantum sensors, such as quantum magnetometers and atomic interferometers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.10353v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new model of quantum computation comprised of low-weight measurement sequences that simultaneously encode logical information, enable error correction, and apply logical gates. These measurement sequences constitute a new class of quantum error-correcting codes generalizing Floquet codes, which we call dynamic automorphism (DA) codes. We construct an explicit example, the DA color code, which is assembled from short measurement sequences that can realize all 72 automorphisms of the 2D color code. On a stack of $N$ triangular patches, the DA color code encodes $N$ logical qubits and can implement the full logical Clifford group by a sequence of two- and, more rarely, three-qubit Pauli measurements. We also make the first step towards universal quantum computation with DA codes by introducing a 3D DA color code and showing that a non-Clifford logical gate can be realized by adaptive two-qubit measurements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.11091v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We build a machine learning model to detect correlations in a three-qubit system using a neural network trained in an unsupervised manner on randomly generated states. The network is forced to recognize separable states, and correlated states are detected as anomalies. Quite surprisingly, we find that the proposed detector performs much better at distinguishing a weaker form of quantum correlations, namely, the quantum discord, than entanglement. In fact, it has a tendency to grossly overestimate the set of entangled states even at the optimal threshold for entanglement detection, while it underestimates the set of discordant states to a much lesser extent. In order to illustrate the nature of states classified as quantum-correlated, we construct a diagram containing various types of states -- entangled, as well as separable, both discordant and non-discordant. We find that the near-zero value of the recognition loss reproduces the shape of the non-discordant separable states with high accuracy, especially considering the non-trivial shape of this set on the diagram. The network architecture is designed carefully: it preserves separability, and its output is equivariant with respect to qubit permutations. We show that the choice of architecture is important to get the highest detection accuracy, much better than for a baseline model that just utilizes a partial trace operation.</description>

Abstract: We study the statistical properties of a single free quantum particle evolving coherently on a discrete lattice in ${\rm d}$ spatial dimensions where every lattice site is additionally subject to continuous measurement of the occupation number. Our numerical results indicate that the system undergoes a Measurement-induced Phase Transition (MiPT) for ${\rm d}&gt;1$ from a $\textit{delocalized}$ to a $\textit{localized}$ phase as the measurement strength $\gamma$ is increased beyond a critical value $\gamma_{c}$. In the language of surface growth, the delocalized phase corresponds to a $\textit{smooth}$ phase while the localized phase corresponds to a $\textit{rough}$ phase. We support our numerical results with perturbative renormalization group (RG) computations which are in qualitative agreement at one-loop order.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13164v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we address the challenge of controlling quantum systems under environmental influences using the theory of dynamical invariants. We employ a reverse engineering approach to develop control protocols designed to be robust against environmental noise and dissipation. This technique offers significant improvements over traditional quantum control methods by accounting for the time-dependent dissipation factor in the master equation, which results from modulating the system's Hamiltonian (the control fields). Additionally, our method obviates the need for iterative propagation of the system state, a resource-intensive process. The method can be applied to any open system dynamics that can be described using a time-dependent Master equation. We demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of our approach through applications to two fundamental models: a two-level quantum system and a quantum harmonic oscillator, both interacting with a thermal bath.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate how to build computationally secure commitment schemes with the aid of quantum auxiliary inputs without unproven complexity assumptions. Furthermore, the quantum auxiliary input can be either sampled in uniform exponential time or prepared in at most doubly exponential time, without relying on an external trusted third party. Classically, this remains impossible without first proving $\mathsf{P} \neq \mathsf{NP}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03867v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the phenomenon of quantum superposition of gravitational fields induced by massive quantum particles is an important starting point for quantum gravity. The purpose of this study is to deepen our understanding of the phenomenon of quantum superposition of gravitational fields. To this end, we consider a trade-off relation of entanglement (monogamy relation) in a tripartite system consisting of two massive particles and a gravitational field that may be entangled with each other. Consequently, if two particles cannot exchange information mutually, they are in a separable state, and the particle and gravitational field are always entangled. Furthermore, even when two particles can send information to each other, there is a trade-off between the two particles and the gravitational field. We also investigate the behavior of the quantum superposition of the gravitational field using quantum discord. We find that quantum discord increases depending on the length scale of the particle superposition. Our results may help understand the relationship between the quantization of the gravitational field and the meaning of the quantum superposition of the gravitational field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01218v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The multitime probability distributions obtained by repeatedly probing a quantum system via the measurement of an observable generally violate Kolmogorov's consistency property. Therefore, one cannot interpret such distributions as the result of the sampling of a single trajectory. We show that, nonetheless, they do result from the sampling of one pair of trajectories. In this sense, rather than give up on trajectories, quantum mechanics requires to double down on them. To this purpose, we prove a generalization of the Kolmogorov extension theorem that applies to families of complex-valued bi-probability distributions (that is, defined on pairs of elements of the original sample spaces), and we employ this result in the quantum mechanical scenario. We also discuss the relation of our results with the quantum comb formalism.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the notion of $su(2)$ spin-$s$ Dicke states, which are higher-spin generalizations of usual (spin-1/2) Dicke states. These multi-qudit states can be expressed as superpositions of $su(2s+1)$ qudit Dicke states. They satisfy a recursion formula, which we use to formulate an efficient quantum circuit for their preparation, whose size scales as $sk(2sn-k)$, where $n$ is the number of qudits and $k$ is the number of times the total spin-lowering operator is applied to the highest-weight state. The algorithm is deterministic and does not require ancillary qudits.</description>

Abstract: We present a quantum simulation strategy for a (1+1)D SU(2) non-abelian lattice gauge theory with dynamical matter, a hardcore-gluon Hamiltonian Yang-Mills, tailored to a six-level trapped-ion qudit quantum processor, as recently experimentally realized. We employ a qudit encoding fulfilling gauge invariance, an SU(2) Gauss law. We discuss the experimental feasibility of generalized M\"olmer-S\"orensen gates used to efficiently simulate the dynamics. We illustrate how a shallow circuit with these resources is sufficient to implement scalable digital quantum simulation of the model. We also numerically show that this model, albeit simple, can dynamically manifest physically-relevant properties specific to non-abelian field theories, such as baryon excitations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18268v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Detection of scattered light can determine the susceptibility of dielectrics. Rayleigh criterion normally limits it: details finer than the wavelength of the incident light cannot be determined from the far-field domain. We show that putting the dielectric in motion (or time-modulating it) can be useful for determining its susceptibility. This inverse quantum optics problem is studied in two different versions: (i) A spatially and temporally modulated metamaterial, whose dielectric susceptibility is similar to moving dielectrics. (ii) A dielectric moving with a constant velocity, a problem we studied within relativistic optics. The vacuum contribution to the photodetection signal is non-zero due to the negative frequencies. Hence, certain susceptibility features can be determined without shining any incident field on the dielectric. This effect pertains to the far-field domain for (i), and to the near-field (but possibly long-range) domain for (ii). When the incident light is shined, the determination of dielectric susceptibility is enhanced for (i) and goes beyond the classical Rayleigh limit in the far-field domain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18665v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The experimental realization of increasingly complex quantum states underscores the pressing need for new methods of state learning and verification. In one such framework, quantum state tomography, the aim is to learn the full quantum state from data obtained by measurements. Without prior assumptions on the state, this task is prohibitively hard. Here, we present an efficient algorithm for learning states on $n$ fermion modes prepared by any number of Gaussian and at most $t$ non-Gaussian gates. By Jordan-Wigner mapping, this also includes $n$-qubit states prepared by nearest-neighbour matchgate circuits with at most $t$ SWAP-gates. Our algorithm is based exclusively on single-copy measurements and produces a classical representation of a state, guaranteed to be close in trace distance to the target state. The sample and time complexity of our algorithm is $\mathrm{poly}(n,2^t)$; thus if $t=O(\log(n))$, it is efficient. We also show that, if $t$ scales slightly more than logarithmically, any learning algorithm to solve the same task must be inefficient, under common cryptographic assumptions. We also provide an efficient property testing algorithm that, given access to copies of a state, determines whether such a state is far or close to the set of states for which our learning algorithm works. In addition to the outputs of quantum circuits, our tomography algorithm is efficient for some physical target states, such as those arising in time dynamics and low-energy physics of impurity models. Beyond tomography, our work sheds light on the structure of states prepared with few non-Gaussian gates and offers an improved upper bound on their circuit complexity, enabling an efficient circuit compilation method.</description>

      <title>Low Depth Virtual Distillation of Quantum Circuits by Deterministic Circuit Decomposition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18874v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Virtual distillation (VD) using measurements of multiple copies of a quantum circuit have recently been proposed as a method of noise mitigation of expectation values. Circuit decompositions known as B gates were found only for single qubit expectation values however practical calculations require multi-qubit expectation values which cannot be corrected with B gates. We discover low depth circuit decompositions for multi-qubit expectation values by combining multiple projections to recover the correct measurement statistics or expectation values. Our method adds linear entangling gates with number of qubits, but requires extra measurements. Furthermore, in applications to find ground states such as the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm, the variational principle is required which states the energy cannot go below the ground state energy. We discover that the variational principle is violated if noise is higher on single expectation values than multi-qubit which renders VQE useless. We show this occurs when using B gates and is preserved if using our low depth decomposition on all expectation values. We perform demonstration on real devices and demonstrate our decomposition can mitigate real experimental noise in VQE for the H$_2$ molecule with a two qubit tapered mapping, H$_3$ with three qubits, and H$_2$ with four qubits. Our decomposition provides a way to perform duplicate circuit virtual distillation on real devices at significantly lower depth and for arbitrary observables.</description>

      <title>Inverted-circuit zero-noise extrapolation for quantum gate error mitigation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01608v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A common approach to deal with gate errors in modern quantum-computing hardware is zero-noise extrapolation. By artificially amplifying errors and extrapolating the expectation values obtained with different error strengths towards the zero-error (zero-noise) limit, the technique aims at rectifying errors in noisy quantum computing systems. For an accurate extrapolation, it is essential to know the exact factors of the noise amplification. In this article, we propose a simple method for estimating the strength of errors occurring in a quantum circuit and demonstrate improved extrapolation results. The method determines the error strength for a circuit by appending to it the inverted circuit and measuring the probability of the initial state. The estimation of error strengths is easy to implement for arbitrary circuits and does not require a previous characterisation of noise properties. We compare this method with the conventional zero-noise extrapolation method and show that the novel method leads to a more accurate calculation of expectation values. Our method proves to be particularly effective on current hardware, showcasing its suitability for near-term quantum computing applications.</description>

Abstract: Quantum tomography approaches typically consider a set of observables which we wish to measure, design a measurement scheme which measures each of the observables and then repeats the measurements as many times as necessary. We show that instead of considering only the simple set of observables, one should consider a multiset of the observables taking into account the required repetitions, to minimize the number of measurements. This leads to a graph theoretic multicolouring problem. We show that multiset tomography offers at most quadratic improvement but it is achievable. Furthermore, despite the NP-hard optimal colouring problem, the multiset approach with greedy colouring algorithms already offers asymptotically quadratic improvement in test cases.</description>

Abstract: Squeezing is a crucial resource for quantum information processing and quantum sensing. In levitated nanomechanics, squeezed states of motion can be generated via temporal control of the trapping frequency of a massive particle. However, the amount of achievable squeezing typically suffers from detrimental environmental effects. We analyze the performance of a scheme that, by embedding careful time-control of trapping potentials and fully accounting for the most relevant sources of noise -- including measurement backaction -- achieves significant levels of mechanical squeezing. The feasibility of our proposal, which is close to experimental state-of-the-art, makes it a valuable tool for quantum state engineering.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00740v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coherent dynamics of interacting quantum particles plays a central role in the study of strongly correlated quantum matter and the pursuit of quantum information processors. Here, we present the state-space of interacting Rydberg atoms as a synthetic landscape on which to control and observe coherent and correlated dynamics. With full control of the coupling strengths and energy offsets between the pairs of sites in a nine-site synthetic lattice, we realize quantum walks, Bloch oscillations, and dynamics in an Escher-type "continuous staircase". In the interacting regime, we observe correlated quantum walks, Bloch oscillations, and confinement of particle pairs. Additionally, we simultaneously tilt our lattice both up and down to achieve coherent pair oscillations. When combined with a few straightforward upgrades, this work establishes synthetic Rydberg lattices of interacting atom arrays as a promising platform for programmable quantum many-body dynamics with access to features that are difficult to realize in real-space lattices.</description>

Abstract: A leading application of quantum computers is the efficient simulation of large unitary quantum systems. Extending this advantage to the study of open Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics (CQED) systems could enable the use of quantum computers in the exploration and design of many-body quantum optical devices. Such devices have promising applications in optical quantum communication, simulation, and computing. In this work, we present an early exploration of the potential for quantum computers to efficiently investigate open CQED physics. Our simulations make use of a recent quantum algorithm that maps the dynamics of a singly excited open Tavis-Cummings model containing $N$ atoms coupled to a lossy cavity. We report the results of executing this algorithm on two noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers, a superconducting processor and a trapped ion processor, to simulate the population dynamics of an open CQED system featuring $N = 3$ atoms. By applying technology-specific transpilation and error mitigation techniques, we minimize the impact of gate errors, noise, and decoherence in each hardware platform, obtaining results which agree closely with the exact solution of the system. These results provide confidence that future simulation algorithms, combined with emerging large-scale quantum processors, can be a powerful tool for studying cavity quantum electrodynamics.</description>

      <title>The Overlap Gap Property limits limit swapping in QAOA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06087v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a quantum algorithm designed for Combinatorial Optimization Problem (COP). We show that if a COP with an underlying Erd\"os--R\'enyi hypergraph exhibits the Overlap Gap Property (OGP), then a random regular hypergraph exhibits it as well. Given that Max-$q$-XORSAT on an Erd\"os--R\'enyi hypergraph is known to exhibit the OGP, and since the performance of QAOA for the pure $q$-spin model matches asymptotically for Max-$q$-XORSAT on large-girth regular hypergraph, we show that the average-case value obtained by QAOA for the pure $q$-spin model for even $q\ge 4$ is bounded away from optimality even when the algorithm runs indefinitely. This suggests that a necessary condition for the validity of limit swapping in QAOA is the absence of OGP in a given combinatorial optimization problem. Furthermore, the results suggests that even when sub-optimised, the performance of QAOA on spin glass is equal in performance to classical algorithms in solving the mean field spin glass problem providing further evidence that the conjecture of getting the exact solution under limit swapping for the Sherrington--Kirkpatrick model to be true.</description>

      <title>Few-mode squeezing in type-I parametric downconversion by complete group velocity matching</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10560v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Frequency-degenerate pulsed type-I parametric downconversion is a widely used source of squeezed light for numerous quantum optical applications. However, this source is typically spectrally multimode and the generated squeezing is distributed between many spectral modes with a limited degree of squeezing per mode. We show that in a nonlinear crystal, where the condition of complete group velocity matching (GVM) for the pump and the signal is satisfied, the number of generated modes may be as low as two or three modes. We illustrate the general theory with the example of the MgO-doped lithium niobate crystal pumped at 775 nm and generating squeezed light at 1.55 $\mu$m. Our model includes the derivation of the degree of squeezing from the properties of the pump and the crystal and shows that 12 dB of squeezing can be obtained in a periodically poled crystal of length 80 mm.</description>

      <title>Extension of a Pattern Recognition Validation Approach for Noisy Boson Sampling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15603v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Boson sampling is one of the main quantum computation models to demonstrate the quantum computational advantage. However, this aim may be hard to realize considering two main kinds of noises, which are photon distinguishability and photon loss. Inspired by the Bayesian validation extended to evaluate whether distinguishability is too high to demonstrate this advantage, the pattern recognition validation is extended for boson sampling, considering both distinguishability and loss. Based on clusters constructed with the K means++ method, where parameters are carefully adjusted to optimize the extended validation performances, the distribution of characteristic values is nearly monotonically changed with indistinguishability, especially when photons are close to be indistinguishable. However, this regulation may be suppressed by photon loss. The intrinsic data structure of output events is analyzed through calculating probability distributions and mean 2-norm distances of the sorted outputs. An approximation algorithm is also used to show the data structure changes with noises.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15883v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe a class of spin chains with new physical and computational properties. On the physical side, the spin chains give examples of symmetry-protected topological phases that are defined by non-onsite symmetries, i.e. symmetries that are not a tensor product of single-site operators. These phases can be detected by string-order parameters, but notably do not exhibit entanglement spectrum degeneracy. On the computational side, the spin chains represent a new class of states that can be used to deterministically teleport information across long distances, with the novel property that the necessary classical side processing is a non-linear function of the measurement outcomes. We also give examples of states that can serve as universal resources for measurement-based quantum computation, providing the first examples of such resources without entanglement spectrum degeneracy. The key tool in our analysis is a new kind of tensor network representation which we call split-index matrix product states (SIMPS). We develop the basic formalism of SIMPS, compare them to matrix product states, show how they are better equipped to describe certain kinds of non-onsite symmetries including anomalous symmetries, and discuss how they are also well-suited to describing quantum teleportation and constrained spin chains.</description>

Abstract: We propose a scheme for quantum-light generation in a nonlinear cavity hybridized with a 2-level system and theoretically show that, when excited by a series of controlled pump pulses, the hybrid source generates Fock states with high probabilities. E.g., 1- and 2-photon states can be generated near-on-demand, and Fock states with up to $7$ photons with a probability above $50\%$. The tailorable nature of the nonlinear cavity allows for generating Fock states with arbitrary frequencies, even with a fixed 2-level system, creating fundamentally new opportunities in all areas of quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Multi-Mode Array Filtering of Resonance Fluorescence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03900v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel frequency-filtering method for measuring and calculating frequency-filtered photon-correlations. This novel method is a cavity-based system we call the multi-mode array filter, which consists of an array of tunable single-mode cavities that are equally spaced in frequency. By introducing a mode-dependent phase modulation, we produce a near rectangular frequency response, allowing us to increase the filter bandwidth -- and thus the temporal response -- without sacrificing frequency isolation. We model the frequency filtering using a cascaded quantum open systems approach which completely neglects any back-action of the filter onto the source system. This allows us to derive a closed set of operator moment equations for source and filter system operators, thus providing an extremely efficient method to calculate frequency-filtered first- and second-order correlation functions. We demonstrate this novel filtering method by applying it to a resonantly driven two-level atom. We present examples of frequency-filtered power spectra to demonstrate the improved frequency isolation of the multi-mode array filter over the single-mode filter. We then present results for the single-mode and multi-mode-array filtered second-order auto- and cross-correlation functions. These are compared against expressions derived in the secular approximation. The improved frequency isolation of the multi-mode array filter allows us to investigate new regimes of frequency-filtered photon correlations, such as two-photon leapfrog processes, and the effect of vanishing bandwidth on filtered auto-correlation functions.</description>

Abstract: Cross-platform verification is the task of comparing the output states produced by different physical platforms using solely local quantum operations and classical communication. While protocols have previously been suggested for this task, their exponential sample complexity renders them unpractical even for intermediate-scale quantum systems. In this work, we propose a novel protocol for this task based on Pauli sampling, a subroutine which generates Paulis distributed according to their weight in the expansion of a quantum state in the Pauli basis. We show that our protocols for both Pauli sampling and cross-platform verification are efficient for quantum states with low magic and entanglement (i.e., of the order $O(\log n)$). Conversely, we show super-polynomial lower bounds on the complexity of both tasks for states with $\omega(\log n)$ magic and entanglement. Interestingly, when considering states with real amplitudes the requirements of our protocol for cross-platform verification can be significantly weakened.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10593v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The one-particle reduced density-matrix (1-RDM) functional theory is a promising alternative to density-functional theory (DFT) that uses the 1-RDM rather than the electronic density as a basic variable. However, long-standing challenges such as the lack of Kohn--Sham scheme and the complexity of the pure $N$-representability conditions are still impeding its wild utilization. Fortunately, ensemble $N$-representability conditions derived in the natural orbital basis are known and trivial, such that almost every functionals of the 1-RDM are actually natural orbital functionals which do not perform well for all the correlation regimes. In this work, we propose a variational minimization scheme in the ensemble $N$-representable domain that is not restricted to the natural orbital representation of the 1-RDM. We show that splitting the minimization into the diagonal and off-diagonal part of the 1-RDM can open the way toward the development of functionals of the orbital occupations, which remains a challenge for the generalization of site-occupation functional theory in chemistry. Our approach is tested on the uniform Hubbard model using the M\"uller and the T\"ows--Pastor functionals, as well as on the dihydrogen molecule using the M\"uller functional.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11150v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent developments in the field of quantum machine learning have promoted the idea of incorporating physical symmetries in the structure of quantum circuits. A crucial milestone in this area is the realization of $S_{n}$-permutation equivariant quantum neural networks (QNN) that are equivariant under permutations of input objects. In this work, we focus on encoding the rotational symmetry of point cloud datasets into the QNN. The key insight of the approach is that all rotationally invariant functions with vector inputs are equivalent to a function with inputs of vector inner products. We provide a novel structure of QNN that is exactly invariant to both rotations and permutations, with its efficacy demonstrated numerically in the problems of two-dimensional image classifications and identifying high-energy particle decays, produced by proton-proton collisions, with the $SO(1,3)$ Lorentz symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17230v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamical decoupling (DD) is a promising technique for mitigating errors in near-term quantum devices. However, its effectiveness depends on both hardware characteristics and algorithm implementation details. This paper explores the synergistic effects of dynamical decoupling and optimized circuit design in maximizing the performance and robustness of algorithms on near-term quantum devices. By utilizing eight IBM quantum devices, we analyze how hardware features and algorithm design impact the effectiveness of DD for error mitigation. Our analysis takes into account factors such as circuit fidelity, scheduling duration, and hardware-native gate set. We also examine the influence of algorithmic implementation details, including specific gate decompositions, DD sequences, and optimization levels. The results reveal an inverse relationship between the effectiveness of DD and the inherent performance of the algorithm. Furthermore, we emphasize the importance of gate directionality and circuit symmetry in improving performance. This study offers valuable insights for optimizing DD protocols and circuit designs, highlighting the significance of a holistic approach that leverages both hardware features and algorithm design for the high-quality and reliable execution of near-term quantum algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06378v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, analog quantum simulators have reached unprecedented quality, both in qubit numbers and coherence times. Most of these simulators natively implement Ising-type Hamiltonians, which limits the class of models that can be simulated efficiently. We propose a method to overcome this limitation and simulate the time-evolution of a large class of spinless fermionic systems in 1D using simple Ising-type Hamiltonians with local transverse fields. Our method is based on domain wall encoding, which is implemented via strong (anti-)ferromagnetic couplings $|J|$. We show that in the limit of strong $|J|$, the domain walls behave like spinless fermions in 1D. The Ising Hamiltonians are one-dimensional chains with nearest-neighbor and, optionally, next-nearest-neighbor interactions. As a proof-of-concept, we perform numerical simulations of various 1D-fermionic systems using domain wall evolution and accurately reproduce the systems' properties, such as topological edge states, Anderson localization, quantum chaotic time evolution and time-reversal symmetry breaking via Floquet-engineering. Our approach makes the simulation of a large class of fermionic many-body systems feasible on analogue quantum hardware that natively implements Ising-type Hamiltonians with transverse fields.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19906v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the novel class $(E_\alpha)_{\alpha \in [-\infty,1)}$ of reverse map projection embeddings, each one defining a unique new method of encoding classical data into quantum states. Inspired by well-known map projections from the unit sphere onto its tangent planes, used in practice in cartography, these embeddings address the common drawback of the amplitude embedding method, wherein scalar multiples of data points are identified and information about the norm of data is lost.
  We show how reverse map projections can be utilised as equivariant embeddings for quantum machine learning. Using these methods, we can leverage symmetries in classical datasets to significantly strengthen performance on quantum machine learning tasks.
  Finally, we select four values of $\alpha$ with which to perform a simple classification task, taking $E_\alpha$ as the embedding and experimenting with both equivariant and non-equivariant setups. We compare their results alongside those of standard amplitude embedding.</description>

      <title>Quantum Algorithm for Testing Graph Completeness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20069v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Testing graph completeness is a critical problem in computer science and network theory. Leveraging quantum computation, we present an efficient algorithm using the Szegedy quantum walk and quantum phase estimation (QPE). Our algorithm, which takes the number of nodes and the adjacency matrix as input, constructs a quantum walk operator and applies QPE to estimate its eigenvalues. These eigenvalues reveal the graph's structural properties, enabling us to determine its completeness. We establish a relationship between the number of nodes in a complete graph and the number of marked nodes, optimizing the success probability and running time. The time complexity of our algorithm is $\mathcal{O}(\log^2n)$, where $n$ is the number of nodes of the graph. offering a clear quantum advantage over classical methods. This approach is useful in network structure analysis, evaluating classical routing algorithms, and assessing systems based on pairwise comparisons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00694v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Steady-state quantum thermal machines are typically characterized by a continuous flow of heat between different reservoirs. However, at the level of discrete stochastic realizations, heat flow is unraveled as a series of abrupt quantum jumps, each representing an exchange of finite quanta with the environment. In this work, we present a framework that resolves the dynamics of quantum thermal machines into cycles that are classified as engine-like, cooling-like, or idle. We explore the statistics of each cycle type and its duration, enabling us to determine both the fraction of cycles useful for thermodynamic tasks and the average waiting time between cycles of the same type. Our framework presents a novel approach in characterizing thermal machines, with significant relevance to modern experiments such as mesoscopic transport using quantum dots.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00975v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coherent storage of quantum information is crucial to many quantum technologies. Long coherence times have been demonstrated in trapped-ion qubits, typically using the hyperfine levels within the ground state of a single ion. However, recent research suggests qubits encoded in metastable states could provide architectural benefits for quantum information processing, such as the possibility of effective dual-species operation in a single-species system and erasure-error conversion for fault-tolerant quantum computing. Here we demonstrate long-lived encoding of a quantum state in the metastable states of a trapped ion. By sympathetically cooling with another ion of the same species and constantly monitoring for erasure errors, we demonstrate a coherence time of 136(42) seconds with a qubit encoded in the metastable $5D_{5/2}$ state of a single $^{137}$Ba$^+$ ion. In agreement with a model based on empirical results from dynamical-decoupling-based noise spectroscopy, we find that dephasing of the metastable levels is the dominant source of error once erasure errors are removed.</description>

      <title>Cooperative emission from two coupled solid-state quantum emitters and its effect on random number generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01799v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the behaviour of cooperative effects in the emitted light from a system of two nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers confined in a nanopillar having dimensions close to the wavelength of the excitation pump. We experimentally observe a $g^{(2)}(0) &gt; 0.5 \to 1$ for the coupled emitter system and a drastic decrease in the singlet and triplet lifetimes by a factor of $\approx 6$, indicating an interaction between the two emitters, which indicates superradiant behaviour. We theoretically study the dissipative dynamics of the interaction of the emitter system with the excitation light at a finite temperature for three cases (single emitter, two emitters with and without dipole-dipole coupling) by solving the Lindblad master equation and providing an analytical expression for the second-order correlation function. We observe that from the master equation, the populations and coherences mix for the two emitters' cases. Through this, we support our experimental results and discuss superradiance from our system. Finally, we discover a reliable quantum random number generation rate of $\sim 200$ kHz from the coupled emitter system, at low pump powers.</description>

      <title>Single-photon interference over 8.4 km urban atmosphere: towards testing quantum effects in curved spacetime with photons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03259v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The emergence of quantum mechanics and general relativity has transformed our understanding of the natural world significantly. However, integrating these two theories presents immense challenges, and their interplay remains untested. Recent theoretical studies suggest that the single-photon interference covering huge space can effectively probe the interface between quantum mechanics and general relativity. We developed an alternative design using unbalanced Michelson interferometers to address this and validated its feasibility over an 8.4 km free-space channel. Using a high-brightness single-photon source based on quantum dots, we demonstrated single-photon interference along this long-distance baseline. We achieved a phase measurement precision of 16.2 mrad, which satisfied the measurement requirements for a gravitational redshift at the geosynchronous orbit by five times the standard deviation. Our results confirm the feasibility of the single-photon version of the Colella-Overhauser-Werner experiment for testing the quantum effects in curved spacetime.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Intensity Correlation via Single-photon Detection in Quantum Key Distribution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07960v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the most significant vulnerabilities in the source unit of quantum key distribution (QKD) is the correlation between quantum states after modulation, which shall be characterized and evaluated for its practical security performance. In this work, we propose a methodology to characterize the intensity correlation according to the single-photon detection results in the measurement unit without modifying the configuration of the QKD system. In contrast to the previous research that employs extra classical optical detector to measure the correlation, our method can directly analyse the detection data generated during the raw key exchange, enabling to characterize the feature of correlation in real-time system operation. The basic method is applied to a BB84 QKD system and the characterized correlation decreases the secure key rate shown by the security proof. Furthermore, the method is extended and applied to characterize the correlation from the result of Bell-state measurement, which demonstrates its applicability to a running full-scheme MDI QKD system. This study provides an approach for standard certification of a QKD system.</description>

Abstract: The intensity correlations due to imperfect modulation during the quantum-state preparation in a measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (MDI QKD) system compromise its security performance. Therefore, it is crucial to assess the impact of intensity correlations on the practical security of MDI QKD systems. In this work, we propose a theoretical model that quantitatively analyzes the secure key rate of MDI QKD systems under intensity correlations. Furthermore, we apply the theoretical model to a practical MDI QKD system with measured intensity correlations, which shows that the system struggles to generate keys efficiently under this model. We also explore the boundary conditions of intensity correlations to generate secret keys. This study extends the security analysis of intensity correlations to MDI QKD protocols, providing a methodology to evaluate the practical security of MDI QKD systems.</description>

      <title>Field mixing in a thermal medium: A quantum master equation approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08460v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We studied the nonequilibrium dynamics of the indirect mixing of two (pseudo-)scalar fields induced by their couplings to common decay channels in a medium. The effective non-Markovian quantum master equation (QME) for the two fields' reduced density matrix is derived to leading order in the couplings of the two fields with the medium, but to all orders of the couplings among degrees of freedom in the medium. The self-energy and noise-kernel in the QME satisfy a fluctuation-dissipation relation. The solutions show that an initial expectation value (condensate) of one field induces a condensate of the other field through the indirect mixing and that the populations and coherence of the two fields thermalize and approach to non-vanishing values asymptotically. The nearly-degenerate field masses and coupling strengths resonantly enhance the quantum beats and asymptotic coherence, and induce a prominent dynamics of the vacuum after the switch-on of the couplings. We argue that a time-dependent definitions of particles due to the changing vacuum must be introduced so as to obtain results consistent with the calculations of equilibrium states in the asymptotic limit. A coupling strength hierarchy breaks down the resonant enhancement in the nearly-degenerate case but leads to different power countings of the coupling strengths in the magnitudes of the observables and time-scales in the evolution, suggesting the possibility of detecting extremely long-lived particles using prepared short-lived particles within a practical experimental period.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2201.08291v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exploring the mysterious dark matter is a key quest in modern physics. Currently, detecting axions, a hypothetical particle proposed as a primary component of dark matter, remains a significant challenge due to their weakly interacting nature. Here we show at quantum level that in a cavity permeated by a magnetic field, the single axion-photon conversion rate is enhanced by the cavity quality factor and is quantitatively larger than the classical result by $\pi/2$. The axion cavity can be considered a quantum device emitting single photons with temporal separations. This differs from the classical picture and reveals a possibility for the axion cavity experiment to handle the signal sensitivity at the quantum level, e.g., a dual path quantum interferometry with cross-power and second-order correlation measurements. This scheme would greatly reduce the signal scanning time and improve the sensitivity of the axion-photon coupling, potentially leading to the direct observation of axions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.14657v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks (NNs) encounter scalability limitations when confronted with a vast array of neurons, thereby constraining their achievable network depth. To address this challenge, we propose an integration of tensor networks (TN) into NN frameworks, combined with a variational DMRG-inspired training technique. This in turn, results in a scalable tensor neural network (TNN) architecture capable of efficient training over a large parameter space. Our variational algorithm utilizes a local gradient-descent technique, enabling manual or automatic computation of tensor gradients, facilitating design of hybrid TNN models with combined dense and tensor layers. Our training algorithm further provides insight on the entanglement structure of the tensorized trainable weights and correlation among the model parameters. We validate the accuracy and efficiency of our method by designing TNN models and providing benchmark results for linear and non-linear regressions, data classification and image recognition on MNIST handwritten digits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.06534v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have investigated the decoherence induced by the primordial graviton, using the influence functional method, to show whether this method is still effective in detecting graviton if the initial state is not a Bunch-Davies vacuum but rather a minimum uncertainty state. This minimum uncertainty condition allows the initial state of the primordial graviton to be an entanglement state between the polarization or, more generally, a superposition state between a vacuum and that entanglement. Both of those states have a non-classical correlation between the two polarization modes. We found that this method is still effective for detecting gravitons if the density matrix of the initial state does not have non-diagonal elements, where the maximum decoherence time is about 20 seconds, and the dimensions of the interferometer could be reduced if the total graviton increases.</description>

Abstract: Quantum Federated Learning (QFL) is an emerging interdisciplinary field that merges the principles of Quantum Computing (QC) and Federated Learning (FL), with the goal of leveraging quantum technologies to enhance privacy, security, and efficiency in the learning process. Currently, there is no comprehensive survey for this interdisciplinary field. This review offers a thorough, holistic examination of QFL. We aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of the principles, techniques, and emerging applications of QFL. We discuss the current state of research in this rapidly evolving field, identify challenges and opportunities associated with integrating these technologies, and outline future directions and open research questions. We propose a unique taxonomy of QFL techniques, categorized according to their characteristics and the quantum techniques employed. As the field of QFL continues to progress, we can anticipate further breakthroughs and applications across various industries, driving innovation and addressing challenges related to data privacy, security, and resource optimization. This review serves as a first-of-its-kind comprehensive guide for researchers and practitioners interested in understanding and advancing the field of QFL.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.02685v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear wave propagation in large extra spatial dimensions (on and above $d=2$) is investigated in the context of nonlinear electrodynamics theories that depend exclusively on the invariant $\mathcal{F}\left(=-(1/4)F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}\right)$. In this vein, we consider propagating waves under the influence of external uniform electric and magnetic fields. Features related to the blackbody radiation in the presence of a background constant electric field such as the generalization of the spectral energy density distribution and the Stefan-Boltzmann law are obtained. Interestingly enough, anisotropic contributions to the frequency spectrum appear in connection to the nonlinearity of the electromagnetic field. In addition, the long wavelength regime and Wien's displacement law in this situation are studied. The corresponding thermodynamics quantities at thermal equilibrium, such as energy, pressure, entropy, and heat capacity densities are contemplated as well.</description>

Abstract: We explore superconducting quantum circuits where several leads are simultaneously connected beyond the tunneling regime, such that the fermionic structure of Andreev bound states in the resulting multiterminal Josephson junction influences the states of the full circuit. Using a simple model of single channel contacts and a single level in the middle region, we discuss different circuit configurations where the leads are islands with finite capacitance and/or form loops with finite inductance. We find situations of practical interest where the circuits can be used to define noise protected qubits, which map to the bifluxon and $0{-}\pi$ qubits in the tunneling regime. We also point out the subtleties of the gauge choice for a proper description of these quantum circuits dynamics.</description>

Although larger CNNs generally exhibit higher accuracy, their size can be effectively reduced by ``tensorization'' while maintaining accuracy, namely, replacing the convolution kernels with compact decompositions such as Tucker, Canonical Polyadic decompositions, or quantum-inspired decompositions such as matrix product states, and directly training the factors in the decompositions to bias the learning towards low-rank decompositions. But why doesn't tensorization seem to impact the accuracy adversely? We explore this by assessing how \textit{truncating} the convolution kernels of \textit{dense} (untensorized) CNNs impact their accuracy. Specifically, we truncated the kernels of (i) a vanilla four-layer CNN and (ii) ResNet-50 pre-trained for image classification on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets. We found that kernels (especially those inside deeper layers) could often be truncated along several cuts resulting in significant loss in kernel norm but not in classification accuracy. This suggests that such ``correlation compression'' (underlying tensorization) is an intrinsic feature of how information is encoded in dense CNNs. We also found that aggressively truncated models could often recover the pre-truncation accuracy after only a few epochs of re-training, suggesting that compressing the internal correlations of convolution layers does not often transport the model to a worse minimum. Our results can be applied to tensorize and compress CNN models more effectively.</description>

      <title>Dispersive shock waves in a one-dimensional droplet-bearing environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02998v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the controllable generation of distinct types of dispersive shock-waves emerging in a quantum droplet bearing environment with the aid of step-like initial conditions. Dispersive regularization of the ensuing hydrodynamic singularities occurs due to the competition between meanfield repulsion and attractive quantum fluctuations. This interplay delineates the dominance of defocusing (hyperbolic) and focusing (elliptic) hydrodynamic phenomena respectively being designated by real and imaginary speed of sound. Specifically, the symmetries of the extended Gross-Pitaevskii model lead to a three-parameter family, encompassing two densities and a relative velocity, of the underlying Riemann problem utilized herein. Surprisingly, dispersive shock waves persist across the hyperbolic-to-elliptic threshold, while a plethora of additional wave patterns arise, such as rarefaction waves, traveling dispersive shock waves, (anti)kinks and droplet wavetrains. The classification and characterization of these features is achieved by deploying Whitham modulation theory. Our results pave the way for unveiling a multitude of unexplored coherently propagating waveforms in such attractively interacting mixtures and should be detectable by current experiments.</description>

      <title>Entanglement bounds for single-excitation energy eigenstates of quantum oscillator systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05527v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide an analytic method for estimating the entanglement of the non-gaussian energy eigenstates of disordered harmonic oscillator systems. We invoke the explicit formulas of the eigenstates of the oscillator systems to establish bounds for their $\epsilon$-R\'enyi entanglement entropy $\epsilon\in(0,1)$. Our methods result in a logarithmically corrected area law for the entanglement of eigenstates, corresponding to one excitation, of the disordered harmonic oscillator systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum droplets in two-dimensional Bose mixtures at finite temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09368v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the formation of quantum droplets at finite temperature in attractive Bose mixtures subject to a strong transverse harmonic confinement. By means of exact path-integral Monte Carlo methods we determine the equilibrium density of the gas and the liquid as well as the pressure vs. volume dependence along isothermal curves. Results for the equation of state and for the gas-liquid coexistence region in quasi-2D configurations are compared with calculations in strictly two dimensions, finding excellent agreement. Within the pure 2D model we explore the relevance of the quantum scale anomaly and we determine the critical interaction strength for the occurrence of the first-order gas to liquid transition. Furthermore, we find that the superfluid response develops suddenly, following the density jump from the gas to the liquid state.</description>

      <title>Une interpretation du spin en mecanique relativiste</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15353v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper aims at studying the spin once again. The departure point is thus the Stern and Gerlach experimental results that can be described in a coherent way in the frame of quantum mechanics only. Instead, the relativistic mechanics point of view is proposed here following the work presented in a previous article about rigid body rotation. Indeed, a careful study of the horizon of this relativistic rigid body rotation appears to be invariant from any observation angle in full agreement with the spin property.</description>

      <title>Floquet interferometry of a dressed semiconductor quantum dot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14241v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A quantum system interacting with a time-periodic excitation creates a ladder of hybrid eigenstates in which the system is mixed with an increasing number of photons. This mechanism, referred to as dressing, has been observed in the context of light-matter interaction in systems as varied as atoms, molecules and solid-state qubits. In this work, we demonstrate state dressing in a semiconductor quantum dot tunnel-coupled to a charge reservoir. We observe the emergence of a Floquet ladder of states in the system's high-frequency electrical response, manifesting as interference fringes at the multiphoton resonances despite the system lacking an avoided crossing. We study the dressed quantum dot while changing reservoir temperature, charge lifetime, and excitation amplitude and reveal the fundamental nature of the mechanism by developing a theory based on the quantum dynamics of the Floquet ladder, which is in excellent agreement with the data. Furthermore, we show how the technique finds applications in the accurate electrostatic characterisation of semiconductor quantum dots.</description>

      <title>Krylov complexity of thermal state in early universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03293v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In our work, we perform a detailed study of the Krylov complexity of the thermal state across the entire early universe, encompassing the inflation, radiation-dominated period, and matter-dominated period, which is for the single field inflation. We utilize both the closed system's method and open system's method to achieve this goal. To accurately calculate the Krylov complexity, we purified the thermal state, resulting in a pure state with two modes. Our analysis with both methods indicates that the Krylov complexity will increase during inflation, but will saturate at constant values during the radiation-dominated and matter-dominated periods, where the generation of particles via preheating leads to this evolution. Furthermore, our findings reveal that inflation behaves as a strong dissipative system, while the radiation-dominated and matter-dominated periods act as weak dissipative systems. The chaotic feature during these periods follows a similar trend to the Krylov complexity. This research has the potential to provide new insights into the exploration of Krylov complexity in cosmology.</description>
