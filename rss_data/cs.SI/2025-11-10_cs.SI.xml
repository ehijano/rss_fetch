      <title>Simulating Misinformation Vulnerabilities With Agent Personas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Disinformation campaigns can distort public perception and destabilize institutions. Understanding how different populations respond to information is crucial for designing effective interventions, yet real-world experimentation is impractical and ethically challenging. To address this, we develop an agent-based simulation using Large Language Models (LLMs) to model responses to misinformation. We construct agent personas spanning five professions and three mental schemas, and evaluate their reactions to news headlines. Our findings show that LLM-generated agents align closely with ground-truth labels and human predictions, supporting their use as proxies for studying information responses. We also find that mental schemas, more than professional background, influence how agents interpret misinformation. This work provides a validation of LLMs to be used as agents in an agent-based model of an information network for analyzing trust, polarization, and susceptibility to deceptive content in complex social systems.</description>

      <title>Communication-Constrained Private Decentralized Online Personalized Mean Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of communication-constrained collaborative personalized mean estimation under a privacy constraint in an environment of several agents continuously receiving data according to arbitrary unknown agent-specific distributions. A consensus-based algorithm is studied under the framework of differential privacy in order to protect each agent's data. We give a theoretical convergence analysis of the proposed consensus-based algorithm for any bounded unknown distributions on the agents' data, showing that collaboration provides faster convergence than a fully local approach where agents do not share data, under an oracle decision rule and under some restrictions on the privacy level and the agents' connectivity, which illustrates the benefit of private collaboration in an online setting under a communication restriction on the agents. The theoretical faster-than-local convergence guarantee is backed up by several numerical results.</description>

      <title>NCSAC: Effective Neural Community Search via Attribute-augmented Conductance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying locally dense communities closely connected to the user-initiated query node is crucial for a wide range of applications. Existing approaches either solely depend on rule-based constraints or exclusively utilize deep learning technologies to identify target communities. Therefore, an important question is proposed: can deep learning be integrated with rule-based constraints to elevate the quality of community search? In this paper, we affirmatively address this question by introducing a novel approach called Neural Community Search via Attribute-augmented Conductance, abbreviated as NCSAC. Specifically, NCSAC first proposes a novel concept of attribute-augmented conductance, which harmoniously blends the (internal and external) structural proximity and the attribute similarity. Then, NCSAC extracts a coarse candidate community of satisfactory quality using the proposed attribute-augmented conductance. Subsequently, NCSAC frames the community search as a graph optimization task, refining the candidate community through sophisticated reinforcement learning techniques, thereby producing high-quality results. Extensive experiments on six real-world graphs and ten competitors demonstrate the superiority of our solutions in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and scalability. Notably, the proposed solution outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving an impressive F1-score improvement ranging from 5.3\% to 42.4\%.

      <title>Zoo of Centralities: Encyclopedia of Node Metrics in Complex Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Centrality is a fundamental concept in network science, providing critical insights into the structure and dynamics of complex systems such as social, transportation, biological and financial networks. Despite its extensive use, there is no universally accepted definition of centrality, leading to the development of a vast array of distinct centrality measures. These measures have grown so numerous that they resemble a 'zoo', each representing a unique approach to capturing node importance within a network. However, the increasing number of metrics being developed has led to several challenges, including issues of discoverability, redundancy, naming conflicts, validation and accessibility. This work aims to address these challenges by providing a comprehensive catalog of over 400 centrality measures, along with clear descriptions and references to original sources. While not exhaustive, this compilation represents the most extensive and systematic effort to date in organizing and presenting centrality measures. We also encourage readers to explore and contribute to the Centrality Zoo website at https://centralityzoo.github.io/, which provides an interactive platform for discovering, comparing and implementing centrality measures.</description>

      <title>Cooperation Under Network-Constrained Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study cooperation in distributed games under network-constrained communication. Building on the framework of Monderer and Tennenholtz (1999), we derive a sufficient condition for cooperative equilibrium in settings where communication between agents is delayed by the underlying network topology. Each player deploys an agent at every location, and local interactions follow a Prisoner's Dilemma structure. We derive a sufficient condition that depends on the network diameter and the number of locations, and analyze extreme cases of instantaneous, delayed, and proportionally delayed communication. We also discuss the asymptotic case of scale-free communication networks, in which the network diameter grows sub-linearly in the number of locations. These insights clarify how communication latency and network design jointly determine the emergence of distributed cooperation.</description>

      <title>Listening Between the Lines: Decoding Podcast Narratives with Language Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Podcasts have become a central arena for shaping public opinion, making them a vital source for understanding contemporary discourse. Their typically unscripted, multi-themed, and conversational style offers a rich but complex form of data. To analyze how podcasts persuade and inform, we must examine their narrative structures -- specifically, the narrative frames they employ.
  The fluid and conversational nature of podcasts presents a significant challenge for automated analysis. We show that existing large language models, typically trained on more structured text such as news articles, struggle to capture the subtle cues that human listeners rely on to identify narrative frames. As a result, current approaches fall short of accurately analyzing podcast narratives at scale.
  To solve this, we develop and evaluate a fine-tuned BERT model that explicitly links narrative frames to specific entities mentioned in the conversation, effectively grounding the abstract frame in concrete details. Our approach then uses these granular frame labels and correlates them with high-level topics to reveal broader discourse trends. The primary contributions of this paper are: (i) a novel frame-labeling methodology that more closely aligns with human judgment for messy, conversational data, and (ii) a new analysis that uncovers the systematic relationship between what is being discussed (the topic) and how it is being presented (the frame), offering a more robust framework for studying influence in digital media.</description>

      <title>Extracting narrative signals from public discourse: a network-based approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00702v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Narratives are key interpretative devices by which humans make sense of political reality. As the significance of narratives for understanding current societal issues such as polarization and misinformation becomes increasingly evident, there is a growing demand for methods that support their empirical analysis. To this end, we propose a graph-based formalism and machine-guided method for extracting, representing, and analyzing selected narrative signals from digital textual corpora, based on Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR). The formalism and method introduced here specifically cater to the study of political narratives that figure in texts from digital media such as archived political speeches, social media posts, transcripts of parliamentary debates, and political manifestos on party websites. We approach the study of such political narratives as a problem of information retrieval: starting from a textual corpus, we first extract a graph-like representation of the meaning of each sentence in the corpus using AMR. Drawing on transferable concepts from narratology, we then apply a set of heuristics to filter these graphs for representations of 1) actors and their relationships, 2) the events in which these actors figure, and 3) traces of the perspectivization of these events. We approach these references to actors, events, and instances of perspectivization as core narrative signals that allude to larger political narratives. By systematically analyzing and re-assembling these signals into networks that guide the researcher to the relevant parts of the text, the underlying narratives can be reconstructed through a combination of distant and close reading. A case study of State of the European Union addresses (2010 -- 2023) demonstrates how the formalism can be used to inductively surface signals of political narratives from public discourse.</description>

      <title>Internal World Models as Imagination Networks in Cognitive Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04391v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: What is the computational objective of imagination? While classical interpretations suggest imagination is useful for maximizing rewards, recent findings challenge this view. In this study, we propose that imagination serves to access an internal world model (IWM) and use psychological network analysis to explore IWMs in humans and large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we assessed imagination vividness ratings using two questionnaires and constructed imagination networks from these reports. Imagination networks from human groups showed correlations between different centrality measures, including expected influence, strength, and closeness. However, imagination networks from LLMs showed a lack of clustering and lower correlations between centrality measures under different prompts and conversational memory conditions. Together, these results indicate a lack of similarity between IWMs in human and LLM agents. Overall, our study offers a novel method for comparing internally-generated representations in humans and AI, providing insights for developing human-like imagination in artificial intelligence.</description>
