      <title>Examining Fast Radiative Feedbacks Using Machine-Learning Weather Emulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The response of the climate system to increased greenhouse gases and other radiative perturbations is governed by a combination of fast and slow feedbacks. Slow feedbacks are typically activated in response to changes in ocean temperatures on decadal timescales and manifest as changes in climatic state with no recent historical analogue. However, fast feedbacks are activated in response to rapid atmospheric physical processes on weekly timescales, and they are already operative in the present-day climate. This distinction implies that the physics of fast radiative feedbacks is present in the historical meteorological reanalyses used to train many recent successful machine-learning-based (ML) emulators of weather and climate. In addition, these feedbacks are functional under the historical boundary conditions pertaining to the top-of-atmosphere radiative balance and sea-surface temperatures. Together, these factors imply that we can use historically trained ML weather emulators to study the response of radiative-convective equilibrium (RCE), and hence the global hydrological cycle, to perturbations in carbon dioxide and other well-mixed greenhouse gases. Without retraining on prospective Earth system conditions, we use ML weather emulators to quantify the fast precipitation response to reduced and elevated carbon dioxed concentrations with no recent historical precedent. We show that the responses from historically trained emulators agree with those produced by full-physics Earth System Models (ESMs). In conclusion, we discuss the prospects for and advantages from using ESMs and ML emulators to study fast processes in global climate.</description>

      <title>Stability analyses of divergence and vorticity damping on gnomonic cubed-sphere grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05624v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Divergence and vorticity damping, which operate upon horizontal divergence and relative vorticity, are explicit diffusion mechanisms used in dynamical cores to ensure stability. To avoid numerical blow-up from excessively strong diffusion, there are mesh-dependent upper bounds on the coefficients of the diffusion operators. This work considers such stability limits for three gnomonic cubed-sphere meshes: the 1) equidistant, 2) equiangular, and 3) equi-edge mappings. Stability limits are derived from a von Neumann analysis of damping with a simplified pseudo-Laplacian operator, as used in NOAA GFDL's finite-volume dynamical core on the cubed-sphere (FV3), and with the full curvilinear Laplacian. The resulting stability limits depend on the gnomonic mapping through the cubed-sphere cell areas, aspect ratios, and grid nonorthogonality. The analytical stability limits are compared to practical divergence and vorticity damping upper bounds in FV3, using idealised tests and the equiangular and equi-edge grids. For divergence damping, both the magnitude of maximum stable coefficients and the locations of instability agree with linear theory. Due to implicit vorticity diffusion in the FV3 transport scheme, practical limits for vorticity damping are lower than the explicit stability limits and depend on the choice of horizontal transport scheme.</description>
