      <title>Shear and transport in a flow environment determine spatial patterns and population dynamics in a model of nonlocal ecological competition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Populations very often self-organize into regular spatial patterns with important ecological and evolutionary consequences. Yet, most existing models neglect the effect that external biophysical drivers might have both on pattern formation and the spatiotemporal population dynamics once patterns form. Here, we investigate the effect of environmental flows on pattern formation and population dynamics using a spatially nonlocal logistic model (or Fisher-Kolmogorov equation) coupled to a simple shear and a Rankine vortex flow. We find that, whereas population abundance generally decreases with increasing flow intensity, the effect of the flow on the pattern instability depends on the spatial structure of the flow velocity field. This result shows that the velocity field interacts with the spatial feedbacks responsible for pattern formation in non-trivial ways, leading to a variety of spatiotemporal population dynamics regimes in which the total population abundance can exhibit either regular oscillations with a characteristic frequency or more erratic dynamics without a well-defined period. More generally, the diversity of spatiotemporal population dynamics caused by the interplay between self-organizing feedbacks and environmental flows highlights the importance of incorporating environmental and biophysical processes when studying both ecological pattern formation and its consequences.</description>

      <title>Galled Perfect Transfer Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting horizontal gene transfers often requires comparative sequence data, but recent work has shown that character-based approaches could also be useful for this task. Notably, perfect transfer networks (PTN) explain the character diversity of a set of taxa for traits that are gained once, rarely lost, but that can be transferred laterally. Characterizing the structure of such characters is an important step towards understanding more complex characters. Although efficient algorithms can infer such networks from character data, they can sometimes predict overly complicated transfer histories. With the goal of recovering the simplest possible scenarios in this model, we introduce galled perfect transfer networks, which are PTNs that are galled trees. Such networks are useful for characters that are incompatible in terms of tree-like evolution, but that do fit in an almost-tree scenario. We provide polynomial-time algorithms for two problems: deciding whether one can add transfer edges to a tree to transform it into a galled PTN, and deciding whether a set of characters are galled-compatible, that is, they can be explained by some galled PTN. We also analyze a real dataset comprising of a bacterial species trees and KEGG functions as characters, and derive several conclusions on the difficulty of explaining characters in a galled tree, which provide several directions for future research.</description>

      <title>Modeling, Inference, and Prediction in Mobility-Based Compartmental Models for Epidemiology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12002v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classical compartmental models in epidemiology often assume a homogeneous population for simplicity, which neglects the inherent heterogeneity among individuals. This assumption frequently leads to inaccurate predictions when applied to real-world data. For example, evidence has shown that classical models overestimate the final pandemic size in the H1N1-2009 and COVID-19 outbreaks. To address this issue, we introduce individual mobility as a key factor in disease transmission and control. We characterize disease dynamics using mobility distribution functions for each compartment and propose a mobility-based compartmental model that incorporates population heterogeneity. Our results demonstrate that, for the same basic reproduction number, our mobility-based model predicts a smaller final pandemic size compared to the classical models, effectively addressing the common overestimation problem. Additionally, we infer mobility distributions from the time series of the infected population. We provide sufficient conditions for uniquely identifying the mobility distribution from a dataset and propose a machine-learning-based approach to learn mobility from both synthesized and real-world data.</description>

      <title>Element-wise and Recursive Solutions for the Power Spectral Density of Biological Stochastic Dynamical Systems at Fixed Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.19890v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochasticity plays a central role in nearly every biological process, and the noise power spectral density (PSD) is a critical tool for understanding variability and information processing in living systems. In steady-state, many such processes can be described by stochastic linear time-invariant (LTI) systems driven by Gaussian white noise, whose PSD is a complex rational function of the frequency that can be concisely expressed in terms of their Jacobian, dispersion, and diffusion matrices, fully defining the statistical properties of the system's dynamics at steady-state. Here, we arrive at compact element-wise solutions of the rational function coefficients for the auto- and cross-spectrum that enable the explicit analytical computation of the PSD in dimensions n=2,3,4. We further present a recursive Leverrier-Faddeev-type algorithm for the exact computation of the rational function coefficients. Crucially, both solutions are free of matrix inverses. We illustrate our element-wise and recursive solutions by considering the stochastic dynamics of neural systems models, namely Fitzhugh-Nagumo (n=2), Hindmarsh-Rose (n=3), Wilson-Cowan (n=4), and the Stabilized Supralinear Network (n=22), as well as an evolutionary game-theoretic model with mutations (n=5, 31). We extend our approach to derive a recursive method for calculating the coefficients in the power series expansion of the integrated covariance matrix for interacting spiking neurons modeled as Hawkes processes on arbitrary directed graphs.</description>

      <title>Noise-free comparison of stochastic agent-based simulations using common random numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02086v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Random numbers are at the heart of every agent-based model (ABM) of health and disease. By representing each individual in a synthetic population, agent-based models enable detailed analysis of intervention impact and parameter sensitivity. Yet agent-based modeling has a fundamental signal-to-noise problem, in which small changes between simulations cannot be reliably differentiated from stochastic noise resulting from misaligned random number realizations. We introduce a novel methodology that eliminates noise due to misaligned random numbers, a first for agent-based modeling. Our approach enables meaningful individual-level analysis between ABM scenarios because all differences are driven by mechanistic effects rather than random number noise. We demonstrate the benefits of our approach on three disparate examples. Results consistently show reductions in the number of simulations required to achieve a given standard error with levels exceeding 10-fold for some applications.</description>
