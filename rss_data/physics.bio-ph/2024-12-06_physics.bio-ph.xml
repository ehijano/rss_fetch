      <title>Optimal Snake Locomotion on Flat Surfaces: An Analytical Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this theoretical study, we present an analytical framework to investigate the slithering motion of snakes on flat surfaces. While previous studies have predominantly relied on numerical methods to identify optimal locomotion kinematics, such approaches are often sensitive to initial guesses and the number of kinematic parameters in the model. Here, we derive analytical solutions for optimal kinematics that minimize the cost of transport or maximize the velocity under varying friction anisotropy conditions. Our analysis assumes a uniform weight distribution and negligible body rigidity, though the framework can be extended to more complex scenarios. Furthermore, we demonstrate the applicability of this approach to the undulatory motion of other elongated bodies in various media, where interactive forces can be described using resistive force theory, such as swimming through sand or viscous fluids.</description>

      <title>Revealing Physical Mechanisms of pattern formation and switching in ecosystems via Landscape and Flux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatial patterns are widely observed in numerous nonequilibrium natural systems, often undergoing complex transitions and bifurcations, thereby exhibiting significant importance in many physical and biological systems such as embryonic development, ecosystem desertification, and turbulence. However, how the pattern formation emerges and how the pattern switching occurs are not fully understood. Here, we developed a landscape-flux field theory via the spatial mode expansion method to uncover the underlying physical mechanism of the pattern formation and switching. We identified the landscape and flux field as the driving force for spatial dynamics and applied this theory to the critical transitions between spatial vegetation patterns in semi-arid ecosystems, revealing that the nonequilibrium flux drives transitions of spatial patterns. We uncovered how the pattern switching emerges through the optimal pathways and how fast this occurs via the speed of pattern switching. Furthermore, both the averaged flux and the entropy production rate exhibit peaks near pattern switching boundaries, revealing dynamical and thermodynamical origins for pattern transitions, and further offering early warning signals for anticipating pattern switching. Our work thus reveals physical mechanisms on spatial pattern-switching in semi-arid ecosystems and, more generally, introduces an useful approach for quantifying spatial pattern switching in nonequilibrium systems, which further offers practical applications such as early warning signals for critical transitions of spatial patterns.</description>

      <title>Electrically functionalized body surface for deep-tissue bioelectrical recording</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Directly probing deep tissue activities from body surfaces offers a noninvasive approach to monitoring essential physiological processes1-3. However, this method is technically challenged by rapid signal attenuation toward the body surface and confounding motion artifacts4-6 primarily due to excessive contact impedance and mechanical mismatch with conventional electrodes. Herein, by formulating and directly spray coating biocompatible two-dimensional nanosheet ink onto the human body under ambient conditions, we create microscopically conformal and adaptive van der Waals thin films (VDWTFs) that seamlessly merge with non-Euclidean, hairy, and dynamically evolving body surfaces. Unlike traditional deposition methods, which often struggle with conformality and adaptability while retaining high electronic performance, this gentle process enables the formation of high-performance VDWTFs directly on the body surface under bio-friendly conditions, making it ideal for biological applications. This results in low-impedance electrically functionalized body surfaces (EFBS), enabling highly robust monitoring of biopotential and bioimpedance modulations associated with deep-tissue activities, such as blood circulation, muscle movements, and brain activities. Compared to commercial solutions, our VDWTF-EFBS exhibits nearly two-orders of magnitude lower contact impedance and substantially reduces the extrinsic motion artifacts, enabling reliable extraction of bioelectrical signals from irregular surfaces, such as unshaved human scalps. This advancement defines a technology for continuous, noninvasive monitoring of deep-tissue activities during routine body movements.</description>

      <title>A Note on Spectral Map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, transitions between states are often rare events due to energy barriers that exceed the thermal temperature. Because of their infrequent occurrence and the huge number of degrees of freedom in molecular systems, understanding the physical properties that drive rare events is immensely difficult. A common approach to this problem is to propose a collective variable (CV) that describes this process by a simplified representation. However, choosing CVs is not easy, as it often relies on physical intuition. Machine learning (ML) techniques provide a promising approach for effectively extracting optimal CVs from MD data. Here, we provide a note on a recent unsupervised ML method called spectral map, which constructs CVs by maximizing the timescale separation between slow and fast variables in the system.</description>

      <title>A Tactile Void</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We mimic the mechanical response of touch mechanoreceptors by that of a gas cavity embedded in an elastic semi-cylinder, as a fingertip analogue. Using tribological experiments combined with optical imaging, we measure the dynamics and deformation of the cavity as the semi-cylinder is put in static contact or slid against model rough surfaces at constant normal force and velocity. We propose an elastic model to predict the cavity deformation under normal load showing that membrane mechanical stresses are anisotropic and we discuss its possible biological consequences. In friction experiments, we show that the cavity shape fluctuations allow for texture discriminations.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed Deep Learning for Muscle Force Prediction with Unlabeled sEMG Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computational biomechanical analysis plays a pivotal role in understanding and improving human movements and physical functions. Although physics-based modeling methods can interpret the dynamic interaction between the neural drive to muscle dynamics and joint kinematics, they suffer from high computational latency. In recent years, data-driven methods have emerged as a promising alternative due to their fast execution speed, but label information is still required during training, which is not easy to acquire in practice. To tackle these issues, this paper presents a novel physics-informed deep learning method to predict muscle forces without any label information during model training. In addition, the proposed method could also identify personalized muscle-tendon parameters. To achieve this, the Hill muscle model-based forward dynamics is embedded into the deep neural network as the additional loss to further regulate the behavior of the deep neural network. Experimental validations on the wrist joint from six healthy subjects are performed, and a fully connected neural network (FNN) is selected to implement the proposed method. The predicted results of muscle forces show comparable or even lower root mean square error (RMSE) and higher coefficient of determination compared with baseline methods, which have to use the labeled surface electromyography (sEMG) signals, and it can also identify muscle-tendon parameters accurately, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed physics-informed deep learning method.</description>

      <title>Partition sum of thermal, under-constrained systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.07264v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Athermal (i.e. zero-temperature) under-constrained systems are typically floppy, but they can be rigidified by the application of external strain. Following our recently developed analytical theory for the athermal limit, here and in the companion paper, we extend this theory to under-constrained systems at finite temperatures. Close to the athermal transition point, we derive from first principles the partition sum for a broad class of under-constrained systems, from which we obtain analytic expressions for elastic material properties such as isotropic tension $t$ and shear modulus $G$ in terms of isotropic strain $\varepsilon$, shear strain $\gamma$, and temperature $T$. These expressions contain only three parameters, entropic rigidity $\kappa_S$, energetic rigidity $\kappa_E$, and a parameter $b_\varepsilon$ describing the interaction between isotropic and shear strain. We provide analytical expressions for these parameters based on the microscopic structure of the system. Our work unifies the physics of systems as diverse as polymer fibers &amp; networks, membranes, and vertex models for biological tissues.</description>
