      <title>Invariants from involutory Hopf algebras of 3-manifolds with embedded framed links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give invariants of pairs $(M,L)$ consisting of a closed connected oriented three-manifold and an (oriented) framed link $L$ embedded in $M$. This invariant generalizes the Kuperberg and Hennings-Kauffman-Radford (HKR) invariants of three-manifolds. We define Heegaard-Link diagrams which represent the pair $(M,L)$ and use the data of an involutory Hopf algebra and a representation of the Drinfeld double to construct the invariant. We show that if $L$ is the empty link, then the invariant recovers the Kuperberg invariant, and if $M$ is the three-sphere and certain particular representation is chosen, then the invariant recovers the HKR invariant. We also show that if the representation is the left regular representation of the Drinfeld double, then we recover the Kuperberg invariant of the surgery manifold $M(L)$, contributing to a new proof of the relationship between the HKR and Kuperberg invariants in the semisimple setting. To this end, we give a Heegaard diagram for $M(L)$ coming from the Heegaard-Link diagram representing the pair $(M,L)$. We also introduce a colored link invariant extending the construction and show it recovers the Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev colored link invariant.</description>

      <title>The $L^p$-diameter of the space of contractible loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the space of contractible simple loops of a given fixed area in any compact oriented surface has infinite diameter as a homogeneous space of the group of area-preserving diffeomorphisms endowed with the $L^p$-metric. As a special case, this resolves the $L^p$-metric analogue of the well-known question in symplectic topology regarding the space of equators on the two-sphere. Our methods involve a new class of functionals on a normed group, which are more general than quasi-morphisms.</description>

      <title>The knot quandles of Suciu's ribbon $n$-knots and automorphisms on the free group of rank two</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Yasuda recently proved that the knot quandles of Suciu's $n$-knots, which share isomorphic knot groups, are mutually non-isomorphic. In this paper, we provide an alternative proof of this result by analyzing the conjugacy classes of certain automorphisms of the free group of rank two.</description>

      <title>On fixed points of pseudo-Anosov maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a formula to estimate the number of fixed points of a pseudo-Anosov homeomorphism of a surface. When the homeomorphism satisfies a mild property called strong irreducibility, the log of the number of fixed points is coarsely equal to the Teichmuller translation length. We also discuss several applications, including an inequality relating the hyperbolic volume of a mapping torus to the rank of its Heegaard Floer homology.</description>

      <title>Explicit Holomorphic Structures for embeddings of closed 3-manifolds into $\mathbb{C}^3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.05672</link>
      <description>arXiv:1912.05672v4 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Expanding on my former work along with the more recent work of Kasuya and Takase, we demonstrate that for a given link $L \subset M$ which is null-homologous in $H_1(M)$ and for any smooth oriented 2-plane field $\eta$ over $L$ there exists a smooth embedding $F:M \hookrightarrow \mathbb{C}^3$ so that the set of complex tangents to the embedding is exactly $L$ and at each $x \in L$ the holomorphic tangent space is exactly $\eta_x$. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the "analyticity" of a complex tangent, as given by the Bishop invariant, may be determined exactly from the angle formed between the holomorphic complex line and the the curve of complex tangents.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03785v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study symmetries in equivariant versions of Khovanov homology, which include (i) the construction of an involution $\widehat{\sigma}$ for the $U(2)$-equivariant theory, (ii) an integral lifting $\widehat{\nu}$ of the Shumakovitch operation $\nu$, and (iii) splitting of the $U(1)$- and $U(1)\times U(1)$-equivariant theories generalizing earlier work over $\mathbb{F}_2$. Finally, we relate these structures to the Rasmussen $s$-invariant over an arbitrary field $F$.</description>

      <title>Covering and labeling generalizations of the Borsuk-Ulam theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove multiple generalizations of Fan's combinatorial labeling result for sphere triangulations. This can be seen as a comprehensive extension of the Borsuk--Ulam theorem. In typical applications, the Borsuk--Ulam theorem gives complexity bounds in a suitable sense, whereas our extension additionally provides insight into the structure of objects satisfying the complexity bound. This structure is governed by order types of finite point sets in Euclidean space and more generally by the intersection combinatorics of faces under continuous maps from the simplex. We develop some of those applications for sphere coverings, Kneser-type colorings, Hall-type results for hypergraphs, and hyperplane mass partitions, among other consequences. We provide a new proof of the topological Hall theorem and extend it into a result that simultaneously generalizes hypergraph Hall theorems and topological lower bounds for chromatic numbers.</description>

      <title>Symplectic configurations: a homological and computer-aided approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulated a homological and computer-aided approach to study certain unions of symplectic surfaces, called symplectic configurations, in a rational $4$-manifold $X=CP^2\# N\overline{CP^2}$. We addressed several fundamental theoretical questions, and also as a technical device, developed a symplectic analog of the so-called quadratic Cremona transformations in complex algebraic geometry. As an application, we gave a new proof that a certain line arrangement in $CP^2$, called Fano planes, does not exist in the symplectic category. The nonexistence of Fano planes in the holomorphic category was due to Hirzebruch, and in the topological category, it was first proved by Ruberman and Starkston. Our proof in the symplectic category is independent to both.</description>

      <title>Some $\ZZ_3^n$-equivariant triangulations of $\CP^n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.2568</link>
      <description>arXiv:1405.2568v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1983, Banchoff and Kuhnel constructed a minimal triangulation of $\CP^2$ with 9 vertices. $\CP^3$ was first triangulated by Bagchi and Datta in 2012 with 18 vertices. Known lower bound on number of vertices of a triangulation of $\CP^n$ is $1 + \frac{(n + 1)^2}{2}$ for $n \geq 3$. We give explicit construction of some triangulations of complex projective space $\CP^n$ with $\frac{4^{n+1}-1}{3}$ vertices for all $n$. No explicit triangulation of $\CP^n$ is known for $n \geq 4$.</description>

      <title>Cobordism of algebraic knots defined by Brieskorn polynomials, II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03662v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In our previous paper, we obtained several results concerning cobordisms of algebraic knots associated with Brieskorn polynomials: for example, under certain conditions, we showed that the exponents are cobordism invariants. In this paper, we further obtain new results concerning the Fox--Milnor type relations, decomposition of the algebraic cobordism class of an algebraic knot associated with a Brieskorn polynomial that has a null-cobordant factor over the field of rational numbers, and cyclic suspensions of knots. As a corollary, we show that a spherical algebraic knot associated with a Brieskorn polynomial has infinite order in the knot cobordism group.</description>

      <title>Lengths of saddle connections on random translation surfaces of large genus</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08727v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We determine the distribution of the number of saddle connections on a random translation surface of large genus. More specifically, for genus $g$ tending to infinity, the number of saddle connections with lengths in a given interval $[\frac{a}{g}, \frac{b}{g}]$ converges in distribution to a Poisson distributed random variable. Furthermore, the numbers of saddle connections associated to disjoint intervals of lengths are independent.</description>

      <title>Twisted torus knots with Horadam parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17850v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sangyop Lee has done much work to determine the knot types of twisted torus knots, including classifying the twisted torus knots which are the unknot. Among the unknotted twisted torus knots are those of the form $K(F_{n+2}, F_n, F_{n+1}, -1)$, where $F_i$ is the $i$th Fibonacci number. Here, we consider twisted torus knots with parameters that are defined recursively, similarly to the Fibonacci sequence. We call these \textit{Horadam parameters}, after the generalization of the Fibonacci sequence introduced by A.F. Horadam. Here, we provide families of twisted torus knots that generalize Lee's work with Horadam parameters. Additionally, we provide lists of primitive/primitive and primitive/Seifert twisted torus knots and connect these lists to the Horadam twisted torus knots.</description>

      <title>Remark on twists of Frobenius algebra and link homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13731v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss twists on Frobenius algebras in the context of link homology. In his paper in 2006, Khovanov asserted that a twist of a Frobenius algebra yields an isomorphic chain complex on each link diagram. Although the result has been widely accepted for nearly two decades, a subtle gap in the original proof was found in the induction step of the construction of the isomorphism. Following discussion with Khovanov, we decided to provide a new proof. Our proof is based on a detailed analysis of configurations of circles in each state.</description>
