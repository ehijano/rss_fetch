      <title>Changes in mesoscale convective system precipitation structures in response to a warming climate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) are crucial components of the hydrological cycle and often produce flash floods. Given their impact, it is crucial to understand how they will change under a warming climate. This study uses a satellite- and radar-based MCS tracking algorithm on convection-permitting climate model simulations and examines changes in MCS properties and precipitation structures between historical and future simulations. An underestimation in MCS total precipitation is evident in historical simulation compared to observations, due to model's depiction of MCS precipitation area and summertime occurrence frequency. Under pseudo-global warming, increases in MCS frequency and total warm season precipitation are observed, most notably in the southern U.S. The precipitation intensity and precipitating area generated by future MCSs also rises and results in an increase in precipitation volume. MCS precipitation structures are further classified into convective core and stratiform regions to understand how change in these structures contributes to future rainfall changes. In a warmer climate, the stratiform region demonstrates minimal change in size, but increases in mean precipitation rate and mean maximum precipitation rate by 15% and 29% are noted, respectively. A more robust future response is observed in the convective core region, with its size, mean precipitation rate and mean maximum precipitation rate increasing significantly by 24%, 37% and 42%, respectively. Finally, by examining the environmental properties of MCS initial condition, future intensification of convective rain may be attributed to a combined effect of substantial increases in atmospheric instability and moisture availability.</description>

      <title>Arabian Sea high salinity core supplies oxygen to Bay of Bengal oxygen minimum zone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) in the Bay of Bengal (BoB) is unique owing to its curious capability to maintain steady dissolved oxygen (DO) levels. In this study, we identify a process by which the oxygen levels in BoB are sustained above the tipping point, using DO and microstructure profiles in the southern BoB and Argo profiles over the entire basin. High salinity core (HSC) rich in DO is advected by the Summer Monsoon Current (SMC) into BoB. Vertical mixing driven by turbulent and salt-fingering processes recharge DO concentration in thermocline above OMZ. HSC identified in the Argo data, also rich in oxygen, can be traced up to 19$^\circ$ N, confirming that HSC is a source of DO and potentially prevents OMZ from moving to the denitrification regime. In changing climate conditions, this might be the only significant oxygen source for the BoB OMZ in the future.</description>

      <title>Probability Estimates of a 21st Century AMOC Collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is increasing concern that the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) may collapse this century with a disrupting societal impact on large parts of the world. Preliminary estimates of the probability of such an AMOC collapse have so far been based on conceptual models and statistical analyses of proxy data. Here, we provide observationally based estimates of such probabilities from reanalysis data. We first identify optimal observation regions of an AMOC collapse from a recent global climate model simulation. Salinity data near the southern boundary of the Atlantic turn out to be optimal to provide estimates of the time of the AMOC collapse in this model. Based on the reanalysis products, we next determine probability density functions of the AMOC collapse time. The collapse time is estimated between 2037-2064 (10-90% CI) with a mean of 2050 and the probability of an AMOC collapse before the year 2050 is estimated to be 59 +/- 17%.</description>

      <title>Climate Change Task Force Report for the American Astronomical Society</title>

Abstract: The AAS Strategic Plan for 2021-26 called for the creation of a task force to identify how the AAS can meet the goals of the Paris Agreement. The AAS and its membership recognize the danger climate change represents to humanity and our world, and to astronomy -- as a profession, a hobby, and a cultural good. Our profession in general -- and the AAS in particular -- should work to make it possible for all astronomers to have an equal opportunity to be successful without needing to incur high carbon emissions, and to preserve astronomy for future generations.
  A study was completed of the carbon emissions associated with the AAS, finding that 84% of total AAS-related emissions are from in-person conferences. We also conducted a survey of AAS members to determine their attitudes about climate change. Respondents overwhelmingly (97%) think that the AAS should reduce its carbon footprint. Our task force created a list of fourteen recommendations, with two ranked as top priorities: The AAS should not schedule additional in-person meetings before 2030 and it should work to innovate the AAS conference model. Based upon our analysis it is clear that online interaction is the only way to increase participation while meaningfully decreasing emissions.
  Our recommendations are aligned with the Astro2020 Decadal Survey as well as AAS values to disseminate our scientific understanding of the universe, and to do our work in an ethically responsible way. Because of their other benefits -- particularly in making our society more welcoming to those who traditionally have been excluded -- we feel that these are sound decisions, worthy of implementation even if the AAS wasn't trying to reduce its carbon footprint. They simply make sense as steps towards a professional society that better serves a broader membership, as our profession evolves to be greener, more inclusive, and more productive.</description>

      <title>General Scintillation for Gaussian Beam Propagating through Oceanic Turbulence and UWOC System Performance Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive a general and exact closed-form expression of scintillation index (SI) for a Gaussian beam propagating through weak oceanic turbulence, based on the general oceanic turbulence optical power spectrum (OTOPS) and the Rytov theory. Our universal expression not only includes existing Rytov variances but also accounts for actual cases where the Kolmogorov microscale is non-zero. The correctness and accuracy of our derivation are verified through comparison with the published work under identical conditions. By utilizing our derived expressions, we analyze the impact of various beam, propagation and oceanic turbulence parameters on both SI and bit error rate (BER) performance of underwater wireless optical communication (UWOC) systems. Numerical results demonstrate that the relationship between the Kolmogorov microscale and SI is nonlinear. Additionally, considering that certain oceanic turbulence parameters are related to depth, we use temperature and salinity data from Argo buoy deployed in real oceans to investigate the dependence of SI on depth. Our findings will contribute to the design and optimization of UWOC systems.</description>

      <title>WeatherQA: Can Multimodal Language Models Reason about Severe Weather?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Severe convective weather events, such as hail, tornadoes, and thunderstorms, often occur quickly yet cause significant damage, costing billions of dollars every year. This highlights the importance of forecasting severe weather threats hours in advance to better prepare meteorologists and residents in at-risk areas. Can modern large foundation models perform such forecasting? Existing weather benchmarks typically focus only on predicting time-series changes in certain weather parameters (e.g., temperature, moisture) with text-only features. In this work, we introduce WeatherQA, the first multimodal dataset designed for machines to reason about complex combinations of weather parameters (a.k.a., ingredients) and predict severe weather in real-world scenarios. The dataset includes over 8,000 (multi-images, text) pairs for diverse severe weather events. Each pair contains rich information crucial for forecasting -- the images describe the ingredients capturing environmental instability, surface observations, and radar reflectivity, and the text contains forecast analyses written by human experts. With WeatherQA, we evaluate state-of-the-art vision language models , including GPT4, Claude3, Gemini-1.5, and a fine-tuned Llama3-based VLM, by designing two challenging tasks: (1) multi-choice QA for predicting affected area and (2) classification of the development potential of severe convection. These tasks require deep understanding of domain knowledge (e.g., atmospheric dynamics) and complex reasoning over multimodal data (e.g., interactions between weather parameters). We show a substantial gap between the strongest VLM, GPT4o, and human reasoning. Our comprehensive case study with meteorologists further reveals the weaknesses of the models, suggesting that better training and data integration are necessary to bridge this gap.

      <title>Quantum Algorithm for a Stochastic Multicloud Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computers have attracted much attention in recent years. This may be because the development of the actual quantum machine is accelerating. Research on how to use quantum computers is active in the fields such as quantum chemistry and machine learning, where vast amounts of computation are required. However, in weather and climate simulations, less research has been done despite similar computational demands. In this study, a quantum computing algorithm was applied to a problem of the atmospheric science to demonstrate that it can achieve the same simulations as a conventional algorithm designed for the classical computers. More specifically, the stochastic nature of a multi-cloud model was reproduced by utilizing probabilistic outputs of computed quantum states. Our results demonstrate that quantum computers can suitably solve some problems in atmospheric and oceanic phenomena, in which stochasticity is widely inherent.</description>

      <title>DustNet: skillful neural network predictions of Saharan dust</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Suspended in the atmosphere are millions of tonnes of mineral dust which interacts with weather and climate. Accurate representation of mineral dust in weather models is vital, yet remains challenging. Large scale weather models use high power supercomputers and take hours to complete the forecast. Such computational burden allows them to only include monthly climatological means of mineral dust as input states inhibiting their forecasting accuracy. Here, we introduce DustNet a simple, accurate and super fast forecasting model for 24-hours ahead predictions of aerosol optical depth AOD. DustNet trains in less than 8 minutes and creates predictions in 2 seconds on a desktop computer. Created by DustNet predictions outperform the state-of-the-art physics-based model on coarse 1 x 1 degree resolution at 95% of grid locations when compared to ground truth satellite data. Our results show DustNet has a potential for fast and accurate AOD forecasting which could transform our understanding of dust impacts on weather patterns.</description>

      <title>Regularization of the ensemble Kalman filter using a non-parametric, non-stationary spatial model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.14318v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The sample covariance matrix of a random vector is a good estimate of the true covariance matrix if the sample size is much larger than the length of the vector. In high-dimensional problems, this condition is never met. As a result, in high dimensions the Ensemble Kalman Filter's (EnKF) ensemble does not contain enough information to specify the prior covariance matrix accurately. This necessitates the need for regularization of the analysis (observation update) problem. We propose a regularization technique based on a new spatial model. The model is a constrained version of the general Gaussian process convolution model. The constraints include local stationarity and smoothness of local spectra. We regularize EnKF by postulating that its prior covariances obey the spatial model. Placing a hyperprior distribution on the model parameters and using the likelihood of the prior ensemble data allows for an optimized use of both the ensemble and the hyperprior. The respective estimator is shown to be consistent. Its neural Bayes implementation proved to be both accurate and computationally efficient. In simulation experiments, the new technique led to substantially better EnKF performance than several existing techniques.</description>

      <title>Effect of rotation on wake vortices in stratified flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02089v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stratified wakes past an isolated conical seamount are simulated at a Froude number of $Fr = 0.15$ and Rossby numbers of $Ro = 0.15$, 0.75, and $\infty$. The wakes exhibit a K{\' a}rm{\' a}n vortex street, unlike their unstratified, non-rotating counterpart. Vortex structures are studied in terms of large-scale global modes, as well as spatially localised vortex evolution, with a focus on rotation effects. The global modes are extracted by spectral proper orthogonal decomposition (SPOD). For all three studied $Ro$ ranging from mesoscale, submesoscale, and non-rotating cases, the frequency of the SPOD modes at different heights remains coupled as a global constant. However, the shape of the SPOD modes changes from slanted `tongues' at zero rotation ($Ro=\infty$) to tall hill-height columns at strong rotation ($Ro=0.15$). A novel method for vortex centre tracking shows that, in all three cases, the vortices at different heights advect uniformly at about $ 0.9U_{\infty}$ beyond the near wake, consistent with the lack of variability of the global modes. Under system rotation, cyclonic vortices (CVs) and anticyclonic vortices (AVs) present considerable asymmetry, especially at $Ro = 0.75$. The vorticity distribution as well as the stability of AVs are tracked downstream using statistics conditioned to the identified vortex centres. At $Ro=0.75$, intense AVs with relative vorticity up to $\omega_z/f_{\rm c}=-2.4$ are seen with small regions of instability but all AVs evolve towards a more stable state. Recent stability analysis that accounts for stratification and viscosity is found to improve on earlier criteria.</description>
