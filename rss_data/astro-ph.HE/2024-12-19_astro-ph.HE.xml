      <title>Revisiting the Suzaku spectrum of the Galactic SNR W 49 B: non-detection of iron K-shell charge exchange emission and refined ejecta mass ratios of iron-group elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of the recombining plasma in several Galactic SNRs has been debated. A plausible mechanism would be a rapid cooling in the past, either by adiabatic or conductive process. A recent spectral study of W 49 B reported a possible charge exchange (CX) emission due to collisions between the shock-heated ejecta and external cold clouds, which could be a direct support for the conduction cooling scenario. However, a potentially large systematic uncertainty in the spectral analysis has not been examined. In this paper, we revisit the Suzaku spectrum of W 49 B with taking into account the systematic uncertainties in spectral codes and instrumental gain calibration. We find that the previously reported CX flux is fully attributable to dielectronic recombination satellite lines of high-shell transitions that are missing from the present version of the spectral codes. We also report refined Fe-group ejecta mass ratios, which, in comparison to those in the literatures, show a better agreement with theoretical expectations from nucleosynthesis models, either of Type Ia explosions or spherical core-collapse explosions.</description>

      <title>Polarized multiwavelength emission from pulsar wind - accretion disk interaction in a transitional millisecond pulsar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transitional millisecond pulsars (tMSPs) bridge the evolutionary gap between accreting neutron stars in low-mass X-ray binaries and millisecond radio pulsars. These systems exhibit a unique subluminous X-ray state characterized by the presence of an accretion disk and rapid switches between high and low X-ray emission modes. The high mode features coherent millisecond pulsations spanning from the X-ray to the optical band. We present multiwavelength polarimetric observations of the tMSP PSR J1023+0038 aimed at conclusively identifying the physical mechanism powering its emission in the subluminous X-ray state. During the high mode, we detect polarized emission in the 2-6 keV energy range, with a polarization degree of 12% +/- 3% and a polarization angle of -2deg +/- 9deg (1sigma) measured counterclockwise from the North celestial pole towards East. At optical wavelengths, we find a polarization degree of 1.41% +/- 0.04% and a polarization angle aligned with that in the soft X-rays, suggesting a common physical mechanism operating across these bands. Remarkably, the polarized flux spectrum matches the pulsed emission spectrum from optical to X-rays. The polarization properties differ markedly from those observed in other accreting neutron stars and isolated rotation-powered pulsars and are also inconsistent with an origin in a compact jet. Our results provide direct evidence that the polarized and pulsed emissions both originate from synchrotron radiation at the shock formed where the pulsar wind interacts with the inner regions of the accretion disk.</description>

      <title>Isolated Binary Black Hole Formation and Merger Rates from Galaxy Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) collaboration has detected 90 gravitational wave events and will detect many more in its fourth observing run. Binary black hole (BBH) systems represent the overwhelming majority of these observations. We build a model for the population of the BBHs based on the observed distribution of metallicities in galaxies and state-of-the-art stellar evolution models implemented through the Stellar EVolution N-body (SEVN) code. We calculate the primary mass spectrum and merger rates of BBHs and find general agreement with the redshift evolution and mass ratio distribution inferred by the LVK collaboration. When comparing to the primary mass distribution, our results indicate that either the average IMF in dwarf galaxies must be top heavy, or most of the $30-40 \, M_\odot$ black holes must be formed through a dynamical capture mechanism. For masses greater than about $50 \, M_\odot$, the predicted number of BBH systems plummet to zero, revealing the well-known mass gap due to the pair instability mechanism and the mass loss in binary systems. We estimate the probability needed to fill part of the mass gap with mergers of dynamically-formed BBHs originating from the single black hole population.</description>

      <title>An improved method to search for flares from point sources of ultra-high-energy photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flares produced by certain classes of astrophysical objects may be sources of some ultra-high-energy particles, which, if they are photons, would group into clusters of events correlated in space and time. Identification of such clustering in cosmic-ray data would provide important evidence for possible existence of ultra-high-energy (UHE) photons and could potentially help identify their sources. We present an analysis method to search for space-time clustering of ultra-high-energy extensive air showers, namely the stacking method, which combines a time-clustering algorithm with an unbinned likelihood study. In addition, to enhance the capability to discriminate between signal (photon-initiated events) and background (hadron-initiated) events, we apply a photon tag. This involves using relevant probability distribution functions to classify each event as more likely to be either a photon or a hadron. We demonstrate that the stacking method can effectively distinguish between events initiated by photons and those initiated by hadrons (background). The number of photon events in a data sample, as well as the flare(s) duration can also be retrieved correctly. The stacking method with a photon tag requires only a few events to identify a photon flare. This method can be used to search for the cosmic ray sources and/or improve limits on the fluxes of UHE photons.</description>

      <title>X-ray pulsed light curves of highly compact neutron stars as probes of scalar-tensor theories of gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The strong gravitational potential of neutron stars (NSs) makes them ideal astrophysical objects for testing extreme gravity phenomena. We explore the potential of NS X-ray pulsed lightcurve observations to probe deviations from general relativity (GR) within the scalar-tensor theory (STT) of gravity framework. We compute the flux from a single, circular, finite-size hot spot, accounting for light bending, Shapiro time delay, and Doppler effect. We focus on the high-compactness regime, i.e., close to the critical GR value GM/(Rc^2) = 0.284, over which multiple images of the spot appear and impact crucially the lightcurve. Our investigation is motivated by the increased sensitivity of the pulse to the scalar charge of the spacetime in such high compactness regimes, making these systems exceptionally suitable for scrutinizing deviations from GR, notably phenomena such as spontaneous scalarization, as predicted by STT. We find significant differences in NS observables, e.g., the flux of a single spot can differ up to 80% with respect to GR. Additionally, reasonable choices for the STT parameters that satisfy astrophysical constraints lead to changes in the NS radius relative to GR of up to approximately 10%. Consequently, scalar parameters might be better constrained when uncertainties in NS radii decrease, where this could occur with the advent of next-generation gravitational wave detectors, such as the Einstein Telescope and LISA, as well as future electromagnetic missions like eXTP and ATHENA. Thus, our findings suggest that accurate X-ray data of the NS surface emission, jointly with refined theoretical models, could constrain STTs.</description>

      <title>X-ray Binaries: a potential dominant contributor to the cosmic ray spectral knee structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: "PeVatrons" refer to astrophysical sources capable of accelerating particles to energies $\sim$PeV and higher, potentially contributing to the cosmic ray spectrum in the knee region. Recently, HAWC and LHAASO have discovered a new type PeVatrons -- X-ray binaries, allowing us to investigate in greater depth of the contributions of these sources to cosmic rays around the knee region. There are hundreds of X-ray binaries in our galaxy observed, which are potential PeVatrons. In this work, we derive the radial distribution of X-ray binaries in the Galaxy. Then we use the DRAGON package to simulate this distribution, and calculate energy spectrum, anisotropy of cosmic rays as well as the resulting diffuse gamma ray emissions, after considering them as factories of cosmic rays in the knee energy bands. our findings show that the contribution from the X-ray binaries, especially microquarsars, may be dominant. More microquasar PeVatrons can be observed by LHAASO and HAWC in the future, and will confirm the contribution of microquasars to high energy cosmic rays.</description>

      <title>Measuring the Transverse Velocity of Strongly Lensed Gravitational Wave Sources with Ground Based Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations of strongly gravitationally lensed gravitational wave (GW) sources provide a unique opportunity for constraining their transverse motion, which otherwise is exceedingly hard for GW mergers in general. Strong lensing makes this possible when two or more images of the lensed GW source are observed, as each image essentially allows the observer to see the GW source from different directional lines-of-sight. If the GW source is moving relative to the lens and observer, the observed GW signal from one image will therefore generally appear blue- or redshifted compared to GW signal from the other image. This velocity induced differential Doppler shift gives rise to an observable GW phase shift between the GW signals from the different images, which provides a rare glimpse into the relative motion of GW sources and their host environment across redshift. We illustrate that detecting such GW phase shifts is within reach of next-generation ground-based detectors such as Einstein Telescope, that is expected to detect $\sim$hundreds of lensed GW mergers per year. This opens up completely new ways of inferring the environment of GW sources, as well as studying cosmological velocity flows across redshift.</description>

      <title>Angular Distribution of Gamma Rays Produced in Proton-Proton Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate modeling of how high-energy proton-proton collisions produce gamma rays through the decays of pions and other secondaries is needed to correctly interpret astrophysical observations with the Fermi-LAT telescope. In the existing literature on cosmic-ray collisions with gas, the focus is on the gamma-ray yield spectrum, $d N_\gamma/dE$. However, in some situations, the joint energy and angular distribution can be observed, so one needs instead $d^2 N_\gamma/dE \, d\Omega$. We provide calculations of this distribution over the energy range from the pion production threshold to $100~{\rm GeV}$, basing our results on FLUKA simulations. We provide the results in tabular form and provide a Python tool on GitHub to aid in utilization. We also provide an approximate analytic formula that illuminates the underlying physics. We discuss simplified examples where this angular dependence can be observed to illustrate the necessity of taking the joint distribution into account.</description>

      <title>Time-delayed gamma-ray signatures of heavy axions from core-collapse supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heavy axions that couple to both quantum electrodynamics and quantum chromodynamics with masses on the order of MeV - GeV and high-scale decay constants in excess of $\sim$$10^8$ GeV may arise generically in e.g. axiverse constructions. In this work we provide the most sensitive search to-date for the existence of such heavy axions using Fermi-LAT data towards four recent supernovae (SN): Cas A, SN1987A, SN2023ixf, and SN2024ggi. We account for heavy axion production in the proto-neutron-star cores through nuclear and electromagnetic processes and then the subsequent decay of the axions into photons. While previous works have searched for gamma-rays from SN1987A using the Solar Maximum Mission that observed SN1987A during the SN itself, we show that using Fermi Large Area Telescope data provides an approximately five orders of magnitude improvement in flux sensitivity for axions with lifetimes larger than around 10 years. We find no evidence for heavy axions and exclude large regions of previously-unexplored parameter space.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Escaping Direct Detection Runs into Higgs Mass Hierarchy Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The current generation of Dark Matter Direct Detection Experiments has ruled out a large region of parameter space for dark matter, particularly in the ($10 - 1000$) GeV mass range. However, due to very low event rates, searching for dark matter in the heavy mass range, $\mathcal{O}$(TeV), is a daunting task requiring even larger volume detectors and long exposure times. We show that for a broad class of dark matter models of the type that these experiments are searching, including some of the most popular candidates, the heavy dark matter mass range can be ruled out in its entirety once we take into account the large corrections to Higgs mass imparted by such heavy dark matter. We show that such a limit is applicable to all types of dark matter i.e. scalar, vector, and fermionic, provided they couple directly with Higgs. By taking some simple and well studied dark matter models we show that the latest LZ limits can completely rule out such a dark matter except in a narrow range around $M_h/2$ mass.</description>

      <title>Spin-dependent Regge-Wheeler Potential and QNMs in Quantum Corrected AdS Black Hole with Phantom Global Monopoles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the geodesic motion of test particles in the spacetime surrounding a static, spherically symmetric black hole, which is described by an AdS-Schwarzschild-like metric and incorporates a quantum correction. This black hole also features phantom global monopoles, which modify the structure of the black hole space-time. We begin by deriving the effective potential governing the motion of test particles in this system and carefully analyze the impact of quantum correction in the presence of both phantom and ordinary global monopoles. Furthermore, we extend our study to include the spin-dependent Regge-Wheeler (RW) potential, which characterizes the dynamics of perturbations in this quantum-corrected black hole background. By examining this RW potential for various spin fields, we show how quantum corrections affect its form in the presence of both phantom and ordinary global monopoles. Our analysis demonstrate that quantum correction significantly alter the nature of the RW-potential, influencing the stability, and behavior of test particles and perturbations around the black hole.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the effect of a Chaplygin dark fluid (CDF) core on neutron stars (NSs). To address this study, we focus on the relativistic structure of stellar configurations composed by a dark-energy core, described by a Chaplygin-like equation of state (EoS), and an ordinary-matter crust which is described by a polytropic EoS. We examine the impact of the rate of energy densities at the discontinuous surface, defined as $\alpha= \rho_{\rm dis}^-/\rho_{\rm dis}^+$, on the radius, total gravitational mass, oscillation spectrum and tidal deformability. Furthermore, we compare our theoretical predictions with several observational mass-radius measurements and tidal deformability constraints. These comparisons together with the radial stability analysis show that the existence of NSs with a dark-energy core is possible.</description>

      <title>Non-locality in Quadrupolar Gravitational Radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: General Relativity suffers for two main problems which have not yet been overcome: it predicts spacetime singularities and cannot be formulated as a perturbative renormalizable theory. In particular, many attempts have been made for avoiding singularities, such as considering higher order or infinite derivative theories. The price to pay in both cases is to give up locality and therefore they are known altogether as non-local theories of gravity. In this paper, we investigate how to recognize the presence of non-local effects by exploiting the power emitted by gravitational waves in a binary system in presence of non-local corrections as $R\Box^{-1}R$ to the Hilbert-Einstein action. After solving the field equations in terms of the source stress-energy tensor $T_{\mu\nu}$ and obtaining the gravitational wave stress-energy pseudo-tensor, $\tau_{\mu\nu}$, we find that the General Relativity quadrupole formula is modified in a non-trivial way, making it feasible to find a possible signature of non-locality. Our final results on the gravitational wave stress-energy pseudo-tensor could also be applied to several astrophysical scenarios involving energy or momentum loss, potentially providing multiple tests for non-local deviations from General Relativity. We finally discuss the detectability of the massless transverse scalar mode, discovering that, although this radiation is extremely weak, in a small range around the model divergence, its amplitude could fall within the low-frequency Einstein Telescope sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Detached Circumstellar Matter as an Explanation for Slowly-Rising Interacting Type Ibc Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02566v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Some hydrogen-poor (Type Ibc) supernovae (SNe) are known to have massive circumstellar matter (CSM) that are well detached from the star. Using the open-source code CHIPS, we construct a grid of models of SN Ibc interacting with detached CSM, inspired by a recently proposed scenario of such CSM generated by a mass eruption and feedback process from the leftover star. We find that interaction with detached CSM can produce a slowly rising phase in the light curve seen in some interacting SN Ibc, which is difficult to reproduce by interaction with continuously distributed CSM down to the star. We also show that SNe having double peaks in their light curves with timescales of months (e.g., SN 2022xxf) can be explained by radioactive decay of $^{56}$Ni/$^{56}$Co, followed by interaction with detached CSM.</description>

      <title>Three-flavor, Full Momentum Space Neutrino Spin Oscillations in Neutron Star Mergers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08159v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the presence of anisotropic neutrino and antineutrino fluxes, the quantum kinetic equations drive coherent oscillations in neutrino helicity, frequently referred to as spin oscillations. These oscillations depend directly on the absolute mass scale and Majorana phase, but are usually too transient to produce important effects. In this paper we present a full momentum-space analysis of Majorana neutrino spin oscillations in a snapshot of a three-dimensional neutron star merger simulation. We find an interesting angular dependence that allows for that resonant and adiabatic oscillations to occur along specific directions in a large volume of the merger remnant. The solid angle spanned by these directions is extremely narrow in general. We then analyze spin transformation in the presence of flavor transformation by characterizing how the effect's resonance and timescale change during a fast flavor instability. For this analysis, we derive a generalized resonance condition that poses a restrictive requirement for resonance to exist in any flavor channel. We determine that spin oscillations at all locations in the merger snapshot have a length scale that is too large for significant oscillations to be expected even where there exist resonant and adiabatic directions.</description>

      <title>$\texttt{AXP4}$, a Numerical Simulator of Pulse Profiles for Binary Accreting X-ray Pulsars $-$ I: Beam Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07509v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper presents model pulse profiles from binary accreting X-ray pulsars using high-resolution numerical simulations for pencil and fan emission beam geometries, each with two different optical depths obtained using a new numerical code $\texttt{AXP4}$ developed in this work. Sharp, pointed-peak improvements are obtained in the known flat-top pulse profiles by extrapolating the model emission functions available in the literature over the full range of emission angles for a realistic description. The effect of general relativistic bending of light due to the strong gravity near the neutron star is taken into account, updating previous attempts with new analytic approximations for photon trajectories in curved space-time reported in the literature (including additional flux contribution from the dark unseen face of the pulsar). Incorporating the other general relativistic effect of gravitational red-shift is seen to redden the pulsar beam to increasingly lower energies along the X-ray observing band. Integrating this emission over a circular slab geometry for two antipodal hotspots lying flush at the neutron star polar caps presents smoothened, composite gravitationally bent pulse profiles to the observer. A comparison between the corresponding non-normalized flux profiles is included. For theoretical completeness and reference base, this treatment is applied to isotropic emitters with uniform injection and limb-darkened beams, as well. The possibility of the production of Einstein rings around a pulsar for a limiting value of the compactness parameter is a distinctive feature.</description>

      <title>ZTF SN Ia DR2: The diversity and relative rates of the thermonuclear SN population</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04200v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Zwicky Transient Facility SN Ia Data Release 2 (ZTF SN Ia DR2) contains more than 3,000 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), providing the largest homogeneous low-redshift sample of SNe Ia. Having at least one spectrum per event, this data collection is ideal for large-scale statistical studies of the photometric, spectroscopic and host-galaxy properties of SNe Ia, particularly of the more rare "peculiar" subclasses. In this paper, we first present the method we developed to spectroscopically classify the SNe in the sample, and the techniques we used to model their multi-band light curves and explore their photometric properties. We then show a method to distinguish between the "peculiar" subtypes and the normal SNe Ia. We also explore the properties of their host galaxies and estimate their relative rates, focusing on the "peculiar" subtypes and their connection to the cosmologically useful SNe Ia. Finally, we discuss the implications of our study with respect to the progenitor systems of the "peculiar" SN Ia events.</description>

      <title>Panning for gold with the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory: an optimal strategy for finding the counterparts to gravitational wave events</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05072v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The LIGO, Virgo and KAGRA gravitational wave observatories are currently undertaking their O4 observing run offering the opportunity to discover new electromagnetic counterparts to gravitational wave events. We examine the capability of the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory (Swift) to respond to these triggers, primarily binary neutron star mergers, with both the UV/Optical Telescope (UVOT) and the X-ray Telescope (XRT). We simulate Swift's response to a trigger under different strategies using model skymaps, convolving these with the 2MPZ catalogue to produce an ordered list of observing fields, deriving the time taken for Swift to reach the correct field and simulating the instrumental responses to modelled kilonovae and short gamma-ray burst afterglows. We find that UVOT using the $u$ filter with an exposure time of order 120 s is optimal for most follow-up observations and that we are likely to detect counterparts in $\sim6$% of all binary neutron star triggers detectable by LVK in O4. We find that the gravitational wave 90% error area and measured distance to the trigger allow us to select optimal triggers to follow-up. Focussing on sources less than 300 Mpc away or 500 Mpc if the error area is less than a few hundred square degrees, distances greater than previously assumed, offer the best opportunity for discovery by Swift with $\sim5 - 30$% of triggers having detection probabilities $\geq 0.5$. At even greater distances, we can further optimise our follow-up by adopting a longer 250 s or 500 s exposure time.</description>

      <title>Observation of a spectral hardening in cosmic ray boron spectrum with the DAMPE space mission</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11460v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Secondary cosmic ray fluxes are important probes of the propagation and interaction of high-energy particles in the Galaxy. Recent measurements of primary and secondary cosmic ray nuclei have revealed unexpected spectral features that demand a deeper understanding. In this work we report the direct measurement of the cosmic ray boron spectrum from 10 GeV/n to 8 TeV/n with eight years of data collected by the Dark Matter Particle Explorer (DAMPE) mission. The measured spectrum shows an evident hardening at $182\pm24$ GeV/n with a spectral power index of $\gamma_1 = 3.02 \pm 0.01$ before the break and an index change of $\Delta \gamma = 0.31 \pm 0.05$ after the break. A simple power law model is disfavored at a confidence level of 8$\sigma$. Compared with the hardenings measured in the DAMPE proton and helium spectra, the secondary boron spectrum hardens roughly twice as much as these primaries, which is consistent with a propagation related mechanism to interpret the spectral hardenings of cosmic rays observed at hundreds of GeV/n.</description>

Abstract: In this document we consider the problem of finding the optimal layout for the array of water Cherenkov detectors proposed by the SWGO collaboration to study very-high-energy gamma rays in the southern hemisphere. We develop a continuous model of the secondary particles produced by atmospheric showers initiated by high-energy gamma rays and protons, and build an optimization pipeline capable of identifying the most promising configuration of the detector elements. The pipeline employs stochastic gradient descent to maximize a utility function aligned with the scientific goals of the experiment. We demonstrate how the software is capable of finding the global maximum in the high-dimensional parameter space, and discuss its performance and limitations.</description>

      <title>Fundamental MHD scales -- II: the kinematic phase of the supersonic small-scale dynamo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17036v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many astrophysical small-scale dynamos (SSDs) amplify weak magnetic fields via highly compressible, supersonic turbulence, but established SSD theories have overlooked these compressible effects. To address this, we perform visco-resistive SSD simulations across a range of sonic Mach numbers ($\mathcal{M}$), hydrodynamic Reynolds numbers ($\mathrm{Re}$), and magnetic Prandtl numbers ($\mathrm{Pm}$). We develop robust methods to measure kinetic and magnetic energy dissipation scales ($\ell_\nu$ and $\ell_\eta$) and the scale of strongest magnetic fields ($\ell_\mathrm{p}$) during the kinematic phase. We demonstrate that $\ell_\nu/\ell_\eta \sim \mathrm{Pm}^{1/2}$ is a universal feature for $\mathrm{Pm} \geq 1$ SSDs, regardless of $\mathcal{M}$ or $\mathrm{Re}$. Incompressible SSDs (either $\mathcal{M} \leq 1$ or $\mathrm{Re} &lt; \mathrm{Re}\mathrm{crit} \approx 100$) concentrate magnetic energy at $\ell_\mathrm{p} \sim \ell_\eta$ with inversely correlated field strength and curvature. However, for compressible SSDs ($\mathcal{M} &gt; 1$ and $\mathrm{Re} &gt; \mathrm{Re}\mathrm{crit}$), shocks concentrate magnetic energy in large structures with $\ell_\mathrm{p} \sim (\ell_\mathrm{turb} / \ell_\mathrm{shock})^{1/3} \ell_\eta \gg \ell_\eta$, where $\ell_\mathrm{shock}$ is the characteristic shock width, and $\ell_\mathrm{turb}$ is the outer scale of the turbulent field. In this regime, magnetic field-line curvature becomes nearly independent of field strength. These results have implications for galaxy mergers and cosmic ray transport models in the interstellar medium.</description>

      <title>Partial alignment between jets and megamasers: Coherent versus selective accretion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18002v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spins play a crucial role in the appearance, evolution, and occupation fraction of massive black holes (MBHs). To date, observational estimates of MBH spins are scarce, and the assumptions commonly made in such estimates have recently been questioned. Similarly, theoretical models for MBH spin evolution, while reproducing the few observational constraints, are based on possibly oversimplified assumptions. New independent constraints on MBH spins are therefore of primary importance. We present a rigorous statistical analysis of the relative orientation of radio jets and megamaser disks in ten low-redshift galaxies. We find a strong preference for (partial) alignment between jets and megamaser that can be attributed to two different causes: coherent accretion and selective accretion. In the first case the partial alignment is due to an anisotropy in the gas reservoir fueling the growth of MBHs. In the second case the spin-dependent anisotropic feedback allows long-lived accretion only if the orbits of the gas inflows are almost aligned to the MBH equatorial plane. A discussion of the implications of the two accretion scenarios regarding the evolution of MBHs is presented, together with an outlook on future observational tests aiming at discriminating between the two scenarios and checking whether either applies to different redshifts and black hole mass regimes.</description>

Abstract: Gravitational wave observations of black hole-neutron star binaries, particularly those where the black hole has a lower mass compared to other observed systems, have the potential to place strong constraints on modifications to general relativity that arise at small curvature length scales. Here we study the dynamics of black hole-neutron star mergers in shift-symmetric Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity, a representative example of such a theory, by numerically evolving the full equations of motion. We consider quasi-circular binaries with different mass-ratios that are consistent with recent gravitational wave observations, including cases with and without tidal disruption of the star, and quantify the impact of varying the coupling controlling deviations from general relativity on the gravitational wave signal and scalar radiation. We find that the main effect on the late inspiral is the accelerated frequency evolution compared to general relativity, and that--even considering Gauss-Bonnet coupling values approaching those where the theory breaks down--the impact on the merger gravitational wave signal is mild, predominately manifesting as a small change in the amplitude of the ringdown. We compare our results to current post-Newtonian calculations and find consistency throughout the inspiral.</description>

Abstract: We compute the $^{63}$Ga(p,$\gamma$)$^{64}$Ge and $^{64}$Ge(p,$\gamma$)$^{65}$As thermonuclear reaction rates using the latest experimental input supplemented with theoretical nuclear spectroscopic information. The experimental input consists of the latest proton thresholds of $^{64}$Ge and $^{65}$As, and the nuclear spectroscopic information of $^{65}$As, whereas the theoretical nuclear spectroscopic information for $^{64}$Ge and $^{65}$As are deduced from the full pf-shell space configuration-interaction shell-model calculations with the GXPF1A Hamiltonian. Both thermonuclear reaction rates are determined with known uncertainties at the energies that correspond to the Gamow windows of the temperature regime relevant to Type I X-ray bursts, covering the typical temperature range of the thermonuclear runaway of the GS 1826$-$24 periodic bursts and SAX J1808.4$-$3658 photospheric radius expansion bursts.</description>

      <title>Y Gem, a symbiotic star outshone by its asymptotic giant branch primary component</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14270v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A considerable number of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars exhibit UV excess and/or X-ray emission that indicates a binary companion. AGB stars are so bright that they easily outshine their companions. This almost prevents their identification. Y Gem has been known for some decades to be an AGB star that is bright in the far-UV and X-rays, but it is unclear whether its companion is a main-sequence star or a white dwarf (WD) in a symbiotic system (SySt). Our goal is to uncover the true nature of Y Gem, which will help us to study the possible misidentified population of SySts. Multiwavelength IR, optical, UV, and X-ray observations were analyzed to investigate the properties of the stellar components and the accretion process in Y Gem. In particular, an optical spectrum of Y Gem is presented here for the first time, while X-ray data are interpreted by means of reflection models produced by an accretion disk and material in its vicinity. The optical spectrum exhibits the typical sawtooth-shaped features of molecular absorptions in addition to narrow recombination and forbidden emission lines. The emission lines and the analysis of the extinction-corrected UV spectrum suggest a hot component with $T_\mathrm{eff}\approx$60,000 K, $L$=140 L$_{\odot}$, and $R$=0.11 R$_{\odot}$ that very likely is an accreting WD. The late component is found to be an 1.1 M$_\odot$ AGB star with $T_\mathrm{eff}$=3350 K and $R$=240 R$_\odot$. Using IR, optical, UV, and X-ray data, we found that Y Gem is an S-type SySt whose compact component is accreting at an estimated mass-accretion rate of $\dot{M}_\mathrm{acc}=2.3\times10^{-7}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. At this accretion rate, the accreting WD has reached the stable and steady burning phase in which no recurrent events are expected.</description>

Abstract: One of the most exciting elements of cosmology is researching the potential of anisotropy in the early cosmos. We examine the expansion of the cosmos over time using an anisotropic Bianchi type-I spacetime subjected to the $f(Q)$ gravity. We do this by limiting the number of cosmological parameters used. The approach, we used is known as CoLFI, which stands for "Estimating Cosmological Parameters with deep learning." This paper presents a revolutionary deep learning-based technique to the parameter inference. The deep learning methodology clearly outperforms the MCMC method in terms of best-fit values, parameter errors, and correlations between parameters. This is the result of comparing the two different ways. Moreover, we obtained the transition redshift $z_{t} = 0.63$ which leads the transitioning model of the Universe from early deceleration to current acceleration phase. The dynamics of jerk parameter and validation of energy conditions of the model are also discussed.</description>
