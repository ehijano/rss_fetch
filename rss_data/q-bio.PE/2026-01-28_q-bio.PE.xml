      <title>LvD: A New Algorithm for Computing the Likelihood of a Phylogeny</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are few, if any, algorithms in statistical phylogenetics which are used more heavily than Felsenstein's 1973 pruning method for computing the likelihood of a tree. We present LvD, (Likelihood via Decomposition), an alternative to Felsenstein's algorithm based on a different decomposition of the underlying phylogeny. It works for all standard nucleotide models. The new algorithm allows updates of the likelihood calculation in worst case $O(\log n)$ time with $n$ taxa, as opposed to worst case $O(n)$ time for existing methods. In practice this leads to appreciable improvements in likelihood calculations, the extent of speed-up depending on how balanced or unbalanced the trees are. We explore implications for parallel computing, and show that the approach allows likelihoods to be computed in $O(\log n)$ parallel time per site, compared to (worst case) $O(n)$ time. We implemented and applied the algorithm to large numbers of simulated and empirical data sets and showed that these theoretical advances lead to a significant practical speed-up, although the extent of the improvement depends on how balanced the phylogenies already are.</description>

      <title>Long-term evolution of regulatory DNA sequences. Part 1: Simulations on global, biophysically-realistic genotype-phenotype maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Promoters and enhancers are cis-regulatory elements (CREs), DNA sequences that bind transcription factor (TF) proteins to up- or down-regulate target genes. Decades-long efforts yielded TF-DNA interaction models that predict how strongly an individual TF binds arbitrary DNA sequences and how individual binding events on the CRE combine to affect gene expression. These insights can be synthesized into a global, biophysically-realistic, and quantitative genotype-phenotype (GP) map for gene regulation, a "holy grail" for the application of evolutionary theory. A global map provides a rare opportunity to simulate long-term evolution of regulatory sequences and pose several fundamental questions: How long does it take to evolve CREs de novo? How many non-trivial regulatory functions exist in sequence space? How connected are they? For which regulatory architecture is CRE evolution most rapid and evolvable? In this article, the first of a two-part series, we briefly review the pertinent modeling and simulation efforts for a unique system that enables close, quantitative, and mechanistic links between biophysics, as well as systems, synthetic, and evolutionary biology.</description>

      <title>LabelKAN -- Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks for Inter-Label Learning: Avian Community Learning</title>

Abstract: Global biodiversity loss is accelerating, prompting international efforts such as the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals to direct resources toward halting species declines. A key challenge in achieving this goal is having access to robust methodologies to understand where species occur and how they relate to each other within broader ecological communities. Recent deep learning-based advances in joint species distribution modeling have shown improved predictive performance, but effectively incorporating community-level learning, taking into account species-species relationships in addition to species-environment relationships, remains an outstanding challenge. We introduce LabelKAN, a novel framework based on Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) to learn inter-label connections from predictions of each label. When modeling avian species distributions, LabelKAN achieves substantial gains in predictive performance across the vast majority of species. In particular, our method demonstrates strong improvements for rare and difficult-to-predict species, which are often the most important when setting biodiversity targets under frameworks like GBF. These performance gains also translate to more confident predictions of the species spatial patterns as well as more confident predictions of community structure. We illustrate how the LabelKAN leads to qualitative and quantitative improvements with a focused application on the Great Blue Heron, an emblematic species in freshwater ecosystems that has experienced significant population declines across the United States in recent years. Using the LabelKAN framework, we are able to identify communities and species in New York that will be most sensitive to further declines in Great Blue Heron populations.</description>

      <title>Classical JAK2V617F+ Myeloproliferative Neoplasms emergence and development based on real life incidence and mathematical modeling</title>

Abstract: Mathematical modeling allows us to better understand myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), a group of blood cancers, emergence and development. We test different mathematical models on an initial cohort to determine the emergence and evolution times before diagnosis of JAK2V617F+ classical MPN (Polycythemia Vera (PV) and Essential Thrombocythemia (ET)). We consider the time before diagnosis as the sum of two independent periods: the time (from embryonic development) for the JAK2V617F mutation to occur, not disappear and enter proliferation, and a second time corresponding to the expansion of the clonal population until diagnosis. We prove that the rate of active mutation occurrence increases exponentially with age following the Gompertz model rather than being constant. We find that the first tumorous cell takes an average time of $63.1 \pm 13$ years to appear and start proliferation. On the other hand, the expansion time is constant: $8.8$ years once the mutation has emerged. These results are validated in an external cohort. Using this model, we analyze JAK2V617F ET versus PV, and obtain that the time of active mutation occurrence for PV takes approximately $1.5$ years more than for ET to develop, while the expansion time was similar. In conclusion, our age-dependent approach for the emergence and development of MPN demonstrates that the emergence of a JAKV617F mutation should be linked to an aging mechanism, and indicates a $8-9$ years period of time to develop a full MPN.</description>

      <title>Conservation priority mapping to prevent zoonotic spillovers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13349v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diseases originating from wildlife pose a significant threat to global health, causing human and economic losses each year. The transmission of disease from animals to humans occurs at the interface between humans, livestock, and wildlife reservoirs, influenced by abiotic factors and ecological mechanisms. Although evidence suggests that intact ecosystems can reduce transmission, disease prevention has largely been neglected in conservation efforts and remains underfunded compared to mitigation. A major constraint is the lack of reliable, spatially explicit information to guide efforts effectively. Given the increasing rate of new disease emergence, accelerated by climate change and biodiversity loss, identifying priority areas for mitigating the risk of disease transmission is more crucial than ever. We present new high-resolution (1 km) maps of priority areas for targeted ecological countermeasures aimed at reducing the likelihood of zoonotic spillover, along with a methodology adaptable to local contexts. Our study compiles data on well-documented risk factors, protection status, forest restoration potential, and opportunity cost of the land to map areas with high potential for cost-effective interventions. We identify low-cost priority areas across 50 countries, including 277,000 km2 where environmental restoration could mitigate the risk of zoonotic spillover and 198,000 km2 where preventing deforestation could do the same, 95% of which are not currently under protection. The resulting layers, covering tropical regions globally, are freely available alongside an interactive no-code platform that allows users to adjust parameters and identify priority areas at multiple scales. Ecological countermeasures can be a cost-effective strategy for reducing the emergence of new pathogens; however, our study highlights the extent to which current conservation efforts fall short of this goal.</description>
