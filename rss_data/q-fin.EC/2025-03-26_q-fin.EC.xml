      <title>Cursed Job Market Signaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is behavioral evidence across economic settings that people often neglect how other people's strategies depend on their private information, a phenomenon known as cursedness. This paper characterizes the Cursed Sequential Equilibrium (CSE) to study the implications of cursedness in Spence's job market signaling game. We show that as players become more cursed, the worker attains less education -- a costly signal that does not improve productivity -- suggesting that cursedness improves efficiency in information transmission.</description>

      <title>Augmenting or Automating Labor? The Effect of AI Development on New Work, Employment, and Wages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping the labor market by changing the task content of occupations. This study investigates the impact of AI development on the emergence of new work, employment, and wages in the United States from 2015 to 2022. I develop innovative methods to measure occupational and industry exposure to AI technologies that substitute labor (automation AI ) or enhance workers' output (augmentation AI), and to identify new work (i.e., new job titles). To address endogeneity, I use instrumental variable estimators, leveraging AI development in countries with limited economic ties to the United States. The findings indicate that automation AI negatively impacts new work, employment, and wages in low-skilled occupations, while augmentation AI fosters the emergence of new work and raises wages for high-skilled occupations. These results suggest that AI may contribute to rising wage inequality.</description>

      <title>The economics of global personality diversity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the relationship between personality diversity and national economic performance, introducing the Global Personality Diversity Index ({\Psi}-GPDI) as a novel metric. Leveraging a dataset of 760,242 individuals across 135 countries, we quantify within-country diversity based on the Big Five personality traits. Our findings reveal that personality diversity accounts for 19.9% of the variance in GDP per capita and provides an additional 2.8% explanatory power beyond institutional quality and immigration, underscoring its unique contribution to economic vitality. Through multi-factor analysis, we demonstrate how personality diversity complements existing economic frameworks, offering actionable insights for policymakers seeking to enhance innovation, productivity, and resilience. This research positions psychological diversity as a critical yet under explored factor in driving economic growth, bridging the fields of psychology and economics.</description>

      <title>The Nonlinear Impact of Minimum Wage on Labor Employment in China</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines the impact of increasing minimum wages, focusing primarily on their effect on employment. Our research involved analyzing the statistics of panel data, testing fixed effects and stationary, conducting linear regression, and integrating the linear regression model with nonlinear model analysis. The results indicate that fluctuations in the employment rate are almost entirely explained by the selected explanatory variables, and there is a significant negative correlation between minimum wages and the employment rate. This paper contributes to current research by providing more comprehensive analyses, particularly through the use of nonlinear models, resulting in better-fitting models. We employed multiple fitting methods for time series data and their differentials, combining these results with nonlinear analysis.</description>

      <title>Endogenous Persistence at the Effective Lower Bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06473v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a perfect foresight method to solve models with an interest rate lower bound constraint that nests OccBin/DynareOBC and \cite{Eggertsson2010}'s as well as \cite{Mertens2014}'s pen and paper solutions as special cases. Our method generalizes the pen-and-paper solutions by allowing for endogenous persistence while maintaining tractability and interpretability. We prove that our method necessarily gives stable multipliers. We use it to solve a New Keynesian model with habit formation and government spending, which we match to expectations data from the Great Recession. We find an output multiplier of government spending close to 1 for the US and Japan.</description>

      <title>Exchange Rate Sensitivity in Free Zone Trade: An Empirical Study of the Istanbul Ataturk Airport Free Zone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03323v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study as part of an ongoing research effort, empirically examines the relationship between foreign trade in the Istanbul Ataturk Airport Free Zone and exchange rate movements. Monthly data from 2003 to 2016 were analyzed through stationarity tests (Unit Root), followed by the Vector Autoregressive (VAR) model, Cointegration Analysis, and the Toda-Yamamoto Causality Test. The findings indicate that the exchange rate does not significantly affect imports and exports in the free zone. This result suggests that free zones, due to their structural characteristics and operational framework, may be relatively insulated from exchange rate fluctuations. The study contributes to the literature by providing a focused analysis of a specific free zone in Turkiye, highlighting the potential independence of free zone trade from exchange rate volatility.</description>

      <title>Algorithms vs. Peers: Shaping Engagement with Novel Content</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11561v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The pervasive rise of digital platforms has reshaped how individuals engage with information, with algorithms and peer influence playing pivotal roles in these processes. This study investigates the effects of algorithmic curation and peer influence through social cues (e.g., peer endorsements) on engagement with novel content. Through a randomized field experiment on WeChat involving over 2.1 million users, we find that while peer-sharing exposes users to more novel content, algorithmic curation elicits significantly higher engagement with novel content than peer-sharing, even when social cues are present. Despite users' preference for redundant and less diverse content, both mechanisms mitigate this bias, with algorithms demonstrating a stronger positive effect than peer influence. These findings, though heterogeneous, are robust across demographic variations such as sex, age, and network size. Our results challenge concerns about "filter bubbles" and underscore the constructive role of algorithms in promoting engagement with non-redundant, diverse content.</description>
