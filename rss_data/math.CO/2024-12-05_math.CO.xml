      <title>The Ehrhart series of alcoved polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alcoved polytopes are convex polytopes which are the closure of a union of alcoves in an affine Coxeter arrangement. They are rational polytopes, and therefore have Ehrhart quasipolynomials. We describe a method for computing the generating function of the Ehrhart quasipolynomial, or Ehrhart series, of any alcoved polytope via a particular shelling order of its alcoves. We also conjecture a connection between Early's decorated ordered set partitions and this shelling order for the hypersimplex $\Delta_{2,n}$.</description>

      <title>Closed Neighborhood Balanced Coloring of Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A coloring of the vertex set of a graph using the colors red and blue is a closed neighborhood balanced coloring if for each vertex there are an equal number of red and blue vertices in its closed neighborhood. A graph with such a coloring is called a CNBC graph. Freyberg and Marr studied the related class of NBC graphs where closed neighborhood is replaced by open neighborhood. We prove results about CNBC graphs and NBC graphs. We show that the class of CNBC graphs is not hereditary, that the sizes of the color classes can be arbitrarily different, and that if the sizes of the color classes are equal, then a graph is a CNBC graph if and only if its complement is an NBC graph. When the sizes of the color classes are equal, we show that the join of two CNBC graphs is a CNBC graph, and the lexicographic product of a CNBC graph with any graph is a CNBC graph. We prove that the Cartesian product of any CNBC graph and any NBC graph is a CNBC graph, and characterize when a hypercube is an NBC graph or a CNBC graph, but show that the product of two CNBC graphs need not be an NBC graph. We show that the strong product of a CNBC graph with any graph is a CNBC graph. We construct infinite families of circulants that are CNBC graphs, and give characterizations of CNBC trees, generalized Petersen graphs, cubic circulants and quintic circulants when $n\equiv 2 \pmod 4$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For fixed $d\geq 3$, we construct subsets of the $d$-dimensional lattice cube $[n]^d$ of size $n^{\frac{3}{d + 1} - o(1)}$ with no $d+2$ points on a sphere or a hyperplane. This improves the previously best known bound of $\Omega(n^{\frac{1}{d-1}})$ due to Thiele from 1995.</description>

      <title>Schubert polynomials and patterns in permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the number of supports of the Schubert polynomial $\mathfrak{S}_w(x)$ indexed by a permutation $w$. This number also equals the number of lattice points in the Newton polytope of $\mathfrak{S}_w(x)$. We establish a lower bound for this number in terms of the occurrences of patterns in $w$. The analysis is carried out in the general framework of dual characters of flagged Weyl modules. Our result considerably improves the bounds for principal specializations of Schubert polynomials or dual flagged Weyl characters previously obtained by Weigandt, Gao, and M{\'e}sz{\'a}ros--St. Dizier--Tanjaya. Some problems and conjectures are discussed.</description>

      <title>Visibility polynomials, dual visibility spectrum, and characterization of total mutual-visibility sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mutual-visibility sets were motivated by visibility in distributed systems and social networks, and intertwine with several classical mathematical areas. Monotone properties of the variety of mutual-visibility sets, and restrictions of such sets to convex and isometric subgraphs are studied. Dual mutual-visibility sets are shown to be intrinsically different from other types of mutual-visibility sets. It is proved that for every finite subset $Z$ of positive integers there exists a graph $G$ that has a dual mutual-visibility set of size $i$ if and only if $i\in Z\cup \{0\}$, while for the other types of mutual-visibility such a set consists of consecutive integers. Visibility polynomials are introduced and their properties derived. As a surprise, every polynomial with nonnegative integer coefficients and with a constant term $1$ is a dual visibility polynomial of some graph. Characterizations are given for total mutual-visibility sets, for graphs with total mutual-visibility number $1$, and for sets which are not total mutual-visibility sets, yet every proper subset is such. Along the way an earlier result from the literature is corrected.</description>

      <title>Complete homogeneous symmetric polynomials with repeating variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider polynomials of the form $\operatorname{h}_m(y_1^{[\varkappa_1]},\ldots,y_n^{[\varkappa_n]})$, where $\operatorname{h}_m$ is the complete homogeneous polynomial of degree $m$ and $y_j^{[\varkappa_j]}$ denotes $y_j$ repeated $\varkappa_j$ times. Using the decomposition of the generating function into partial fractions we represent such polynomials in the form \[ \operatorname{h}_m(y_1^{[\varkappa_1]},\ldots,y_n^{[\varkappa_n]}) =\sum_{j=1}^n \sum_{r=1}^{\varkappa_j} \binom{r+m-1}{r-1} A_{y,\varkappa,j,r} y_j^m, \] where $A_{y,\varkappa,j,r}$ are some coefficients that do not depend on $m$. We also provide an alternative proof using the inverse of the confluent Vandermonde matrix.</description>

      <title>Generalized rank functions and quilts of alternating sign matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present new objects, quilts of alternating sign matrices with respect to two given posets. Quilts generalize several commonly used concepts in mathematics. For example, the rank function on submatrices of a matrix gives rise to a quilt with respect to two Boolean lattices. When the two posets are chains, a quilt is equivalent to an alternating sign matrix and its corresponding corner sum matrix. Quilts also generalize the monotone Boolean functions counted by the Dedekind numbers. Quilts form a distributive lattice with many beautiful properties and contain many classical and well-known sublattices, such as the lattice of matroids of a given rank and ground set. While enumerating quilts is hard in general, we prove two major enumerative results, when one of the posets is an antichain and when one of them is a chain. We also give some bounds for the number of quilts when one poset is the Boolean lattice.</description>

      <title>The strong vertex span of trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The strong vertex (edge) span of a given graph $G$ is the maximum distance that two players can maintain at all times while visiting all vertices (edges) of $G$ and moving either to an adjacent vertex or staying in the current position independently of each other. We introduce the notions of switching walks and triod size of a tree, which are used to determine the strong vertex and the strong edge span of an arbitrary tree. The obtained results are used in an algorithm that computes the strong vertex (edge) span of the input tree in linear time.</description>

Abstract: Halin proved that every graph with an end $\omega$ containing infinitely many pairwise disjoint rays admits a subdivision of the infinite quarter-grid as a subgraph where all rays from that subgraph belong to $\omega$. We will prove a corresponding statement for digraphs, that is, we will prove that every digraph that has an end with infinitely many pairwise disjoint directed rays contains a subdivision of a grid-like digraph all of whose directed rays belong to that end.</description>

      <title>On arborescence packing augmentation in hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We deepen the link between two classic areas of combinatorial optimization: augmentation and packing arborescences. We consider the following type of questions: What is the minimum number of arcs to be added to a digraph so that in the resulting digraph there exists some special kind of packing of arborescences? We answer this question for two problems: $h$-regular \textsf{M}-independent-rooted $(f,g)$-bounded $(\alpha, \beta)$-limited packing of mixed hyperarborescences and $h$-regular $(\ell, \ell')$-bordered $(\alpha, \beta)$-limited packing of $k$ hyperbranchings. We also solve the undirected counterpart of the latter, that is the augmentation problem for $h$-regular $(\ell, \ell')$-bordered $(\alpha, \beta)$-limited packing of $k$ rooted hyperforests. Our results provide a common generalization of a great number of previous results.</description>

      <title>Augmenting a hypergraph to have a matroid-based $(f,g)$-bounded $(\alpha,\beta)$-limited packing of rooted hypertrees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to further develop the theory of packing trees in a graph. We first prove the classic result of Nash-Williams \cite{NW} and Tutte \cite{Tu} on packing spanning trees by adapting Lov\'asz' proof \cite{Lov} of the seminal result of Edmonds \cite{Egy} on packing spanning arborescences in a digraph. Our main result on graphs extends the theorem of Katoh and Tanigawa \cite{KT} on matroid-based packing of rooted trees by characterizing the existence of such a packing satisfying the following further conditions: for every vertex $v$, there are a lower bound $f(v)$ and an upper bound $g(v)$ on the number of trees rooted at $v$ and there are a lower bound $\alpha$ and an upper bound $\beta$ on the total number of roots. We also answer the hypergraphic version of the problem. Furthermore, we are able to solve the augmentation version of the latter problem, where the goal is to add a minimum number of edges to have such a packing. The methods developed in this paper to solve these problems may have other applications in the future.</description>

      <title>Hertzsprung patterns on involutions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hertzsprung patterns, recently introduced by Anders Claesson, are subsequences of a permutation contiguous in both positions and values, and can be seen as a subclass of bivincular patterns.
  This paper investigates Hertzsprung patterns within involutions, where additional structural constraints introduce new challenges. We present a general formula for enumerating occurrences of these patterns in involutions.
  We also analyze specific cases to derive the distribution of all Hertzsprung patterns of lengths two and three.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the \emph{standard zero forcing number} $Z(G)$ and the \emph{positive semidefinite zero forcing number} $Z_+(G)$ are equal for all claw-free graphs $G$. This result resolves a conjecture proposed by the computer program \emph{TxGraffiti} and highlights a connection between these graph invariants in claw-free structures. As a corollary, we show that a graph $G$ is claw-free if and only if every induced subgraph $H \subseteq G$ satisfies $Z(H) = Z_+(H)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A lattice $(d,k)$-polytope is the convex hull of a set of points in $\mathbb{R}^d$ whose coordinates are integers ranging between $0$ and $k$. We consider the smallest possible distance $\varepsilon(d,k)$ between two disjoint lattice $(d,k)$-polytopes. We propose an algebraic model for this distance and derive from it an explicit formula for $\varepsilon(2,k)$. Our model also allows for the computation of previously intractable values of $\varepsilon(d,k)$. In particular, we compute $\varepsilon(3,k)$ when $4\leq{k}\leq8$, $\varepsilon(4,k)$ when $2\leq{k}\leq3$, and $\varepsilon(6,1)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Halin showed that any thick end of any graph contains an infinite grid. We extend Halin's theorem to digraphs. More precisely, we show that for any infinite family $\mathcal{R}$ of disjoint equivalent out-rays there is a grid whose vertical rays are contained in $\mathcal{R}$. Furthermore, we obtain similar results for in-rays and necklaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1975, Bollob\'{a}s, Erd\H{o}s, and Szemer\'{e}di asked for the smallest $\tau$ such that an $n \times n \times n$ tripartite graph with minimum degree $n + \tau$ must contain $K_{t, t, t}$, conjecturing that $\tau = \mathcal{O}(n^{1/2})$ for $t = 2$. We prove that $\tau = \mathcal{O}(n^{1 - 1/t})$ which confirms their conjecture and is best possible assuming the widely believed conjecture that $\operatorname{ex}(n, K_{t, t}) = \Theta(n^{2 - 1/t})$. Our proof uses a density increment argument.
  We also construct an infinite family of extremal graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pin permutations play an important role in the structural study of permutation classes, most notably in relation to simple permutations and well-quasi-ordering, and in enumerative consequences arising from these. In this paper, we continue our study of pin classes, which are permutation classes that comprise all the finite subpermutations contained in an infinite pin permutation. We show that there is a phase transition at $\mu\approx 3.28277$: there are uncountably many different pin classes whose growth rate is equal to $\mu$, yet only countably many below $\mu$. Furthermore, by showing that all pin classes with growth rate less than $\mu$ are essentially defined by pin permutations that possess a periodic structure, we classify the set of growth rates of pin classes up to $\mu$.</description>

      <title>A sharp version of Talagrand's selector process conjecture and an application to rounding fractional covers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Expectation thresholds arise from a class of integer linear programs (LPs) that are fundamental to the study of thresholds in large random systems. An avenue towards estimating expectation thresholds comes from the fractional relaxation of these integer LPs, which yield the fractional expectation thresholds. Regarding the gap between the integer LPs and their fractional relaxations, Talagrand made a bold conjecture, that the integral and fractional expectation thresholds are within a constant factor of each other. In other words, any small fractional solution can be ``rounded''.
  In this paper, we prove a strong upper bound on the expectation threshold starting from a fractional solution supported on sets with small size. In particular, this resolves Talagrand's conjecture for fractional solutions supported on sets with bounded size. Our key input for rounding the fractional solutions is a sharp version of Talagrand's selector process conjecture that is of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Dynamic capacity allocation of hybrid transportation units for cargo-hitching in urban public transportation systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To improve the utilization of public transportation systems (PTSs) during off-peak hours, we present an algorithmic framework that designs PTSs with hybrid transportation units (HTUs), which can transport passengers or freight by leveraging a flexible interior. Against this background, we study a capacitated network design problem to enable cargo-hitching in existing PTSs. Specifically, we study a setting with fixed vehicle routes and timetables in which vehicles can be equipped with HTUs to enable cargo-hitching. We optimize the network design from a total cost perspective to account for normalized network design costs tied to the investment in HTUs and freight routing costs. We present an algorithmic framework that encodes some of the problem's constraints in a spatially and temporally expanded, layered graph, and solves the resulting network design problem with a price-and-branch algorithm. We apply this framework to a case study based on the subway network in the city of Munich. Our algorithm outscales commercial solvers by a factor of six and yields integer feasible solutions with a median integrality gap of less than 1.02% for all instances. We show that cargo-hitching with HTUs increases the utilization of PTSs, especially during off-peak hours, without cannibalizing passenger service level and quality. Moreover, we present a sensitivity analysis that indicates that cargo-hitching is worthwhile if truck-based transport occurs at an externality cost of more than EUR 1.6 per vehicle and kilometer and loading and unloading costs of less than EUR 2 per passenger equivalent.</description>

      <title>Partitioning Theorems for Sets of Semi-Pfaffian Sets with Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalize the seminal polynomial partitioning theorems of Guth and Katz to a set of semi-Pfaffian sets. Specifically, given a set $\Gamma \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ of $k$-dimensional semi-Pfaffian sets, where each $\gamma \in \Gamma$ is defined by a fixed number of Pfaffian functions, and each Pfaffian function is in turn defined with respect to a Pfaffian chain $\vec{q}$ of length $r$, for any $D \ge 1$, we prove the existence of a polynomial $P \in \mathbb{R}[X_1, \ldots, X_n]$ of degree at most $D$ such that each connected component of $\mathbb{R}^n \setminus Z(P)$ intersects at most $\sim \frac{|\Gamma|}{D^{n - k - r}}$ elements of $\Gamma$. Also, for any $D \ge 1$, we prove the existence of a Pfaffian function $P'$ of degree at most $D$ defined with respect to $\vec{q}$, such that each connected component of $\mathbb{R}^n \setminus Z(P')$ intersects at most $\sim \frac{|\Gamma|}{D^{n-k}}$ elements of $\Gamma$. To do so, given a $k$-dimensional semi-Pfaffian set $\mathcal{X} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$, and a polynomial $P \in \mathbb{R}[X_1, \ldots, X_n]$ of degree at most $D$, we establish a uniform bound on the number of connected components of $\mathbb{R}^n \setminus Z(P)$ that $\mathcal{X}$ intersects; i.e. we prove that the number of connected components of $(\mathbb{R}^n \setminus Z(P)) \cap \mathcal{X}$ is at most $\sim D^{k+r}$. Finally as applications, we derive Pfaffian versions of Szemer\'edi-Trotter type theorems, and also prove bounds on the number of joints between Pfaffian curves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A problem of reconstructing words from their subwords involves determining the minimum amount of information needed, such as multisets of scattered subwords of a specific length or the frequency of scattered subwords from a given set, in order to uniquely identify a word. In this paper we show that a cyclic word on a binary alphabet can be reconstructed by its scattered subwords of length $\frac34n+4$, and for each $n$ one can find two cyclic words of length $n$ which have the same set of scattered subwords of length $\frac34n-\frac32$.</description>

      <title>Scarf's Algorithm on Arborescence Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scarf's algorithm--a pivoting procedure that finds a dominating extreme point in a down-monotone polytope--can be used to show the existence of a fractional stable matching in hypergraphs. The problem of finding a fractional stable matching in a hypergraph, however, is PPAD-complete. In this work, we study the behavior of Scarf's algorithm on arborescence hypergraphs, the family of hypergraphs in which hyperedges correspond to the paths of an arborescence. For arborescence hypergraphs, we prove that Scarf's algorithm can be implemented to find an integral stable matching in polynomial time. En route to our result, we uncover novel structural properties of bases and pivots for the more general family of network hypergraphs. Our work provides the first proof of polynomial-time convergence of Scarf's algorithm on hypergraphic stable matching problems, giving hope to the possibility of polynomial-time convergence of Scarf's algorithm for other families of polytope.</description>

      <title>A complete theory of smoothable compactified Jacobians of nodal curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study a new class of compactified Jacobians for nodal curves, that we call compactified Jacobians of vine type, or simply V-compactified Jacobians. This class is strictly larger than the class of classical compactified Jacobians, as constructed by Oda-Seshadri, Simpson, Caporaso and Esteves.
  We characterize V-compactified Jacobians as the compactified Jacobians that can arise as limits of Jacobians of smooth curves under a one-parameter smoothing of the nodal curve, extending previous works on fine compactified Jacobians by Pagani-Tommasi and Viviani to the case of all compactified Jacobians.</description>

Abstract: Using Bailey's very-well-poised $_6\psi_6$ summation, we show that a specific sequence of well-poised bilateral basic hypergeometric $_3\psi_3$ series form a family of orthogonal functions on the unit circle. We further extract a bilateral matrix inverse from Dougall's ${}_2H_2$ summation which we use, in combination with the Pfaff--Saalsch\"utz summation, to derive a summation for a particular bilateral hypergeometric $_3H_3$ series. We finally provide multivariate extensions of the bilateral matrix inverse and the $_3H_3$ summation in the setting of hypergeometric series associated to the root system $A_r$.</description>

      <title>Resolving Sets in Temporal Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13183v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A \emph{resolving set} $R$ in a graph $G$ is a set of vertices such that every vertex of $G$ is uniquely identified by its distances to the vertices of $R$. Introduced in the 1970s, this concept has been since then extensively studied from both combinatorial and algorithmic points of view. We propose a generalization of the concept of resolving sets to temporal graphs, \emph{i.e.}, graphs with edge sets that change over discrete time-steps. In this setting, the \emph{temporal distance from $u$ to $v$} is the earliest possible time-step at which a journey with strictly increasing time-steps on edges leaving $u$ reaches $v$, \emph{i.e.}, the first time-step at which $v$ could receive a message broadcast from $u$. A \emph{temporal resolving set} of a temporal graph $\mathcal{G}$ is a subset $R$ of its vertices such that every vertex of $\mathcal{G}$ is uniquely identified by its temporal distances from vertices of $R$.
  We study the problem of finding a minimum-size temporal resolving set, and show that it is NP-complete even on very restricted graph classes and with strong constraints on the time-steps: temporal complete graphs where every edge appears in either time-step~1 or~2, temporal trees where every edge appears in at most two consecutive time-steps, and even temporal subdivided stars where every edge appears in at most two (not necessarily consecutive) time-steps. On the other hand, we give polynomial-time algorithms for temporal paths and temporal stars where every edge appears in exactly one time-step, and give a combinatorial analysis and algorithms for several temporal graph classes where the edges appear in periodic time-steps.</description>

      <title>On the independence number of sparser random Cayley graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09361v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Cayley sum graph $\Gamma_A$ of a set $A \subseteq \mathbb{Z}_n$ is defined to have vertex set $\mathbb{Z}_n$ and an edge between two distinct vertices $x, y \in \mathbb{Z}_n$ if $x + y \in A$. Green and Morris proved that if the set $A$ is a $p$-random subset of $\mathbb{Z}_n$ with $p = 1/2$, then the independence number of $\Gamma_A$ is asymptotically equal to $\alpha(G(n, 1/2))$ with high probability. Our main theorem is the first extension of their result to $p = o(1)$: we show that, with high probability, $$\alpha(\Gamma_A) = (1 + o(1)) \alpha(G(n, p))$$ as long as $p \ge (\log n)^{-1/80}$.
  One of the tools in our proof is a geometric-flavoured theorem that generalises Fre\u{i}man's lemma, the classical lower bound on the size of high dimensional sumsets. We also give a short proof of this result up to a constant factor; this version yields a much simpler proof of our main theorem at the expense of a worse constant.</description>

Abstract: The notion of weak tiling was a key ingredient in the proof of Fuglede's spectral set conjecture for convex bodies \cite{conv}, due to the fact that every spectral set tiles its complement weakly with a suitable Borel measure. In this paper we review the concept of weak tiling, and answer a question raised in \cite{weak} by giving an example of a set $T$ which tiles its complement weakly, but $T$ is neither spectral, nor a proper tile.</description>

      <title>Longest subsequence for certain repeated up/down patterns in random permutations avoiding a pattern of length three</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11482v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $S_n$ denote the set of permutations of $[n]$ and let $\sigma=\sigma_1\cdots\sigma_n\in S_n$. For a subsequence $\{\sigma_{i_j}\}_{j=1}^k$ of $\{\sigma_i\}_{i=1}^n$ of length $k\ge2$, construct
  the ``up/down'' sequence $V_1\cdots V_{k-1}$ defined by $$ V_j=\begin{cases} U,\ \text{if}\ \sigma_{i_j+1}-\sigma_{i_j}&gt;0;\\ D,\ \text{if}\ \sigma_{i_j+1}-\sigma_{i_j}&lt;0.\end{cases} $$ Consider now a fixed up/down pattern: $V_1\cdots V_l$, where $l\in\mathbb{N}$ and $V_j\in\{U, D\},\ j\in[l]$. Given a permutation $\sigma\in S_n$, consider the length of the longest subsequence of $\sigma$ that repeats this pattern.
  For example, consider $l=3$ and $V_1V_2V_3=UUD$. Then for the permutation $342617985\in S_9$, the length of the longest subsequence that repeats the pattern $UUD$ is 7; it is obtained by 3461798 and 3461785.
  The above framework includes two well-known cases. The pattern $U$ is the celebrated case of the longest increasing subsequence. The pattern $UD$ (or $DU$) is the case of the longest alternating subsequence. These have been studied both under the uniform distribution on $S_n$ as well as under the uniform distribution on those permutations in $S_n$ which avoid a particular pattern of length three.
  In this paper, we consider the patterns $UUD$ and $UUUD$ under the uniform distribution on those permutations in $S_n$ which avoid the pattern $132$. We prove that the expected value of the longest increasing subsequence following the pattern $UUD$ is asymptotic to $\frac37n$ and the expected value of the longest increasing subsequence following the pattern $UUUD$ is asymptotic to $\frac4{11}n$. (For $UD$ (alternating subsequences) it is known to be $\frac12n$.) This leads directly to appropriate corresponding results for permutations avoiding any particular pattern of length three.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00336v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonnesting permutations are permutations of the multiset $\{1,1,2,2,\dots,n,n\}$ that avoid subsequences of the form $abba$ for any $a\neq b$. These permutations have recently been studied in connection to noncrossing (also called quasi-Stirling) permutations, which are those that avoid subsequences of the form $abab$, and in turn generalize the well-known Stirling permutations. Inspired by the work by Archer et al. on pattern avoidance in noncrossing permutations, we consider the analogous problem in the nonnesting case. We enumerate nonnesting permutations that avoid each set of two or more patterns of length 3, as well as those that avoid some sets of patterns of length 4. We obtain closed formulas and generating functions, some of which involve unexpected appearances of the Catalan and Fibonacci numbers. Our proofs rely on decompositions, recurrences, and bijections.</description>

Abstract: The asymmetric coloring number of a graph is the minimum number of colors needed to color its vertices, so that no non-trivial automorphism preserves the color classes. We investigate the asymmetric coloring number of graphs that are disjoint unions of graphs. We will derive a general relationship between the asymmetric coloring number of disjoint copies of graphs and the number of ways to color a single copy asymmetrically, and then look at particular cases such as disjoint copies of paths, stars, cycles, and hypercubes.</description>

Abstract: We give manifestly positive Andrews-Gordon type series for the level 3 standard modules of the affine Lie algebra of type $A^{(1)}_2$. We also give corresponding bipartition identities, which have representation theoretic interpretations via the vertex operators. Our proof is based on the Borodin product formula, the Corteel-Welsh recursion for the cylindric partitions, a $q$-version of Sister Celine's technique and a generalization of Andrews' partition ideals by finite automata due to Takigiku and the author.</description>

      <title>On the codimension of permanental varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17839v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study permanental varieties, i.e. varieties defined by the vanishing of permanents of fixed size of a generic matrix. Permanents and their varieties play an important, and sometimes poorly understood, role in combinatorics. However, there are essentially no geometric results about them in the literature, in very sharp contrast to the well-behaved and ubiquitous case of determinants and minors. Motivated by the study of the singular locus of the permanental hypersurface, we focus on the codimension of these varieties. We introduce a $\mathbb C^{*}$-action on matrices and prove a number of results. In particular, we improve a lower bound on the codimension of the aforementioned singular locus established by von zur Gathen in 1987.</description>

      <title>Symplectic duality via log topological recursion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10720v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We review the notion of symplectic duality earlier introduced in the context of topological recursion. We show that the transformation of symplectic duality can be expressed as a composition of $x-y$ dualities in a broader context of log topological recursion. As a corollary, we establish nice properties of symplectic duality: various convenient explicit formulas, invertibility, group property, compatibility with topological recursion and KP integrability. As an application of these properties, we get a new and uniform proof of topological recursion for large families of weighted double Hurwitz numbers; this encompasses and significantly extends all previously known results on this matter.</description>

      <title>Directed Hypercube Routing, a Generalized Lehman-Ron Theorem, and Monotonicity Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02206v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by applications to monotonicity testing, Lehman and Ron (JCTA, 2001) proved the existence of a collection of vertex disjoint paths between comparable sub-level sets in the directed hypercube. The main technical contribution of this paper is a new proof method that yields a generalization to their theorem: we prove the existence of two edge-disjoint collections of vertex disjoint paths. Our main conceptual contribution are conjectures on directed hypercube flows with simultaneous vertex and edge capacities of which our generalized Lehman-Ron theorem is a special case. We show that these conjectures imply directed isoperimetric theorems, and in particular, the robust directed Talagrand inequality due to Khot, Minzer, and Safra (SIAM J. on Comp, 2018). These isoperimetric inequalities, that relate the directed surface area (of a set in the hypercube) to its distance to monotonicity, have been crucial in obtaining the best monotonicity testers for Boolean functions. We believe our conjectures pave the way towards combinatorial proofs of these directed isoperimetry theorems.</description>

      <title>Additive Ramsey theory over Piatetski-Shapiro numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14427v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We characterise partition regularity for linear equations over the Piatetski-Shapiro numbers $\lfloor n^c \rfloor$ when $1 &lt; c &lt; c^\dag(s)$, where $s \ge 3$ is the number of variables. Here $c^\dag(3) = 12/11$ and $c^\dag(4) = 7/6$, while $c^\dag(s) = 2$ for $s \ge 5$. We also establish density results with quantitative bounds.</description>

      <title>Counterexamples to Zagier's Duality Conjecture on Nahm Sums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09701v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given any positive integer $r$, Nahm's problem is to determine all $r\times r$ rational positive definite matrix $A$, $r$-dimensional rational vector $B$ and rational scalar $C$ such that the rank $r$ Nahm sum associated with $(A,B,C)$ is modular. Around 2007, Zagier conjectured that if the rank $r$ Nahm sum for $(A,B,C)$ is modular, then so is the dual Nahm sum associated with $(A^{-1},A^{-1}B,B^\mathrm{T} A^{-1}B/2-{r}/{24}-C)$. We construct some explicit rank four Nahm sums which are modular while their duals are not modular. This provides counterexamples to Zagier's duality conjecture.</description>
