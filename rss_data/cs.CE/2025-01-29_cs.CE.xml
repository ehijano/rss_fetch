      <title>Unveiling Discrete Clues: Superior Healthcare Predictions for Rare Diseases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate healthcare prediction is essential for improving patient outcomes. Existing work primarily leverages advanced frameworks like attention or graph networks to capture the intricate collaborative (CO) signals in electronic health records. However, prediction for rare diseases remains challenging due to limited co-occurrence and inadequately tailored approaches. To address this issue, this paper proposes UDC, a novel method that unveils discrete clues to bridge consistent textual knowledge and CO signals within a unified semantic space, thereby enriching the representation semantics of rare diseases. Specifically, we focus on addressing two key sub-problems: (1) acquiring distinguishable discrete encodings for precise disease representation and (2) achieving semantic alignment between textual knowledge and the CO signals at the code level. For the first sub-problem, we refine the standard vector quantized process to include condition awareness. Additionally, we develop an advanced contrastive approach in the decoding stage, leveraging synthetic and mixed-domain targets as hard negatives to enrich the perceptibility of the reconstructed representation for downstream tasks. For the second sub-problem, we introduce a novel codebook update strategy using co-teacher distillation. This approach facilitates bidirectional supervision between textual knowledge and CO signals, thereby aligning semantically equivalent information in a shared discrete latent space. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate our superiority.</description>

      <title>Graph Transformers for inverse physics: reconstructing flows around arbitrary 2D airfoils</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a Graph Transformer framework that serves as a general inverse physics engine on meshes, demonstrated through the challenging task of reconstructing aerodynamic flow fields from sparse surface measurements. While deep learning has shown promising results in forward physics simulation, inverse problems remain particularly challenging due to their ill-posed nature and the difficulty of propagating information from limited boundary observations. Our approach addresses these challenges by combining the geometric expressiveness of message-passing neural networks with the global reasoning of Transformers, enabling efficient learning of inverse mappings from boundary conditions to complete states. We evaluate this framework on a comprehensive dataset of steady-state RANS simulations around diverse airfoil geometries, where the task is to reconstruct full pressure and velocity fields from surface pressure measurements alone. The architecture achieves high reconstruction accuracy while maintaining fast inference times. We conduct experiments and provide insights into the relative importance of local geometric processing and global attention mechanisms in mesh-based inverse problems. We also find that the framework is robust to reduced sensor coverage. These results suggest that Graph Transformers can serve as effective inverse physics engines across a broader range of applications where complete system states must be reconstructed from limited boundary observations.</description>

      <title>ForTune: Running Offline Scenarios to Estimate Impact on Business Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00133v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Making ideal decisions as a product leader in a web-facing company is extremely difficult. In addition to navigating the ambiguity of customer satisfaction and achieving business goals, one must also pave a path forward for ones' products and services to remain relevant, desirable, and profitable. Data and experimentation to test product hypotheses are key to informing product decisions. Online controlled experiments by A/B testing may provide the best data to support such decisions with high confidence, but can be time-consuming and expensive, especially when one wants to understand impact to key business metrics such as retention or long-term value. Offline experimentation allows one to rapidly iterate and test, but often cannot provide the same level of confidence, and cannot easily shine a light on impact on business metrics. We introduce a novel, lightweight, and flexible approach to investigating hypotheses, called scenario analysis, that aims to support product leaders' decisions using data about users and estimates of business metrics. Its strengths are that it can provide guidance on trade-offs that are incurred by growing or shifting consumption, estimate trends in long-term outcomes like retention and other important business metrics, and can generate hypotheses about relationships between metrics at scale.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Deep Learning Surrogate Models for Uncertainty Propagation in Microstructure-Properties of Ceramic Aerogels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13255v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep learning surrogate models have become pivotal in enabling model-driven materials discovery to achieve exceptional properties. However, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of predictions from these models, trained on limited and sparse material datasets remains a significant challenge. This study introduces an integrated deep learning framework for predicting the synthesis, microstructure, and mechanical properties of ceramic aerogels, leveraging physics-based models such as Lattice Boltzmann simulations for microstructure formation and stochastic finite element methods for mechanical property calculations. To address the computational demands of repeated physics-based simulations required for experimental calibration and material design, a linked surrogate model is developed, leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for stochastic microstructure generation and microstructure-to-mechanical property mapping. To overcome challenges associated with limited training datasets from expensive physical modeling, CNN training is formulated within a Bayesian inference framework, enabling robust uncertainty quantification in predictions. Numerical results highlight the strengths and limitations of the linked surrogate framework, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting properties of aerogels with pore sizes and morphologies similar to the training data (in-distribution) and its ability to interpolate to new microstructural features between training data (out-of-distribution).</description>
