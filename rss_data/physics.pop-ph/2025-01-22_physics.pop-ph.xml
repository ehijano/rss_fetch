      <title>Centenary progress from the Nernst theorem to the Nernst statement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is found from textbooks that there are the different versions of the schematic diagram related to the Nernst equation, and consequently, it leads to some discussion related to the Nernst equation and the discovery of other meaningful schematic diagrams never appearing in literature. It is also found that through the introduction of a new function, the schematic diagram of the Nernst equation in the isothermal process of any thermodynamic system can be generated in a unified way and that the Nernst equation can be re-obtained from the experimental data of low-temperature chemical reactions without any artificial additional assumptions. The results obtained here show clearly that the centenary progress from the Nernst theorem to the Nernst statement is completed.</description>

      <title>Hawking for beginners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12100v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stephen Hawkings most important scientific contribution was his theoretical discovery that black holes aint so black, since they emit thermal radiation as if they were hot bodies with an absolute temperature known as the Hawking temperature. Although this year marks half a century since Hawking made his discovery, it remains unknown to the vast majority of people. In his popular books, Hawking explains the significance of his discovery in a simple way, using the so-called vacuum quantum fluctuations. The aim of this work is to bring Hawking's discovery to the widest possible audience, especially physics teachers. To do this, we will develop a derivation of the Hawking temperature that fairly faithfully translates Hawking's quantum fluctuation model into the mathematical language used by a typical physics teacher, whether in training or in practice.</description>
