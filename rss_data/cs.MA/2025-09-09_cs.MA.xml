      <title>Efficient Multi-Agent Coordination via Dynamic Joint-State Graph Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) traditionally focuses on collision avoidance, but many real-world applications require active coordination between agents to improve team performance. This paper introduces Team Coordination on Graphs with Risky Edges (TCGRE), where agents collaborate to reduce traversal costs on high-risk edges via support from teammates. We reformulate TCGRE as a 3D matching problem-mapping robot pairs, support pairs, and time steps-and rigorously prove its NP-hardness via reduction from Minimum 3D Matching. To address this complexity, (in the conference version) we proposed efficient decomposition methods, reducing the problem to tractable subproblems: Joint-State Graph (JSG): Encodes coordination as a single-agent shortest-path problem. Coordination-Exhaustive Search (CES): Optimizes support assignments via exhaustive pairing. Receding-Horizon Optimistic Cooperative A* (RHOCA*): Balances optimality and scalability via horizon-limited planning. Further in this extension, we introduce a dynamic graph construction method (Dynamic-HJSG), leveraging agent homogeneity to prune redundant states and reduce computational overhead by constructing the joint-state graph dynamically. Theoretical analysis shows Dynamic-HJSG preserves optimality while lowering complexity from exponential to polynomial in key cases. Empirical results validate scalability for large teams and graphs, with HJSG outperforming baselines greatly in runtime in different sizes and types of graphs. This work bridges combinatorial optimization and multi-agent planning, offering a principled framework for collaborative pathfinding with provable guarantees, and the key idea of the solution can be widely extended to many other collaborative optimization problems, such as MAPF.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Evolutionary Framework for Safe, Efficient, and Cooperative Autonomous Vehicle Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern transportation systems face significant challenges in ensuring road safety, given serious injuries caused by road accidents. The rapid growth of autonomous vehicles (AVs) has prompted new traffic designs that aim to optimize interactions among AVs. However, effective interactions between AVs remains challenging due to the absence of centralized control. Besides, there is a need for balancing multiple factors, including passenger demands and overall traffic efficiency. Traditional rule-based, optimization-based, and game-theoretic approaches each have limitations in addressing these challenges. Rule-based methods struggle with adaptability and generalization in complex scenarios, while optimization-based methods often require high computational resources. Game-theoretic approaches, such as Stackelberg and Nash games, suffer from limited adaptability and potential inefficiencies in cooperative settings. This paper proposes an Evolutionary Game Theory (EGT)-based framework for AV interactions that overcomes these limitations by utilizing a decentralized and adaptive strategy evolution mechanism. A causal evaluation module (CEGT) is introduced to optimize the evolutionary rate, balancing mutation and evolution by learning from historical interactions. Simulation results demonstrate the proposed CEGT outperforms EGT and popular benchmark games in terms of lower collision rates, improved safety distances, higher speeds, and overall better performance compared to Nash and Stackelberg games across diverse scenarios and parameter settings.</description>

      <title>Bio-inspired decision making in swarms under biases from stubborn robots, corrupted communication, and independent discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Minimalistic robot swarms offer a scalable, robust, and cost-effective approach to performing complex tasks with the potential to transform applications in healthcare, disaster response, and environmental monitoring. However, coordinating such decentralised systems remains a fundamental challenge, particularly when robots are constrained in communication, computation, and memory. In our study, individual robots frequently make errors when sensing the environment, yet the swarm can rapidly and reliably reach consensus on the best among $n$ discrete options. We compare two canonical mechanisms of opinion dynamics -- direct-switch and cross-inhibition -- which are simple yet effective rules for collective information processing observed in biological systems across scales, from neural populations to insect colonies. We generalise the existing mean-field models by considering asocial biases influencing the opinion dynamics. While swarms using direct-switch reliably select the best option in absence of asocial dynamics, their performance deteriorates once such biases are introduced, often resulting in decision deadlocks. In contrast, bio-inspired cross-inhibition enables faster, more cohesive, accurate, robust, and scalable decisions across a wide range of biased conditions. Our findings provide theoretical and practical insights into the coordination of minimal swarms and offer insights that extend to a broad class of decentralised decision-making systems in biology and engineering.</description>

      <title>Towards Generalized Routing: Model and Agent Orchestration for Adaptive and Efficient Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) and domain-specific AI agents has greatly expanded the ecosystem of AI-powered services. User queries, however, are highly diverse and often span multiple domains and task types, resulting in a complex and heterogeneous landscape. This diversity presents a fundamental routing challenge: how to accurately direct each query to an appropriate execution unit while optimizing both performance and efficiency. To address this, we propose MoMA (Mixture of Models and Agents), a generalized routing framework that integrates both LLM and agent-based routing. Built upon a deep understanding of model and agent capabilities, MoMA effectively handles diverse queries through precise intent recognition and adaptive routing strategies, achieving an optimal balance between efficiency and cost. Specifically, we construct a detailed training dataset to profile the capabilities of various LLMs under different routing model structures, identifying the most suitable tasks for each LLM. During inference, queries are dynamically routed to the LLM with the best cost-performance efficiency. We also introduce an efficient agent selection strategy based on a context-aware state machine and dynamic masking. Experimental results demonstrate that the MoMA router offers superior cost-efficiency and scalability compared to existing approaches.</description>

      <title>A data-driven discretized CS:GO simulation environment to facilitate strategic multi-agent planning research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern simulation environments for complex multi-agent interactions must balance high-fidelity detail with computational efficiency. We present DECOY, a novel multi-agent simulator that abstracts strategic, long-horizon planning in 3D terrains into high-level discretized simulation while preserving low-level environmental fidelity. Using Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) as a testbed, our framework accurately simulates gameplay using only movement decisions as tactical positioning -- without explicitly modeling low-level mechanics such as aiming and shooting. Central to our approach is a waypoint system that simplifies and discretizes continuous states and actions, paired with neural predictive and generative models trained on real CS:GO tournament data to reconstruct event outcomes. Extensive evaluations show that replays generated from human data in DECOY closely match those observed in the original game. Our publicly available simulation environment provides a valuable tool for advancing research in strategic multi-agent planning and behavior generation.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Online Riemannian Optimization Beyond Hadamard Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study decentralized online Riemannian optimization over manifolds with possibly positive curvature, going beyond the Hadamard manifold setting. Decentralized optimization techniques rely on a consensus step that is well understood in Euclidean spaces because of their linearity. However, in positively curved Riemannian spaces, a main technical challenge is that geodesic distances may not induce a globally convex structure. In this work, we first analyze a curvature-aware Riemannian consensus step that enables a linear convergence beyond Hadamard manifolds. Building on this step, we establish a $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret bound for the decentralized online Riemannian gradient descent algorithm. Then, we investigate the two-point bandit feedback setup, where we employ computationally efficient gradient estimators using smoothing techniques, and we demonstrate the same $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret bound through the subconvexity analysis of smoothed objectives.</description>

      <title>Multi-Topic Projected Opinion Dynamics for Resource Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a model of opinion formation on resource allocation among multiple topics by multiple agents, who are subject to hard budget constraints. We define a utility function for each agent and then derive a projected dynamical system model of opinion evolution assuming that each agent myopically seeks to maximize its utility subject to its constraints. Inter-agent coupling arises from an undirected social network, while inter-topic coupling arises from resource constraints. We show that opinions always converge to the equilibrium set. For special networks with very weak antagonistic relations, the opinions converge to a unique equilibrium point. We further show that the underlying opinion formation game is a potential game. We relate the equilibria of the dynamics and the Nash equilibria of the game and characterize the unique Nash equilibrium for networks with no antagonistic relations. Finally, simulations illustrate our findings.</description>

      <title>Grid-Agent: An LLM-Powered Multi-Agent System for Power Grid Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05702v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern power grids face unprecedented complexity from Distributed Energy Resources (DERs), Electric Vehicles (EVs), and extreme weather, while also being increasingly exposed to cyberattacks that can trigger grid violations. This paper introduces Grid-Agent, an autonomous AI-driven framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) within a multi-agent system to detect and remediate violations. Grid-Agent integrates semantic reasoning with numerical precision through modular agents: a planning agent generates coordinated action sequences using power flow solvers, while a validation agent ensures stability and safety through sandboxed execution with rollback mechanisms. To enhance scalability, the framework employs an adaptive multi-scale network representation that dynamically adjusts encoding schemes based on system size and complexity. Violation resolution is achieved through optimizing switch configurations, battery deployment, and load curtailment. Our experiments on IEEE and CIGRE benchmark networks, including the IEEE 69-bus, CIGRE MV, IEEE 30-bus test systems, demonstrate superior mitigation performance, highlighting Grid-Agent's suitability for modern smart grids requiring rapid, adaptive response.</description>
