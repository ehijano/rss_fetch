      <title>Vacancy-induced suppression of CDW order and its impact on magnetic order in kagome antiferromagnet FeGe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) kagome lattice metals are interesting because they display flat electronic bands, Dirac points, Van Hove singularities, and can have interplay between charge density wave (CDW), magnetic order, and superconductivity. In kagome lattice antiferromagnet FeGe, a short-range CDW order was found deep within an antiferromagnetically ordered state, interacting with the magnetic order. Surprisingly, post-growth annealing of FeGe at 560$^{\circ}$C can suppress the CDW order while annealing at 320$^{\circ}$C induces a long-range CDW order, with the ability to cycle between the states repeatedly by annealing. Here we perform transport, neutron scattering, scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), and muon spin rotation ($\mu$SR) experiments to unveil the microscopic mechanism of the annealing process and its impact on magneto-transport, CDW, and magnetic properties of FeGe. We find that 560$^{\circ}$C annealing creates germanium vacancies uniformly distributed throughout the FeGe kagome lattice, which prevent the formation of Ge-Ge dimers necessary for the CDW order. Upon annealing at 320$^{\circ}$C, the system segregates into stoichiometric FeGe regions with long-range CDW order and regions with stacking faults that act as nucleation sites for the CDW. The presence or absence of CDW order greatly affects the anomalous Hall effect, incommensurate magnetic order, and spin-lattice coupling in FeGe, thus placing FeGe as the only known kagome lattice material with a tunable CDW and magnetic order, potentially useful for sensing and information transmission.</description>

      <title>Minimal pole representation and analytic continuation of matrix-valued correlation functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a minimal pole method for analytically continuing matrix-valued imaginary frequency correlation functions to the real axis, enabling precise access to off-diagonal elements and thus improving the interpretation of self-energies and susceptibilities in quantum simulations. Traditional methods for matrix-valued analytic continuation tend to be either noise-sensitive or make ad-hoc positivity assumptions. Our approach avoides these issues via the construction of a compact pole representation with shared poles through exponential fits, expanding upon prior work focused on scalar functions. We test our method across various scenarios, including fermionic and bosonic response functions, with and without noise, and for both continuous and discrete spectra of real materials and model systems. Our findings demonstrate that this technique addresses the shortcomings of existing methodologies, such as artificial broadening and positivity violations. The paper is supplemented with a sample implementation in Python.</description>

      <title>Influence of oxygen orbitals and boundary conditions on the pairing behavior in the Emery model for doped ladders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the Emery model on several ladder-like lattices including two legs of copper d-orbitals and various numbers of oxygen p-orbitals. Pair binding energy, pair spatial structure, density distribution, and pairing correlation functions are calculated using the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG). We show that a Luther-Emery phase with enhanced pairing correlations can be found for hole doping as well as for electron doping with realistic model parameters. Ladder properties depend sensitively on model parameters, the oxygen p-orbitals taken into account, and boundary conditions. The pair binding energy is a more reliable quantity than correlation functions for studying pairing in ladders. Overall, our results for two-leg Emery ladders support the possibility of superconductivity in the hole-doped 2D model. The issue is rather to determine which of the various ladder structures and model parameters are appropriate to approximate the two-dimensional cuprates.</description>

      <title>Even-odd effect in multilayer Kitaev honeycomb magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the three-dimensional structure of Kitaev materials we explore multilayer Kitaev models. The magnetic properties of a multilayer of an arbitrary number of Kitaev honeycomb layers stacked on top of each other coupled through a Heisenberg interaction, J, is analyzed through Abrikosov fermion mean-field theory. The system sustains quantum spin liquid (QSL) solutions which have different character depending on parity of the number of layers. While in even layered Kitaev models a gapped QSL emerges, odd-layered models host gapless QSLs. The projective symmetry group analysis of these solutions unravel a layer-to-layer inversion symmetry rather than an expected reflection. Although these QSLs retain features of the single layer Kitaev spin liquid (KSL), they should be regarded hybrid QSLs consisting on several KSLs. The good agreement at large-J between the energy of the Gutzwiller projected mean-field QSL and the exact energy indicates that such QSL Ansatz is adiabatically connected to the exact ground state. We also find that the Kitaev gapped chiral quantum spin liquid induced by external magnetic fields is stabilized by an antiferromagnetic interlayer coupling. Our results are relevant to the physics of alpha-RuCl3 and H3LiIr2O6 which are examples of magnetically coupled multilayer Kitaev models.</description>

      <title>Chains of magnetic ions in NH$_4^+$-intercalated vanadium pentoxide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the electronic and magnetic properties of NH$_4^+$-intercalated vanadium pentoxide (NH$_4^+$-V$_2$O$_5$), a material that has been identified as a promising cathode for aqueous zinc-ion batteries. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations incorporating the Hubbard U correction reveal that NH$_4^+$-V$_2$O$_5$ is an antiferromagnetic insulator with an energy gap of 1.97 eV. The introduction of NH$_4^+$ ions into the V$_2$O$_5$ structure results in significant structural distortions, leading to the formation of magnetic vanadium ions (V$^{4+}$, $3d^1$) and non-magnetic ions (V$^{5+}$, $3d^0$). The magnetic vanadium ions are organized into chains with antiferromagnetic order along the $a$-axis. Our findings indicate that NH$_4^+$-V$_2$O$_5$ exhibits strong electron correlation effects and negligible interchain magnetic interactions, rendering it a promising candidate for a one-dimensional magnetic van der Waals system. This work provides insights into the electronic and magnetic behaviors of NH$_4^+$-V$_2$O$_5$, with implications for its potential applications in energy storage technologies.</description>

      <title>Hidden Kondo lattice physics in single-orbital Hubbard models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-orbital Hubbard models exhibit remarkably nontrivial correlation phenomena, even on nonfrustrated bipartite lattices. Some of these, like non-Fermi-liquid metal states, or the coexistence of heavy and light quasi-particles, are reminiscent of the properties of more complex multi-orbital or Kondo-lattice systems. Here, we use basis transformations to map single-orbital models to effective multi-orbital descriptions and clarify how a ferromagnetic Kondo-lattice-like behavior emerges in prototypical models with flat bands or van Hove singularities in the density of states: the Hubbard model on the diamond chain, square-lattice, Lieb lattice and honeycomb lattice. In particular, this mapping explains the non-Fermi-liquid states and pseudo-gaps found in the correlated metal regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generalizing from previous work on the integer quantum Hall effect, we construct the effective action for the analog of Laughlin states for the fractional quantum Hall effect in higher dimensions. The formalism is a generalization of the parton picture used in two spatial dimensions, the crucial ingredient being the cancellation of anomalies for the gauge fields binding the partons together. Some subtleties which exist even in two dimensions are pointed out. The effective action is obtained from a combination of the Dolbeault and Dirac index theorems. We also present expressions for some transport coefficients such as Hall conductivity and Hall viscosity for the fractional states.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Confined Tunable Ferromagnetism on the Surface of a van der Waals Antiferromagnet NaCrTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The surface of three-dimensional materials provides an ideal and versatile platform to explore quantum-confined physics. Here, we systematically investigate the electronic structure of Na-intercalated CrTe2, a van der Waals antiferromagnet, using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and ab-initio calculations. The measured band structure deviates from the calculation of bulk NaCrTe2 but agrees with that of ferromagnetic monolayer CrTe2. Consistently, we observe an unexpected exchange splitting of the band dispersions, persisting well above the N\'eel temperature of bulk NaCrTe2. We argue that NaCrTe2 features a quantum-confined 2D ferromagnetic state in the topmost surface layer due to strong ferromagnetic correlation in the CrTe2 layer. Moreover, the exchange splitting and the critical temperature can be controlled by surface doping of alkali-metal atoms, suggesting a feasible tunability of the surface ferromagnetism. Our work not only presents a simple platform to explore tunable 2D ferromagnetism but also provides important insights into the quantum-confined low-dimensional magnetic states.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic mixed state topological order in a stabilizer system under stochastic decoherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discovering quantum orders in mixed many-body systems is an ongoing issue. Very recently, the notion of an intrinsic mixed state topologically-ordered (IMTO) state was proposed. As a concrete example, we observe the emergence of IMTO by studying the toric code system under stochastic maximal decoherence by $ZX$-diagonal type projective measurement without monitoring. We study how the toric code state changes to an IMTO state at the level of the averaged quantum trajectories. This phase transition is understood from the viewpoint of spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) of 1-form weak symmetry, that is, the IMTO is characterized by the symmetry restoration from the SSB, which comes from the proliferation of anyons. To understand the emergent IMTO, order and disorder parameters of 1-form symmetry are numerically studied by stabilizer simulation. The present study clarifies the existence of two kinds of fermionic anyons, and also the obtained critical exponents indicate strong relation between IMTO and percolation.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium dynamics of superconductivity in the Hatsugai-Kohmoto model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the non-equilibrium dynamics of the superconducting order parameter in the Hatsugai-Kohmoto (HK) model. In the absence of superconductivity, its ground state is a non-Fermi liquid, whose properties are controlled by the HK interaction. Our protocol involves quantum quenching the HK interaction but leaving the interaction responsible for superconductivity unchanged. We map out the non-equilibrium dynamical phase diagram of the interacting model which contains three phases where, at long times, the order parameter amplitude vanishes, approaches a constant value or persistently oscillates. We also investigate the Loschmidt echo in searching for dynamical quantum phase transition, and find no significant correlation between the three phases and the non-analytic temporal behaviour of the Loschmidt echo. The momentum space entanglement entropy between positive and negative momentum modes, relevant for Coopair pairing, is calculated. Counterintuitively, this momentum space entanglement does not change significantly during the quench dynamics and its value remains reasonably large even for vanishing superconducting order parameter. Nevertheless, its derivative with respect to the HK interaction signals the dynamical phase transition associated to the late time vanishing of superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Emergent soft-gap Anderson models at quantum criticality in a lattice Hamiltonian within dynamical mean field theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.07348v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Local quantum criticality in itinerant fermion systems has been extensively investigated through the soft-gap Anderson impurity model, wherein a localized, correlated impurity, hybridizes with a broad conduction band with a singular, $|\omega|^r$, density of states. However, lattice models hosting quantum critical points (QCPs), do not appear to have such a spectrum emerging at the QCP. In this work, we report the emergence of such a singular form of the density of states in a three-orbital lattice model, within dynamical mean field theory, precisely at a quantum critical point, separating a gapless, Fermi liquid, metallic phase from a gapped, Mott insulating phase. A temperature-dependent exponent, $\alpha$, defined using the corresponding Matsubara self-energy, is found to vary from $+1$ deep in the FL regime, to $-1$ in the Mott insulator regime. Interestingly, we find that $\alpha$ becomes temperature independent, and hence isosbestic, precisely at the QCP. The isosbestic exponent is shown to lead to an emergent soft-gap spectrum, $|\omega|^r$ at the QCP, where $r = |\alpha_{\rm iso}|$. We discuss the implications of our findings for non-Fermi liquid behaviour in the quantum critical region of the phase diagram.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06886v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In ergodic quantum spin chains, locally conserved quantities such as energy or particle number generically evolve according to hydrodynamic equations as they relax to equilibrium. We investigate the complexity of simulating hydrodynamics at infinite temperature with multiple methods: time evolving block decimation (TEBD), TEBD with density matrix truncation (DMT), the recursion method with a universal operator growth hypothesis (R-UOG), and operator-size truncated (OST) dynamics. Density matrix truncation and the OST dynamics give consistent dynamical correlations to $t=60/J$ and diffusion coefficients agreeing within 1%. TEBD only converges for $t\lesssim 20$, but still produces diffusion coefficients accurate within 1%. The universal operator growth hypothesis fails to converge and only matches other methods on short times. We see no evidence of long-time tails in either DMT or OST calculations of the current-current correlator, although we cannot rule out that they appear at longer times. We do observe power-law corrections to the energy density correlator. At finite wavelength, we observe a crossover from purely diffusive, overdamped decay of the energy density, to underdamped oscillatory behavior similar to that of cold atom experiments. We dub this behavior "hot band second sound" and offer a microscopically-motivated toy model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07948v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Van der Waals (vdW) magnetic materials are comprised of layers of atomically thin sheets, making them ideal platforms for studying magnetism at the two-dimensional (2D) limit. These materials are at the center of a host of novel types of experiments, however, there are notably few pathways to directly probe their magnetic structure. We report the magnetic order within a single crystal of NiPS$_3$ and show it can be accessed with resonant elastic X-ray diffraction along the edge of the vdW planes in a carefully grown crystal by detecting structurally forbidden resonant magnetic X-ray scattering. We find the magnetic order parameter has a critical exponent of $\beta\sim0.36$, indicating that the magnetism of these vdW crystals is more adequately characterized by the three-dimensional (3D) Heisenberg universality class. We verify these findings with first-principle density functional theory, Monte-Carlo simulations, and density matrix renormalization group calculations.</description>

      <title>Extended edge modes and disorder preservation of a symmetry-protected topological phase out of equilibrium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09610v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The time evolution of topological systems is an active area of interest due to their expected applications in fault-tolerant quantum computing. Here, we analyze the dynamics of a noninteracting spinless fermion chain in its topological phase, quenched out of equilibrium by a Hamiltonian belonging to the same symmetry class. Due to particle-hole symmetry, the bulk properties of the system remain intact throughout its evolution. However, the boundary properties may be drastically altered, with the initially localized Majorana edge modes extending across the chain. Up to a timescale $t^*$, identified by area-law behavior of the entanglement entropy, these extended edge modes are an example of exotic effects in topological systems out of equilibrium. Further, while local disorder can be utilized to preserve localization and increase $t^*$, we still identify nontrivial dynamics in the Majorana polarization and Loschmidt echo.</description>

      <title>Giant domain wall anomalous Hall effect in an antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07336v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generally, the dissipationless Hall effect in solids requires time-reversal symmetry breaking (TRSB), where TRSB induced by external magnetic field results in ordinary Hall effect, while TRSB caused by spontaneous magnetization gives rise to anomalous Hall effect (AHE) which scales with the net magnetization. The AHE is therefore not expected in antiferromagnets with vanishing small magnetization. However, large AHE was recently observed in certain antiferromagnets with noncolinear spin structure and nonvanishing Berry curvature. Here, we report another origin of AHE in a layered antiferromagnet EuAl2Si2, namely the domain wall (DW) skew scattering with Weyl points near the Fermi level, in experiments for the first time. Interestingly, the DWs form a unique periodic stripe structure with controllable periodicity by external magnetic field, which decreases nearly monotonically from 975 nm at 0 T to 232 nm at 4 T. Electrons incident on DW with topological bound states experience strong asymmetric scattering, leading to a giant AHE, with the DW Hall conductivity (DWHC) at 2 K and 1.2 T reaching a record value of ~ 1,5100 S cm-1 among bulk systems and being two orders of magnitude larger than the intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity. The observation not only sets a new paradigm for exploration of large anomalous Hall effect, but also provides potential applications in spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Topological Heavy Fermion Principle For Flat (Narrow) Bands With Concentrated Quantum Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07253v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a general principle for the low-energy theory of narrow bands with concentrated Berry curvature and Fubini-Study metric in the form of a map to Anderson-"+" models composed of heavy fermions hybridizing and interacting with semi-metallic modes. This map resolves the obstruction preventing topological bands from being realized in a local Hamiltonian acting on the low-energy degrees of freedom. The concentrated quantum geometry is reproduced through band inversion with a dispersive semi-metal, leaving a nearly flat, trivial band which becomes the heavy fermion. This representation is natural when the narrow band is not energetically isolated on the scale of the interaction and an enlarged Hilbert space is inescapable, but also provides analytical insight into the projected-interaction limit. First exemplified in twisted bilayer graphene (TBG), we extend it to (1) the twisted checkerboard, which we find has a chiral symmetric stable anomaly that forbids a lattice realization at all energies, and (2) the Lieb lattice with gapless flat bands, where we show the heavy fermions can be obtained by minimizing a Euclidean instanton action to saturate its BPS bound. The heavy fermion approach is widely applicable and physically transparent: heavy electrons carry the strong correlations and dispersive electrons carry the topology. This simple picture unifies the dichotomous phenomena observed in TBG and points to connections between moir\'e and stoichiometric materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09745v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the rapid development of modern measurement techniques, the energy resolution of $1 \, meV$ can now be easily obtained. Generally, the driving mechanisms of the physical, chemical or biological processes of the matters or the living organisms on Earth at about $1 \, meV$ energy scale are assumed to stem from the fundamental microscopic Coulomb interaction, its various reduced ones and the relativistic corrections. In this article, by using a path integral approach on a non-relativistic quantum electrodynamics theory, we show that there is another fundamental microscopic electromagnetic interaction at this energy scale, the microscopic Amp\`ere current-current interaction. It has time-dependent dynamical feature and can be the driving interaction of the physical, chemical or biological processes at about $1\, meV$ energy scale. A new Amp\`ere-type exchange spin interaction is also found with a magnitude about $10^{-4}$ of the well-known Heisenberg exchange spin interaction.</description>

      <title>Neural Network Quantum States for the Interacting Hofstadter Model with Higher Local Occupations and Long-Range Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04472v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to their immense representative power, neural network quantum states (NQS) have gained significant interest in current research. In recent advances in the field of NQS, it has been demonstrated that this approach can compete with state-of-the-art numerical techniques, making NQS a compelling alternative, in particular for the simulation of large, two-dimensional quantum systems. In this study, we show that recurrent neural network (RNN) wave functions can be employed to study systems relevant to current research in quantum many-body physics. Specifically, we employ a 2D tensorized gated RNN to explore the bosonic Hofstadter model with a variable local Hilbert space cut-off and long-range interactions. At first, we benchmark the RNN-NQS for the Hofstadter-Bose-Hubbard (HBH) Hamiltonian on a square lattice. We find that this method is, despite the complexity of the wave function, capable of efficiently identifying and representing most ground state properties. Afterwards, we apply the method to an even more challenging model for current methods, namely the Hofstadter model with long-range interactions. This model describes Rydberg-dressed atoms on a lattice subject to a synthetic magnetic field. We study systems of size up to $12 \times 12$ sites and identify three different regimes by tuning the interaction range and the filling fraction $\nu$. In addition to phases known from the HBH model at short-ranged interaction, we observe bubble crystals and Wigner crystals for long-ranged interactions. Especially interesting is the evidence of a bubble crystal phase on a lattice, as this gives experiments a starting point for the search of clustered liquid phases, possibly hosting non-Abelian anyon excitations. In our work we show that NQS are an efficient and reliable simulation method for quantum systems, which are the subject of current research.</description>

      <title>Kibble-Zurek behavior in a topological phase transition with a quadratic band crossing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19780v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kibble-Zurek (KZ) mechanism describes the scaling behavior when driving a system across a continuous symmetry-breaking transition. Previous studies have shown that the KZ-like scaling behavior also lies in the topological transitions in the Qi-Wu-Zhang model (2D) and the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model (1D), although symmetry breaking does not exist here. Both models with linear band crossings give that $\nu=1$ and $z=1$. We wonder whether different critical exponents can be acquired in topological transitions beyond linear band crossing. In this work, we look into the KZ behavior in a topological 2D checkerboard lattice with a quadratic band crossing. We investigate from dual perspectives: momentum distribution of the Berry curvature in clean systems for simplicity, and real-space analysis of domain-like local Chern marker configurations in disordered systems, which is a more intuitive analog to conventional KZ description. In equilibrium, we find the correlation length diverges with a power $\nu\simeq 1/2$. Then, by slowly quenching the system across the topological phase transition, we find that the freeze-out time $t_\mathrm{f}$ and the unfrozen length scale $\xi(t_\mathrm{f})$ both satisfy the KZ scaling, verifying $z\simeq 2$. We subsequently explore KZ behavior in topological phase transitions with other higher-order band crossing and find the relationship between the critical exponents and the order. Our results extend the understanding of the KZ mechanism and non-equilibrium topological phase transitions.</description>

      <title>A note on the canonical approach to hydrodynamics and linear response theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10698v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This note provides a comprehensive examination of the various approaches to formulating relativistic hydrodynamics, with a particular emphasis on the canonical approach. Relativistic hydrodynamics plays a crucial role in understanding the behavior of fluids in high-energy astrophysical phenomena and heavy-ion collisions. The canonical approach is explored in detail, highlighting its foundational principles, mathematical formulations, and practical implications in modeling relativistic fluid dynamics. Following this, we delve into the linear response theory, elucidating its relevance in the context of hydrodynamics. We analyze the response of relativistic fluids to external perturbations, discussing the theoretical framework and key results. This dual focus aims to bridge the gap between theoretical foundations and practical applications, offering a robust perspective on the dynamic interplay between relativistic hydrodynamics and linear response theory.</description>

      <title>Evolution of pairing symmetry in FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_x$ as probed by uniaxial-strain tuning of $T_c$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13319v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In iron-based superconductors (FeSCs), the interplay between electronic nematicity and superconductivity is essential for understanding the exotic superconducting ground state. In the nematic regime, uniaxial-strain ($\varepsilon$) tuning of the superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ [$\Delta T_c(\varepsilon)=\alpha\varepsilon+\beta\varepsilon^2$] offers a unique approach to investigating the evolution of pairing symmetry if both $s$ and $d$ wave pairing instabilities are relevant. Here, we employ uniaxial strain to tune the $T_c$ of FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_x$, in which both nematicity and superconductivity undergo significant changes with doping. While $T_c$ is usually suppressed quadratically with $\varepsilon$ in optimally doped BaFe$_2$As$_2$, $\Delta T_c(\varepsilon)$ in FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_x$ dominated by $\Delta T_c(\varepsilon)=\beta\varepsilon^2$ changes its sign from $\beta$ &lt; $0$ in FeSe to $\beta$ &gt; $0$ in FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_x$ ($x\gtrsim0.10$), indicating an evolution of the pairing symmetry from an $s_{\pm}$ state towards an $s+d$ wave state. These findings highlight the $\Delta T_c(\varepsilon)$ as a powerful probe for elucidating the superconducting pairing symmetry in the nematic regime of FeSCs and provide new insights into the evolution of pairing symmetry in FeSCs.</description>
