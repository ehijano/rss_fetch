      <title>SOON: Symmetric Orthogonal Operator Network for Global Subseasonal-to-Seasonal Climate Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate global Subseasonal-to-Seasonal (S2S) climate forecasting is critical for disaster preparedness and resource management, yet it remains challenging due to chaotic atmospheric dynamics. Existing models predominantly treat atmospheric fields as isotropic images, conflating the distinct physical processes of zonal wave propagation and meridional transport, and leading to suboptimal modeling of anisotropic dynamics. In this paper, we propose the Symmetric Orthogonal Operator Network (SOON) for global S2S climate forecasting. It couples: (1) an Anisotropic Embedding strategy that tokenizes the global grid into latitudinal rings, preserving the integrity of zonal periodic structures; and (2) a stack of SOON Blocks that models the alternating interaction of Zonal and Meridional Operators via a symmetric decomposition, structurally mitigating discretization errors inherent in long-term integration. Extensive experiments on the Earth Reanalysis 5 dataset demonstrate that SOON establishes a new state-of-the-art, significantly outperforming existing methods in both forecasting accuracy and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Blackening Cryosphere: Revealing Hotspot Shifts and HGB-Based Forecasting of Absorbing Aerosol Threats over the Himalayan Frozen Frontiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black carbon and mineral dust are key absorbing aerosols that influence atmospheric radiation and increasingly threaten global cryospheric stability. This study examines the long-range transport and seasonal variability of these aerosols over Pakistan and their movement toward the western Himalayas. Using satellite-derived Absorption Aerosol Optical Depth (AAOD) data from 2019 to mid-2025, we analyse their spatiotemporal behaviour across Pakistan's urban lowlands and high-altitude regions. Fifteen-day aggregated AAOD fields are used to track seasonal transport into glaciated terrain, where deposited aerosols can darken snow and ice and accelerate melt. For high-AAOD events, a probabilistic forecasting approach based on machine learning (ML) was developed. Using geographical, seasonal, and lagged indicators, a histogram-based gradient boosting classifier was trained to predict AAOD exceedance one step in advance. ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, and the Brier score were used to assess the model's performance. The results show high predictive capacity and good probability calibration, with values of 0.791, 0.269, and 0.028, respectively. Forecasts indicate that areas adjacent to Himalayan glaciers consistently exhibit the highest probability of increasing AAOD, signalling an elevated risk of aerosol-induced snowmelt.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing Carbon Monoxide Reanalysis with Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Copernicus Atmospheric Monitoring Service provides reanalysis products for atmospheric composition by combining model simulations with satellite observations. The quality of these products depends strongly on the availability of the observational data, which can vary over time as new satellite instruments become available or are discontinued, such as Carbon Monoxide (CO) observations of the Measurements Of Pollution In The Troposphere (MOPITT) satellite in early 2025. Machine learning offers a promising approach to compensate for such data losses by learning systematic discrepancies between model configurations. In this study, we investigate machine learning methods to predict monthly-mean total column of Carbon Monoxide re-analysis from a control model simulation.</description>

      <title>IT-DPC-SRI: A Cloud-Optimized Archive of Italian Radar Precipitation (2010-2025)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present IT-DPC-SRI, the first publicly available long-term archive of Italian weather radar precipitation estimates, spanning 16 years (2010--2025). The dataset contains Surface Rainfall Intensity (SRI) observations from the Italian Civil Protection Department's national radar mosaic, harmonized into a coherent Analysis-Ready Cloud-Optimized (ARCO) Zarr datacube. The archive comprises over one million timesteps at temporal resolutions from 15 to 5 minutes, covering a $1200\times1400$ kilometer domain at 1 kilometer spatial resolution, compressed from 7TB to 51GB on disk. We address the historical fragmentation of Italian radar data - previously scattered across heterogeneous formats (OPERA BUFR, HDF5, GeoTIFF) with varying spatial domains and projections - by reprocessing the entire record into a unified store. The dataset is accessible as a static versioned snapshot on Zenodo, via cloud-native access on the ECMWF European Weather Cloud, and as a continuously updated live version on the ArcoDataHub platform. This release fills a significant gap in European radar data availability, as Italy does not participate in the EUMETNET OPERA pan-European radar composite. The dataset is released under a CC BY-SA 4.0 license.</description>

      <title>Southern Ocean latent heat flux variability driven by oceanic meso- and submesoscale motions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Latent heat flux is a primary pathway for ocean-atmosphere exchange of heat and moisture, yet the influence of sea surface temperature variability at fine scales ($\leq$ 100 km) on latent heat flux variability, particularly over the Southern Ocean, remains poorly understood. Here we quantify the scale-dependent drivers of latent heat flux (LHF) variability using a year-long, global, fully coupled ocean-atmosphere simulation with kilometer-scale resolution. Annual-mean LHF in eddy-rich regions reaches $\approx$ 215 W m$^{-2}$, approximately three times larger than in eddy-poor regions. Spectral analyses show that ocean mesoscale [$\mathcal{O}$(100 km)] and submesoscale [$\mathcal{O}$(1-10 km)] variability accounts for up to $\approx$ 80% of the total LHF variance in eddy-rich sectors, but as little as 10% in eddy-poor regions, and increases proportionally with eddy kinetic energy and sea surface temperature (SST) variance. We also find that strong submesoscale SST fronts ($\approx$ 5 $^\circ$C over 10 km) force a localized secondary circulation that extends well above the marine boundary layer into the mid-troposphere. Comparison with ERA5 shows that fine ocean scales, responsible for about 17% of the ocean-driven LHF variance in the simulation, are largely unresolved in the reanalysis, leading to a muted atmospheric response lacking any secondary circulation. Despite a strong heterogeneity in LHF variability, the atmospheric dynamics are mostly uniform across the domain, suggesting a non local atmospheric response to ocean forcing. These results highlight the potential for ocean meso- and submesoscales, commonly under-resolved in climate models and reanalysis, to influence Southern Ocean air-sea coupling and atmosphere both locally and remotely.</description>

      <title>Ensemble-size-dependence of deep-learning post-processing methods that minimize an (un)fair score: motivating examples and a proof-of-concept solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fair scores reward ensemble forecast members that behave like samples from the same distribution as the verifying observations. They are therefore an attractive choice as loss functions to train data-driven ensemble forecasts or post-processing methods when large training ensembles are either unavailable or computationally prohibitive. The adjusted continuous ranked probability score (aCRPS) is fair and unbiased with respect to ensemble size, provided forecast members are exchangeable and interpretable as conditionally independent draws from an underlying predictive distribution. However, distribution-aware post-processing methods that introduce structural dependency between members can violate this assumption, rendering aCRPS unfair. We demonstrate this effect using two approaches designed to minimize the expected aCRPS of a finite ensemble: (1) a linear member-by-member calibration, which couples members through a common dependency on the sample ensemble mean, and (2) a deep-learning method, which couples members via transformer self-attention across the ensemble dimension. In both cases, the results are sensitive to ensemble size and apparent gains in aCRPS can correspond to systematic unreliability characterized by over-dispersion. We introduce trajectory transformers as a proof-of-concept that ensemble-size independence can be achieved. This approach is an adaptation of the Post-processing Ensembles with Transformers (PoET) framework and applies self-attention over lead time while preserving the conditional independence required by aCRPS. When applied to weekly mean $T_{2m}$ forecasts from the ECMWF subseasonal forecasting system, this approach successfully reduces systematic model biases whilst also improving or maintaining forecast reliability regardless of the ensemble size used in training (3 vs 9 members) or real-time forecasts (9 vs 100 members).</description>

      <title>Multi-Arrival Infrasound from Meteoroids: Fragmentation Signatures versus Propagation Effects in a Fine-Scale Layered Atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Infrasonic signatures of meteoroid fragmentation are frequently ambiguous: do multiple arrivals signify a complex breakup or merely the distorting effects of a layered atmosphere? Resolving this ambiguity is critical for accurate energy estimates and source reconstruction. In this study, we address this challenge by analyzing a unique regional dataset of well-constrained meteoroid events observed by the Southern Ontario Meteor Network and the co-located Elginfield Infrasound Array. We employ pseudo-differential parabolic equation (PPE) simulations to quantify how fine-scale gravity-wave structures in the stratosphere and lower thermosphere modify acoustic waveforms at ranges &lt;300 km. Our modeling reveals that while fine-scale layering can stretch signals and generate diffuse oscillatory tails, it does not produce discrete, high-amplitude pulse splitting at ranges below ~140 km. By applying these results to the rare multi-arrival event 20060305, we demonstrate that its distinct double arrival at 100 km range is inconsistent with atmospheric multipathing and provides definitive evidence of separate fragmentation episodes. These findings establish new diagnostic criteria for separating source physics from propagation artifacts, improving the reliability of infrasound as a monitoring tool for natural bolides, space debris re-entries, and catastrophic launch failures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.06986v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the coupled dynamics of temperature and atmospheric CO2 concentrations during Pleistocene glacial cycles using a Structural Vector Error Correction Model (SVECM). To address the controversy regarding causal leads and lags, we develop a structural identification framework that utilizes Milankovitch orbital parameters as instrumental variables to disentangle the Instantaneous Greenhouse Effect (IGE) and the Instantaneous Carbon Feedback (ICF) at a millennial resolution. Focusing on the gap-free interval of Termination II, we employ a Causality Allocation Curve (CAC) derived from system-wide residuals to identify the causal structure that maximizes statistical consistency with the observed record. This approach allows for the estimation of Earth System Sensitivity (ESS) based purely on observational data and the decomposition of warming dynamics into structural momentum and equilibrium adjustment. By demonstrating the consistency of these paleo-derived structural parameters with modern instrumental records, this study establishes a robust econometric foundation for integrating long-term climate analysis with contemporary climate monitoring.</description>

      <title>Atmospheric Muon Measurements Near Tornadic and Non-Tornadic Storms in the US Central Plains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20182v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tornadoes and other severe weather hazards affect thousands of people every year. Despite this, the details surrounding tornadic processes including formation, decay, and longevity are not well understood, partially due to limitations of available instrumentation. Measurements of atmospheric pressure within tornadic systems currently rely almost entirely on in-situ instrumentation, and no existing techniques can provide two-dimensional spatial information of the atmospheric density field. Atmospheric muons may hold a solution to this problem: muons are attenuated by matter, and tornadic storms are large regions of low atmospheric density, suggesting that tornadic storms induce a directional perturbation on the atmospheric muon flux. Measurements of this perturbation could then be used to infer the density field associated with severe weather. Simulations of these systems indicate that a robust measurement of the atmospheric density field would require a relatively large muon detector, however smaller detectors may be able to detect ambient muon flux perturbations if the storm is large and intense enough. This paper presents results from a pilot field study that measured the atmospheric muon flux near tornadic storms during May 2025, including directional measurements of the muon flux near tornadic mesocyclones and a measurement of the muon flux near the base of a forming tornado.</description>

      <title>Causally constrained reduced-order neural models of complex turbulent dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13847v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a flexible framework based on response theory and score matching to suppress spurious, noncausal dependencies in reduced-order neural emulators of turbulent systems, focusing on climate dynamics as a proof-of-concept. We showcase the approach using the stochastic Charney-DeVore model as a relevant prototype for low-frequency atmospheric variability. We show that the resulting causal constraints enhance neural emulators' ability to respond to both weak and strong external forcings, despite being trained exclusively on unforced data. The approach is broadly applicable to modeling complex turbulent dynamical systems in reduced spaces and can be readily integrated into general neural network architectures.</description>
