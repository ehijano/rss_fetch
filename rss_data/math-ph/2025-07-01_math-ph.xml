      <title>Quadratic Bureau-Guillot systems with the first and second Painlev\'e transcendents in the coefficients. Part I: geometric approach and birational equivalence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bureau proposed a classification of systems of quadratic differential equations in two variables which are free of movable critical points, which was recently revised by Guillot. We revisit the quadratic Bureau-Guillot systems with the first and second Painlev\'e transcendent in the coefficients. We explain their birational equivalence by using the geometric approach of Okamoto's spaces of initial conditions and the method of iterative polynomial regularisation, solving the Painlev\'e equivalence problem for the Bureau-Guillot systems with non-rational meromorphic coefficients. We also find that one of the systems related to the second Painlev\'e equation can be transformed into a Hamiltonian system (which we call the cubic Bureau Hamiltonian system) via the iterative polynomial regularisation.</description>

      <title>Zernike polynomials from the tridiagonalization of the radial harmonic oscillator in displaced Fock states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the J-matrix method for the one dimensional radial harmonic oscillator (RHO) and construct its tridiagonal matrix representation within an orthonormal basis phi(z)n of L2 (R+);parametrized by a fixed z in the complex unit disc D and n = 0,1,2,.... Remarkably, for fixed n,and varying z in D, the system phi(z)n forms a family of Perelomov-type coherent states associated with the RHO. For each fixed n, the expansion of phi(z)n over the basis (fs) of eigenfunctions of the RHO yields coefficients cn,s(z; z) precisely given by two-dimensional complex Zernike polynomials. The key insight is that the algebraic tridiagonal structure of RHO contains the complete information about the bound state solutions of the two-dimensional Schr\"odinger operator describing a charged particle in a magnetic field (of strenght proportionnal to B &gt; 1/2) on the Poincar\'e disc D.</description>

      <title>A Closed-Form Approach to Oscillatory Integrals in Level-Crossing Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a closed-form, exact analytical solution, valid at finite times, to a class of multiple integrals with highly oscillatory kernels. Our approach leverages the intimate connection between these integrals and the minimal level-crossing model, namely the Landau-Zener model. Benchmarking against data from numerical simulations demonstrates excellent agreement validating our analytical method. Impacts of our results in level-crossing dynamics are also discussed. A dedicated Mathematica package named {\bf OscillatoryIntegralAnalytical.wl} publicly accessible in our \href{https://github.com/Kenmax15/Closed-Form-Approach-to-Oscillatory-Integrals/tree/main}{GitHub repository} allows generating the integrals for arbitrary order.</description>

      <title>The Generalized Dirac Equation in the Metric Affine Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the most general form of Dirac equation in the non$-$Riemannian spacetimes containing curvature, torsion and non$-$metricity. It includes all bases of the Clifford algebra $cl(1,3)$ within the spinor connection. We adopt two approaches. First, the generalized Dirac equation is directly formulated by applying the minimal coupling prescription to the original Dirac equation. It is referred to as the {\it direct Dirac equation} for seek of clarity and to preserve the tractability. Second, through the application of variational calculation to the original Dirac Lagrangian, the resulting Dirac equation is referred to as the {\it variational Dirac equation}. A consistency crosscheck is performed between these two approaches, leading to novel constraints on the arbitrary coupling constants appearing in the covariant derivative of spinor. Following short analysis on the generalized Dirac Lagrangian, it is observed that two of the novel terms give rise to a shift in the spinor mass by sensing its handedness.</description>

      <title>Canonical partial ordering from min-cuts and quantum entanglement in random tensor networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The \emph{max-flow min-cut theorem} has been recently used in the theory of random tensor networks in quantum information theory, where it is helpful for computing the behavior of important physical quantities, such as the entanglement entropy. In this paper, we extend the max-flow min-cut theorem to a relation among different \emph{partial orders} on the set of vertices of a network and introduce a new partial order for the vertices based on the \emph{min-cut structure} of the network. We apply the extended max-flow min-cut theorem to random tensor networks and find that the \emph{finite correction} to the entanglement R\'enyi entropy arising from the degeneracy of the min-cuts is given by the number of \emph{order morphisms} from the min-cut partial order to the partial order induced by non-crossing partitions on the symmetric group. Moreover, we show that the number of order morphisms corresponds to moments of a graph-dependent measure which generalizes the free Bessel law in some special cases in free probability theory.</description>

Abstract: The description of the $\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_2$-graded special linear Lie superalgebra $\mathfrak{sl} (m_1+1,m_2|n_1,n_2)$ is carried out via generators $a_1^\pm,\ldots, a_{m_1+m_2+n_1+n_2}^\pm$ that satisfy triple relations and are called creation and annihilation operators. With respect to these generators, a class of Fock type representations of $\mathfrak{sl} (m_1+1,m_2|n_1,n_2)$ is constructed. The properties of the underlying statistics are discussed and its Pauli principle is formulated.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a generalization of Dirac constraint theory based on the theory of Poisson-Dirac submanifolds. The theory is formulated in a coordinate-free manner while simultaneously relaxing the invertibility condition as seen in standard Dirac constraint theory. We illustrate the the method with two examples: elimination of the electron number density using Gass' Law and ideal MHD as a slow manifold constraint in the ideal two-fluid model.</description>

      <title>An anomalous particle-exchange mechanism for two isolated Bose gases merged into one</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In an isolated ideal Bose system with a fixed energy, the number of microstates depends solely on the configurations of bosons in excited states, implying zero entropy for particles in the ground state. When two such systems merge, the resulting entropy is less than the sum of the individual entropies. This entropy decrease is numerically shown to arise from an effectively but anomalous exchange of particles in excited states, where $\overline{N}!/(\overline{N}_{1}!\overline{N}_{2}!)&lt;1$. Here, $\overline{N}$, $\overline{N}_{1}$, and $\overline{N}_{2}$ are real decimals representing, respectively, the mean number of particles in excited states in the merged system and the two individual systems before merging, with $\overline{N}&lt;\overline{N}_{1}+\overline{N}_{2}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The entanglement bootstrap program has generated new quantum numbers associated with degrees of freedom living on gapped domain walls between topological phases in two dimensions. Most fundamental among these are the so-called "parton" quantum numbers, which give rise to a zoo of composite sectors. In this note, we propose a categorical description of partons. Along the way, we make contact with ideas from generalized symmetries and SymTFT.</description>

      <title>On the Structure of Carbon Nanotubes: Results from Computer-Assisted Proofs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a toolbox based on computer-assisted proofs to rigorously study the structure of capped carbon nanotubes. We model nanotubes as minimizers of an interatomic potential. Numerical simulations and validated computations produce rigorous mathematical results about atomic distances and structural variations. In particular, we rigorously measure the diameter, bond lengths, and bond angles of nanotubes and thereby precisely quantify oscillations near the caps, differences between interaction potentials, and effects of nanotube size or chirality. As an example, we observe that the caps induce diameter oscillations along the tube (rather than a monotonous diameter equilibration) with increasing spatial extent for less smooth interaction potentials.</description>

      <title>Projective Transformations for Regularized Central Force Dynamics: Hamiltonian Formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a Hamiltonian approach to regularization and linearization of central force particle dynamics through a new canonical extension of the so-called "projective decomposition". The regularization scheme is formulated within the framework of classic analytical Hamiltonian dynamics as a redundant-dimensional canonical/symplectic coordinate transformation, combined with an evolution parameter transformation, on extended phase space. By considering a generalized version of the standard projective decomposition, we obtain a family of such canonical transformations which differ at the momentum level. From this family of transformations, a preferred canonical coordinate set is chosen that possesses a simple and intuitive connection to the particle's local reference frame. Using this transformation, closed-form solutions are readily obtained for inverse square and inverse cubic radial forces (or any superposition thereof) on any finite-dimensional Euclidean space. From these solutions, a new set of orbit elements for Kepler-Coulomb dynamics is derived, along with their variational equations for arbitrary perturbations (singularity-free in all cases besides rectilinear motion). Governing equations are numerically validated for the classic two-body problem, incorporating the J_2 gravitational perturbation.</description>

      <title>Heavy-tailed open quantum systems reveal long-lived and ultrasensitive coherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding random open quantum systems is critical for characterizing the performance of large-scale quantum devices and exploring macroscopic quantum phenomena. Various features in these systems, including spectral distributions, gap scaling, and decoherence, have been examined by modelling randomness under the central limit theorem. Here, we investigate random open quantum systems beyond the central limit theorem, focusing on heavy-tailed system-environment interactions. By extending the Ginibre unitary ensemble, we model system-environment interactions to exhibit a continuous transition from light-tailed to heavy-tailed distributions. This generalized configuration reveals unique properties-gapless spectra, Pareto principle governing dissipation, orthogonalization, and quasi-degeneracies-all linked to the violation of the central limit theorem. The synergy of these features challenges the common belief-the tradeoff between stability and sensitivity-through the emergence of long-lived and ultrasensitive quantum coherences that exhibit an enhancement of two orders of magnitude compared to predictions under the central limit theorem. The result, which is based on heavy-tailedness of open quantum systems, provides highly desirable platforms for quantum sensing applications.</description>

      <title>Non-Bloch Band Theory for 2D Geometry-Dependent Non-Hermitian Skin Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), characterized by boundary-localized eigenstates under open boundary conditions, represents the key feature of the non-Hermitian lattice systems. Although the non-Bloch band theory has achieved success in depicting the NHSE in one-dimensional (1D) systems, its extension to higher dimensions encounters a fundamental hurdle in the form of the geometry-dependent skin effect (GDSE), where the energy spectra and the boundary localization of the eigenstates rely on the lattice geometry. In this work, we establish the non-Bloch band theory for two-dimensional (2D) GDSE, by introducing a strip generalized Brillouin zone (SGBZ) framework. Through taking two sequential 1D thermodynamic limits, first along a major axis and then along a minor axis, we construct geometry-dependent non-Bloch bands, unraveling that the GDSE originates from the competition between incompatible SGBZs. Based on our theory, we derive for the first time a crucial sufficient condition for the GDSE: the non-Bloch dynamical degeneracy splitting of SGBZ eigenstates, where a continuous set of degenerate complex momenta breaks down into a discrete set. Moreover, our SGBZ formulation reveals that the Amoeba spectrum contains the union of all possible SGBZ spectra, which bridges the gap between the GDSE and the Amoeba theory. The proposed SGBZ framework offers a universal roadmap for exploring non-Hermitian effects in 2D lattice systems, opening up new avenues for the design of novel non-Hermitian materials and devices with tailored boundary behaviors.</description>

Abstract: Reconstruction of a full-space quantum Hamiltonian from its effective Feshbach's model-space avatar is shown feasible. In a preparatory step the information carried by the effective Hamiltonian is compactified using a linear algebraic operation (matrix inversion). A ``universal'' coupled set of polynomial algebraic equations it then obtained. In a few simplest special cases their solution is given and discussed.</description>

      <title>Generating Moving Field Initial Conditions with Spatially Varying Boost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel class of algorithms, the ``spatially varying boost'', for generating dynamical field initial conditions with prescribed bulk velocities. Given (non-moving) initial field data, the algorithm generates new initial data with the given velocity profile by performing local Lorentz boosts. This algorithm is generic, with no restriction on the type of the field, the equation of motion, and can endow fields with ultra-relativistic velocities. This algorithm enables new simulations in different branches of physics, including cosmology and condensed matter physics. For demonstration, we used this algorithm to (1) boost two Sine-Gordon solitons to ultra-relativistic speeds for subsequent collision, (2) generate a relativistic transverse Proca field with random velocities, and (3) set up a spin-$1$ Schr\"{o}dinger-Poisson field with velocity and density perturbations consistent with dark matter in matter dominated universe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we systematically investigate the intricate dynamics of the breather-to-soliton transitions and nonlinear wave interactions for the higher-order modified Gerdjikov-Ivanov equation. We discuss the transition conditions of the breather-to-soliton and obtain different types of nonlinear converted waves, including the W-shaped soliton, M-shaped soliton, multi-peak soliton, anti-dark soliton and periodic wave solution. Meanwhile, the interactions among the above nonlinear converted waves are explored by choosing appropriate parameters. Furthermore, we derive the double-pole breather-to-soliton transitions and apply the asymptotic analysis method to analyze the dynamics of the asymptotic solitons for the double-pole anti-dark soliton.</description>

      <title>Subordinacy theory for long-range operators: hyperbolic geodesic flow insights and monotonicity theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a comprehensive framework for subordinacy theory applicable to long-range operators on $\ell^2(\mathbb Z)$, bridging dynamical systems and spectral analysis. For finite-range operators, we establish a correspondence between the dynamical behavior of partially hyperbolic (Hermitian-)symplectic cocycles and the existence of purely absolutely continuous spectrum, resolving an open problem posed by Jitomirskaya. For infinite-range operators-where traditional cocycle methods become inapplicable-we characterize absolutely continuous spectrum through the growth of generalized eigenfunctions, extending techniques from higher-dimensional lattice models.
  Our main results include the first rigorous proof of purely absolutely continuous spectrum for quasi-periodic long-range operators with analytic potentials and Diophantine frequencies-in particular, the first proof of the all-phases persistence for finite-range perturbations of subcritical almost Mathieu operators-among other advances in spectral theory of long-range operators.
  The key novelty of our approach lies in the unanticipated connection between stable/vertical bundle intersections in geodesic flows-where they detect conjugate points-and their equally fundamental role in governing (de-)localization for Schr\"odinger operators. The geometric insight, combined with a novel coordinate-free monotonicity theory for general bundles (including its preservation under center-bundle restrictions) and adapted analytic spectral and KAM techniques, enables our spectral analysis of long-range operators.</description>

      <title>Homomorphism, substructure and ideal: Elementary but rigorous aspects of renormalization group or hierarchical structure of topological orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study ring homomorphisms between fusion rings appearing in conformal field theories connected under massless renormalization group (RG) flows. By interpreting the elementary relationship between homomorphism, quotient ring, and projection, we propose a general quantum Hamiltonian formalism of a massless and massive RG flow with an emphasis on generalized symmetry. In our formalism, the noninvertible nature of the ideal of a fusion ring plays a fundamental role as a condensation rule between anyons. Our algebraic method applies to the domain wall problem in $2+1$ dimensional topologically ordered systems and the corresponding classification of $1+1$ dimensional gapped phase, for example. An ideal decomposition of a fusion ring provides a straightforward but strong constraint on the gapped phase with noninvertible symmetry and its symmetry-breaking (or emergent symmetry) patterns. Moreover, even in several specific homomorphisms connected under massless RG flows, less familiar homomorphisms appear, and we conjecture that they correspond to partially solvable models in recent literature. Our work demonstrates the fundamental significance of the abstract algebraic structure, ideal, for the RG in physics.</description>

      <title>Stability transitions of NLS action ground-states on metric graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the orbital stability of action ground-states of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation over two particular cases of metric graphs, the $\mathcal{T}$ and the tadpole graphs. We show the existence of stability transitions near the $L^2$-critical exponent, a new dynamical feature of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation. More precisely, as the frequency $\lambda$ increases, the action ground-state transitions from stable to unstable and then back to stable (or vice-versa).
  This result is complemented with the stability analysis of ground-states in the asymptotic cases of low/high frequency and weak/strong nonlinear interaction. Finally, we present a numerical simulation of the stability of action ground-states depending on the nonlinearity and the frequency parameter, which validates the aforementioned theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Measurements in stochastic gravity and thermal variance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the thermal fluctuations of a free, conformally invariant, Maxwell quantum field (photon) interacting with a cosmological background spacetime, in the framework of quantum field theory in curved spacetimes and semiclassical and stochastic gravity. The thermal fluctuations give rise to backreaction effects upon the spacetime geometry, which are incorporated in the semiclassical Einstein-Langevin equation, evaluated in the cosmological Friedmann-Lema\^{i}tre-Robertson-Walker spacetime. We first evaluate the semiclassical Einstein equation for the background geometry sourced by the thermal quantum stress-energy tensor. For large enough temperature, the solution is approximated by a radiation-dominated expanding universe driven by the thermal bath of photons. We then evaluate the thermal noise kernel associated to the quantum fluctuations of the photon field using point-splitting regularization methods, and give its explicit analytic form in the limits of large and small temperature, as well as a local approximation. Finally, we prove that this thermal noise kernel corresponds exactly to the thermal variance of the induced fluctuations of the linearized metric perturbation in the local and covariant measurement scheme defined by Fewster and Verch. Our analysis allows to quantify the extent to which quantum fluctuations may give rise to non-classical effects, and thus become relevant in inflationary cosmology.</description>

      <title>Some invariant connections on symplectic reductive homogeneous spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A symplectic reductive homogeneous space is a pair $(G/H,\Omega)$, where $G/H$ is a reductive homogeneous $G$-space and $\Omega$ is a $G$-invariant symplectic form on it. The main examples include symplectic Lie groups, symplectic symmetric spaces, and flag manifolds. This paper focuses on the existence of a natural symplectic connection on $(G/H,\Omega)$. First, we introduce a family $\{\nabla^{a,b}\}_{(a,b)\in\mathbb{R}^2}$ of $G$-invariant connection on $G/H$, and establish that $\nabla^{0,1}$ is flat if and only if $(G/H,\Omega)$ is locally a symplectic Lie group. Next, we show that among all $\{\nabla^{a,b}\}_{(a,b)\in\mathbb{R}^2}$, there exists a unique symplectic connection, denoted by $\nabla^\mathbf{s}$, corresponding to $a=b=\tfrac{1}{3}$, a fact that seems to have previously gone unnoticed. We then compute its curvature and Ricci curvature tensors. Finally, we demonstrate that the $\operatorname{SU}(3)$-invariant preferred symplectic connection of the Wallach flag manifold $\operatorname{SU}(3)/\mathbb{T}^2$ (from Cahen-Gutt-Rawnsley) coincides with the natural symplectic connection $\nabla^\mathbf{s}$, which is furthermore Ricci-parallel.</description>

Abstract: We consider motion of a material point placed in a constant homogeneous magnetic field restricted to the sphere $S^{n-1}$. We provide a Lax representation of the equations of motion for arbitrary $n$ and prove integrability of those systems in the Liouville sense.

      <title>Quantum phase transitions and information-theoretic measures of a spin-oscillator system with non-Hermitian coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we describe some interesting properties of a spin-oscillator system with non-Hermitian coupling. As shown earlier, the Hilbert space of this problem can be described by infinitely-many closed two-dimensional invariant subspaces together with the global ground state. We expose the appearance of exceptional points (EP) on such two-dimensional subspaces together with quantum phase transitions marking the transit from real to complex eigenvalues. We analytically compute some information-theoretic measures for this intriguing system, namely, the thermal entropy as well as the von Neumann and R\'enyi entropies using the framework of the so-called \(G\)-inner product. Such entropic measures are verified to be non-analytic at the points which mark the quantum phase transitions on the space of parameters -- a naive comparison with Ehrenfest's classification of phase transitions then suggests that these transitions are of the first order as the first derivatives of the entropies are discontinuous across such transitions.</description>

      <title>The monomial expansions for modified Macdonald polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discover a family $A$ of sixteen statistics on fillings of any given Young diagram and prove new combinatorial formulas for the modified Macdonald polynomials, that is, $$\tilde{H}_{\lambda}(X;q,t)=\sum_{\sigma\in T(\lambda)}x^{\sigma}q^{maj(\sigma)}t^{\eta(\sigma)}$$ for each statistic $\eta\in A$. Building upon this new formula, we establish four compact formulas for the modified Macdonald polynomials, namely, $$\tilde{H}_{\lambda}(X;q,t)=\sum_{\sigma}d_{\varepsilon}(\sigma)x^{\sigma}q^{maj(\sigma)}t^{\eta(\sigma)}$$ which is summed over all canonical or dual canonical fillings of a Young diagram and $d_{\varepsilon}(\sigma)$ is a product of $t$-multinomials. Finally, the compact formulas enable us to derive four explicit expressions for the monomial expansion of modified Macdonald polynomials, one of which coincides with the formula given by Garbali and Wheeler (2019).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the phase space formulation of the Jaynes-Cummings model through the explicit construction of the full Wigner function for a hybrid bipartite quantum system composed of a two-level atom and a quantized coherent field. By employing the Stratonovich-Weyl correspondence and the coadjoint orbit method, we derive an informationally complete quasi-probability distribution that captures the full dynamics of light-matter interaction. This approach provides a detailed phase space perspective of fundamental quantum phenomena such as Rabi oscillations, atomic population inversion, and entanglement generation. We further measure the purity of the reduced quantized field state by means of an appropriate Wigner function corresponding to the bosonic field part in order to investigate the entanglement dynamics of the system.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the dynamical properties of cusp bifurcations in max-plus dynamical systems derived from continuous differential equations through the tropical discretization and the ultradiscrete limit. A general relationship between cusp bifurcations in continuous and corresponding discrete systems is formulated as a proposition. For applications of this proposition, we analyze the Ludwig and Lewis models, elucidating the dynamical structure of their ultradiscrete cusp bifurcations obtained from the original continuous models. In the resulting ultradiscrete max-plus systems, the cusp bifurcation is characterized by piecewise linear representations, and its behavior is examined through the graph analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Repetitive curling of the incompressible viscid Navier-Stokes differential equation leads to a higher-order diffusion equation. Substituting this equation into the Navier-Stokes differential equation transposes the latter into the Korteweg-de Vries-Burgers equation with the Weierstrass p-function as the soliton solution. However, a higher-order derivative of the studied variable produces the so-called N-soliton solution, which is comparable to the N-soliton solution of the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equation.</description>

Abstract: We classify Toda-type tt*-structures in terms of the anti-symmetry condition. A Toda-type tt*-structure is a flat bundle whose flatness condition is the tt*-Toda equation (Guest-Its-Lin). We show that the Toda-type tt*-structure can be described as a fixed point of $e^{\sqrt{-1}\frac{2\pi}{n+1}}$-multiplication and this ``intrinsic'' description reduces the possibilities of the anti-symmetry condition to only two cases. We give an application to the relation between tt*-Toda equations and representation theory.</description>

Abstract: Wind tunnels and linearized turbulence and boundary-layer models have been so far necessary to simulate and approximate the stationery lift and drag forces on (base-mounted) airfoils by means of statistically determined or approximated values of the relevant situational coefficients as the drag and lift coefficients.To improve this process, we introduce transient and exact formulae to separate these forces in advance by means of the solutions found from the fluid dynamics model of the Navier Stokes differential equations.</description>

      <title>Heavy-Tailed Mixed p-Spin Spherical Model: Breakdown of Ultrametricity and Failure of the Parisi Formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the two cornerstones of mean-field spin glass theory -- the Parisi variational formula and the ultrametric organization of pure states -- break down under heavy-tailed disorder. For the mixed spherical $p$-spin model whose couplings have tail exponent $\alpha&lt;2$, we attach to each $p$ an explicit threshold $H_p^{*}$. If any coupling exceeds its threshold, a single dominant monomial governs both the limiting free energy and the entire Gibbs measure; the resulting energy landscape is intrinsically probabilistic, with a sharp failure of ultrametricity for $p\ge4$ and persistence of only a degenerate 1-RSB structure for $p\le3$. When all couplings remain below their thresholds, the free energy is $O(n^{-1})$ and the overlap is near zero, resulting in a trivial Gibbs geometry. For $\alpha&lt;1$ we further obtain exact fluctuations of order $n^{1-p}$. Our proof introduces Non-Intersecting Monomial Reduction (NIMR), an algebraic-combinatorial technique that blends convexity analysis, extremal combinatorics and concentration on the sphere, providing the first rigorous description of both regimes for heavy-tailed spin glasses with $p\ge3$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.24079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The maximum entropy principle states that the maximum entropy among all quantum states with a fixed mean energy is achieved only by the thermal state of given mean energy. In this notes, we prove the maximum entropy principle for quantum processes -- the entropy of a quantum channel with fixed mean energy is maximum if and only if the channel is absolutely thermalizing channel with the fixed output thermal state of that mean energy. This allows for an alternate approach to describe emergence of the absolute thermalization processes under energy constraints in the observable universe.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Symmetry-Fragmentation of Nonabelian Anyons In Symmetry-Enriched Topological Phases: A String-Net Model Realization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetry-enriched topological (SET) phases combine intrinsic topological order with global symmetries, giving rise to novel symmetry phenomena. While SET phases with Abelian anyons are relatively well understood, those involving non-Abelian anyons remain elusive. This obscurity stems from the multi-dimensional internal gauge spaces intrinsic to non-Abelian anyons -- a feature first made explicit in [1,2] and further explored and formalized in our recent works [3-8]. These internal spaces can transform in highly nontrivial ways under global symmetries. In this work, we employ an exactly solvable model -- the multifusion Hu-Geer-Wu string-net model introduced in a companion paper [9] -- to reveal how the internal gauge spaces of non-Abelian anyons transform under symmetries. We uncover a universal mechanism, global symmetry fragmentation (GSF), whereby symmetry-invariant anyons exhibit internal Hilbert space decompositions into eigensubspaces labeled by generally fractional symmetry charges. Meanwhile, symmetry-permuted anyons hybridize and fragment their internal spaces in accordance with their symmetry behavior. These fragmented structures realize genuinely nonlinear symmetry representations -- to be termed coherent representations -- that transcend conventional linear and projective classifications, reflecting the categorical nature of symmetries in topological phases. Our results identify nonlinear fragmentation as a hallmark of non-Abelian SETs and suggest new routes for symmetry-enabled control in topological quantum computation.</description>

      <title>The Second Order 2D Behaviors of a 3D Bose Gases in the Gross-Pitaevskii Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15540v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a system of $N$ bosons interacting in a three-dimensional box endowed with periodic boundary condition that is strongly confined in one direction such that the normalized thickness of the box $d\ll1$. We assume particles to interact through a repulsive, radially symmetric and short-range interaction potential with scattering length scale $a\ll d$. We present a comprehensive study of such system in the Gross-Pitaevskii regime, up to the second order ground state energy, starting from proving optimal Bose-Einstein condensation results which were not previously available. The fine interplay between the parameters $N$, $a$ and $d$ generates three regions. Our result in one region on the one hand, is compatible with the classical three-dimensional Lee-Huang-Yang formula. On the other hand, it reveals a new mechanism exhibiting how the second order correction compensates and modifies the first order energy, which was previously thought of as containing a jump, and thus explains how a three-dimensional Bose gas system smoothly transits into two-dimensional system. Moreover, delving into the analysis of this new mechanism exclusive to the second order, we discover a dimensional coupling correlation effect, deeply buried away from the expected 3D and quasi-2D renormalizations, and calculate a new second order correction to the ground state energy.</description>

      <title>Analysis of quasi-planar defects using the Thomas-Fermi-von Weiszacker model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11933v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the convergence of the electron density and relative energy with respect to a perfect crystal of a class of volume defects that are compactly contained along one direction while being of infinite extent along the other two using the Thomas-Fermi-von Weiszacker (TFW) model. We take advantage of prior work on the thermodynamic limit and stability estimates in the TFW setting, and specialize it to the case of quasi-planar defects. In particular, we prove that the relative energy of the defective crystal with respect to a perfect crystal is finite, and in fact conforms to a well-posed minimization problem. In order to show the existence of the minimization problem, we modify the TFW theory for thin films and establish convergence of the electronic fields due to the perturbation caused by the quasi-planar defect. We also show that perturbations to both the density and electrostatic potential due to the presence of the quasi-planar defect decay exponentially away from the defect, in agreement with the known locality property of the TFW model. We use these results to infer bounds on the generalized stacking fault energy, in particular the finiteness of this energy, and discuss its implications for numerical calculations. We conclude with a brief presentation of numerical results on the (non-convex) Thomas-Fermi-von Weiszacker-Dirac (TFWD) model that includes the Dirac exchange in the universal functional, and discuss its implications for future work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12253v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the initial boundary value problem of a finitely degenerate semilinear pseudo-parabolic equation associated with H\"{o}rmander's operator. Based on the global existence of solutions in previous literature, the exponential decay estimate of the energy functional is obtained. Moreover, by developing some novel estimates about solutions and using the energy method, the upper bounds of both blow-up time and blow-up rate and the exponential growth estimate of blow-up solutions are determined. In addition, the lower bound of blow-up rate is estimated when a finite time blow-up occurs. Finally, it is established that as time approaches infinity, the global solutions strongly converge to the solution of the corresponding stationary problem. These results complement and improve the ones obtained in the previous literature.</description>

      <title>Law of Large Numbers and Central Limit Theorem for random sets of solitons of the focusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17036v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a random configuration of $N$ soliton solutions $\psi_N(x,t;\boldsymbol{\lambda})$ of the cubic focusing Nonlinear Schr\"odinger (fNLS) equation in one space dimension. The $N$ soliton solutions are parametrized by $2N$ complex numbers $(\boldsymbol{\lambda}, \boldsymbol{c})$ where $\boldsymbol{\lambda}\in\mathbb{C}_+^N$ are the eigenvalues of the Zakharov-Shabat linear operator, and $ \boldsymbol{c}\in\mathbb{C}^N\backslash \{0\}$ are the norming constants of the corresponding eigenfunctions. The randomness is obtained by choosing the complex eigenvalues to be i.i.d. random variables sampled from a probability distribution with compact support in the complex plane. The corresponding norming constants are interpolated by a smooth function of the eigenvalues. Then we consider the expectation of the random measure associated to this random spectral data. Such expectation uniquely identifies, via the Zakharov-Shabat inverse spectral problem, a solution $\psi_\infty(x,t)$ of the fNLS equation. This solution can be interpreted as a soliton gas solution.
  We prove a Law of Large Numbers and a Central Limit Theorem for the differences $\psi_N(x,t;\boldsymbol{\lambda})-\psi_\infty(x,t)$ and $|\psi_N(x,t;\boldsymbol{\lambda})|^2-|\psi_\infty(x,t)|^2$ when $(x,t)$ are in a compact set of $\mathbb R\times\mathbb R^+$; we additionally compute the correlation functions.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Lieb-Robinson bounds for commuting long-range interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19241v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent works have revealed the intricate effect of long-range interactions on information transport in quantum many-body systems: In $D$ spatial dimensions, interactions decaying as a power-law $r^{-\alpha}$ with $\alpha &gt; 2 D+1$ exhibit a Lieb-Robinson bound (LRB) with a linear light cone and the threshold $2D +1$ is sharp in general. Here, we observe that mutually commuting, long-range interactions satisfy an enhanced LRB of the form $t \, r^{-\alpha}$ for any $\alpha&gt;0$, and this scaling is sharp. In particular, the linear light cone occurs at $\alpha = 1$ in any dimension. Part of our motivation stems from quantum error-correcting codes. As applications, we derive enhanced bounds on ground state correlations and an enhanced local perturbations perturb locally (LPPL) principle for which we adapt a recent subharmonicity argument of Wang-Hazzard. Similar enhancements hold for commuting interactions with stretched exponential decay.</description>

      <title>Moments of characteristic polynomials for classical $\beta$ ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07142v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For random matrix ensembles with unitary symmetry, there is interest in the large $N$ form of the moments of the absolute value of the characteristic polynomial for their relevance to the Riemann zeta function on the critical line, and to Fisher-Hartwig asymptotics in the theory of Toeplitz determinants. The constant (with respect to $N$) in this asymptotic expansion, involving the Barnes $G$ function, is most relevant to the first of these, while the algebraic term (in $N$) and the functional dependence on the power are of primary interest in the latter. Desrosiers and Liu [20] have obtained the analogous expansions for the classical Gaussian, Laguerre and Jacobi $\beta$ ensembles in the case of even moments. We give simplified working of these results -- which requires the use of duality formulas and the use of steepest descents for multidimensional integrals -- providing too an error bound on the resulting asymptotic expressions. The universality of the constant term with respect to an earlier result known for the circular $\beta$ ensemble is established, which requires writing it in a Barnes $G$ function form, while the functional dependence on the powers is related to that appearing in Gaussian fluctuation formulas for linear statistics. In the Laguerre and Jacobi cases our working can be extended to the circumstance when the exponents in the weight function are (strictly) proportional to $N$, giving results not previously available in the literature.</description>

Abstract: For a diagonalizable linear operator $H:\mathscr{H}\to\mathscr{H}$ acting in a separable Hilbert space $\mathscr{H}$, i.e., an operator with a purely point spectrum, eigenvalues with finite algebraic multiplicities, and a set of eigenvectors that form a Reisz basis of $\mathscr{H}$, the pseudo-Hermiticity of $H$ is equivalent to its generalized parity-time-reversal ($PT$) symmetry, where the latter means the existence of an antilinear operator $X:\mathscr{H}\to\mathscr{H}$ satisfying $[X,H]=0$ and $X^2=1$. {The original proof of this result makes use of the anti-pesudo-Hermiticity of every diagonalizable operator $L:\mathscr{H}\to\mathscr{H}$, which means the existence of an antilinear Hermitian bijection $\tau:\mathscr{H}\to\mathscr{H}$ satisfying $L^\dagger=\tau L\,\tau^{-1}$. We establish the validity of this result for block-diagonalizable operators}, i.e., those which have a purely point spectrum, eigenvalues with finite algebraic multiplicities, and a set of generalized eigenvectors that form a Jordan Reisz basis of $\mathscr{H}$. {This allows us to generalize the original proof of the equivalence of pseudo-Hermiticity and generalized $PT$-symmetry for diagonalizable operators to block-diagonalizable operators. For a pair of pseudo-Hermitian operators acting respectively in two-dimensional and infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, we obtain explicit expressions for the antlinear operators $\tau$ and $X$ that realize their anti-pseudo-Hermiticity and generalized $PT$-symmetry at and away from the exceptional points.</description>

      <title>Auxetic laminates composed of plies with special orthotropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04249v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the conditions for obtaining auxetic, i.e. with a negative Poisson's ratio, composite laminates made of specially orthotropic layers. In particular, the layers considered are of three types: R1-orthotropic, i.e. square-symmetric plies, like those reinforced by balanced fabrics, R0-orthotropic layers, like those that can be obtained with balanced fabrics having warp and weft forming an angle of 45 degrees, and finally r0-orthotropic layers, like common paper. All these types of orthotropy have mathematical and mechanical properties different by common orthotropy. As a consequence of this, the conditions of auxeticity for anisotropic composite laminates made of such special plies change from the more common case of unidirectional plies. These conditions are analyzed in this paper making use of the polar formalism, a mathematical method particularly suited for the study of two-dimensional anisotropic elasticity.</description>

Abstract: We construct families of rotationally symmetric toroidal domains in $\mathbb R^3$ for which the eigenfields associated to the first (positive) Amp\`erian curl eigenvalue are symmetric, and others for which no first eigenfield is symmetric. This implies, in particular, that minimizers of the celebrated Woltjer's variational principle do not need to inherit the rotational symmetry of the domain. This disproves the folk wisdom that the eigenfields corresponding to the lowest curl eigenvalue must be symmetric if the domain is.</description>

      <title>Generalised Fisher Information in Defective Fokker-Planck Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.14033v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The goal of this work is to introduce and investigate a \textit{generalised Fisher Information} in the setting of linear Fokker-Planck equations. This functional, which depends on two functions instead of one, exhibits the same decay behaviour as the standard Fisher information, and allows us to investigate different parts of the Fokker-Planck solution via an appropriate decomposition. Focusing almost exclusively on Fokker-Planck equations with constant drift and diffusion matrices, we will use a modification of the well established Bakry-Emery method with this newly defined functional to provide an alternative proof to the sharp long time behaviour of relative entropies of solutions to such equations when the diffusion matrix is positive definite and the drift matrix is defective. This novel approach is different to previous techniques and relies on minimal spectral information on the Fokker-Planck operator, unlike the one presented the authors' previous work, where powerful tools from spectral theory were needed.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical measures of eigenfunctions of the attractive Coulomb operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.09640v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We characterize the set of semiclassical measures corresponding to sequences of eigenfunctions of the attractive Coulomb operator $\widehat{H}_{\hbar}:=-\frac{\hbar^2}{2}\Delta_{\mathbb{R}^3}-\frac{1}{|x|}$. In particular, any Radon probability measure on the fixed negative energy hypersurface $\Sigma_E$ of the Kepler Hamiltonian $H$ in classical phase space that is invariant under the regularized Kepler flow is the semiclassical measure of a sequence of eigenfunctions of $\widehat{H}_{\hbar}$ with eigenvalue $E$ as $\hbar \to 0$. The main tool that we use is the celebrated Fock unitary conjugation map between eigenspaces of $\widehat{H}_{\hbar}$ and $-\Delta_{\mathbb{S}^3}$. We first prove that for any Kepler orbit $\gamma$ on $\Sigma_E$, there is a sequence of eigenfunctions that converge in the sense of semiclassical measures to the delta measure supported on $\gamma$ as $\hbar \to 0$, and we finish using a density argument in the weak-* topology.</description>

      <title>Symmetric Yang--Mills theory in FLRW universes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.13645v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we set up the theoretical framework and indicate future applications of symmetric Yang--Mills fields to cosmology. We analyze the coset space dimensional reduction scheme to construct pure Yang--Mills fields on spacetimes given as cylinders over cosets. Particular cases of foliations using $H^n$, dS$_n$ and AdS$_n$ slices as non-compact symmetric spaces are solved, compared to previous results in the literature, and generalized in a structured fashion. Coupling to general relativity in FLRW-type universes is introduced via the cosmological scale factor. For the hyperbolic slicing in 4D, the dynamics of the Einstein--Yang--Mills system is analytically solved and discussed. Finally, we generalize the analysis to warped foliations of the cylinders, which enlarge the range of possible spacetimes while also introducing a Hubble friction-like term in the equation of motion for the Yang--Mills field.</description>

      <title>Power law coupling Higgs-Palatini inflation with a congruence between physical and geometrical symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09107v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate a power law coupling Higgs inflationary model in which the background geometry is determined by the Palatini's variational principle. The geometrical symmetries of the background geometry determine the invariant form of the action of the model and the background geometry resulted is of the Weyl-integrable type. The invariant action results also invariant under the $U(1)$ group, which in general is not compatible with the Weyl group of invariance of the background geometry. However, we found compatibility conditions between the geometrical and physical symmetries of the action in the strong coupling limit. We found that if we start with a non-minimally coupled to gravity action, when we impose the congruence between the both groups of symmetries we end with an invariant action of the scalar-tensor type. We obtain a nearly scale invariant power spectrum for the inflaton fluctuations for certain values of some parameters of the model. Also we obtain va\-lues for the tensor to scalar ratio in agreement with PLANCK and BICEP observational data: $r&lt;0.032$.</description>

      <title>The Streda Formula for Floquet Systems: Topological Invariants and Quantized Anomalies from Cesaro Summation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13576v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The St\v{r}eda formula establishes a fundamental connection between the topological invariants characterizing the bulk of topological matter and the presence of gapless edge modes. In this work, we extend the St\v{r}eda formula to periodically driven systems, providing a rigorous framework to elucidate the unconventional bulk-boundary correspondence of Floquet systems, while offering a link between Floquet winding numbers and tractable response functions. Using the Sambe representation of periodically driven systems, we analyze the response of the unbounded Floquet density of states to a magnetic perturbation. This Floquet-St\v{r}eda response is regularized through Ces\`aro summation, yielding a well-defined, quantized result within spectral gaps. The response features two physically distinct contributions: a quantized charge flow between edge and bulk, and an anomalous energy flow between the system and the drive, offering new insight into the nature of anomalous edge states. This result rigorously connects Floquet winding numbers to the orbital magnetization density of Floquet states and holds broadly, from clean to disordered and inhomogeneous systems. This is further supported by providing a real-space formulation of the Floquet-St\v{r}eda response, which introduces a local topological marker suited for periodically driven settings. In translationally-invariant systems, the framework yields a remarkably simple expression for Floquet winding numbers involving geometric properties of Floquet-Bloch bands. A concrete experimental protocol is proposed to extract the Floquet-St\v{r}eda response via particle-density measurements in systems coupled to engineered baths. Finally, by expressing the topological invariants through the magnetic response of the Floquet density of states, this approach opens a promising route toward the topological characterization of interacting driven phases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11501v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The loop-Amplituhedron $\mathcal{A}^{(L)}_{n}$ is a semialgebraic set in the product of Grassmannians $\mathrm{Gr}_{\mathbb{R}}(2,4)^L$. Recently, many aspects of this geometry for the case of $L=1$ have been elucidated, such as its algebraic and face stratification, its residual arrangement and the existence and uniqueness of the adjoint. This paper extends this analysis to the simplest higher loop case given by the two-loop four-point Amplituhedron $\mathcal{A}^{(2)}_4$.</description>

      <title>Constructing stable Hilbert bundles via Diophantine approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15784v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: On any complex smooth projective curve with positive genus, we construct Hilbert bundles that admit Hermitian--Einstein metrics. Our main constructive step is by investigating the arithmetic property of the upper half plane in Bridgeland's definition of stability conditions and its homological countparts.
  The main analytic ingredient in our proof is a notion called a geometrically well-approximable pair $(X,\theta)$. This notion compares a constant $L(X)$ that can be bounded by the geometric information of the Riemann surface $X$ with a constant $L_0(\theta)$ that depends only on the arithmetic information of the irrational number $\theta$. This notion helps us to apply the Diophantine approximation to Donaldson's functional.
  We further study the continuous structures, smooth structures, and holomorphic structures on such Hilbert bundles. We hope that this construction can shed some new light on the geometric background of quantum field theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01326v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The motion of particles hit by a burst of gravitational waves generated by flyby admits, for the derivative-of-the-Gaussian profile, only a numerical description. The profile can however be approximated by the hyperbolic Scarf potential which admits an exact analytic solution via the Nikiforov-Uvarov method. Our toy model is consistent with the prediction of Zel'dovich and Polnarev provided the wave amplitude takes certain ``magical'' values.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09796v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the Araki-Uhlmann relative entropy in Quantum Field Theory, focusing on a free massive scalar field in 1+1-dimensional Minkowski spacetime. Using Tomita-Takesaki modular theory, we analyze the relative entropy between a coherent state and the vacuum state, with several types of test functions localized in the right Rindler wedge. Our results confirm that relative entropy decreases with increasing mass and grows with the size of the spacetime region, aligning with theoretical expectations.</description>

      <title>A phase transition for the two-dimensional random field Ising/FK-Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16268v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the total variation (TV) distance between the laws of the 2D Ising/FK-Ising model in a box of side-length $N$ with and without an i.i.d.\ Gaussian external field with variance $\epsilon^2$. Letting the external field strength $\epsilon = \epsilon(N)$ depend on the size of the box, we derive a phase transition for each model depending on the order of $\epsilon(N)$. For the random field Ising model, the critical order for $\epsilon$ is $N^{-1}$. For the random field FK-Ising model, the critical order depends on the temperature regime: for $T&gt;T_c$, $T=T_c$ and $T\in (0, T_c)$ the critical order for $\epsilon$ is, respectively, $N^{-\frac{1}{2}}$, $N^{-\frac{15}{16}}$ and $N^{-1}$. In each case, as $N \to \infty$ the TV distance under consideration converges to $1$ when $\epsilon$ is above the respective critical order and converges to $0$ when below.</description>

      <title>Transmission resonances in scattering by $\delta'$-like combs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23837v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new exactly solvable model in quantum mechanics that describes the propagation of particles through a potential field created by regularly spaced $\delta'$-type point interactions, which model the localized dipoles often observed in crystal structures. We refer to the corresponding potentials as $\delta'_\theta$-combs, where the parameter $\theta$ represents the contrast of the resonant wave at zero energy and determines the interface conditions in the Hamiltonians. We explicitly calculate the scattering matrix for these systems and prove that the transmission probability exhibits sharp resonance peaks while rapidly decaying at other frequencies. Consequently, Hamiltonians with $\delta'_\theta$-comb potentials act as quantum filters, permitting tunnelling only for specific wave frequencies. Furthermore, for each $\theta &gt; 0$, we construct a family of regularized Hamiltonians approximating the ideal model and prove that their transmission probabilities have a similar structure, thereby confirming the physical realizability of the band-pass filtering effect.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Mirror Axion Solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00893v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study an axion soliton, which weakly interacts with background matter and magnetic fields. A mirror-symmetric soliton, for which the magnetic flow is due to secondary magnetic helicity invariant, is described by the Iroshnikov-Kreichnan spectrum. For a large scale magnetic field dynamo is not observed. In a mirror axionic soliton, a phase transition, which produces a magnetic helical flow, is possible. Using this transition, the soliton becomes mirror-asymmetric. When the mirror symmetry is broken, the axion soliton allows the magnetic energy, which is the result of the transformation of the axionic energy. In the main result, for an initial stage of the process, we calculate a scale for which the generation of large scale magnetic fields is the most intense. By making numerical simulations, we received that lower lateral harmonics of the magnetic field have greater amplitudes compared to higher ones. A simplest statistical ensemble, which is defined by the projection of all harmonics onto principal harmonics is constructed. We put forward an assumption that it was the indication to some instability in axionic MHD. Now, we can provide a possible explanation of this feature. When the mirror symmetry of the axion soliton is broken, the $\gamma$-term in the axionic mean field equation, which is related to the axion spatial inhomogeneity, interacts with principal harmonics. As the result, the axion soliton acquires the magnetic energy and becomes helical.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13148v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Utilizing the Tomita-Takesaki modular theory, we derive a closed-form analytic expression for the Araki-Uhlmann relative entropy between a single-mode squeezed state and the vacuum state in a free relativistic massive scalar Quantum Field Theory within wedge regions of Minkowski spacetime. Similarly to the case of coherent states, this relative entropy is proportional to the smeared Pauli-Jordan distribution. Consequently, the Araki-Uhlmann entropy between a single-mode squeezed state and the vacuum satisfies all expected properties: it remains positive, increases with the size of the Minkowski region under consideration, and decreases as the mass parameter grows.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14934v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate negative eigenvalues of exactly solvable quantum models, particularly one-dimensional Hamiltonians with $\delta'$-like potentials used to represent localized dipoles. These operators arise as norm resolvent limits of Schr\"odinger operators with suitably regularized potentials. Although the limiting operator is bounded below, we show that the approximating operators may possess a finite but arbitrarily large number of negative eigenvalues that diverge to $-\infty$ as the regularization parameter vanishes. This phenomenon illustrates a spectral instability of Schr\"odinger operators with $\delta'$-like singularities.</description>

Abstract: Mock modular forms, first invented by Ramanujan, provide a beautiful generalization of the usual modular forms. In recent years, it was found that they capture generating functions of the number of microstates of BPS black holes appearing in compactifications of string theory with 8 and 16 supercharges. This review describes these results and their applications which range from the actual computation of these generating functions for both compact and non-compact compactification manifolds (encoding, respectively, Donaldson-Thomas and Vafa-Witten topological invariants) to the construction of new non-commutative structures on moduli spaces of Calabi-Yau threefolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21192v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Hamiltonian with eigenvalues $E_n = \rho_n(1-\rho_n) $ has been constructed, where $\rho_n $ denotes the $n-$th non-trivial zero of the Riemann zeta function. To construct such a Hamiltonian, we generalize the Berry-Keating's paradigm and encode number-theoretic information into the Hamiltonian through modular forms. Even though our construction does not resolve the Hilbert-P\'olya conjecture -- since the eigenstates corresponding to $E_n$ are \emph{not} normalizable states -- it offers a novel physical perspective on the Riemann Hypothesis(RH). Especially, we proposed a physical statement of RH, which may serve as a potential pathway toward its proof.</description>

Abstract: This article concludes the study of (2+1)-dimensional nonlinear wave equations that can be derived in a model of an ideal fluid with irrotational motion. In the considered case of identical scaling of the $x,y$ variables, obtaining a (2+1)-dimensional wave equation analogous to the KdV equation is impossible. Instead, from a system of two first-order Boussinesq equations, a non-linear wave equation for the auxiliary function $f(x,y,z)$ defining the velocity potential can be obtained, and only from its solutions can the surface wave form $\eta(x,y,t)$ be obtained. We demonstrate the existence of families of (2+1)-dimensional traveling wave solutions, including solitary and periodic solutions, of both cnoidal and superposition types.</description>

      <title>Large-scale quantization of trace I: Finite propagation operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10957v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by parallel developments in coarse geometry in mathematics and exact macroscopic quantization in physics, we present a family of general trace formulae which are universally quantized and depend only on large-scale geometric features of the input data. They generalize, to arbitrary dimensions, formulae found by Roe in his partitioned manifold index theorem, as well as the Kubo and Kitaev formulae for 2D Hall conductance used in physics.</description>

      <title>Entropy from scattering in weakly interacting systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19127v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Perturbation theory is used to investigate the evolution of the von Neumann entropy of a subsystem of a bipartite quantum system in the course of a gedanken scattering experiment. We find surprisingly simple criteria for the initial state and the scattering matrix that guarantee that the subsystem entropy increases. The class of states that meet these criteria are more correlated than simple product states of the subsystems. They form a subclass of the set of all separable states, and they can therefore be assembled by classical processes alone.</description>
