      <title>Introduction of Vacuum Fields to Cavity with Diffraction Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The space-based gravitational wave detector DECIGO employs a 1000 km-long Fabry-Perot cavity, which introduces significant diffraction loss. Previous studies accounted or diffraction loss by modeling it as a reduction in laser power for sensitivity calculations. In this research, we take an optical approach by explicitly considering the impact of vacuum fields introduced through diffraction loss, including leakage loss and higher-order mode loss, as well as mirror optical loss. By formulating input-output relations that incorporate these vacuum fields in a realistic cavity with diffraction loss and an optical spring, we achieve a more precise evaluation of DECIGO's optical response. This analysis provides new insights into how diffraction loss affects quantum-locking techniques, offering a refined framework for improving DECIGO's optical design and sensitivity estimation.</description>

      <title>Assessing Suburban Air Quality Constraints on Free Cooling in an Irish City</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Temperate climates are expected to have an expansion of the number of hours where ventilative cooling is needed and where potential is available even under climate change scenarios. Further to this, the use of free cooling in the form of untreated outdoor air has the potential to be a renewable energy source that adds flexibility to national electricity grids if used appropriately and is critical in decarbonising cooling more generally, particularly where coupled with significant thermal mass in buildings. The following study utilises external air quality measurements from the PASSESPARTOUT project and were collected from unique external air quality systems located in Cork in Ireland. The study characterises this data according to constraints based on control limits for cooling systems and for individual external air quality parameters. While the work aims to demonstrate the barriers to cooling potential that may exist due to poor external air quality, it also offers insights into where good urban air quality supports diurnal ventilative cooling strategies that are best suited given these limitations. The findings show that out of seven outdoor pollutants investigated, NO2 and PM2.5 were consistently above recommended threshold limits in suburban areas and present a barrier to the use of indoor-outdoor direct airflow coupling using natural ventilation strsategies for ventilative cooling purposes. Indoor concentration levels within the surrounding areas to those investigated should be evaluated to develop Indoor-Outdoor ratios for designers for barrier pollutants.</description>

      <title>Output correction factors in a 1.5 T magnetic field determined at the central axis and at the lateral dose maximum for five detectors using alanine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent literature, the output correction factor in a 1.5T magnetic field, kB,Q,Clin, were determined only for the central axis (CAX), including our last work. At an MR-linac, the determination of the CAX position relies on e.g. MV-imaging and is at small field sizes located at the penumbra, whereas the maximum of the lateral profile (MAX) position is directly measurable. This study determined kB,Q,Ratio - the influence of the magnetic field on the output correction factor without a magnetic field, kQ,Clin - and kB,Q,Clin for both CAX and MAX fully experimentally for two MR-optimized ionization chambers, their conventional counterparts, and a solid-state detector. Additionally, the uncertainty due to intra-type variation for tabulated kB,Q,Clin was estimated. Measurements were conducted using an experimental setup consisting of a mobile electromagnet positioned in front of a standard clinical linac (6MV, 1.5T). Intra-type variation for the solid-state detector was assessed using four detectors. The change of absorbed dose to water was determined with alanine. Within the uncertainty, no difference in kB,Q,Ratio was observed between the MR-optimized chambers and their conventional counterparts. For the solid-state detector, no difference between CAX and MAX was observed. For all detectors, kB,Q,Clin remained constant down to a field size of 3x3cm2. At smaller field sizes, for MAX and for all detectors, kB,Q,Ratio decreased linearly. The maximum intra-type variation standard uncertainty was 0.009 for the smallest field size, with and without a magnetic field. In summary, kB,Q,Ratio and kB,Q,Clin, including its uncertainty, was successfully determined for five detectors at both CAX and MAX. For ionization chambers, kB,Q,Clin is lower at MAX, whereas for the solid-state detector, it remains the same. For the tabulated correction factors uncertainty, intra-type variation must be considered.</description>

      <title>Design, Fabrication, Characterization, and Testing of a Bias Supply Circuit for Silicon Photomultipliers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04510v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To assess the viability of a shallow-depth neutrino detector, a Cosmic Muon Veto Detector (CMVD) is being constructed on top of the stack of Resistive Plate Chamber (RPC) detectors at TIFR, Mumbai. The CMVD employs extruded plastic scintillators for muon detection, with wavelength-shifting fibers coupled to silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) for signal readout. A highly stable, low-noise power source is essential for biasing the SiPMs, as the precision, accuracy, and stability of the supply directly impact the consistency of their gain. To address this, we designed a biasing power supply capable of delivering 50-58 V in 50 mV steps, with a maximum short-circuit current output of 1 mA. The system incorporates digital voltage control, stabilization, and current monitoring, making it compatible with external controllers (such as microcontrollers). This added flexibility and modularity allow for additional functionalities, including temperature compensation. Designed to supply multiple SiPMs with close to breakdown voltages in parallel, the circuit seamlessly integrates with the front-end electronics of the detector system.</description>

      <title>Tunable coherence laser interferometry: demonstrating 40dB of straylight suppression and compatibility with resonant optical cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11528v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A major limitation of laser interferometers using continuous wave lasers are parasitic light fields, such as ghost beams, scattered or stray light, which can cause non-linear noise. This is especially relevant for laser interferometric ground-based gravitational wave detectors. Increasing their sensitivity, particularly at frequencies below 10 Hz, is threatened by the influence of parasitic photons. These can up-convert low-frequency disturbances into phase and amplitude noise inside the relevant measurement band. By artificially tuning the coherence of the lasers, using pseudo-random-noise (PRN) phase modulations, this influence of parasitic fields can be suppressed. As it relies on these fields traveling different paths, it does not sacrifice the coherence for the intentional interference. We demonstrate the feasibility of this technique experimentally, achieving noise suppression levels of 40 dB in a Michelson interferometer with an artificial coherence length below 30 cm. We probe how the suppression depends on the delay mismatch and length of the PRN sequence. We also prove that optical resonators can be operated in the presence of PRN modulation by measuring the behavior of a linear cavity with and without such a modulation. By matching the resonators round-trip length and the PRN sequence repetition length, the classic response is recovered.</description>

      <title>Scattered light reduction in Sagnac Speed Meters with Tunable Coherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07383v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sagnac Speed Meter and ring resonators can be used as high precision instruments, but they are limited in their sensitivity through scattered light causing non-linear noise. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a technique called Tunable Coherence, where the long coherence length of the laser is broken in a controlled way, to suppress the coupling of scattered light in a Sagnac interferometer. We demonstrate a scattered light suppression of 24.2 dB in a Sagnac interferometer and discuss the experimental limitations. Further, we show an analytical discussion on how Tunable Coherence could be a fundamental solution to light scattering back from optical surfaces into the counter propagating beam, which is an issue particularly in ring resonators.</description>
