      <title>Glued tree lattices with only compact localized states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flat band physics is a central theme in modern condensed matter physics. By constructing a tight--binding single particle system that has vanishing momentum dispersion in one or more bands, and subsequently including more particles and interactions, it is possible to study physics in strongly interacting regimes. Inspired by the glued trees that first arose in one of the few known examples of quantum supremacy, we define and analyze two infinite families of tight binding single particle Bose--Hubbard models that have only flat bands, and only compact localized states despite having any nonnegative number of translation symmetries. The first class of model that we introduce is constructed by replacing a sufficiently large fraction of the edges in a generic countable graph with glued trees modified to have complex hoppings. The second class arises from thinking of complex weighted glued trees as rhombi that can then be used to tile two dimensional space, giving rise to the familiar dice lattice and infinitely many generalizations thereof, of which some are Euclidian while others are hyperbolic.</description>

      <title>Scattering of transient waves by an interface with time-modulated jump conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time modulation of the physical parameters offers new possibilities for wave control. Examples include amplification of waves, harmonic generation and non-reciprocity, without resorting to non-linear mechanisms. Most of the recent studies on the matter focus on the the time-modulation of the physical properties of a given media, that is, a time-modulation `in volume'. Here, we focus instead on time modulation at some lower-dimensional space by considering time-varying jump conditions across some interface. The latter offers simpler solutions for practical implementation. This work is focused on wave propagation in a 1D medium containing one modulated interface. Many properties of the scattered waves are investigated theoretically: energy balance, generation of harmonics, impedance matching and non-reciprocity. A fourth-order numerical method is also developed to simulate such transient scattering. Numerical experiments are conducted to validate both the theoretical findings and the numerical scheme.</description>

      <title>$p$-Adic Polynomial Regression as Alternative to Neural Network for Approximating $p$-Adic Functions of Many Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A method for approximating continuous functions $\mathbb{Z}_{p}^{n}\rightarrow\mathbb{Z}_{p}$ by a linear superposition of continuous functions $\mathbb{Z}_{p}\rightarrow\mathbb{Z}_{p}$ is presented and a polynomial regression model is constructed that allows approximating such functions with any degree of accuracy. A physical interpretation of such a model is given and possible methods for its training are discussed. The proposed model can be considered as a simple alternative to possible $p$-adic models based on neural network architecture.</description>

      <title>Convergent Power Series for Anharmonic Chain with Periodic Forcing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the case of a pinned anharmonic chain of oscillators, with coordinates $({\bf q}.{\bf p})=\{(q_x, p_x):\,x\in\bbZ_N=\{-N, ......, N\}\}$, subjected to an external driving force ${\cal
  F}(\cdot)$ of period $\theta=2\pi/\omega$ acting on the oscillator at $x=0$. The system evolves according to a Hamiltonian dynamics with frictional damping, {$\gamma&gt;0$}, present at both endpoints $x=-N,N$. The Hamiltonian is given by \begin{equation} \label{010503-25} {\cal H}_N({\bf q}.{\bf p})=\sum_{x\in\bbZ_N}\left[\frac{p_x^2}2 + \frac12 (q_{x}-q_{x-1})^2 +\frac{\om_0^2 q_x^2}{2}+\nu\Big( V(q_x)+ U(q_x-q_{x-1})\Big) \right],\end{equation} where $V(\cdot)$ and $U(\cdot)$ are $C^2$ smooth anharmonic pinning and interaction potentials with {bounded second derivatives}, $\om_0&gt;0$ and $\nu \in \mathbb R$.
  We prove that if $\omega$ does not fall in the spectrum of the
  infinite harmonic system ${\cal I}:=[\omega_0 ,\sqrt{\omega_0^2+4} ]$, then
  there exists a $\nu_0&gt;0$ such that for $\vert \nu\vert &lt;\nu_0$ the
  system {approaches asymptotically in time a unique
  $\theta$-periodic solution, whose coordinates}
  are given by a convergent power type series in $\nu$.
  The series coefficients are bounded and smooth functions of $\nu$.
  The value of $\nu_0$ is {a lower bound on the radius of convergence,}
  independent of $N$,
  the friction coefficient {$\gamma&gt;0$} and ${\cal F}$. It depends only {on the supremum norm of $V''(\cdot)$ and $U''(\cdot)$} and {the distance of
  the set of integer multiplicities of $\om$} from ${\cal I}$.</description>

      <title>Spherical Harmonic Oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A linear quantum harmonic oscillator factors into one dimensional oscillators and can be solved using creation and annihilation operators. We consider a spherical analogue (there is an obvious hyperbolic analogue, and natural geometric generalizations). This analogue does not factor, and in fact the two dimensional case is critical and has potential applications to chiral models in 2d quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>Adjoint-based optimization of the Rayleigh-B\'enard instability with melting boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose an adjoint-based optimization procedure to control the onset of the Rayleigh-B\'enard instability with a melting front. A novel cut cell method is used to solve the Navier-Stokes equations in the Boussinesq approximation and the convection-diffusion equation in the fluid layer, as well as the heat equation in the solid phase. To track the interface we use the level set method where its evolution is simply governed by an advection equation. An incomplete continuous adjoint problem is then derived by considering that the velocity field is a check-pointing variable. The results of the minimization problem with a tracking-type cost-functional show that our adjoint method is well suited to optimize the shapes of the fronts in this configuration.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear-elasticity models with surface energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soft solids with surface energy exhibit complex mechanical behavior, necessitating advanced constitutive models to capture the interplay between bulk and surface mechanics. This interplay has profound implications for material design and emerging technologies. In this work, we set up variational models for bulk-surface elasticity and explore a novel class of surface-polyconvex constitutive models that account for surface energy while ensuring the existence of minimizers. These models are implemented within a finite element framework and validated through benchmark problems and applications, including, e.g., the liquid bridge problem and the Rayleigh-Plateau instability, for which the surface energy plays the dominant role. The results demonstrate the ability of surface-polyconvex models to accurately capture surface-driven phenomena, establishing them as a powerful tool for advancing the mechanics of soft materials in both engineering and biological applications.</description>

      <title>Last-passage percolation and product-matrix ensembles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study a model of directed last-passage percolation in planar layered environment. This environment is represented by an array of random exponential clocks arranged in blocks, for each block the average waiting times depend only on the local coordinates within the block. The last-passage time, the total time needed to travel from the source to the sink located in a given block, maximized over all the admissible paths, becomes a stochastic process indexed by the number of blocks in the array. We show that this model is integrable, particularly the probability law of the last-passage time process can be determined via a Fredholm determinant of the kernel that also appears in the study of products of random matrices. Further, we identify the scaling limit of the last-passage time process, as the sizes of the blocks become infinitely large and the average waiting times become infinitely small. Finite-dimensional convergence to the continuous-time critical stochastic process of random matrix theory is established.</description>

      <title>Inverse scattering for the multipoint potentials of Bethe-Peierls-Thomas-Fermi type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the Schr\"odinger equation with a multipoint potential of the Bethe-Peierls-Thomas-Fermi type. We show that such a potential in dimension d=2 or d=3 is uniquely determined by its scattering amplitude at a fixed positive energy. Moreover, we show that there is no non-zero potential of this type with zero scattering amplitude at a fixed positive energy and a fixed incident direction. Nevertheless, we also show that a multipoint potential of this type is not uniquely determined by its scattering amplitude at a positive energy E and a fixed incident direction. Our proofs also contribute to the theory of inverse source problem for the Helmholtz equation with multipoint source.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complexes and cohomology, traditionally central to topology, have emerged as fundamental tools across applied mathematics and the sciences. This survey explores their roles in diverse areas, from partial differential equations and continuum mechanics to reformulations of the Einstein equations and network theory. Motivated by advances in compatible and structure-preserving discretisation such as Finite Element Exterior Calculus (FEEC), we examine how differential complexes encode critical properties such as existence, uniqueness, stability and rigidity of solutions to differential equations. We demonstrate that various fundamental concepts and models in solid and fluid mechanics are essentially formulated in terms of differential complexes.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the dynamic of position-dependent mass system confined in harmonic
  oscillator potential. We derive the eigensystems by solving the Schr\''odinger-like equation which

  show that these states satisfy the Klauder's mathematical condition to build coherent states. We
  compute and analyse some statistical properties of these states. We find that these states exhibit
  sub-Poissonian statistics. We also evaluate quasiprobability distributions such as the Wigner
  function to demonstrate graphically nonclassical features of these states.</description>

      <title>The geomagnetic storm and Kp prediction using Wasserstein transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accurate forecasting of geomagnetic activity is important. In this work, we present a novel multimodal Transformer based framework for predicting the 3 days and 5 days planetary Kp index by integrating heterogeneous data sources, including satellite measurements, solar images, and KP time series. A key innovation is the incorporation of the Wasserstein distance into the transformer and the loss function to align the probability distributions across modalities. Comparative experiments with the NOAA model demonstrate performance, accurately capturing both the quiet and storm phases of geomagnetic activity. This study underscores the potential of integrating machine learning techniques with traditional models for improved real time forecasting.</description>

      <title>Reduced Yang model and noncommutative geometry of curved spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Yang model describes a noncommutative geometry in a curved spacetime by means of an orthogonal algebra $o(1,5)$, whose 15 generators are identified with phase space variables and Lorentz generators together with an additional scalar generator. In this paper we show that it is possible to define a nonlinear algebra with the same structure, but with only 14 generators, that better fits in phase space. The fifteenth generator of the Yang algebra can then be written as a function of the squares of the others.
  As a simple application, we also consider the problem of the quantum harmonic oscillator in this theory, calculating the energy spectrum in the one- and three-dimensional nonrelativistic versions of the model.</description>

      <title>Vacuum polarization current in presence of intense Sauter field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum vacuum becomes unstable under an external field, leading to spontaneous particle-antiparticle pair creation. In canonical quantization, the time-dependent particle number, defined via Bogoliubov transformations lacks physical meaning until the external field vanishes. To address this, we explore dynamical quantities that remain well-defined at both asymptotic and intermediate times, focusing on the vacuum polarization current. Investigating this observable provides insights into the system's intermediate-time behavior. We consider pair creation in a spatially homogeneous, time-dependent, intense Sauter field. Specifically, we analyze the real and imaginary parts of the correlation function, linking them to vacuum polarization effects. The vacuum polarization current in an intense laser pulse is computed numerically, revealing that it correlates with the real part of the correlation function. Initially, the current changes sign and gradually decreases, but unlike the particle number, it does not reach a constant asymptotic value. Instead, for large times, it exhibits nearly undamped oscillations, a distinctive feature of scalar particles, oscillating strongly around zero. Additionally, we explore the uniqueness of the vacuum polarization current in the adiabatic basis, comparing different reference mode function choices. Notably, we find that the current remains independent of the basis choice.</description>

      <title>On the 2D Plasma-Vacuum Interface Problems for Ideal Incompressible MHD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This manuscript concerns the two-dimensional plasma-vacuum interface problems for ideal incompressible magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations, which describe the dynamics of perfect conducting fluids in a vacuum region under the influence of magnetic fields. We establish their local well-posedness theories in standard Sobolev spaces, under the hypothesis that either there exist capillary forces or the total magnetic fields are non-degenerate on the free boundary. We also show vanishing surface tension limits under either the non-degeneracy assumption on magnetic fields or the Rayleigh-Taylor sign condition on the effective pressure. These results indicate that both capillary forces and non-degenerate tangential magnetic fields can indeed stabilize the motion of the plasma-vacuum interface, which, in particular, give another interpretations to the ill-posed examples constructed by C. Hao and the second author (Comm. Math. Phys. 376 (2020), 259-286). Although the initial data provided there are highly-unstable/ill-posed in the Sobolev spaces characterizing regularities of flow maps, plasma-vacuum problems with these initial data can still be stable/well-posed in suitable standard Sobolev spaces in the Eulerian framework without involving flow maps.</description>

Abstract: In statistical and nonlinear systems, two qualitatively distinct parameter regions are typically identified: the regular region, characterized by smooth behavior of key quantities, and the critical region, where these quantities exhibit singularities or strong fluctuations. Due to their starkly different properties, these regions are often perceived as being weakly related, if at all. However, we demonstrate that these regions are intimately connected, a relationship that can be explicitly revealed using self-similar approximation theory. This framework enables the prediction of observable quantities near the critical point based on information from the regular region and vice versa. Remarkably, the method relies solely on asymptotic expansions with respect to a parameter, regardless of whether the expansion originates in the regular or critical region. The mathematical principles of self-similar theory remain consistent across both cases. We illustrate this connection by extrapolating from the regular region to predict the existence, location, and critical indices of a critical point of an equation of state for a statistical system, even when no direct information about the critical region is available. Conversely, we explore extrapolation from the critical to the regular region in systems with discrete scale invariance, where log-periodic oscillations in observables introduce additional complexity. Our findings provide insights and solutions applicable to diverse phenomena, including material fracture, stock market crashes, and earthquake forecasting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give conserved quantities of two generalizations of conformal circles on the conformal sphere. One generalization concerns curves carrying a distinguished parallel tractor along them, which can be used to construct the conserved quantities. The other is the class of curves satisfying the conformal Mercator equation, the conserved quantities of which are computed using Lagrangian formalism. The two generalizations are not disjoint, and our main result is the relation between their conserved quantities. Explicit examples are also presented.</description>

      <title>Robust Self-testing for Synchronous Correlations and Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an abstract operator-algebraic characterization of robust self-testing for synchronous correlations and games. Specifically, we show that a synchronous correlation is a robust self-test if and only if there is a unique state on an appropriate $C^*$-algebra that "implements" the correlation. Extending this result, we prove that a synchronous game is a robust self-test if and only if its associated $C^*$-algebra admits a unique amenable tracial state. This framework allows us to establish that all synchronous correlations and games that serve as commuting operator self-tests for finite-dimensional strategies are also robust self-tests. As an application, we recover sufficient conditions for linear constraint system games to exhibit robust self-testing. We also demonstrate the existence of a synchronous nonlocal game that is a robust self-test but not a commuting operator self-test, showing that these notions are not equivalent.</description>

      <title>Impact of Lorentz violation on Radiative transition of an atom falling into spherically symmetric black hole and related BHAR entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the intriguing phenomenon of acceleration radiation exhibited by an atom falling into a black hole. Our investigation focuses on examining the impact of Lorentz violation within the framework of the bumblebee gravity model on this phenomenon. We observe that the excitation probability although acquires Planck-like factor the exponential part of it acquires the Lorentz violation factor that shows a clear indication of violation of equivalence principle and it is rooted to Lorentz violation conformal symmetry has nothing to do with it. Then we calculate the horizon brightened acceleration radiation (HBAR) entropy for this black hole geometry. We observed that the HBAR entropy has the form similar to that of Bekenstein-Hawking black hole entropy however it has been observed that it is also influenced by Lorentz violation aspect of Bumblebee theory. We also study the prospect of equivalence principle in this Lorentz violation background. by investigating the transition probabilities of a two-level atomic detector. Transition probabilities depend both on conformal symmetry and Lorentz violation effect.</description>

      <title>Deformations of the symmetric subspace of qubit chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The symmetric subspace of multi-qubit systems, that is, the space of states invariant under permutations, is commonly encountered in applications in the context of quantum information and communication theory. It is known that the symmetric subspace can be described in terms of irreducible representations of the group $SU(2)$, whose representation spaces form a basis of symmetric states, the so-called Dicke states. In this work, we present deformations of the symmetric subspace as deformations of this group structure, which are promoted to a quantum group $\mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{su}(2))$. We see that deformations of the symmetric subspace obtained in this manner correspond to local deformations of the inner product of each spin, in such a way that departure from symmetry can be encoded in a position-dependent inner product. The consequences and possible extensions of these results are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Topological consequences of null-geodesic refocusing and applications to $Z^x$ manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $(M,h)$ be a connected, complete Riemannian manifold, let $x\in M$ and $l&gt;0$. Then $M$ is called a $Z^x$ manifold if all geodesics starting at $x$ return to $x$ and it is called a $Y^x_l$ manifold if every unit-speed geodesic starting at $x$ returns to $x$ at time $l$. It is unknown whether there are $Z^x$ manifolds that are not $Y^x_l$-manifolds for some $l&gt;0$. By the B\'erard-Bergery theorem, any $Y^x_l$ manifold of dimension at least $2$ is compact with finite fundamental group. We prove the same result for $Z^x$ manifolds $M$ for which all unit-speed geodesics starting at $x$ return to $x$ in uniformly bounded time. We also prove that any $Z^x$ manifold $(M,h)$ with $h$ analytic is a $Y^x_l$ manifold for some $l&gt;0$. We start by defining a class of globally hyperbolic spacetimes (called observer-refocusing) such that any $Z^x$ manifold is the Cauchy surface of some observer-refocusing spacetime. We then prove that under suitable conditions the Cauchy surfaces of observer-refocusing spacetimes are compact with finite fundamental group and show that analytic observer-refocusing spacetimes of dimension at least $3$ are strongly refocusing. We end by stating a contact-theoretic conjecture analogous to our results in Riemannian and Lorentzian geometry.</description>

Abstract: The one-dimensional $J_1$-$J_2$ $q$-state Potts model is solved exactly for arbitrary $q$, based on using OpenAI's latest reasoning model o3-mini-high to exactly solve the $q=3$ case. The exact results provide insights to outstanding physical problems such as the stacking of atomic or electronic orders in layered materials and the formation of a $T_c$-dome-shaped phase often seen in unconventional superconductors. The work is anticipated to fuel both the research in one-dimensional frustrated magnets for recently discovered finite-temperature application potentials and the fast moving topic area of AI for sciences.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new exactly solvable model in quantum mechanics that describes the propagation of particles through a potential field created by regularly spaced $\delta'$-type point interactions, which model the localized dipoles often observed in crystal structures. We refer to the corresponding potentials as $\delta'_\theta$-combs, where the parameter $\theta$ represents the contrast of the resonant wave at zero energy and determines the interface conditions in the Hamiltonians. We explicitly calculate the scattering matrix for these systems and prove that the transmission probability exhibits sharp resonance peaks while rapidly decaying at other frequencies. Consequently, Hamiltonians with $\delta'_\theta$-comb potentials act as quantum filters, permitting tunnelling only for specific wave frequencies.</description>

Abstract: We consider the Wigner matrix $W_{n}$ of dimension $n \times n$ as $n \to \infty$. The objective of this paper is two folds: first we construct an operator $\mathcal{W}$ on a suitable Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$ and then define a suitable notion of convergence such that the matrices $W_{n}$ converge in that notion of convergence to $\mathcal{W}$. We further investigate some properties of $\mathcal{W}$ and $\mathcal{H}$. We show that $\mathcal{H}$ is a nontrivial extension of $L^{2}[0,1]$ with respect to the Lebesgue measure and the spectral measure of $\mathcal{W}$ at any function $f \in L^{2}[0,1]$ is almost surely the semicircular law.</description>

      <title>Analytic Conformal Blocks of $C_2$-cofinite Vertex Operator Algebras III: The Sewing-Factorization Theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb V=\bigoplus_{n\in\mathbb N}\mathbb V(n)$ be a $C_2$-cofinite VOA, not necessarily rational or self-dual. In this paper, we establish various versions of the sewing-factorization (SF) theorems for conformal blocks associated to grading-restricted generalized modules of $\mathbb V^{\otimes N}$ (where $N\in\mathbb N$). In addition to the versions announced in the Introduction of [GZ23], we prove the following coend version of the SF theorem:
  Let $\mathfrak F$ be a compact Riemann surface with $N$ incoming and $R$ outgoing marked points, and let $\mathfrak G$ be another compact Riemann surface with $K$ incoming and $R$ outgoing marked points. Assign $\mathbb W\in\mathrm{Mod}(\mathbb V^{\otimes N})$ and $\mathbb X\in\mathrm{Mod}(\mathbb V^{\otimes K})$ to the incoming marked points of $\mathfrak F$ and $\mathfrak G$ respectively. For each $\mathbb{M} \in \mathrm{Mod}(\mathbb{V}^{\otimes R})$, assign $\mathbb{M}$ and its contragredient $\mathbb M'$ to the outgoing marked points of $\mathfrak F$ and $\mathfrak G$ respectively. Denote the corresponding spaces of conformal blocks by $\mathscr T_{\mathfrak F}^*(\mathbb M\otimes\mathbb W)$ and $\mathscr T_{\mathfrak{G}}^*(\mathbb M'\otimes\mathbb X)$. Let the $\mathfrak X$ be the $(N+K)$-pointed surface obtained by sewing $\mathfrak F$, $\mathfrak G$ along their outgoing marked points. Then the sewing of conformal blocks-proved to be convergent in [GZ24]-yields an isomorphism of vector spaces $$\int^{\mathbb{M}\in\mathrm{Mod}(\mathbb V^{\otimes R})}\mathscr T_{\mathfrak F}^*(\mathbb M\otimes\mathbb{W})\otimes_{\mathbb C} \mathscr T_{\mathfrak G}^*(\mathbb M'\otimes \mathbb X)\simeq\mathscr T_{\mathfrak X}^*(\mathbb W\otimes \mathbb X)$$
  We also discuss the relation between conformal blocks and the modular functors defined using Lyubashenko's coend in the case where $\mathbb V$ is strongly finite and rigid.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Airfoil Design Using Neural Network Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, prediction of airfoil shape from targeted pressure distribution (suction and pressure sides) and vice versa is demonstrated using both Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) techniques. The dataset is generated for 1600 airfoil shapes, with simulations carried out at Reynolds numbers (Re) ranging from 10,000 and 90,00,000 and angles of attack (AoA) ranging from 0 to 15 degrees, ensuring the dataset captured diverse aerodynamic conditions. Five different CNN and DNN models are developed depending on the input/output parameters. Results demonstrate that the refined models exhibit improved efficiency, with the DNN model achieving a multi-fold reduction in training time compared to the CNN model for complex datasets consisting of varying airfoil, Re, and AoA. The predicted airfoil shapes/pressure distribution closely match the targeted values, validating the effectiveness of deep learning frameworks. However, the performance of CNN models is found to be better compared to DNN models. Lastly, a flying wing aircraft model of wingspan &gt;10 m is considered for the prediction of pressure distribution along the chordwise. The proposed CNN and DNN models show promising results. This research underscores the potential of deep learning models accelerating aerodynamic optimization and advancing the design of high-performance airfoils.</description>

      <title>Effective Dynamics and Blow Up in a Model of Magnetic Relaxation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we study a one dimensional model for Magnetic Relaxation. This model was introduced by Moffatt and describes a low resistivity viscous plasma, in which the pressure and the inercia are much smaller than the magnetic pressure. In the limit of resistivity $\varepsilon\rightarrow 0$, we prove the existence of two time scales for the evolution of the magnetic field: a fast one for times of order $\log(\varepsilon^{-1})$ in which the resistivity plays no role and the energy is dissipated only via viscosity; and a slow one for times of order $\varepsilon^{-1}$ characterized by the influence of the resistivity. We show that in this second time scale, as $\varepsilon\rightarrow 0$, the modulus of magnetic field approaches a function that depends only on time. We also prove that, in this regime, the magnetic field $b_\varepsilon(t,x)$ can be approximated as $\varepsilon \rightarrow 0$ by the solution of a PDE whose solutions exhibit blow up for some choices of initial data.</description>

      <title>Quantization of Lie-Poisson algebra and Lie algebra solutions of mass-deformed type IIB matrix model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A quantization of Lie-Poisson algebras is studied. The mass-deformed IIB matrix model admits classical solutions constructed from the basis of any semisimple Lie algebra. We consider the geometry described by the classical solutions of the Lie algebras in the limit where the mass vanishes and the matrix size is infinite. Lie-Poisson varieties are regarded as such geometric objects. We provide a quantization called ``weak matrix regularization''of any Lie-Poisson algebra (linear Poisson algebra) on the algebraic variety defined by its Casimir polynomials. The Lie algebra that gives weak matrix regularization is not necessarily semisimple. Casimir polynomials correspond with Casimir operators of the Lie algebra by the quantization. This quantization is a generalization of the fuzzy sphere. In order to define the weak matrix regularization of the quotient space by the ideal generated by the Casimir polynomials, we take a construction method that fixes a reduced Gr\"obner basis of the ideal. The Gr\"obner basis determines remainders of polynomials. The operation of replacing this remainders with representation matrices of a Lie algebra roughly corresponds to a weak matrix regularization. As concrete examples, we construct weak matrix regularization for $su(2)$ and $su(3)$. In the case of $su(3)$, we not only construct weak matrix regularization for the quadratic Casimir polynomial, but also construct weak matrix regularization for the cubic Casimir polynomial.</description>

      <title>Estimation of thermal properties and boundary heat transfer coefficient of the ground with a Bayesian technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Urbanization is the key contributor for climate change. Increasing urbanization rate causes an urban heat island (UHI) effect, which strongly depends on the short- and long-wave radiation balance heat flux between the surfaces. In order to calculate accurately this heat flux, it is required to assess the surface temperature which depends on the knowledge of the thermal properties and the surface heat transfer coefficients in the heat transfer problem. The aim of this paper is to estimate the thermal properties of the ground and the time varying surface heat transfer coefficient by solving an inverse problem. The Dufort--Frankel scheme is applied for solving the unsteady heat transfer problem. For the inverse problem, a Markov chain Monte Carlo method is used to estimate the posterior probability density function of unknown parameters within the Bayesian framework of statistics, by applying the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm for random sample generation. Actual temperature measurements available at different ground depths were used for the solution of the inverse problem. Different time discretizations were examined for the transient heat transfer coefficient at the ground surface, which then involved different prior distributions. Results of different case studies show that the estimated values of the unknown parameters were in accordance with literature values. Moreover, with the present solution of the inverse problem the temperature residuals were smaller than those obtained by using literature values for the unknowns.</description>

Abstract: Recent results on causality in noncommutative space-time are reviewed. We study, in particular, quantum causal structures in 1+1 dimensional kappa Minkowski space-time. This later is described by a twisted Lorentzian Spectral Triple build with a twisted set of derivatives. Investigation of causality provides a quantum constraint, which is a quantum analog of the speed light limits</description>

      <title>Compressible N-phase fluid mixture models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fluid mixture models are essential for describing a wide range of physical phenomena, including wave dynamics and spinodal decomposition. However, there is a lack of consensus in the modeling of compressible mixtures, with limited connections between different classes of models. On the one hand, existing compressible two-phase flow models accurately describe wave dynamics, but do not incorporate phase separation mechanisms. On the other hand, phase-field technology in fluid dynamics consists of models incorporating spinodal decomposition, however, a general phase-field theory for compressible mixtures remains largely undeveloped.
  In this paper, we take an initial step toward bridging the gap between compressible two-phase flow models and phase-field models by developing a theory for compressible, isothermal N-phase mixtures. Our theory establishes a system of reduced complexity by formulating N mass balance laws alongside a single momentum balance law, thereby naturally extending the Navier-Stokes Korteweg model to N-phases and providing the Navier-Stokes Cahn-Hilliard/Allen-Cahn model for compressible mixtures. Key aspects of the framework include its grounding in continuum mixture theory and its preservation of thermodynamic consistency despite its reduced complexity.</description>

      <title>PhD Thesis: Shifted Contact Structures on Differentiable Stacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This thesis focuses on developing "stacky" versions of contact structures, extending the classical notion of contact structures on manifolds. A fruitful approach is to study contact structures using line bundle-valued $1$-forms. Specifically, we introduce the notions of $0$ and $+1$-shifted contact structures on Lie groupoids. To define the kernel of a line bundle-valued $1$-form $\theta$ on a Lie groupoid, we draw inspiration from the concept of the homotopy kernel in Homological Algebra. That kernel is essentially given by a representation up to homotopy (RUTH). Similarly, the curvature is described by a specific RUTH morphism. Both the definitions are motivated by the Symplectic-to-Contact Dictionary, which establishes a relationship between Symplectic and Contact Geometry. Examples of $0$-shifted contact structures can be found in contact structures on orbifolds, while examples of $+1$-shifted contact structures include the prequantization of $+1$-shifted symplectic structures and the integration of Dirac-Jacobi structures.</description>

      <title>A criterion on the free energy for log-Sobolev inequalities in mean-field particle systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a class of mean-field particle systems, we formulate a criterion in terms of the free energy that implies uniform bounds on the log-Sobolev constant of the associated Langevin dynamics. For certain double-well potentials with quadratic interaction, the criterion holds up to the critical temperature of the model, and we also obtain precise asymptotics on the decay of the log-Sobolev constant when approaching the critical point. The criterion also applies to ``diluted'' mean-field models defined on sufficiently dense, possibly random graphs. We further generalize the criterion to non-quadratic interactions that admit a mode decomposition. The mode decomposition is different from the scale decomposition of the Polchinski flow we used for short-range spin systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.09913v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let K denote a simply connected compact Lie group and let G denote its complexification. It is known that there exists an LK-biinvariant probability measure on a natural completion of the complex loop group LG. It is believed that there exist deformations which are positive line bundle valued and reproduce the unitary structure for (projective) positive energy representations of LK. These are notes which supplement lectures I have given on these measures, explaining a number of conjectures concerning how these measures are characterized, how they are computed, and how they are potentially useful for formulating quantum sigma models.</description>

      <title>Quasiparticle solutions for the nonlocal NLSE with an anti-Hermitian term in semiclassical approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08532v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We deal with the $n$-dimensional nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation (NLSE) with a cubic nonlocal nonlinearity and an anti-Hermitian term, which is widely used model for the study of open quantum system. We construct asymptotic solutions to the Cauchy problem for such equation within the formalism of semiclassical approximation based on the Maslov complex germ method. Our solutions are localized in a neighbourhood of few points for every given time, i.e. form some spatial pattern. The localization points move over trajectories that are associated with the dynamics of semiclassical quasiparticles. The Cauchy problem for the original NLSE is reduced to the system of ODEs and auxiliary linear equations. The semiclassical nonlinear evolution operator is derived for the NLSE. The general formalism is applied to the specific one-dimensional NLSE with a periodic trap potential, dipole-dipole interaction, and phenomenological damping. It is shown that the long-range interactions in such model, which are considered through the interaction of quasiparticles in our approach, can lead to drastic changes in the behaviour of our asymptotic solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.24141v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we define a family of probability densities involving the generalized trigonometric functions defined by Dr\'abek and Man\'asevich [1], which we name Generalized Trigonometric Densities. We show their relationship with the generalized stretched Gaussians and other types of laws such as logistic, hyperbolic secant, and raised cosine probability densities. We prove that, for a fixed generalized Fisher information, this family of densities is of minimal R\'enyi entropy. Moreover, we introduce generalized moments via the mean of the power of a deformed cumulative distribution. The latter is defined as a cumulative of the power of the probability density function, this second parameter tuning the tail weight of the deformed cumulative distribution. These generalized moments coincide with the usual moments of a deformed probability distribution with a regularized tail. We show that, for any bounded probability density, there exists a critical value for this second parameter below which the whole subfamily of generalized moments is finite for any positive value of the first parameter (power of the moment). In addition, we show that such generalized moments satisfy remarkable properties like order relation w.r.t. the first parameter, or adequate scaling behavior. Then we highlight that, if we constrain such a generalized moment, both the R\'enyi entropy and generalized Fisher information achieve respectively their maximum and minimum for the generalized trigonometric densities. Finally, we emphasis that GTDs and cumulative moments can be used to formally characterize heavy-tailed distributions, including the whole family of stretched Gaussian densities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14700v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lagrangian multiform theory is a variational framework for integrable systems. In this article we introduce a new formulation which is based on symplectic geometry and which treats position, momentum and time coordinates of a finite-dimensional integrable hierarchy on an equal footing. This formulation allows a streamlined one-step derivation of both the multi-time Euler-Lagrange equations and the closure relation (encoding integrability). We argue that any Lagrangian one-form for a finite-dimensional system can be recast in our new framework. This framework easily extends to non-commuting flows and we show that the equations characterising (infinitesimal) Hamiltonian Lie group actions are variational in character. We reinterpret these equations as a system of compatible non autonomous Hamiltonian equations.</description>

Abstract: We investigate connections between $\mathcal {O}$-operators of Poisson superalgebras and skew-symmetric solutions of the Poisson Yang-Baxter equation (PYBE). We prove that a skew-symmetric solution of the PYBE on a Poisson superalgebra can be interpreted as an $\mathcal {O}$-operator associated to the co-regular representation. We show that this connection can be enhanced with symplectic forms when considering non-degenerate skew-symmetric solutions. We also show that $\mathcal {O}$-operators associated to a general representation could give skew-symmetric solutions of the PYBE in certain semi-direct product of Poisson superalgebras.</description>

      <title>Analytic Conformal Blocks of $C_2$-cofinite Vertex Operator Algebras I: Propagation and Dual Fusion Products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.10180v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is the first paper of a three-part series in which we develop a theory of conformal blocks for $C_2$-cofinite vertex operator algebras (VOAs) that are not necessarily rational. The ultimate goal of this series is to prove a sewing-factorization theorem (and in particular, a factorization formula) for conformal blocks over holomorphic families of compact Riemann surfaces, associated to grading-restricted (generalized) modules of $C_2$-cofinite VOAs.
  In this paper, we prove that if $\mathbb V$ is a $C_2$-cofinite VOA, if $\mathfrak X$ is a compact Riemann surface with $N$ incoming marked points and $M$ outgoing ones, each equipped with a local coordinate, and if $\mathbb W$ is a grading-restricted $\mathbb V^{\otimes N}$-modules, then the ``dual fusion product" exists as a grading-restricted $\mathbb V^{\otimes M}$-module. Indeed, we prove a more general version of this result without assuming $\mathbb V$ to be $C_2$-cofinite. Our main method is a generalization of the propagation of conformal blocks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.12733v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the synthetic geometric setting introduced by Kunzinger and S\"amann, we present an analogue of Toponogov's Globalisation Theorem which applies to Lorentzian length spaces with lower (timelike) curvature bounds. Our approach utilises a "cat's cradle" construction akin to that which appears in several proofs in the metric setting. On the road to our main result, we also provide a lemma regarding the subdivision of triangles in spaces with a local lower curvature bound and a synthetic Lorentzian version of the Lebesgue Number Lemma. Several properties of time functions and the null distance on globally hyperbolic Lorentzian length spaces are also highlighted. We conclude by presenting several applications of our results, including versions of the Bonnet--Myers Theorem and the Splitting Theorem for Lorentzian length spaces with local lower curvature bounds, as well as discussion of stability of curvature bounds under Gromov--Hausdorff convergence.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic solutions for linear ODEs with not-necessarily meromorphic coefficients: a Levinson type theorem on complex domains, and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19739v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider systems of linear ordinary differential equations, with analytic coefficients on big sectorial domains, which are asymptotically diagonal for large values of $|z|$. Inspired by N. Levinson's work [Lev48], we introduce two conditions on the dominant diagonal term (the $L$-$condition$) and on the perturbation term (the $good\,\,decay\,\,condition$) of the coefficients of the system, respectively. Under these conditions, we show the existence and uniqueness, on big sectorial domains, of an $asymptotic$ fundamental matrix solution, i.e. asymptotically equivalent (for large $|z|$) to a fundamental system of solutions of the unperturbed diagonal system. Moreover, a refinement (in the case of subdominant solutions) and a generalization (in the case of systems depending on parameters) of this result are given.
  As a first application, we address the study of a class of ODEs with not-necessarily meromorphic coefficients. We provide sufficient conditions on the coefficients ensuring the existence and uniqueness of an asymptotic fundamental system of solutions, and we give an explicit description of the maximal sectors of validity for such an asymptotics. Furthermore, we also focus on distinguished examples in this class of ODEs arising in the context of open conjectures in Mathematical Physics relating Integrable Quantum Field Theories and affine opers ($ODE/IM\,\,correspondence$). Our results fill two significant gaps in the mathematical literature pertaining to these conjectural relations.
  As a second application, we consider the classical case of ODEs with meromorphic coefficients. Under an $adequateness$ condition on the coefficients, we show that our results reproduce (with a shorter proof) the main asymptotic existence theorems of Y. Sibuya [Sib62, Sib68] and W. Wasow [Was65] in their optimal refinements.</description>

      <title>Radiative corrections to the $R$ and $R^2$ invariants from torsion fluctuations on maximally symmetric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16681v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive the runnings of the $R$ and $R^2$ operators that stem from integrating out quantum torsion fluctuations on a maximally symmetric Euclidean background, while treating the metric as a classical field. Our analysis is performed in a manifestly covariant way, exploiting both the recently-introduced spin-parity decomposition of torsion perturbations and the heat kernel technique. The Lagrangian we start with is the most general one for 1-loop computations on maximally symmetric backgrounds involving kinetic terms and couplings to the scalar curvature that is compatible with a gauge-like symmetry for the torsion. The latter removes the twice-longitudinal vector mode from the spectrum, and it yields operators of maximum rank four. We also examine the conditions required to avoid ghost instabilities and ensure the validity of our assumption to neglect metric quantum fluctuations, demonstrating the compatibility between these two assumptions. Then, we use our findings in the context of Starobinsky's inflation to calculate the contributions from the torsion tensor to the $\beta$-function of the $R^2$ term. While this result is quantitatively reliable only at the $0$-th order in the slow-roll parameters or during the very early stages of inflation -- due to the background choice -- it qualitatively illustrates how to incorporate quantum effects of torsion in the path integral formalism.</description>

Abstract: Reaction-diffusion processes are the foundational model for a diverse range of complex systems, ranging from biochemical reactions to social agent-based phenomena. The underlying dynamics of these systems occur at the individual particle/agent level, and in realistic applications, they often display interaction with their environment through energy or material exchange with a reservoir. This requires intricate mathematical considerations, especially in the case of material exchange since the varying number of particles/agents results in ``on-the-fly'' modification of the system dimension. In this work, we first overview the probabilistic description of reaction-diffusion processes at the particle level, which readily handles varying number of particles. We then extend this model to consistently incorporate interactions with macroscopic material reservoirs. Based on the resulting expressions, we bridge the probabilistic description with macroscopic concentration-based descriptions for linear and nonlinear reaction-diffusion systems, as well as for an archetypal open reaction-diffusion system. Using these mathematical bridges across scales, we finally develop numerical schemes for open reaction-diffusion systems, which we implement in two illustrative examples. This work establishes a methodological workflow to bridge particle-based probabilistic descriptions with macroscopic concentration-based descriptions of reaction-diffusion in open settings, laying the foundations for a multiscale theoretical framework upon which to construct theory and simulation schemes that are consistent across scales.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13033v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider labelings of a finite regular tree by a finite alphabet subject to restrictions specified by a nonnegative transition matrix, propose an algorithm for determining whether the set of possible configurations on the last row of the tree is independent of the symbol at the root, and prove that the algorithm succeeds in a bounded number of steps, provided that the dimension of the tree is greater than or equal to the maximum row sum of the transition matrix. (The question was motivated by calculation of topological pressure on trees and is an extension of the idea of primitivity for nonnegative matrices.)</description>

      <title>A unified framework for N-phase Navier-Stokes Cahn-Hilliard Allen-Cahn mixture models with non-matching densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20145v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the past few decades, numerous N-phase incompressible diffuse-interface flow models with non-matching densities have been proposed. Despite aiming to describe the same physics, these models are generally distinct, and an overarching modeling framework is absent. This paper provides a unified framework for N-phase incompressible Navier-Stokes Cahn-Hilliard Allen-Cahn mixture models with a single momentum equation. The framework naturally emerges from continuum mixture theory, exhibits an energy-dissipative structure, and is invariant to the choice of fundamental variables. This opens the door to exploring connections between existing N-phase models and facilitates the computation of N-phase flow models rooted in continuum mixture theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16624v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of the Nose-Hoover and Moore-Spiegel Oscillators, and in particular, their topological dynamics. We prove the dynamics of both these systems can be reduced to a flow on a solid torus, with at most a finite number of attracting periodic trajectories. As a consequence, we obtain that every periodic trajectory for the Nose-Hoover and the Moore-Spiegel Oscillators is a Torus knot.</description>

      <title>A General Theory of Operator-Valued Measures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19306v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a new kind of measures, called projection families, which generalize the classical notion of vector and operator-valued measures. The maximal class of reasonable functions admits an integral with respect to a projection family, where the integral is defined as an element of the second dual instead of the original space. We show that projection families possess strong enough properties to satisfy the theorems of Monotone Convergence and Dominated convergence, but are much easier to come by than the more restrictive operator-valued measures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20725v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The notion of projection families generalizes the classical notions of vector- and operator-valued measures. We show that projection families are general enough to extend the Spectral Theorem to Banach algebras and operators between Banach spaces. To this end, we first develop a Smooth Functional Calculus in Banach algebras using the Cauchy-Pompeiu formula, which is further extended to a Continuous Functional Calculus. We also show that these theorems are proper generalizations of the usual result for operators between Hilbert spaces.</description>

      <title>Analytic Conformal Blocks of $C_2$-cofinite Vertex Operator Algebras II: Convergence of Sewing and Higher Genus Pseudo-$q$-traces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07707v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb V=\bigoplus_{n\in\mathbb N}\mathbb V(n)$ be a $C_2$-cofinite vertex operator algebra. We prove the convergence of Segal's sewing of conformal blocks associated to analytic families of pointed compact Riemann surfaces and grading-restricted generalized $\mathbb V^{\otimes N}$-modules (where $N=1,2,\dots$) that are not necessarily tensor products of $\mathbb V$-modules, generalizing significantly the results on convergence in [Gui23].
  We show that ``higher genus pseudo-$q$-traces" (called pseudo-sewing in this article) can be recovered from Segal's sewing. Therefore, our result on the convergence of Segal's sewing implies the convergence of pseudo-sewing, and hence covers both the convergence of genus-$0$ sewing in [HLZ12] and the convergence of pseudo-$q$-traces in [Miy04] and [Fio16].
  Using a similar method, we also prove the convergence of Virasoro uniformization, i.e., the convergence of conformal blocks deformed by non-automomous meromorphic vector fields near the marked points. The local freeness of the analytic sheaves of conformal blocks is a consequence of this convergence. It will be used in the third paper of this series to prove the sewing-factorization theorem.</description>

      <title>Non-invertible SPTs: an on-site realization of (1+1)d anomaly-free fusion category symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20546v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate (1+1)d symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases with fusion category symmetries. We emphasize that the UV description of an anomaly-free fusion category symmetry must include the fiber functor, giving rise to a local symmetry action, a charge category and a trivial phase. We construct an ``onsite'' matrix-product-operator (MPO) version of the Hopf algebra symmetry operators in a lattice model with tensor-product Hilbert space. In particular, we propose a systematic framework for classifying and constructing SPTs with non-invertible symmetries. An SPT phase corresponds to a Q-system in the charge category, such that the Q-system becomes a matrix algebra when the symmetry is forgotten. As an example, we provide an explicit microscopic realization of all three $\mathsf{Rep}^\dagger(D_8)$ SPT phases, including a trivial phase, and further demonstrate the $S_3$-duality among these three SPT phases.</description>

      <title>Dafermos' principle and Brenier's duality scheme for defocusing dispersive equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05389v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discover an abstract structure behind several nonlinear dispersive equations (including the NLS, NLKG and GKdV equations with generic defocusing power-law nonlinearities) that is reminiscent of hyperbolic conservation laws. The underlying abstract problem admits an "entropy" that is formally conserved. The entropy is determined by a strictly convex function that naturally generates an anisotropic Orlicz space. For such problems, we introduce the dual matrix-valued variational formulation in the spirit of [Y. Brenier. Comm. Math. Phys. (2018) 364(2) 579-605]. Employing time-adaptive weights, we are able to prove consistency of the duality scheme on large time intervals. We also prove solvability of the dual problem in the corresponding anisotropic Orlicz spaces. As an application, we show that no subsolution of the PDEs that fit into our framework is able to dissipate the total entropy earlier or faster than the strong solution on the interval of existence of the latter. This result (we call it Dafermos' principle) is new even for "isotropic" problems such as the incompressible Euler system.</description>

      <title>Entropy functionals and equilibrium states in mixed quantum-classical dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18587v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The computational challenges posed by many-particle quantum systems are often overcome by mixed quantum-classical (MQC) models in which certain degrees of freedom are treated as classical while others are retained as quantum. One of the fundamental questions raised by this hybrid picture involves the characterization of the information associated to MQC systems. Based on the theory of dynamical invariants in Hamiltonian systems, here we propose a family of hybrid entropy functionals that consistently specialize to the usual R\'enyi and Shannon entropies. Upon considering the MQC Ehrenfest model for the dynamics of quantum and classical probabilities, we apply the hybrid Shannon entropy to characterize equilibrium configurations for simple Hamiltonians. The present construction also applies beyond Ehrenfest dynamics.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Free Field and Discrete Gaussians in Periodic Dimer Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07241v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze height fluctuations in Aztec diamond dimer models with nearly arbitrary periodic edge weights. We show that the centered height function approximates the sum of two independent components: a Gaussian free field on the multiply connected liquid region and a harmonic function with random liquid-gas boundary values. The boundary values are jointly distributed as a discrete Gaussian random vector. This discrete Gaussian distribution maintains a quasi-periodic dependence on $N$, a phenomenon also observed in multi-cut random matrix models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09796v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the Araki-Uhlmann relative entropy in Quantum Field Theory, focusing on a free massive scalar field in 1+1-dimensional Minkowski spacetime. Using Tomita-Takesaki modular theory, we analyze the relative entropy between a coherent state and the vacuum state, with several types of test functions localized in the right Rindler wedge. Our results confirm that relative entropy decreases with increasing mass and grows with the size of the spacetime region, aligning with theoretical expectations.</description>
