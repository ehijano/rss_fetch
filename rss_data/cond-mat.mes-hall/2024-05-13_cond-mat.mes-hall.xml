      <title>RKKY interaction in Rashba altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction between two impurity spins provides vital information about the host system and has been suggested to form a building block in quantum computation and spintronic devices. We here determine this Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction in recently discovered altermagnetic materials, including the presence of an exchange field and Rashba spin-orbit coupling in the case where the impurities are placed on an altermagnetic surface. We provide exact analytical expressions for the RKKY interaction to second order in the spin coupling parameter. Our results reveal that the momentum-resolved spin-polarization of the itinerant carriers in the altermagnet changes the RKKY interaction qualitatively from the isotropic spin-splitting in a ferromagnet. The Ising-contribution directed parallel with the altermagnetism is found to exhibit a beating pattern reflecting the shape of the Fermi surface of the system and may thus be further influenced by an out-of-plane exchange field. However, the exchange interaction for in-plane impurity spins deviates only slightly from that of a normal metal. On shorter length scales, we find that the Ising, the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya terms, and other non-collinear interaction terms in the RKKY interaction acquire a rapidly oscillating behavior as a function of the relative angle between the impurity spins, which is not present in the ferromagnetic case. We determine how this new length scale depends on the system parameters analytically. Our results show that the RKKY interaction in altermagnets is qualitatively different from that of ferromagnets despite both breaking time-reversal symmetry.</description>

      <title>Tunable Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity in Magnetic Skyrmion Manipulation Chambers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions, as scalable and non-volatile spin textures, can dynamically interact with fields and currents, making them promising for unconventional computing. This paper presents a neuromorphic device based on skyrmion manipulation chambers to implement spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), a mechanism for unsupervised learning in brain-inspired computing. STDP adjusts synaptic weights based on the timing of pre- and post-synaptic spikes. The proposed three-chamber design encodes synaptic weight in the number of skyrmions in the center chamber, with left and right chambers for pre-synaptic and post-synaptic spikes. Micromagnetic simulations demonstrate that the timing between applied currents across the chambers controls the final skyrmion count (weight). The device exhibits adaptability and learning capabilities by manipulating chamber parameters, mimicking Hebbian and dendritic location-based plasticity. The device's ability to maintain state post-write highlights its potential for advancing adaptable neuromorphic devices.</description>

      <title>Exploring Topological Transport in Pt$_2$HgSe$_3$ Nanoribbons: Insights for Spintronic Device Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of the quantum spin Hall effect led to the exploration of the electronic transport for spintronic devices. Here, we theoretically investigated the electronic conductance in large-gap realistic quantum spin Hall system, Pt$_2$HgSe$_3$ nanoribbons. By an ab initio approach, we found that the edge states present a penetration depth of about $0.9$\,{nm}, which is much smaller than those predicted in other 2D topological systems. Thus, suggesting that Pt$_2$HgSe$_3$ allows the exploitation of topological transport properties in narrow ribbons. Using non-equilibrium Green's functions calculations, we have examined the electron conductivity upon the presence of Se\,$\leftrightarrow$\,Hg antistructure defects randomly distributed in the Pt$_2$HgSe$_3$ scattering region. By considering scattering lengths up to $109$\,nm, we found localization lengths that can surpass $\mu$m sizes for narrow nanoribbons ($&lt;9$\,nm). These findings can contribute to further understanding the behavior of topological insulators under realistic conditions and their integration within electronic, spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Second-Order magnon Thermal Hall Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the intrinsic contribution of nonlinear magnon thermal Hall Effect. We derive the intrinsic second order thermal Hall conductivity of magnon by the thermal scalar potential (TSP) method and the thermal vector potential (TVP) method. We find that the intrinsic second order magnon thermal Hall conductivity is related to the thermal Berry-connection polarizability (TBCP). We apply our theory to the monolayer ferromagnetic Hexagonal lattice, and we find that the second order magnon thermal Hall conductivity can be controlled by changing Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya strength and applying strain.</description>

      <title>Van der Waals Magnetic Electrode Transfer for Two-Dimensional Spintronic Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials are promising candidates for spintronic applications. Maintaining their atomically smooth interfaces during integration of ferromagnetic (FM) electrodes is crucial since conventional metal deposition tends to induce defects at the interfaces. Meanwhile, the difficulties in picking up FM metals with strong adhesion and in achieving conductance match between FM electrodes and spin transport channels make it challenging to fabricate high-quality 2D spintronic devices using metal transfer techniques. Here, we report a solvent-free magnetic electrode transfer technique that employs a graphene layer to assist in the transfer of FM metals. It also serves as part of the FM electrode after transfer for optimizing spin injection, which enables the realization of spin valves with excellent performance based on various 2D materials. In addition to two-terminal devices, we demonstrate that the technique is applicable for four-terminal spin valves with nonlocal geometry. Our results provide a promising future of realizing 2D spintronic applications using the developed magnetic electrode transfer technique.</description>

      <title>Theory for electron and hole fine structure and Land\'e g-factors in lead chalcogenide nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the atomistic tight-binding method in combination with symmetry analysis and extended effective mass theory we derive a phenomenological model for the fine structure of the ground electron and hole states in $[111]$-grown PbX, X=S,Se hexagonal and cylindrical nanowires. Projection of the tight-binding states to the basis of valley states enables the explicit parametrization of the valley mixing Hamiltonian, which is essential to obtain correct combinations of the valley states for electron (hole) ground levels analytically. The effective Hamiltonian of valley mixing allows to convert the intravalley components of the $g$-factors tensors to the Zeeman splittings of electron and hole levels in nanowires.Tensors of the intravalley electron (hole) Land\'e $g$-factors, parameters of the valley mixing Hamiltonian as well as the valley and anisotropic splitting energies and velocity matrix elements are also calculated.</description>

      <title>Atomic-scale tunable phonon transport at tailored grain boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Manipulating thermal properties in materials has been of fundamental importance for advancing innovative technologies. Heat carriers such as phonons are impeded by breaking crystal symmetry or periodicity. Notable methods of impeding the phonon propagation include varying the density of defects, interfaces, and nanostructures, as well as changing composition. However, a robust link between the individual nanoscale defect structures, phonon states, and macroscopic thermal conductivity is lacking. Here we reveal from nanoscale structure-phonon mechanisms on how the grain boundary (GB) tilt and twist angles fundamentally drive the changes in atom rearrangements, exotic vibrational states, and finally macroscopic heat transport at different bicrystal strontium titanate GBs using emerging atomic resolution vibrational spectroscopy. The 10 deg and 22 deg tilt GBs exhibit reduced phonon populations by 54% and 16% compared to the bulk value, respectively, consistent with measured thermal conductivities. A tiny twist angle further introduces a fine and local tunning of thermal conductivity by introducing twist induced defects periodically embedded with the tilt induced GB defects. Our results demonstrate that varying the tilt angle coarsely modifies the phonon population along entire GB while varying the twist angle incurs a finer adjustment at periodic locations on the GB. Our study offers a systematic approach to understanding and manipulating cross GB thermal transport of arbitrary GBs predictably and precisely.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Orbital Origin for the Chirality-Dependent Nonlinear Planar Hall Effect of Topological Nodal Fermions in Chiral Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological semimetals in chiral crystals, which possess both structural handedness and band crossings (or nodes) with topological chiral charge, exhibit many exotic physical properties. Here we demonstrate that the structural and electronic chirality of these systems can endow them with another fascinating phenomenon -- the intrinsic nonlinear planar Hall effect (INPHE), which is prominent around the nodes and reverses sign upon chirality reversal in opposite enantiomers. Taking chiral tellurium as an example, we reveal an intrinsic orbital mechanism, which manifests diverging orbital magnetic moments with hedgehog-like textures around nodes and, therefore, generates a dominant contribution to the INPHE that is proportional to the topological charge. Furthermore, we show that multifold fermions in topological chiral semimetals with B20 structures (e.g., CoSi and PtAl) induce a giant INPHE conductivity reaching the order of $1\sim 10\; \mathrm{A}\cdot\mathrm{V}^{-2}\cdot\mathrm{T}^{-1}$, which is detectable in experiments. Our study not only relates nonlinear transport to band topology and enantiomer recognition but also offers a new way to explore the exotic physical properties associated with unconventional chiral fermions.</description>

      <title>Interpreting S-Parameter Spectra in Coupled Resonant Systems: The Role of Probing Configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The S-parameter $S_{21}$ is widely used to characterize the resonant properties of various systems. However, we demonstrates that the reliability of $S_{21}$ as a true indicator of system resonances depends heavily on the specific probing setup employed. While point-probe or weak probes preserve the integrity of the $S_{21}$ spectrum and accurately reflect system resonances, multi-point and strong probes can introduce significant discrepancies. These discrepancies can manifest as misleading features such as repulsive level anti-crossing or attractive level crossing, even in systems that are fundamentally uncoupled. This highlights the critical importance of selecting appropriate probing techniques to ensure a precise evaluation of system resonances.</description>

      <title>Observation of oriented Landau levels in Berry dipole semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Band crossing points, such as Weyl and Dirac points, play a crucial role in the topological classification of materials and guide the exploration of exotic topological phases. The Berry dipole, a three-dimensional band crossing point beyond the Chern class, hosts a dipolar Berry curvature field and gives rise to numerous nontrivial quantum geometric effects. It has been proposed that the Berry dipole exhibits oriented Landau levels, whose spectrum critically relies on the orientation of the applied magnetic field. However, experimental demonstration of this phenomenon has remained elusive. Here we experimentally demonstrate oriented Landau levels by carefully engineering an inhomogeneous acoustic lattice. We observe distinct Landau level spectra and different propagation properties when the orientation of the pseudomagnetic field is reversed. Notably, we discover a new type of helical zero modes whose existence critically depends on the magnetic field's orientation. Our work paves the way for studying band crossings beyond Chern-class crossing points, including Berry multipoles and even-dimensional monopoles. Furthermore, it offers new insight for exploring topological devices.</description>

      <title>InP/GaSb core-shell nanowires: a practical proposal for Majorana modes in a full-shell hybrid geometry with hole bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Full-shell hybrid nanowires (NWs), structures comprising a superconductor shell that encapsulates a semiconductor (SM) core, have attracted considerable attention in the search for Majorana zero modes (MZMs). The main caveats of this platform, however, are that the predicted Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in the SM is too small to achieve substantial topological minigaps and that the MZMs typically coexist with a finite background of trivial subgap states. In order to overcome both problems, we explore the advantages of utilizing core-shell hole-band NWs for the SM part of the full-shell hybrid, with an insulating core and an active SM shell. In particular, we consider InP/GaSb core-shell NWs, which allow to exploit the unique characteristics of the III-V compound SM valence bands. We demonstrate that they exhibit a robust hole SOC that depends mainly on SM and geometrical parameters. In other words, the SOC is intrinsic and does not rely on neither electric fields, which are non-tunable in a full-shell hybrid geometry, nor on the strain at the interface, contrary to what happens in Ge/Si heterostructures where the strain plays a crucial role. As a result, core-shell hole-band NWs emerge as a promising candidate for full-shell Majorana physics, addressing several challenges in the field.</description>

      <title>Significant improvement in sensitivity of an anomalous Nernst heat flux sensor by composite structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heat flux sensors (HFS) have attracted significant interest for their potential in managing waste heat efficiently. A recently proposed HFS, that works on the basis of the anomalous Nernst effect (ANE), offers several advantages in its simple structure leading to easy fabrication, low cost, and reduced thermal resistance. However, enhancing sensitivity through traditional material selection is now challenging due to a small number of materials satisfying the required coexistence of a large transverse Seebeck coefficient and low thermal conductivity. In this study, by utilizing composite structures and optimizing the device geometry, we have achieved a substantial improvement in the sensitivity of an ANE-based HFS. We developed composite structures comprised of a plastic substrate with an uneven surface and three-dimensional (3D) uneven TbCo films, fabricated using nanoimprint techniques and sputtering. This approach resulted in a sensitivity that is approximately four times greater than that observed in previous studies. Importantly, this method is independent of the material properties and can significantly enhance the sensitivity. Our findings could lead to the development of highly sensitive HFS devices and open new avenues for the fabrication of 3D devices.</description>

Abstract: The expression for the higher temperature dependence of the mean squared displacement in proteins is obtained. The quantum multi-well model explains the dynamic transitions of the proteins and minimizes the amount of parameters to a single one leading to the few-state harmonic system at low-temperatures, and, thus, justifying the possibility of using proteins as atom traps to control qubits at a bit higher temperatures.</description>

      <title>Quasiparticle and superfluid dynamics in Magic-Angle Graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magic-Angle Twisted Bilayer Graphene shows a wide range of correlated phases which are electrostatically tunable. Despite a growing knowledge of the material, there is yet no consensus on the microscopic mechanisms driving its superconducting phase. In particular, elucidating the symmetry and formation mechanism of the superconducting phase may provide key insights for the understanding of unconventional, strongly coupled and topological superconductivity. A major obstacle to progress in this direction is that key thermodynamic properties, such as specific heat, electron-phonon coupling and superfluid stiffness, are extremely challenging to measure due to the 2D nature of the material and its relatively low energy scales. Here, we use a gate-defined, radio frequency-biased, Josephson junction to probe the electronic dynamics of magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG). We reveal both the electronic quasiparticle dynamics, driven by their thermalization through phonon scattering, as well as the condensate dynamics, driven by the inertia of Cooper pairs. From these properties we recover the evolution of thermalization rates, and the superfluid stiffness across the phase diagram. Our findings favor an anisotropic or nodal pairing state and allow to estimate the strength of electron-phonon coupling. These results contribute to understanding the underlying mechanisms of superconductivity in MATBG while establishing an easy-to-implement method for characterizing thermal and superfluid properties of superconducting 2D materials.</description>

      <title>Topological Superconductivity in Monolayer T$_{\textrm{d}}$-MoTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological superconductivity has attracted significant attention due to its potential applications in quantum computation, but its experimental realization remains challenging. Recently, monolayer T$_{\textrm{d}}$-MoTe$_2$ was observed to exhibit gate tunable superconductivity, and its in-plane upper critical field exceeds the Pauli limit. Here, we show that an in-plane magnetic field beyond the Pauli limit can drive the superconducting monolayer T$_{\textrm{d}}$-MoTe$_2$ into a topological superconductor. The topological superconductivity arises from the interplay between the in-plane Zeeman coupling and the unique \emph{Ising plus in-plane SOC} in the monolayer T$_{\textrm{d}}$-MoTe$_2$. The \emph{Ising plus in-plane SOC} plays the essential role to enable the effective $p_x+ip_y$ pairing. Importantly, as the essential \emph{Ising plus in-plane SOC} in the monolayer T$_{\textrm{d}}$-MoTe$_2$ is generated by an in-plane polar field, our proposal demonstrates that applying an in-plane magnetic field to a gate tunable 2D superconductor with an in-plane polar axis is a feasible way to realize topological superconductivity.</description>

Abstract: The generation and manipulation of the valley polarization in solids are crucial for valleytronics, which is mainly limited to the analysis of inversion and time-reversal symmetries for two-dimensional (2D) hexagonal systems. Here, through group theory analysis, we propose general rules for the generation and manipulation of valley polarization in 2D hexagonal lattices. The generation of valley polarization requires breaking the specific enforced symmetry that is associated with different valleys or reverses the sign of Berry curvature. Further manipulation of valley polarization requires asymmetry operators connecting two states with opposite signs of Berry curvature. These rules for generating and manipulating valley polarization are extendable to generic points in momentum space. Combined with first-principles calculations, we realize the controllable valley polarization in three representative systems, i.e., monolayer FeCl2, bilayer TcGeSe3, and monolayer CrOBr. Our work provides symmetry rules for designing valleytronic materials that could facilitate the experimental detection and realistic applications.</description>

      <title>Mixed quantum-classical modeling of exciton-phonon scattering in solids: Application to optical linewidths of monolayer MoS2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a mixed quantum-classical framework for the microscopic and non-Markovian modeling of exciton-phonon scattering in solid-state materials, and apply it to calculate the optical linewidths of monolayer MoS2. Within this framework, we combine reciprocal-space mixed quantum-classical dynamics with models for the quasiparticle band structure as well as the electron-hole and carrier-phonon interactions, parametrized against ab initio calculations, although noting that a direct interfacing with ab initio calculations is straightforward in principle. We introduce various parameters for truncating the Brillouin zone to select regions of interest. Variations of these parameters allow us to determine linewidths in the limit of asymptotic material sizes. Obtained asymptotic linewidths are found to agree favorably with experimental measurements across a range of temperatures. As such, our framework establishes itself as a promising route towards unraveling the non-Markovian and microscopic principles governing the nonadiabatic dynamics of solids.</description>

      <title>Gate-controlled superconducting proximity effect of superconductor/ferromagnet van der Waals heterostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of 2D materials opens up unprecedented opportunities to design new materials with specified properties. In many cases, the design guiding principle is based on one or another proximity effect, i.e. the nanoscale-penetration of electronic correlations from one material to another. In a few layer van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures the proximity regions occupy the entire system. Here we demonstrate that the physics of magnetic and superconducting proximity effects in 2D superconductor/ferromagnet vdW heterostructures is determined by the effects of interface hybridization of the electronic spectra of both materials. The degree of hybridization can be adjusted by gating, which makes it possible to achieve a high degree of controllability of the proximity effect. In particular, we show that this allows for electrical switching of superconductivity in such structures on and off, as well as for control of the amplitude and sign of the Zeeman splitting of superconducting spectra.</description>

      <title>InAs on Insulator: A New Platform for Cryogenic Hybrid Superconducting Electronics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconducting circuits based on hybrid InAs Josephson Junctions (JJs) play a starring role in the design of fast and ultra-low power consumption solid-state quantum electronics and exploring novel physical phenomena. Conventionally, 3D substrates, 2D quantum wells (QWs), and 1D nanowires (NWs) made of InAs are employed to create superconductive circuits with hybrid JJs. Each platform has its advantages and disadvantages. Here, we proposed the InAs-on-insulator (InAsOI) as a groundbreaking platform for developing superconducting electronics. An epilayer of semiconductive InAs with different electron densities was grown onto an InAlAs metamorphic buffer layer, efficiently used as a cryogenic insulator to decouple adjacent devices electrically. JJs with various lengths and widths were fabricated employing Al as a superconductor and InAs with different electron densities. We achieved a switching current density of 7.3 uA/um, a critical voltage of 50-to-80 uV, and a critical temperature equal to that of the superconductor used. For all the JJs, the switching current follows a characteristic Fraunhofer pattern with an out-of-plane magnetic field. These achievements enable the use of InAsOI to design and fabricate surface-exposed Josephson Field Effect Transistors with high critical current densities and superior gating properties.</description>

Abstract: The increasing financial and environmental cost of many inorganic materials has motivated study into organic and "green" alternatives. However, most organic compounds contain a large number of atoms in the primitive unit cell, posing a significant barrier to high-throughput screening for functional properties. In this work, we attempt to overcome this challenge and identify superconducting candidates among the metal-organic-frameworks in the organic materials database using a recently proposed proxy for the electron-phonon coupling. We then isolate the most promising candidate for in-depth analysis, C$_{9}$H$_{8}$Mn$_{2}$O$_{11}$, providing evidence for superconductivity below $100$mK.</description>

Abstract: We consider a time-dependent, surface Hamiltonian for the 3D compound samarium hexaboride based on the slave boson protocol linked version of the periodic Anderson model reported earlier. We show the possible access to the quantum anomalous Hall state due to the normal incidence of circularly polarized light on the surface of the compound in the high frequency limit within the framework of the Floquet theory. The chern number is found to be unity for the right-handed as well as the left-handed circularly polarized light.</description>

      <title>Influence of higher order electron-phonon interaction on the electron-related lattice thermal properties of 2d Dirac crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.18369v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To understand the essential properties of Dirac crystals, such as their thermal conductivity, we require models that consider the interaction between Dirac electrons and dispersive acoustic phonons. The exceptionally high thermal conductivity in 2D Dirac crystals is attributed to near-ideal phonon quantum gases, while undesired limitations arise from electron-phonon (e-ph) interactions which have been shown to limit the thermal conductivity up to several microns away. The e-ph thermal conductivity is directly linked to the phonon scattering rate. Conventional calculations overlook phonons with short-dispersive wavelengths, rendering them inadequate for analyzing 2D Dirac crystals. The phonon scattering rate is typically calculated up to the first-order magnitude, considering 3-particle interactions involving the decay of an electron and phonon (EP-E*) to create a new electron. However, processes involving the decay of an electron and the creation of a new electron and phonon (E-E*P*) are neglected. In this study, we present an accurate expression for the phonon scattering rate and e-ph thermal conductivity in 2D Dirac crystals, accounting for short-dispersive wavelength phonons. We demonstrate the significance of the E-E*P* process even at room temperature in calculating the phonon scattering rate and e-ph thermal conductivity, particularly for first-order e-ph interactions. Furthermore, we emphasize the importance of incorporating second-order e-ph interactions, specifically the EP-E*P* interaction involving the decay of an electron and phonon and the creation of a new electron-phonon pair, to accurately determine the phonon scattering rate and e-ph thermal conductivity at high temperatures and low Fermi energies. This 4-particle interaction process plays a crucial role in characterizing these properties effectively.</description>

      <title>Giant Hall Switching by Surface-State-Mediated Spin-Orbit Torque in a Hard Ferromagnetic Topological Insulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.05603v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological insulators (TI) and magnetic topological insulators (MTI) can apply highly efficient spin-orbit torque (SOT) and manipulate the magnetization with their unique topological surface states with ultra-high efficiency. Here, we demonstrate efficient SOT switching of a hard MTI, V-doped (Bi,Sb)2Te3 (VBST) with a large coercive field that can prevent the influence of an external magnetic field. A giant switched anomalous Hall resistance of 9.2 $k\Omega$ is realized, among the largest of all SOT systems. The SOT switching current density can be reduced to $2.8\times10^5 A/cm^2$. Moreover, as the Fermi level is moved away from the Dirac point by both gate and composition tuning, VBST exhibits a transition from edge-state-mediated to surface-state-mediated transport, thus enhancing the SOT effective field to $1.56\pm 0.12 T/ (10^6 A/cm^2)$ and the interfacial charge-to-spin conversion efficiency to $3.9\pm 0.3 nm^{-1}$. The findings establish VBST as an extraordinary candidate for energy-efficient magnetic memory devices.</description>

Abstract: A significant hurdle in developing high-performance semiconductor quantum technologies utilizing deep defects is related to charge dynamics. Unfortunately, progress in modeling their charge dynamics has been hindered over recent decades due to the absence of appropriate multiscale models capable of accurately representing the atomic properties of these defects and their impact on device performance. Here, we present a semi-\textit{ab initio} method for modeling the bound states of deep defects in semiconductor quantum technologies, applied to the negatively charged nitrogen vacancy (NV$^-$) center in diamond. We employ density functional theory calculations to construct accurate potentials for an effective mass model, which allow us to unveil the structure of the bound hole states. We develop a model to calculate the nonradiative capture cross sections, which agrees with experiment within one order of magnitude. Finally, we present our attempt at constructing the photoionization spectrum of NV$^0\rightarrow$ NV$^-$ + bound hole, showing that the electronic transitions of the bound holes can be distinguished from phonon sidebands. This paper offers a practical and efficient solution to a long-standing challenge in understanding the charge dynamics of deep defects.</description>

      <title>Circuit-theoretic phenomenological model of an electrostatic gate-controlled bi-SQUID</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.01094v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A numerical model based on a lumped circuit element approximation for a bi-superconducting quantum interference device (bi-SQUID) operating in the presence of an external magnetic field is presented in this paper. Included in the model is the novel ability to capture the resultant behaviour of the device when a strong electric field is applied to its Josephson junctions by utilising gate electrodes. The model is used to simulate an all-metallic SNS (Al-Cu-Al) bi-SQUID, where good agreement is observed between the simulated results and the experimental data. The results discussed in this work suggest that the primary consequences of the superconducting field effect induced by the gating of the Josephson junctions are accounted for in our minimal model; namely, the suppression of the junctions super-current. Although based on a simplified semi-empirical model, our results may guide the search for a microscopic origin of this effect by providing a means to model the voltage response of gated SQUIDs. Also, the possible applications of this effect regarding the operation of SQUIDs as ultra-high precision sensors, where the performance of such devices can be improved via careful tuning of the applied gate voltages, are discussed at the end of the paper.</description>

      <title>Simple model for the gap in the surface states of the antiferromagnetic topological insulator MnBi$_2$Te$_4$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.11216v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the influence of the antiferromagnetic order on the surface states of topological insulators. We derive an effective Hamiltonian for these states, taking into account the spatial structure of the antiferromagnetic order. We obtain a typical (gapless) Dirac Hamiltonian for the surface states when the surface of the sample is not perturbed. Gapless spectrum is protected by the combination of time-reversal and half-translation symmetries. However, a shift in the chemical potential of the surface layer opens a gap in the spectrum away from the Fermi energy. Such a gap occurs only in systems with finite antiferromagnetic order. We observe that the system topology remains unchanged even for large values of the disorder. We calculate the spectrum using the tight-binding model with different boundary conditions. In this case we get a gap in the spectrum of the surface states. This discrepancy arises due to the violation of the combined time-reversal symmetry. We compare our results with experiments and density functional theory calculations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04565v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate one- and two-photon absorption in twisted bilayer graphene (TBLG) by examining the effects of tuning the twist angle $ \theta $ and the excitation energy $ E_l $ on their corresponding absorption coefficients $ \alpha_{i=1,2}$. We find that $ \alpha_1 $ shows distinct peaks as a function of $ E_l $ which correspond to the van Hove singularities (vHS) of TBLG. In contrast to single- (SLG) and AB bilayer graphene (BLG), $ \alpha_1 $ is substantially enhanced by $\sim 2$ and $\sim 1$ orders of magnitude, respectively, in the visible range. On the other hand, $\alpha_2 $ exhibits a remarkable increase of $\sim 11$ and $\sim 9$ orders of magnitude. Interestingly, as $\theta$ increases, the resonant features exhibited by $\alpha_{i=1,2}$ \textit{vs.} $ E_l $ shift progressively from the infrared to the visible. On doping TBLG, both $\alpha_1 $ and $ \alpha_2 $ remain essentially unchanged \textit{vs.} $ E_l $ but with a minor red-shift in their resonant peaks. Additionally, we explore various polarization configurations for TPA and determine the conditions under which $\alpha_2$ becomes extremal.</description>

Abstract: We report on experimental observation of unidirectional propagation of zero-momentum magnons in synthetic antiferromagnet consisting of strained CoFeB/Ru/CoFeB trilayer. Inherent non-reciprocity of spin waves in synthetic antiferromagnets with uniaxial anisotropy results in smooth and monotonous dispersion relation around Gamma point, where the direction of the phase velocity is reversed, while the group velocity direction is conserved. The experimental observation of this phenomenon by intensity-, phase-, and time-resolved Brillouin light scattering microscopy is corroborated by analytical models and micromagnetic simulations.</description>

Abstract: A holistic computational analysis is developed to calculate the quantum efficiency of InAs/GaSb superlattice-based photodetectors. Starting with the electronic band characteristics computed by taking the InSb/GaAs at the interface using the 8-band k.p approach, we demonstrate the impact of InAs and GaSb widths on the bandgap, carrier concentration, and the oscillator strength for type-II superlattice absorbers. Subsequently, the alteration of these characteristics due to the extra AlSb layer in the M superlattice absorber is investigated. Extending our models for determining TE- and TM-polarized optical absorption, our calculations reveal that the TE-polarized absorption shows a substantial influence near the conduction-heavy hole band transition energy, which eventually diminishes, owing to the dominant TM-contribution due to the conduction-light hole band transition. Extending our analysis to the dark currents, we focus mainly on Schokley-Read-Hall recombination and radiative recombination at lower temperatures, and show that Schokley-Read-Hall dominates at low-level injection. We show that short-wavelength and mid-wavelength M superlattice structures exhibit higher quantum efficiency than the corresponding same bandgap type-II superlattice with the lower diffusion dark current. Further, we analyze the density of states blocked by the barrier; crucial for XBp photodetector after absorber examination. Our work thus sets a stage for a holistic and predictive theory aided analysis of the type-II superlattice absorbers, from the atomistic interfacial details all the way to the dark currents and absorption spectra.</description>

Abstract: Gate-defined quantum dots are a promising candidate system to realize scalable, coupled qubit systems and serve as a fundamental building block for quantum computers. However, present-day quantum dot devices suffer from imperfections that must be accounted for, which hinders the characterization, tuning, and operation process. Moreover, with an increasing number of quantum dot qubits, the relevant parameter space grows sufficiently to make heuristic control infeasible. Thus, it is imperative that reliable and scalable autonomous tuning approaches are developed. In this report, we outline current challenges in automating quantum dot device tuning and operation with a particular focus on datasets, benchmarking, and standardization. We also present ideas put forward by the quantum dot community on how to overcome them.</description>

      <title>Influence of the magneto-volume effect on the transient reflectivity of MnSi</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02174v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The magneto-volume effect is a well-established yet frequently overlooked phenomenon in magnetic materials that may affect a wide range of physical properties. Our study explores the influence of the magneto-volume effect on the transient reflectivity of MnSi, a well-known chiral magnet with strong magnetoelastic coupling. We observe a unipolar reflectivity transient in the paramagnetic phase, contrasting with a bipolar response in phases with magnetic long-range order. Comparing our findings with thermal expansion from literature, we establish that the bipolar response originates in the magneto-volume effect which dominates the thermal expansion and influences the optical reflectivity. Our results highlight not only that the magneto-volume effect must be considered when discussing transient reflectivity measurements of magnetic materials but also that such measurements permit to study the characteristic time scales of the magneto-volume effect itself, contributing to a deeper understanding of this often-neglected phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Energy landscape of noncollinear exchange coupled magnetic multilayers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15910v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We conduct an exploration of the energy landscape of two coupled ferromagnetic layers with perpendicular-to-plane uniaxial anisotropy using finite-element micromagnetic simulations. These multilayers can be used to produce noncollinearity in spin-transfer torque magnetic random-access memory cells, which has been shown to increase the performance of this class of computer memory. We show that there exists a range of values of the interlayer exchange coupling constants for which the magnetic state of these multilayers can relax into two energy minima. The size of this region is determined by the difference in the magnitude of the layer anisotropies and is minimized when this difference is large. In this case, there is a wide range of experimentally achievable coupling constants that can produce desirable and stable noncollinear alignment. We investigate the energy barriers separating the local and global minima using string method simulations, showing that the stabilities of the minima increase with increasing difference in the anisotropy of the ferromagnetic layers. We provide an analytical solution to the location of the minima in the energy landscape of coupled macrospins, which has good agreement with our micromagnetic results for a case involving ferromagnetic layers with the same thickness and anisotropy, no demagnetization field, and large exchange stiffness. These results are important to understand how best to employ noncollinear coupling in the next generation of thin film magnetic devices.</description>

      <title>On the equivalence of the semiclassical theory and the response theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17086v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is commonly believed that the response theory can give quantum correction (or interband coherent effects) to the semiclassical theory, while both formulations essentially are perturbatively solving the time-dependent Sch\"odinger equation in a periodic potential probed by the electric field within the independent-particle approximation. Herein, by extending the semiclassical theory under an AC uniform electric field to the nonlinear regime, we show that up to the second order of the electric field, the AC semiclassical theory is equivalent to the response theory in the absence of relaxation. Remarkably, this equivalence can be inherited when the relaxation is incorporated into the response theory, particularly by taking the semiclassical results with a finite relaxation time obtained by solving the Boltzmann equation as a benchmark. ......</description>

      <title>Giant Hyperfine Interaction between a Dark Exciton Condensate and Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04555v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the interaction of a dark exciton Bose-Einstein condensate with the nuclei in GaAs/AlGaAs coupled quantum wells and find clear evidence for nuclear polarization buildup that accompanies the appearance of the condensate. We show that the nuclei are polarized throughout the mesa area, extending to regions which are far away from the photoexcitation area, and persisting for seconds after the excitation is switched off. Photoluminescence measurements in the presence of RF radiation reveal that the hyperfine interaction between the nuclear and electron spins is enhanced by two orders of magnitude. We suggest that this large enhancement manifests the collective nature of the N-excitons condensate, which amplifies the interaction by a factor of sqrt{N}.</description>

      <title>Realization of an atomic quantum Hall system in four dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.06322v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern condensed matter physics relies on the concept of topology to classify matter, from quantum Hall systems to topological insulators. Engineered systems, benefiting from synthetic dimensions, can potentially give access to novel topological states predicted in dimensions $D &gt; 3$. We report the realization of an atomic quantum Hall system evolving in four dimensions (4D), with two spatial dimensions and two synthetic ones encoded in the large spin of dysprosium atoms. The non-trivial topology is evidenced by measuring a quantized electromagnetic non-linear response and observing anisotropic hyperedge modes. We also excite non-planar cyclotron motion, contrasting with its circular equivalents in $D\leq3$. Our work opens to the investigation of strongly-correlated topological liquids in 4D generalizing fractional quantum Hall states.</description>

      <title>Suppression of quasiparticle poisoning in transmon qubits by gap engineering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02655v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The performance of various superconducting devices operating at ultra-low temperatures is impaired by the presence of non-equilibrium quasiparticles. Inelastic quasiparticle (QP) tunneling across Josephson junctions in superconducting qubits results in decoherence and spurious excitations and, notably, can trigger correlated errors that severely impede quantum error correction. In this work, we use "gap engineering" to suppress the tunneling of low-energy quasiparticles in Al-based transmon qubits, a leading building block for superconducting quantum processors. By implementing potential barriers for QP, we strongly suppress QP tunneling across the junction and preserve charge parity for over $10^3$ seconds. The suppression of QP tunneling also results in a reduction in the qubit energy relaxation rates. The demonstrated approach to gap engineering can be easily implemented in all Al-based circuits with Josephson junctions.</description>

      <title>Mesoscale modeling of deformations and defects in crystalline sheets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11371v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a mesoscale description of deformations and defects in thin, flexible sheets with crystalline order, tackling the interplay between in-plane elasticity, out-of-plane deformation, and dislocation nucleation and motion. Our approach is based on the Phase-Field Crystal (PFC) model, which describes the microscopic atomic density in crystals at diffusive timescales, naturally encoding elasticity and plasticity effects. In its amplitude expansion (APFC), a coarse-grained description of the mechanical properties of crystals is achieved. We introduce surface PFC and surface APFC models in a convenient height-function formulation encoding deformation in the normal direction. This framework is proven consistent with classical aspects of strain-induced buckling, defect nucleation on deformed surfaces, and out-of-plane relaxation near dislocations. In particular, we benchmark and discuss the results of numerical simulations by looking at the continuum limit for buckling under uniaxial compression and at evidence from microscopic models for deformation at defects and defect arrangements, demonstrating the scale-bridging capabilities of the proposed framework. Results concerning the interplay between lattice distortion at dislocations and out-of-plane deformation are also illustrated by looking at the annihilation of dislocation dipoles and systems hosting many dislocations. With the novel formulation proposed here, and its assessment with established approaches, we envision applications to multiscale investigations of crystalline order on deformable surfaces.</description>

      <title>Invalidation of the Bloch-Redfield Equation in Sub-Ohmic Regime via a Practical Time-Convolutionless Fourth-Order Master Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15089v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite recent advances in quantum sciences, a quantum master equation that accurately and simply characterizes open quantum dynamics across extremely long timescales and in dispersive environments is still needed. In this study, we optimize the computation of the fourth-order time-convolutionless master equation to meet this need. Early versions of this master equation required computing a multidimensional integral, limiting its use. Our master equation accounts for simultaneous relaxation and dephasing, resulting in coefficients proportional to the system's spectral density over frequency derivative. In sub-Ohmic environments, this derivative induces infrared divergence in the master equation, invalidating the second-order Bloch-Redfield master equation findings. We analyze the approach to a ground state in a generic open quantum system and demonstrate that it is not reliably computed by the Bloch-Redfield equation alone. The optimized fourth-order equation shows that the ground-state approach is accurate to second order in bath coupling regardless of the dispersion, even though it can diverge in the fourth order at zero temperature.</description>

      <title>Scalable multi-qubit intrinsic gates in quantum dot arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06894v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study multi-qubit quantum gates intrinsic to an array of semiconductor quantum dots and investigate how they can be implemented in a scalable way. The intrinsic quantum gates refer to the class of natural-forming transformations in the qubit rotating-frame under direct exchange coupling, and can be recognized as an instruction set of spin-qubit chips. Adopting perturbative treatment, we can model the intrinsic gates by first-order dynamics in the coupling strength and develop a general formalism for identifying the multi-qubit intrinsic gates under arbitrary array connectivity. The advantageous applications of the intrinsic gates in quantum computing and quantum error correction are explored. Factors influencing the fidelities of the multi-qubit intrinsic gates are also discussed. To overcome the problem of inhomogeneous coupling, we propose a theoretical scheme in which single-qubit pulses are applied to dynamically calibrate the connecting bonds. This scheme can be further combined with periodic dynamical decoupling for robust implementations of multi-qubit gates in large-scale quantum computers.</description>
