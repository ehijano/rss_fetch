      <title>Epidemic outbreaks in structured host populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a heterogeneous host population, the basic reproduction number of an infectious disease, $\cR_0$, is defined as the spectral radius of the next generation operator (NGO). The threshold properties of the basic reproduction number are typically established by imposing conditions that make $\cR_0$ an eigenvalue of the NGO associated with a positive eigenvector and a positive eigenfunctional (eigenvector of the dual of the NGO). More general results can be obtained by imposing conditions that associate $\cR_0$ just with a positive eigenfunctional. The next generation operator is conveniently expressed by a measure kernel or a Feller kernel which enables the use of analytic rather than functional analytic methods.</description>

      <title>Variational methods for Learning Multilevel Genetic Algorithms using the Kantorovich Monad</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Levels of selection and multilevel evolutionary processes are essential concepts in evolutionary theory, and yet there is a lack of common mathematical models for these core ideas. Here, we propose a unified mathematical framework for formulating and optimizing multilevel evolutionary processes and genetic algorithms over arbitrarily many levels based on concepts from category theory and population genetics. We formulate a multilevel version of the Wright-Fisher process using this approach, and we show that this model can be analyzed to clarify key features of multilevel selection. Particularly, we derive an extended multilevel probabilistic version of Price's Equation via the Kantorovich Monad, and we use this to characterize regimes of parameter space within which selection acts antagonistically or cooperatively across levels. Finally, we show how our framework can provide a unified setting for learning genetic algorithms (GAs), and we show how we can use a Variational Optimization and a multi-level analogue of coalescent analysis to fit multilevel GAs to simulated data.</description>

      <title>Gamma Distribution for Equilibrium Analysis of Discrete Stochastic Logistic Population Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic models play an essential role in accounting for the variability and unpredictability seen in real-world. This paper focuses on the application of the gamma distribution to analysis of the stationary distributions of populations governed by the discrete stochastic logistic equation at equilibrium. It is well known that the population dynamics of deterministic logistic models are dependent on the range of intrinsic growth rate. In this paper, we identify the same feasible range of the intrinsic growth rate for the stochastic model at equilibrium and establish explicit mathematical relation among the parameters of the gamma distribution and the stochastic models. We analyze the biological implications of these relationships, with particular emphasis on how the shape and scale parameters of the gamma distribution reflect population dynamics at equilibrium. These mathematical relations describe the impact of the variance of the stochastic perturbation on the intrinsic growth rate, and, in particular, reveal that there are two branches of the intrinsic growth rates representing alternative stable states at equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Using sequence data to study spatial scales of interactions driving spread of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza in Great Britain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) has been recently circulating in previously unseen patterns. As the underlying causes are uncertain, we need a better understanding of the drivers of virus circulation, as they underpin the spread, and inform about the impact of HPAI. We combine infection and bird population data, using Random Forest models to quantify the relationship between spatially aggregated values of possible infection risk factors and viral phylogenetic data from HPAI outbreaks to define scales of interactions that influence virus circulation. As genetic proximity is correlated to transmission proximity, the genetic relationships of sequences and relevant variables indicate the scale and resolution of interactions driving transmission. We used H5N1 Sequences from Great Britain divided into two periods: Dec 2020-May 2022, and Jun-Oct 2022. Final model with selected spatial scales shows that for the first period game bird abundance and geographical distance were the strongest predictors of genetic distance, and for the second period, these were geographical distance, collection date and farm count. Variables related to infections have different spatial scales for analysed periods, while variables describing the environment have more consistent scales. The differences in predictors for the periods bears further investigation, however may be related to differences in the virus, areas of spread, or seasonal factors. This is the first phylogenetic study indicating possible role for game birds in the circulation of HPAI and supports experimental studies but must be viewed with caution as our study does not indicate direct causation. We show that the scale of spatial aggregation is variable dependent and reflects the scale of underlying processes. In the future our findings may be used to study dynamics of HPAI and design targeted surveillance and intervention strategies.</description>

      <title>Improving the accuracy of automated labeling of specimen images datasets via a confidence-based process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The digitization of natural history collections over the past three decades has unlocked a treasure trove of specimen imagery and metadata. There is great interest in making this data more useful by further labeling it with additional trait data, and modern deep learning machine learning techniques utilizing convolutional neural nets (CNNs) and similar networks show particular promise to reduce the amount of required manual labeling by human experts, making the process much faster and less expensive. However, in most cases, the accuracy of these approaches is too low for reliable utilization of the automatic labeling, typically in the range of 80-85% accuracy. In this paper, we present and validate an approach that can greatly improve this accuracy, essentially by examining the confidence that the network has in the generated label as well as utilizing a user-defined threshold to reject labels that fall below a chosen level. We demonstrate that a naive model that produced 86% initial accuracy can achieve improved performance - over 95% accuracy (rejecting about 40% of the labels) or over 99% accuracy (rejecting about 65%) by selecting higher confidence thresholds. This gives flexibility to adapt existing models to the statistical requirements of various types of research and has the potential to move these automatic labeling approaches from being unusably inaccurate to being an invaluable new tool. After validating the approach in a number of ways, we annotate the reproductive state of a large dataset of over 600,000 herbarium specimens. The analysis of the results points at under-investigated correlations as well as general alignment with known trends. By sharing this new dataset alongside this work, we want to allow ecologists to gather insights for their own research questions, at their chosen point of accuracy/coverage trade-off.</description>

      <title>The replacement number dynamics in SIR-type epidemic models I: From SSISS to RND picture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19532v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In SIR-type epidemic models time derivative of prevalence $I$ can always be cast into the form $\dot{I}=(X-1)I$, where $X$ is the replacement number and recovery rate is normalized to one. Assuming $\dot{X}=f(X,I)$ for some smooth function $f$ defines a "replacement number dynamics" (RND). Choosing transmission coefficients $\beta_1&gt;\beta_2$, any such system uniquely maps to an isomorphic "SSISS model", i.e. an abstract SIR-type 3-compartment model. Extending to negative values $\beta_i&lt;0$ takes care of demographic dynamics with compartment dependent birth and death rates. Fixing $f$ and varying $\beta_i$ generates a family of isomorphic SSISS systems, the "SSISS fiber" $\cal{F}(f)$}. A symmetry group $G_\sigma$ acts freely and transitively on fibers $\cal{F}(f)$, so SSISS systems become a principal $G_\sigma$-fiber bundle over the space of RND systems. Choosing two specific 6-parameter polynomials $f$ at most quadratic in $(X,I)$ covers a large class of models in the literature, with in total up to 17 (largely redundant!) parameters, including also reactive social behavior models. Epidemiological admissibility conditions guarantee forward boundedness and absence of periodic solutions in all these models. Part II of this work will prove existence and stability properties of endemic equilibria, which in RND picture simply boils down to analyzing zeros of the parabolas $f|_{I=0}$ and $f|_{X=1}$. This will cover and extend well known results for a wide range of models by a unifying approach while also closing some open issues in the literature.</description>
