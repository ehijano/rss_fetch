      <title>Proof-of-concept: Using ChatGPT to Translate and Modernize an Earth System Model from Fortran to Python/JAX</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Earth system models (ESMs) are vital for understanding past, present, and future climate, but they suffer from legacy technical infrastructure. ESMs are primarily implemented in Fortran, a language that poses a high barrier of entry for early career scientists and lacks a GPU runtime, which has become essential for continued advancement as GPU power increases and CPU scaling slows. Fortran also lacks differentiability - the capacity to differentiate through numerical code - which enables hybrid models that integrate machine learning methods. Converting an ESM from Fortran to Python/JAX could resolve these issues. This work presents a semi-automated method for translating individual model components from Fortran to Python/JAX using a large language model (GPT-4). By translating the photosynthesis model from the Community Earth System Model (CESM), we demonstrate that the Python/JAX version results in up to 100x faster runtimes using GPU parallelization, and enables parameter estimation via automatic differentiation. The Python code is also easy to read and run and could be used by instructors in the classroom. This work illustrates a path towards the ultimate goal of making climate models fast, inclusive, and differentiable.</description>

      <title>Heat, Health, and Habitats: Analyzing the Intersecting Risks of Climate and Demographic Shifts in Austrian Districts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The impact of hot weather on health outcomes of a population is mediated by a variety of factors, including its age profile and local green infrastructure. The combination of warming due to climate change and demographic aging suggests that heat-related health outcomes will deteriorate in the coming decades. Here, we measure the relationship between weekly all-cause mortality and heat days in Austrian districts using a panel dataset covering $2015-2022$. An additional day reaching $30$ degrees is associated with a $2.4\%$ increase in mortality per $1000$ inhabitants during summer. This association is roughly doubled in districts with a two standard deviation above average share of the population over $65$. Using forecasts of hot days (RCP) and demographics in $2050$, we observe that districts will have elderly populations and hot days $2-5$ standard deviations above the current mean in just $25$ years. This predicts a drastic increase in heat-related mortality. At the same time, district green scores, measured using $10\times 10$ meter resolution satellite images of residential areas, significantly moderate the relationship between heat and mortality. Thus, although local policies likely cannot reverse warming or demographic trends, they can take measures to mediate the health consequences of these growing risks, which are highly heterogeneous across regions, even in Austria.</description>

      <title>Northward Propagating Versus Non-propagating BSISO over South Asia: Horizontal Advection Driven Moisture Mode Within a Vertically Sheared Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.20489v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Boreal Summer Intraseasonal Oscillation (BSISO) is a pronounced mode of tropical variability. Here, we identify two types of BSISO events, one which propagates northward over South Asia (SA) from the equatorial Indian Ocean (EIO), and the other which doesn't. Contrasting their behaviour shows that northward propagation occurs in multiple stages after convection is initiated over the EIO. First, convection moves into the southern Arabian Sea (AS) due to moistening of the free troposphere via horizontal BSISO anomalous winds acting on the background moisture distribution, and forms a northwest-southeast (NW-SE) oriented convection band. Subsequently, in the presence of an easterly vertical shear of monsoon winds and meridional gradient of anomalous vertical velocity, a NW-SE oriented tilting term is generated that results in a tilted gyre north of the existing convective anomaly and south-easterly BSISO winds over the South Asian landmass. In the second stage, these winds tap the ambient north-westward moisture gradient and help move convection further north over land. Moreover, background winds advect anomalous moisture to initiate convection over the Bay of Bengal. For non-propagating events, though a Rossby gyre results as a response to nascent EIO convection, it is smaller, thus BSISO advection of moisture is weaker and does not initiate convection over the southern AS. In turn, the meridional gradient of anomalous vertical velocity is weak, and the background vertical shear does not generate sufficient tilting over the northern AS. Thus, the convective wind response stalls, and large-scale convection does not propagate north of 15N. Thus, free-tropospheric moisture advection and vortex tilting due to the background vertical shear work together for robust northward propagation of the BSISO.</description>

      <title>GenCast: Diffusion-based ensemble forecasting for medium-range weather</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15796v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Weather forecasts are fundamentally uncertain, so predicting the range of probable weather scenarios is crucial for important decisions, from warning the public about hazardous weather, to planning renewable energy use. Here, we introduce GenCast, a probabilistic weather model with greater skill and speed than the top operational medium-range weather forecast in the world, the European Centre for Medium-Range Forecasts (ECMWF)'s ensemble forecast, ENS. Unlike traditional approaches, which are based on numerical weather prediction (NWP), GenCast is a machine learning weather prediction (MLWP) method, trained on decades of reanalysis data. GenCast generates an ensemble of stochastic 15-day global forecasts, at 12-hour steps and 0.25 degree latitude-longitude resolution, for over 80 surface and atmospheric variables, in 8 minutes. It has greater skill than ENS on 97.4% of 1320 targets we evaluated, and better predicts extreme weather, tropical cyclones, and wind power production. This work helps open the next chapter in operational weather forecasting, where critical weather-dependent decisions are made with greater accuracy and efficiency.</description>
