      <title>Critical Thresholds for Maximum Cardinality Matching on General Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Significant work has been done on computing the ``average'' optimal solution value for various $\mathsf{NP}$-complete problems using the Erd\"{o}s-R\'{e}nyi model to establish \emph{critical thresholds}. Critical thresholds define narrow bounds for the optimal solution of a problem instance such that the probability that the solution value lies outside these bounds vanishes as the instance size approaches infinity. In this paper, we extend the Erd\"{o}s-R\'{e}nyi model to general hypergraphs on $n$ vertices and $M$ hyperedges. We consider the problem of determining critical thresholds for the largest cardinality matching, and we show that for $M=o(1.155^n)$ the size of the maximum cardinality matching is almost surely 1. On the other hand, if $M=\Theta(2^n)$ then the size of the maximum cardinality matching is $\Omega(n^{\frac12-\gamma})$ for an arbitrary $\gamma &gt;0$. Lastly, we address the gap where $\Omega(1.155^n)=M=o(2^n)$ empirically through computer simulations.</description>

      <title>Ants on the highway</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform intensive computations of Generalised Langton's Ants, discovering rules with a big number of highways. We depict the structure of some of them, formally proving that the number of highways which are possible for a given rule does not need to be bounded, moreover it can be infinite. The frequency of appearing of these highways is very unequal within a given generalised ant rule, in some cases these frequencies where found in a ratio of $1/10^7$ in simulations, suggesting that those highways that appears as the only possible asymptotic behaviour of some rules, might be accompanied by a big family of very infrequent ones.</description>

      <title>Efficient approximation schemes for scheduling on a stochastic number of machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study three two-stage optimization problems with a similar structure and different objectives. In the first stage of each problem, the goal is to assign input jobs of positive sizes to unsplittable bags. After this assignment is decided, the realization of the number of identical machines that will be available is revealed. Then, in the second stage, the bags are assigned to machines. The probability vector of the number of machines in the second stage is known to the algorithm as part of the input before making the decisions of the first stage. Thus, the vector of machine completion times is a random variable. The goal of the first problem is to minimize the expected value of the makespan of the second stage schedule, while the goal of the second problem is to maximize the expected value of the minimum completion time of the machines in the second stage solution. The goal of the third problem is to minimize the \ell_p norm for a fixed p&gt;1, where the norm is applied on machines' completion times vectors. Each one of the first two problems admits a PTAS as Buchem et al. showed recently. Here we significantly improve all their results by designing an EPTAS for each one of these problems. We also design an EPTAS for \ell_p norm minimization for any p&gt;1.</description>

      <title>A greedy heuristic for graph burning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07577v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$, the optimization version of the graph burning problem seeks for a sequence of vertices, $(u_1,u_2,...,u_p) \in V(G)^p$, with minimum $p$ and such that every $v \in V(G)$ has distance at most $p-i$ to some vertex $u_i$. The length $p$ of the optimal solution is known as the burning number and is denoted by $b(G)$, an invariant that helps quantify the graph's vulnerability to contagion. This paper explores the advantages and limitations of an $\mathcal{O}(mn + pn^2)$ deterministic greedy heuristic for this problem, where $n$ is the graph's order, $m$ is the graph's size, and $p$ is a guess on $b(G)$. This heuristic is based on the relationship between the graph burning problem and the clustered maximum coverage problem, and despite having limitations on paths and cycles, it found most of the optimal and best-known solutions of benchmark and synthetic graphs with up to 102400 vertices. Beyond practical advantages, our work unveils some of the fundamental aspects of graph burning: its relationship with a generalization of a classical coverage problem and compact integer programs. With this knowledge, better algorithms might be designed in the future.</description>

      <title>My part is bigger than yours -- assessment within a group of peers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01843v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A project (e.g., writing a collaborative research paper) is often a group effort. At the end, each contributor identifies their contribution, often verbally. The reward, however, is very frequently financial. It leads to the question of what (percentage) share in the creation of the paper is due to individual authors. Different authors may have various opinions on the matter; even worse, their opinions may have different relevance. In this paper, we present simple models that allow aggregation of experts' views, linking the priority of his preference directly to the assessment made by other experts. In this approach, the more significant the contribution of a given expert, the greater the importance of his opinion. The presented method can be considered an attempt to find consensus among peers involved in the same project. Hence, its applications may go beyond the proposed study example of writing a scientific paper.</description>

      <title>From Width-Based Model Checking to Width-Based Automated Theorem Proving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.10995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.10995v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the field of parameterized complexity theory, the study of graph width measures has been intimately connected with the development of width-based model checking algorithms for combinatorial properties on graphs. In this work, we introduce a general framework to convert a large class of width-based model-checking algorithms into algorithms that can be used to test the validity of graph-theoretic conjectures on classes of graphs of bounded width. Our framework is modular and can be applied with respect to several well-studied width measures for graphs, including treewidth and cliquewidth.
  As a quantitative application of our framework, we prove analytically that for several long-standing graph-theoretic conjectures, there exists an algorithm that takes a number $k$ as input and correctly determines in time double-exponential in $k^{O(1)}$ whether the conjecture is valid on all graphs of treewidth at most $k$. These upper bounds, which may be regarded as upper-bounds on the size of proofs/disproofs for these conjectures on the class of graphs of treewidth at most $k$, improve significantly on theoretical upper bounds obtained using previously available techniques.</description>

      <title>Decidability of Querying First-Order Theories via Countermodels of Finite Width</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.06348v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a generic framework for establishing the decidability of a wide range of logical entailment problems (briefly called querying), based on the existence of countermodels that are structurally simple, gauged by certain types of width measures (with treewidth and cliquewidth as popular examples). As an important special case of our framework, we identify logics exhibiting width-finite finitely universal model sets, warranting decidable entailment for a wide range of homomorphism-closed queries, subsuming a diverse set of practically relevant query languages. As a particularly powerful width measure, we propose to employ Blumensath's partitionwidth, which subsumes various other commonly considered width measures and exhibits highly favorable computational and structural properties. Focusing on the formalism of existential rules as a popular showcase, we explain how finite partitionwidth sets of rules subsume other known abstract decidable classes but - leveraging existing notions of stratification - also cover a wide range of new rulesets. We expose natural limitations for fitting the class of finite unification sets into our picture and suggest several options for remedy.</description>

      <title>Cost-sharing in Parking Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12265v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the total displacement statistic of parking functions from the perspective of cooperative game theory. We introduce parking games, which are coalitional cost-sharing games in characteristic function form derived from the total displacement statistic. We show that parking games are supermodular cost-sharing games, indicating that cooperation is difficult (i.e., their core is empty). Next, we study their Shapley value, which formalizes a notion of "fair" cost-sharing and amounts to charging each car for its expected marginal displacement under a random arrival order. Our main contribution is a polynomial-time algorithm to compute the Shapley value of parking games, in contrast with known hardness results on computing the Shapley value of arbitrary games. The algorithm leverages the permutation-invariance of total displacement, combinatorial enumeration, and dynamic programming. We conclude with open questions around an alternative solution concept for supermodular cost-sharing games and connections to other areas in combinatorics.</description>

      <title>A concentration phenomenon for $h$-extra edge-connectivity reliability analysis of enhanced hypercubes Q_{n,2} with exponentially many faulty links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17150v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reliability assessment of interconnection networks is critical to the design and maintenance of multiprocessor systems. The $(n, k)$-enhanced hypercube $Q_{n,k}$, as a variation of the hypercube $Q_{n}$, was proposed by Tzeng and Wei in 1991. As an extension of traditional edge-connectivity, $h$-extra edge-connectivity of a connected graph $G,$ $\lambda_h(G),$ is an essential parameter for evaluating the reliability of interconnection networks. This article intends to study the $h$-extra edge-connectivity of the $(n,2)$-enhanced hypercube $Q_{n,2}$. Supposing that the link malfunction of an interconnection network $Q_{n,2}$ does not isolate any subnetwork with no more than $h-1$ processors, the minimum number of these possible faulty links concentrate on a constant $2^{n-1}$ for each integer $\lceil\frac{11\times2^{n-1}}{48}\rceil \leq h \leq 2^{n-1}$ and $n\geq 9$. That is, for about $77.083$ percent values of $h\leq2^{n-1},$ the corresponding $h$-extra edge-connectivity of $Q_{n,2}$, $\lambda_h(Q_{n,2})$, presents a concentration phenomenon. Moreover, the above lower and upper bounds of $h$ are both tight.</description>

      <title>Orientable and negative orientable sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00672v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Analogously to de Bruijn sequences, orientable sequences have application in automatic position-location applications and, until recently, studies of these sequences focused on the binary case. In recent work by Alhakim et al., a range of methods of construction were described for orientable sequences over arbitrary finite alphabets; some of these methods involve using negative orientable sequences as a building block. In this paper we describe three techniques for generating such negative orientable sequences, as well as upper bounds on their period. We then go on to show how these negative orientable sequences can be used to generate orientable sequences with period close to the maximum possible for every non-binary alphabet size and for every tuple length. In doing so we use two closely related approaches described by Alhakim et al.</description>
