      <title>Scalable quantum dynamics compilation via quantum machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum dynamics compilation is an important task for improving quantum simulation efficiency: It aims to synthesize multi-qubit target dynamics into a circuit consisting of as few elementary gates as possible. Compared to deterministic methods such as Trotterization, variational quantum compilation (VQC) methods employ variational optimization to reduce gate costs while maintaining high accuracy. In this work, we explore the potential of a VQC scheme by making use of out-of-distribution generalization results in quantum machine learning (QML): By learning the action of a given many-body dynamics on a small data set of product states, we can obtain a unitary circuit that generalizes to highly entangled states such as the Haar random states. The efficiency in training allows us to use tensor network methods to compress such time-evolved product states by exploiting their low entanglement features. Our approach exceeds state-of-the-art compilation results in both system size and accuracy in one dimension ($1$D). For the first time, we extend VQC to systems on two-dimensional (2D) strips with a quasi-1D treatment, demonstrating a significant resource advantage over standard Trotterization methods, highlighting the method's promise for advancing quantum simulation tasks on near-term quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the Energy Gap of Random Graph Problems via XX-catalysts in Quantum Annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the bottlenecks in solving combinatorial optimisation problems using quantum annealers is the emergence of exponentially-closing energy gaps between the ground state and the first excited state during the annealing, which indicates that a first-order phase transition is taking place. The minimum energy gap scales inversely with the exponential of the system size, ultimately resulting in an exponentially large time required to ensure the adiabatic evolution. In this paper we demonstrate that employing multiple XX-catalysts on all the edges of a graph upon which a MWIS (Maximum Weighted Independent Set) problem is defined significantly enhances the minimum energy gap. Remarkably, our analysis shows that the more severe the first-order phase transition, the more effective the catalyst is in opening the gap. This result is based on a detailed statistical analysis performed on a large number of randomly generated MWIS problem instances on both Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi and Barab\'asi-Albert graphs. We also observe that similar performance cannot be achieved by the non-stoquastic version of the same catalyst, with the stoquastic catalyst being the preferred choice in this context.</description>

      <title>Deep Circuit Compression for Quantum Dynamics via Tensor Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic quantum simulation is a leading application for achieving quantum advantage. However, high circuit depths remain a limiting factor on near-term quantum hardware. We present a compilation algorithm based on Matrix Product Operators for generating compressed circuits enabling real-time simulation on digital quantum computers, that for a given depth are more accurate than all Trotterizations of the same depth. By the efficient use of environment tensors, the algorithm is scalable in depth beyond prior work, and we present circuit compilations of up to 64 layers of $SU(4)$ gates. Surpassing only 1D circuits, our approach can flexibly target a particular quasi-2D gate topology. We demonstrate this by compiling a 52-qubit 2D Transverse-Field Ising propagator onto the IBM Heavy-Hex topology. For all circuit depths and widths tested, we produce circuits with smaller errors than all equivalent depth Trotter unitaries, corresponding to reductions in error by up to 4 orders of magnitude and circuit depth compressions with a factor of over 6.</description>

      <title>The multimode nature of spacetime entanglement in QFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the presence of multimode entanglement in the vacuum state of a free, massless scalar quantum field in four-dimensional flat spacetime between two sets of field modes, each contained within a spacetime region that is causally disconnected from the other. This is true despite the fact that entanglement between pairs of individual field modes is sparse and appears only when the two individual modes are carefully selected. Our results reveal that, while entanglement between individual modes is limited, bipartite multimode entanglement in quantum field theory is ubiquitous. We further argue that such multimode entanglement is operationally extractable, and it forms the basis of the entanglement commonly discussed in entanglement harvesting protocols.</description>

      <title>Exact gradients for linear optics with single photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Though parameter shift rules have drastically improved gradient estimation methods for several types of quantum circuits, leading to improved performance in downstream tasks, so far they have not been transferable to linear optics with single photons. In this work, we derive an analytical formula for the gradients in these circuits with respect to phaseshifters via a generalized parameter shift rule, where the number of parameter shifts depends linearly on the total number of photons. Experimentally, this enables access to derivatives in photonic systems without the need for finite difference approximations. Building on this, we propose two strategies through which one can reduce the number of shifts in the expression, and hence reduce the overall sample complexity. Numerically, we show that this generalized parameter-shift rule can converge to the minimum of a cost function with fewer parameter update steps than alternative techniques. We anticipate that this method will open up new avenues to solving optimization problems with photonic systems, as well as provide new techniques for the experimental characterization and control of linear optical systems.</description>

      <title>Phase-space gaussian ensemble quantum camouflage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extending the phase-space description of the Weyl-Wigner quantum mechanics to a subset of non-linear Hamiltonians in position and momentum, gaussian functions are identified as the quantum ground state. Once a Hamiltonian, $H^{W}(q,\,p)$, is constrained by the $\partial ^2 H^{W} / \partial q \partial p = 0$ condition, flow properties for generic $1$-dim systems can be analytically obtained in terms of Wigner functions and Wigner currents. For gaussian statistical ensembles, the exact phase-space profile of the quantum fluctuations over the classical trajectories are found, so to interpret them as a suitable Hilbert space state configuration for confronting quantum and classical regimes. In particular, a sort of {\em quantum camouflage} where the stationarity of classical statistical ensembles can be camouflaged by the stationarity of gaussian quantum ensembles is identified. Besides the broadness of the framework worked out in some previous examples, our results provide an encompassing picture of quantum effects on non-linear dynamical systems which can be interpreted as a first step for finding the complete spectrum of non-standard Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>The Influence of Quantum Correlation on the Holonomy of Spatially-Structured Photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The manifestation of entanglement within geometric phase is elucidated for spatially-structured photons. It is shown that entanglement parameters manifest in two distinct ways: through statistical superpositions of separable states; and via quantum correlation. It is the latter that is truer to the core idea of entanglement, but the two influences are inherently intertwined within geometric phase. This motivates the construction of a projective, gauge-invariant measure that allows the manifestation of quantum correlation to be pinpointed and explained. An optical circuit consisting of a pair of misoriented optical mode converters gives a practical demonstration of its utility. Its implementation as an analytical simulation is facilitated by a novel pump engineering method which produces photon pairs with tunable entanglement.</description>

      <title>Quantum Probability via the Method of Arbitrary Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to apply the collection of mathematical tools known as the "method of arbitrary functions" to analyze how probability arises from quantum dynamics. We argue that in a toy model of quantum measurement the Born rule probabilities can be derived from the unitary Schr\"odinger dynamics when certain dynamical parameters are treated as themselves random variables with initial probability distributions. Specifically, we study the perturbed double well model, in which the perturbation is treated as a random variable, and we show that for arbitrary initial distributions within a certain class, the dynamics yields the Born rule probabilities in the joint limits given by long times and small values of Planck's constant (the classical limit). Our results establish the Born rule as a type of universal limiting behavior that is independent of the precise initial dynamical parameters.</description>

      <title>A Butterfly Effect in Encoding-Decoding Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of information scrambling has profoundly deepened our understanding of many-body quantum systems. Much recent research has been devote to understanding the interplay between scrambling and decoherence in open systems. Continuing in this vein, we investigate scrambling in a noisy encoding-decoding circuit model. Specifically, we consider an $L$-qubit circuit consisting of a Haar-random unitary, followed by noise acting on a subset of qubits, and then by the inverse unitary. Scrambling is measured using the bipartite algebraic out-of-time-order correlator ($\mathcal{A}$-OTOC), which allows us to track information spread between extensively sized subsystems. We derive an analytic expression for the $\mathcal{A}$-OTOC that depends on system size and noise strength. In the thermodynamic limit, this system displays a \textit{butterfly effect} in which infinitesimal noise induces macroscopic information scrambling. We also perform numerical simulations while relaxing the condition of Haar-randomness, which preliminarily suggest that this effect may manifest in a larger set of circuits.</description>

      <title>Random ensembles of symplectic and unitary states are indistinguishable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A unitary state $t$-design is an ensemble of pure quantum states whose moments match up to the $t$-th order those of states uniformly sampled from a $d$-dimensional Hilbert space. Typically, unitary state $t$-designs are obtained by evolving some reference pure state with unitaries from an ensemble that forms a design over the unitary group $\mathbb{U}(d)$, as unitary designs induce state designs. However, in this work we study whether Haar random symplectic states -- i.e., states obtained by evolving some reference state with unitaries sampled according to the Haar measure over $\mathbb{SP}(d/2)$ -- form unitary state $t$-designs. Importantly, we recall that random symplectic unitaries fail to be unitary designs for $t&gt;1$, and that, while it is known that symplectic unitaries are universal, this does not imply that their Haar measure leads to a state design. Notably, our main result states that Haar random symplectic states form unitary $t$-designs for all $t$, meaning that their distribution is unconditionally indistinguishable from that of unitary Haar random states, even with tests that use infinite copies of each state. As such, our work showcases the intriguing possibility of creating state $t$-designs using ensembles of unitaries which do not constitute designs over $\mathbb{U}(d)$ themselves, such as ensembles that form $t$-designs over $\mathbb{SP}(d/2)$.</description>

      <title>Quantum error correction-inspired multiparameter quantum metrology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel strategy for obtaining optimal probe states and measurement schemes in a class of noiseless multiparameter estimation problems with symmetry among the generators. The key to the framework is the introduction of a set of quantum metrology conditions, analogous to the quantum error correction conditions of Knill and Laflamme, which are utilized to identify probe states that saturate the multiparameter quantum Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound. Similar to finding two-dimensional irreps for encoding a logical qubit in error correction, we identify trivial irreps of finite groups that guarantee the satisfaction of the quantum metrology conditions. To demonstrate our framework, we analyze the SU(2) estimation with symmetric states in which three parameters define a global rotation of an ensemble of $N$ qubits. For even $N$, we find that tetrahedral symmetry and, with fine-tuning, $S_{3}$ symmetry, are minimal symmetry groups providing optimal probe states for SU(2) estimation, but that the quantum metrology conditions can also be satisfied in an entanglement-assisted setting by using a maximally entangled state of two spin-$N/2$ representations for any $N$. By extending the multiparameter method of moments to non-commuting observables, we use the quantum metrology conditions to construct a measurement scheme that saturates the multiparameter quantum Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound for small rotation angles.</description>

      <title>Hard Quantum Extrapolations in Quantum Cryptography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although one-way functions are well-established as the minimal primitive for classical cryptography, a minimal primitive for quantum cryptography is still unclear. Universal extrapolation, first considered by Impagliazzo and Levin (1990), is hard if and only if one-way functions exist. Towards better understanding minimal assumptions for quantum cryptography, we study the quantum analogues of the universal extrapolation task. Specifically, we put forth the classical$\rightarrow$quantum extrapolation task, where we ask to extrapolate the rest of a bipartite pure state given the first register measured in the computational basis. We then use it as a key component to establish new connections in quantum cryptography: (a) quantum commitments exist if classical$\rightarrow$quantum extrapolation is hard; and (b) classical$\rightarrow$quantum extrapolation is hard if any of the following cryptographic primitives exists: quantum public-key cryptography (such as quantum money and signatures) with a classical public key or 2-message quantum key distribution protocols.
  For future work, we further generalize the extrapolation task and propose a fully quantum analogue. We observe that it is hard if quantum commitments exist, and it is easy for quantum polynomial space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the behavior of light as it passes through systems composed of polarizing filters at different angular orientations. The analysis is initially conducted in the context of classical optics, using Malus's Law to calculate the transmitted intensity for the cases of two perpendicular filters (0 and 90 degrees) and three filters (0, 45, and 90 degrees). We then apply quantum mechanics to describe the phenomenon using state notation and the probabilistic interpretation of the projection of the polarization states of photons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data privacy and authentication are two main security requirements for remote access and cloud services. While QKD has been explored to address data privacy concerns, oftentimes its use is separate from the client authentication protocol despite implicitly providing authentication. Here, we present a quantum authentication key expansion (QAKE) protocol that (1) integrates both authentication and key expansion within a single protocol, and (2) provides key recycling property -- allowing all authentication keys to be reused. We analyse the security of the protocol in a QAKE framework adapted from a classical authentication key exchange (AKE) framework, providing separate security conditions for authentication and data privacy. An experimental implementation of the protocol, with appropriate post-selection, was performed to demonstrate its feasibility.</description>

      <title>Amplifying hybrid entangled states and superpositions of coherent states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compare two amplification schemes, photon addition and then subtraction ($\hat{a}\hat{a}^\dagger$) and successive photon addition ($\hat{a}^\dagger{}^2$), applied to hybrid entangled states (HESs) and superpositions of coherent states (SCSs). We show that the amplification schemes' fidelity and gain for HESs are the same as those of coherent states. On the other hand, SCSs show quite nontrivial behaviors by the amplification schemes, depending on the amplitudes of coherent states, number of coherent-state components, and relative phases between the components. This implies that appropriate amplification schemes for SCSs should be chosen depending on the tasks and specific forms of the states. To investigate the quality of amplified states, we calculate the quantum Fisher information, a measure of quantum phase estimation. In terms of the quantum Fisher information, the $\hat{a}\hat{a}^\dagger$ scheme tends to show better performance for relatively small amplitudes while the $\hat{a}^\dagger{}^2$ scheme is better in larger amplitude regime. The performance of the two schemes becomes indistinguishable as the amplitude grows sufficiently large.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study ergotropy, the maximum unitarily extractable work from a system, in two quantum chaotic models: the quantum kicked top and the kicked Ising spin chain. In an ancilla-assisted scenario, chaos enhances ergotropy when the state is known, a consequence of large entanglement production in the chaotic regime. In contrast, we establish a negative correlation between chaos and work when the state is unknown. The downside arises from chaos impeding information gain of the system from coarse-grained measurements. When both entanglement and coarse-grained measurements are present, there is competition between the two, and the ergotropy initially increases, followed by a decrease at larger kick-strengths.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Quantum Neural Network for Split Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) is an emerging field of research with potential applications to distributed collaborative learning, such as Split Learning (SL). SL allows resource-constrained clients to collaboratively train ML models with a server, reduce their computational overhead, and enable data privacy by avoiding raw data sharing. Although QML with SL has been studied, the problem remains open in resource-constrained environments where clients lack quantum computing capabilities. Additionally, data privacy leakage between client and server in SL poses risks of reconstruction attacks on the server side. To address these issues, we propose Hybrid Quantum Split Learning (HQSL), an application of Hybrid QML in SL. HQSL enables classical clients to train models with a hybrid quantum server and curtails reconstruction attacks. In addition, we introduce a novel qubit-efficient data-loading technique for designing a quantum layer in HQSL, minimizing both the number of qubits and circuit depth. Experiments on five datasets demonstrate HQSL's feasibility and ability to enhance classification performance compared to its classical models. Notably, HQSL achieves mean improvements of over 3% in both accuracy and F1-score for the Fashion-MNIST dataset, and over 1.5% in both metrics for the Speech Commands dataset. We expand these studies to include up to 100 clients, confirming HQSL's scalability. Moreover, we introduce a noise-based defense mechanism to tackle reconstruction attacks on the server side. Overall, HQSL enables classical clients to collaboratively train their models with a hybrid quantum server, leveraging quantum advantages while improving model performance and security against data privacy leakage-related reconstruction attacks.</description>

      <title>Heralded optical entanglement distribution via lossy quantum channels: A comparative study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement serves as a foundational resource for various quantum technologies. In optical systems, entanglement distribution rely on the indistinguishability and spatial overlap of photons. Heralded schemes play a crucial role in ensuring the reliability of entanglement generation by detecting ancillary photons to signal the creation of desired entangled states. However, photon losses in quantum channels remain a significant challenge, limiting the distance and capacity of entanglement distributions. This study suggests three heralded schemes that distribute multipartite Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states via lossy quantum channels. These schemes utilize different photon sources (Bell states or single-photons) and channel structures (centralized or decentralized heralding detectors). By comparing success probabilities and heralding efficiency, we find that each scheme has its own advantage according to the number of parties and the channel distance and the security requirement. This analysis provides insights into designing resilient heralded circuits for quantum information processing over lossy channels.</description>

      <title>Trotter error time scaling separation via commutant decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suppressing the Trotter error in dynamical quantum simulation typically requires running deeper circuits, posing a great challenge for noisy near-term quantum devices. Studies have shown that the empirical error is usually much smaller than the one suggested by existing bounds, implying the actual circuit cost required is much less than the ones based on those bounds. Here, we improve the estimate of the Trotter error over existing bounds, by introducing a general framework of commutant decomposition that separates disjoint error components that have fundamentally different scaling with time. In particular we identify two error components that each scale as $\mathcal{O}(t^{p+1}/r^p)$ and $\mathcal{O}(t^p/r^p)$ for a $p$th-order product formula evolving to time $t$ using $r$ partitions. Under a fixed step size $t/r$, it implies one would scale linearly with time $t$ and the other would be constant of $t$. We show that this formalism not only straightforwardly reproduces previous results but also provides a better error estimate for higher-order product formulas. We demonstrate the improvement both analytically and numerically. We also apply the analysis to observable error relating to the heating in Floquet dynamics and thermalization, which is of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Fast unconditional reset and leakage reduction in fixed-frequency transmon qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The realization of fault-tolerant quantum computing requires the execution of quantum error-correction (QEC) schemes, to mitigate the fragile nature of qubits. In this context, to ensure the success of QEC, a protocol capable of implementing both qubit reset and leakage reduction is highly desirable. We demonstrate such a protocol in an architecture consisting of fixed-frequency transmon qubits pair-wise coupled via tunable couplers -- an architecture that is compatible with the surface code. We use tunable couplers to transfer any undesired qubit excitation to the readout resonator of the qubit, from which this excitation decays into the feedline. In total, the combination of qubit reset, leakage reduction, and coupler reset takes only 83ns to complete. Our reset scheme is fast, unconditional, and achieves fidelities well above 99%, thus enabling fixed-frequency qubit architectures as future implementations of fault-tolerant quantum computers. Our protocol also provides a means to both reduce QEC cycle runtime and improve algorithmic fidelity on quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Atom Detection Algorithms for Neutral Atom Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In neutral atom quantum computers, readout and preparation of the atomic qubits are usually based on fluorescence imaging and subsequent analysis of the acquired image. For each atom site, the brightness or some comparable metric is estimated and used to predict the presence or absence of an atom. Across different setups, we can see a vast number of different approaches used to analyze these images. Often, the choice of detection algorithm is either not mentioned at all or it is not justified. We investigate several different algorithms and compare their performance in terms of both precision and execution run time. To do so, we rely on a set of synthetic images across different simulated exposure times with known occupancy states. Since the use of simulation provides us with the ground truth of atom site occupancy, we can easily state precise error rates and variances of the reconstructed property. To also rule out the possibility of better algorithms existing, we calculated the Cram\'er-Rao bound in order to establish an upper limit that even a perfect estimator cannot outperform. As the metric of choice, we used the number of photonelectrons that can be contributed to a specific atom site. Since the bound depends on the occupancy of neighboring sites, we provide the best and worst cases, as well as a half filled one. Our comparison shows that of our tested algorithms, a global non-linear least-squares solver that uses the optical system's PSF to return a each sites' number of photoelectrons performed the best, on average crossing the worst-case bound for longer exposure times. Its main drawback is its huge computational complexity and, thus, required calculation time. We manage to somewhat reduce this problem, suggesting that its use may be viable. However, our study also shows that for cases where utmost speed is required, simple algorithms may be preferable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fast and scalable scheme for multi-qubit resetting in superconducting quantum processors is proposed by exploiting the feasibility of frequency-tunable transmon qubits and transmon-like couplers to engineer a full programmable superconducting erasing head. The scalability of the device is verified by simultaneously resetting two qubits, where we show that collectivity effects may emerge as an fundamental ingredient to speed up the erasing process. Conversely, we also describe the appearance of decoherence-free subspace in multi-qubit chips, causing it to damage the device performance. To overcome this problem, a special set of parameters for the tunable frequency coupler is proposed, which allows us to erase even states within such subspace. To end, we offer a proposal to buildup integrated superconducting processors that can be efficiently connected to erasure heads in a scalable way.</description>

      <title>Non-stabilizerness Entanglement Entropy: a measure of hardness in the classical simulation of quantum many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical and quantum states can be distinguished by entanglement entropy, which can be viewed as a measure of quantum resources. Entanglement entropy also plays a pivotal role in understanding computational complexity in simulating quantum systems. However, stabilizer states formed solely by Clifford gates can be efficiently simulated with the tableau algorithm according to the Gottesman-Knill theorem, although they can host large entanglement entropy. In this work, we introduce the concept of non-stabilizerness entanglement entropy which is basically the minimum residual entanglement entropy for a quantum state by excluding the contribution from Clifford circuits. It can serve as a new practical and better measure of difficulty in the classical simulation of quantum many-body systems. We discuss why it is a better criterion than previously proposed metrics such as Stabilizer R\'enyi Entropy. We also show numerical results of non-stabilizerness entanglement entropy with concrete quantum many-body models. The concept of non-stabilizerness entanglement entropy expands our understanding of the ``hardness`` in the classical simulation of quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Space-Based Quantum Internet: Entanglement Distribution in Time-Varying LEO Constellations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the complexities of entanglement distribution in LEO satellite networks, particularly those arising from their dynamic topology. Traditional static and dynamic entanglement distribution methods often result in high entanglement drop rates and reduced end-to-end throughput. We introduce a novel framework that leverages the dynamic nature of LEO satellite networks to enhance entanglement distribution efficiency. Employing a space-time graph model to represent the network's temporal evolution, we propose an entanglement distribution strategy based on path utility, incorporating pointing errors, non-ideal link transmittance for intersatellite links, and atmospheric effects for downlinks. Our approach demonstrates superior performance in reducing entanglement drop rates and improving throughput compared to conventional methods. This study advances the field of quantum communication in satellite networks, offering resilient and efficient entanglement distribution strategies that support practical applications such as distributed computing, quantum multipartite cryptography, and distributed quantum sensing. The findings underscore the potential of integrating dynamic satellite networks with quantum technologies to create a reliable and secure quantum internet.</description>

      <title>Susceptibility Formulation of Density Matrix Perturbation Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Density matrix perturbation theory based on recursive Fermi-operator expansions provides a computationally efficient framework for time-independent response calculations in quantum chemistry and materials science. From a perturbation in the Hamiltonian we can calculate the first-order perturbation in the density matrix, which then gives us the linear response in the expectation values for some chosen set of observables. Here we present an alternative, {\it dual} formulation, where we instead calculate the static susceptibility of an observable, which then gives us the linear response in the expectation values for any number of different Hamiltonian perturbations. We show how the calculation of the susceptibility can be performed with the same expansion schemes used in recursive density matrix perturbation theory, including generalizations to fractional occupation numbers and self-consistent linear response calculations, i.e. similar to density functional perturbation theory. As with recursive density matrix perturbation theory, the dual susceptibility formulation is well suited for numerically thresholded sparse matrix algebra, which has linear scaling complexity for sufficiently large sparse systems. Similarly, the recursive computation of the susceptibility also seamlessly integrates with the computational framework of deep neural networks used in artificial intelligence (AI) applications. This integration enables the calculation of quantum response properties that can leverage cutting-edge AI-hardware, such as Nvidia Tensor cores or Google Tensor Processing Units. We demonstrate performance for recursive susceptibility calculations using Nvidia Graphics Processing Units and Tensor cores.</description>

      <title>Extracting Dynamical Maps of Non-Markovian Open Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The most general description of quantum evolution up to a time $\tau$ is a completely positive tracing preserving map known as a dynamical map $\hat{\Lambda}(\tau)$. Here we consider $\hat{\Lambda}(\tau)$ arising from suddenly coupling a system to one or more thermal baths with a strength that is neither weak nor strong. Given no clear separation of characteristic system/bath time scales $\hat{\Lambda}(\tau)$ is generically expected to be non-Markovian, however we do assume the ensuing dynamics has a unique steady state implying the baths possess a finite memory time $\tau_{\rm m}$. By combining several techniques within a tensor network framework we directly and accurately extract $\hat{\Lambda}(\tau)$ for a small number of interacting fermionic modes coupled to infinite non-interacting Fermi baths. We employ the Choi-Jamiolkowski isomorphism so that $\hat{\Lambda}(\tau)$ can be fully reconstructed from a single pure state calculation of the unitary dynamics of the system, bath and their replica auxillary modes up to time $\tau$. From $\hat{\Lambda}(\tau)$ we also compute the time local propagator $\hat{\mathcal{L}}(\tau)$. By examining the convergence with $\tau$ of the instantaneous fixed points of these objects we establish their respective memory times $\tau^{\Lambda}_{\rm m}$ and $\tau^{\mathcal{L}}_{\rm m}$. Beyond these times, the propagator $\hat{\mathcal{L}}(\tau)$ and dynamical map $\hat{\Lambda}(\tau)$ accurately describe all the subsequent long-time relaxation dynamics up to stationarity. Our numerical examples of interacting spinless Fermi chains and the single impurity Anderson model demonstrate regimes where our approach can offer a significant speedup in determining the stationary state compared to directly simulating the long-time limit.</description>

      <title>Polarization-encoded quantum key distribution with a room-temperature telecom single-photon emitter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single photon sources (SPSs) are directly applicable in quantum key distribution (QKD) because they allow the implementation of the canonical BB84 protocol. To date, QKD implementations using SPS are not widespread because of the need for cryogenic operation, or frequency conversion to a wavelength efficiently transmitted over telecommunication fibers. We report an observation of polarization-encoded QKD using a room-temperature telecom SPS based on a GaN defect. A field test over 3.5 km of deployed fiber with 4.0 dB loss yielded a secure key rate of 585.9~bps. Further testing in a 32.5 km fiber spool (attenuation of 11.2 dB), which exhibited substantially lower polarization mode dispersion, yielded a secure key rate of 50.4 bps. Both results exhibited a quantum bit error rate (QBER) of approximately 5%. These results illustrate the potential of the GaN defects for supporting polarization-encoded quantum communication.</description>

      <title>Against (unitary) interpretation (of quantum mechanics): removing the metaphysical load</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics is a science. Thus a statement can be treated as its "law" only if it agrees with our experience of the World/Nature (this includes our experiments). Statements which are fundamentally untestable are hypotheses which belong to metaphysics. Such are all interpretations of quantum mechanics, which attribute to its mathematical tools meanings that are beyond experimentally observable events, while not affecting quantum predictions of these events.
  We show that "unitary quantum mechanics", which according to its followers leads to some interesting paradoxes, is an interpretation of quantum mechanics, based on hypotheses that are untestable. The (operational) quantum mechanics, which is the one tested in every quantum experiment is free of these paradoxes.
  The root of "unitary" vs. operational discrepancy is that the latter treats the measurement process as irreversible, and in the different answers to the question of what is described by the state vector.
  The clearest manifestation of this is the insistence of the supporters of "unitary quantum mechanics" that measurements can be "in principle undone". "Unitarists" also try to avoid the postmeasurement state vector collapse at any cost, including no attempt to describe it, but still accept the Born rule as a calculational tool.
  Ipso facto, the hypothesis of "in principle possibility of undoing measurements" belongs to metaphysics, as it is untestable. In the case of predictions of factual events in the laboratories the ``unitary" quantum mechanics agrees with the operational one. It shares this property with all interpretations of quantum mechanics which do not affect its predictions. Metaphysics begins when one requests that quantum mechanics should be more than a mathematically formulated theory which predicts future observable events of a certain class basing on events observed earlier (of the same class).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement plays a crucial role not only in understanding Hermitian many-body systems but also in offering valuable insights into non-Hermitian quantum systems. In this paper, we analytically investigate the entanglement Hamiltonian and entanglement energy spectrum of a non-Hermitian spin ladder using perturbation theory in the biorthogonal basis. Specifically, we examine the entanglement properties between coupled non-Hermitian quantum spin chains. In the strong coupling limit ($J_\mathrm{rung}\gg1$), first-order perturbation theory reveals that the entanglement Hamiltonian closely resembles the single-chain Hamiltonian with renormalized coupling strengths, allowing for the definition of an ad hoc temperature. Our findings provide new insights into quantum entanglement in non-Hermitian systems and offer a foundation for developing novel algorithms, such as applying finite-temperature Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) to non-Hermitian quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Effective (Floquet) Lindblad generators from spectral unwinding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A mathematical description of the reduced dynamics of an open quantum system can often be given in terms of a completely positive and trace preserving (CPTP) map, also known as quantum channel. In a seminal work by Wolf et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 101, 150402 (2008)], it was shown that deciding whether a given quantum channel was generated from an underlying effective Markovian dynamics, with time-independent Lindbladian generator, is generally an NP-hard problem. In this work we show that in cases where one has access to the full reduced dynamics at all previous times (the dynamical map) one can significantly facilitate the search for an effective generator by making use of Floquet theory. By performing a spectral unwinding such that the effective micromotion is minimized, the effective Floquet generator is often an excellent candidate for an effective Lindblad generator, hence significantly reducing the complexity of the search for an effective Lindblad generator in many (though not all) cases. Our results are relevant for engineering Floquet Lindbladians in complex many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Long-distance device-independent quantum key distribution using single-photon entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Device-independent quantum key distribution (DIQKD) provides the strongest form of quantum security, as it allows two honest users to establish secure communication channels even when using fully uncharacterized quantum devices. The security proof of DIQKD is derived from the violation of a Bell inequality, mitigating side-channel attacks by asserting the presence of nonlocality. This enhanced security comes at the cost of a challenging implementation, especially over long distances, as losses make Bell tests difficult to conduct successfully. Here, we propose a photonic realization of DIQKD, utilizing a heralded preparation of a single-photon path entangled state between the honest users. Being based on single-photon interference effects, the obtained secret key rate scales with the square root of the quantum channel transmittance. This leads to positive key rates over distances of up to hundreds of kilometers, making the proposed setup a promising candidate for securing long-distance communication in quantum networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin systems have been extensively studied to understand the mechanisms of quantum batteries, which have shown the ability to charge faster than classical counterparts, even in closed systems. However, the internal dynamics of quantum batteries can significantly affect their performance, making it crucial to understand the influence of various parameters. In this study, we focus on the XY Z Heisenberg spin system, examining key factors such as anisotropy in spin interactions and external magnetic field to optimize work output to ensure effective charging.</description>

      <title>Quantum Advantage in Distributed Sensing with Noisy Quantum Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that quantum advantage in distributed sensing can be achieved with noisy quantum networks. When using depolarized GHZ states as the probe, we derive a closed-form fidelity threshold to achieve advantage over the optimal local sensing strategy. The threshold indicates that while entanglement is needed for this quantum advantage, genuine multipartite entanglement is generally unnecessary. We further explore the impacts from imperfect local entanglement generation and local measurement constraint, and our results imply that the quantum advantage is more robust against quantum network imperfections than local operation errors. Finally, we demonstrate that the quantum advantage in distributed sensing can be achieved with a three-node quantum network using practical protocol stacks through simulations with SeQUeNCe, an open-source, customizable quantum network simulator.</description>

      <title>Visualizing Dynamics of Charges and Strings in (2+1)D Lattice Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lattice gauge theories (LGTs) can be employed to understand a wide range of phenomena, from elementary particle scattering in high-energy physics to effective descriptions of many-body interactions in materials. Studying dynamical properties of emergent phases can be challenging as it requires solving many-body problems that are generally beyond perturbative limits. We investigate the dynamics of local excitations in a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGT using a two-dimensional lattice of superconducting qubits. We first construct a simple variational circuit which prepares low-energy states that have a large overlap with the ground state; then we create particles with local gates and simulate their quantum dynamics via a discretized time evolution. As the effective magnetic field is increased, our measurements show signatures of transitioning from deconfined to confined dynamics. For confined excitations, the magnetic field induces a tension in the string connecting them. Our method allows us to experimentally image string dynamics in a (2+1)D LGT from which we uncover two distinct regimes inside the confining phase: for weak confinement the string fluctuates strongly in the transverse direction, while for strong confinement transverse fluctuations are effectively frozen. In addition, we demonstrate a resonance condition at which dynamical string breaking is facilitated. Our LGT implementation on a quantum processor presents a novel set of techniques for investigating emergent particle and string dynamics.</description>

      <title>Gapped and gapless quantum spin liquids on the ruby lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ruby lattice has been the subject of much interest recently due its realization in Rydberg atom arrays, where its rich variety of frustrated interactions gives rise to topologically ordered quantum spin liquids. Similarly, numerical studies of ruby-lattice spin models, with both isotropic and anisotropic interactions, have provided evidence of gapped and gapless spin-liquid ground states with different low-energy gauge structures. Motivated by these findings, we perform a projective symmetry group (PSG) classification of U(1) and $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ fermionic spinon mean-field theories$\unicode{x2014}$respecting space-group and time-reversal symmetries$\unicode{x2014}$for $S=1/2$ spins. We obtain a total of 50 U(1) and 64 $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ PSGs, and upon restricting their realization via mean-field $\textit{Ans\"atze}$ with up to second-nearest-neighbor singlet amplitudes (relevant to the models studied here), only 8 U(1) and 18 $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ distinct states are obtained. We present the singlet fields for all $\textit{Ans\"atze}$ up to third-nearest-neighboring bonds and discuss their spinon dispersions as well as their dynamical spin structure factors. Building on this information, we also obtain the phase diagram of the Heisenberg model in the presence of first ($J_{1}$), second ($J_{1}'$), and third ($J_{2}$) neighbor antiferromagnetic couplings within a self-consistent mean-field approximation.</description>

      <title>The multi-state geometry of shift current and polarization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum metric and Berry curvature capture essential properties of non-trivial Bloch states and underpin many fascinating phenomena. However, it becomes increasingly evident that a more comprehensive understanding of quantum state geometry is necessary to explain properties involving Bloch states of multiple bands, such as optical transitions. To this end, we employ quantum state projectors to develop an explicitly gauge-invariant formalism and demonstrate its power with applications to non-linear optics and the theory of electronic polarization. We provide a simple expression for the shift current that resolves its precise relation to the moments of electronic polarization, clarifies the treatment of band degeneracies, and reveals its decomposition into the sum of the skewness of the occupied states and intrinsic multi-state geometry. The projector approach is applied to calculate non-linear optical properties of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) layers, using minimal tight-binding models previously calculated by ab initio methods. We close with comments on potential further applications of the projector operator approach to multi-state geometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using modern tools of relativistic quantum information, we compare entanglement of a free, massive scalar field in the Bunch-Davies vacuum in the cosmological patch of de Sitter spacetime with that in Minkowski spacetime. There is less entanglement between spatially localized field modes in de Sitter, despite the fact that there is more entanglement stored in the field on large scales. This shows that inflation does not produce entanglement between local observables.</description>

      <title>Wide-field microwave magnetic field imaging with nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-invasive imaging of microwave (MW) magnetic fields with microscale lateral resolution is pivotal for various applications, such as MW technologies and integrated circuit failure analysis. Diamond nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center magnetometry has emerged as an ideal tool, offering $\mu$m-scale resolution, millimeter-scale field of view, high sensitivity, and non-invasive imaging compatible with diverse samples. However, up until now, it has been predominantly used for imaging of static or low-frequency magnetic fields or, concerning MW field imaging, to directly characterize the same microwave device used to drive the NV spin transitions. In this work we leverage an NV center ensemble in diamond for wide-field imaging of MW magnetic fields generated by a test device employing a differential measurement protocol. The microscope is equipped with a MW loop to induce Rabi oscillations between NV spin states, and the MW field from the device-under-test is measured through local deviations in the Rabi frequency. This differential protocol yields magnetic field maps of a 2.57 GHz MW field with a sensitivity of $\sim$ 9 $\mu$T Hz$^{-1/2}$ for a total measurement duration of $T = 357$ s, covering a $340\times340$ $\mu$m$^2$ field of view with a $\mu$m-scale spatial resolution and a DUT input power dynamic range of 30 dB. This work demonstrates a novel NV magnetometry protocol, based on differential Rabi frequency measurement, that extends NV wide-field imaging capabilities to imaging of weak MW magnetic fields that would be difficult to measure directly through standard NV Rabi magnetometry.</description>

      <title>Simulating black hole quantum dynamics on an optical lattice using the complex Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a low energy model for simulating an analog black hole on an optical lattice using ultracold atoms. Assuming the validity of the holographic principle, we employ the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, which describes a system of randomly infinite range interacting fermions, also conjectured to be an exactly solvable UV-complete model for an extremal black hole in a higher dimensional Anti-de Sitter (AdS) dilaton gravity. At low energies, the SYK model exhibits an emergent conformal symmetry and is dual to the extremal black hole solution in near AdS2 spacetime. Furthermore, we show how the SYK maximally chaotic behaviour at large N limit, found to be dual to a gauge theory in higher dimensions, can also be employed as a non-trivial investigation tool for the holographic principle. The proposed setup is a theoretical platform to realize the SYK model with relevant exotic effects and behaviour at low energies as a highly non-trivial example of the AdS/CFT duality and a framework for studying black holes.</description>

Of these, the sol-gel method yields the most reliable and high-quality X2 phase Y$_{2}$SiO$_{5}$ microcrystals. Absorption and laser site-selective fluorescence measurements of Nd$^{3+}$, Eu$^{3+}$ and Er$^{3+}$ doped material, performed at cryogenic temperatures, indicate that the as-grown microcrystals are of high optical quality with inhomogeneously broadened optical linewidths that are comparable to bulk crystals at similar dopant concentrations.</description>

      <title>Squeezing Quantum States in Three-Dimensional Twisted Crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A fundamental idea in wave mechanics is that propagation in a periodic medium can be described by Bloch waves whose conserved crystal momenta define their transformations when displaced by the set of discrete lattice translations. In ordered materials where incommensurate spatial periods compete, this general principle is rendered ineffective, often with dramatic consequences. Examples are crystals with broken symmetries from charge or spin density waves, quasiperiodic lattices that produce diffraction patterns with crystallographically forbidden point symmetries, and stacks of two-dimensional lattices with a relative rotation (twist) between layers. In special cases when there is a small difference between the competing periods, a useful work-around is a continuum description where a periodic long-wavelength field produces Bragg scattering that coherently mixes short-wavelength carrier waves. In this work, we advocate an alternative approach to study three-dimensional twisted crystals that replaces their spectrally congested momentum-space Bloch band structures with a representation using squeezed coherent states in a Fock space of free-particle vortex states. This reorganization of the Hilbert space highlights the crucial role of the Coriolis force in the equations of motion that leads to unconventional phase space dynamics and edge state structure generic to a family of complex crystals.</description>

Abstract: Using an S-matrix formulation we evaluate the energy and conductance of a Bloch or N\'eel magnetic wall interacting with a one dimensional free electron system via a double exchange interaction. We find that for chemical potential larger than the magnetic interaction the domain wall is greatly deformed towards larger width. For double magnetic wall systems the electronic energy depends on the relative chirality of the domain walls while the conductance is basically independent of it. The energy and conductance are identical for Bloch and N\'eel magnetic domain walls within this prototype model.</description>

      <title>Multipartite information in sparse SYK models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In quantum field theories that admit gravity dual, specific inequalities involving entanglement entropy between arbitrary disjoint spatial regions hold. An example is the negativity of tripartite information. Inspired by this, we investigate the analogous entropy inequalities in Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) and sparse SYK models, which involve the entanglement among different flavors of Majorana fermions rather than spatial entanglement. Sparse SYK models are models where some of the SYK couplings are set to zero. Since these models have been argued to admit gravity duals up to a certain sparseness, it is interesting to see whether the multipartite entanglement structure changes in a sparseness-dependent manner. In the parameter space explored by our numerical analysis, which we performed upto five parties, we find that all entropy inequalities are satisfied for any temperature and degree of sparseness for an arbitrary choice of flavor subregions. In addition, if we plot the multipartite entanglement entropy in terms of purity, the only significant effect of sparseness is to change the range of purity. Thus, we conclude that multipartite information is almost unaffected by sparseness. As a counterexample, we also show that in a vector model of $N$-flavored Majorana fermions which contains no random variables, choices of subregions exist for which the entropy inequalities are violated.</description>

      <title>From angular coefficients to quantum observables: a phenomenological appraisal in di-boson systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the growing interest in accessing the spin structure of multi-boson processes and in measuring quantum entanglement at high energies, we study polarisation and spin-correlation coefficients in di-boson systems. We show that higher-order corrections of QCD and electroweak type, off-shell modelling, and realistic effects such as fiducial selections and neutrino reconstruction are unavoidable to properly determine such coefficients, and consequently to provide a sound interpretation of observables sensitive to quantum entanglement and Bell-inequality violation. Our findings are based on a detailed phenomenological analysis of boson pairs at the LHC, either in inclusive electroweak production or coming from Higgs-boson decays.</description>

      <title>Non-invertible duality defects in one, two, and three dimensions via gauging spatially modulated symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatially modulated symmetries have emerged since the discovery of fractons, which characterize unconventional topological phases with mobility-constrained quasiparticle excitations. On the other hand, non-invertible duality defects have attracted substantial attention in communities of high energy and condensed matter physics due to their deep insight into quantum anomalies and exotic phases of matter. However, the connection between these exotic symmetries and defects has not been fully explored. In this paper, we construct concrete lattice models with non-invertible duality defects via gauging spatially modulated symmetries and investigate their exotic fusion rules. Specifically, we construct spin models with subsystem symmetries or dipole symmetries on one, two, and three-dimensional lattices. Gauging subsystem symmetries leads to non-invertible duality defects whose fusion rules involve $0$-form subsystem charges in two dimensions and higher-form operators that correspond to ``lineon'' excitations (excitations which are mobile along one-dimensional line) in three dimensions. Gauging dipole symmetries leads to non-invertible duality defects with dipole algebras that describe a hierarchical structure between global and dipole charges. Notably, the hierarchical structure of the dual dipole charges is inverted compared with the original ones. Our work provides a unified and systematic analytical framework for constructing exotic duality defects by gauging relevant symmetries.</description>

      <title>Transport properties in a two-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model in Quantum Hall Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the transport properties of a two-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (2D SSH) model in the quantum Hall regime using non-equilibrium Green's function formalism (NEGF). The device Hamiltonian, where the 2D SSH model serves as the channel, is constructed using a nearest-neighbor tight-binding model. The effect of an external perpendicular magnetic field is incorporated into the contacts via Peierls substitution. We observe a transition from a gapped phase to a flat band regime at zero energy by varying the magnetic field. This transition is characterized by the emergence of highly localized states in the bulk or edges, which we observe by calculating local density-of-states (LDOS). We analyze transport in the system along two directions ($x$ and $y$) via transmission measurements, indicating a magnetic field-induced transition from insulating to metallic phase. The study of the energy spectrum of the system shows the formation of Landau levels. Moreover, the quantum number of the non-degenerate and degenerate Landau levels (transmission modes) can be any integer or only an odd integer, depending on diagonal, inter-cell, and intra-cell hopping strengths. From the analysis of the transport properties along $y$-direction, we find that edge modes play a crucial role in facilitating ballistic transport.</description>

      <title>Design and Fabrication of Robust Hybrid Photonic Crystal Cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heterogeneously integrated hybrid photonic crystal cavities enable strong light-matter interactions with solid-state, optically addressable quantum memories. A key challenge to realizing high quality factor (Q) hybrid photonic crystals is the reduced index contrast on the substrate compared to suspended devices in air. This challenge is particularly acute for color centers in diamond because of diamond's high refractive index, which leads to increased scattering loss into the substrate. Here we develop a design methodology for hybrid photonic crystals utilizing a detailed understanding of substrate-mediated loss, which incorporates sensitivity to fabrication errors as a critical parameter. Using this methodology we design robust, high-Q, GaAs-on-diamond photonic crystal cavities, and by optimizing our fabrication procedure we experimentally realize cavities with Q approaching 30,000 at a resonance wavelength of 955 nm.</description>

      <title>Non-collapsing electric readout of arbitrary Andreev qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nondemolition protocols use ancilla qubits to identify the fragile quantum state of a qubit without destroying its encoded information, thus playing a crucial role in nondestructive quantum measurements particularly relevant for quantum error correction. However, the multitude of ancilla preparations, information transfers, and ancilla measurements in these protocols create an intrinsic overhead for information processing. Here we consider an Andreev qubit defined in a quantum-dot Josephson junction and show that the intrinsic time-dependent oscillatory supercurrent arising from the quantum interference of the many-body eigenstates of the Andreev qubit, can be used to probe the qubit itself nondestructively and \textit{without} collapsing its quantum state. This nondestructive and non-collapsing readout of arbitrary superposition states of Andreev qubits avoids ancilla qubits altogether and significantly reduces experimental overhead as no repetitive qubit resetting is needed. Our findings should have an unprecedented impact on advancing research and applications involving Andreev dots, thus positioning them as promising qubit contenders for quantum processing and technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce regular stratified piecewise linear manifolds to describe lattices and investigate the lattice model approach to topological quantum field theory in all dimensions. We introduce the unitary $n+1$ alterfold TQFT and construct it from a linear functional on an $n$-dimensional lattice model on an $n$-sphere satisfying three conditions: reflection positivity, homeomorphic invariance and complete finiteness. A unitary spherical $n$-category is mathematically defined and emerges as the local quantum symmetry of the lattice model. The alterfold construction unifies various constructions of $n+1$ TQFT from $n$-dimensional lattice models and $n$-categories. In particular, we construct a non-invertible unitary 3+1 alterfold TQFT from a linear functional and derive its local quantum symmetry as a unitary spherical 3-category of Ising type with explicit 20j-symbols, so that the scalar invariant of 2-knots in piecewise linear 4-manifolds could be computed explicitly.</description>

Abstract: One key aspect of quantum metrology, measurement incompatibility, is evident only through the simultaneous estimation of multiple parameters. The symmetric logarithmic derivative Cram\'er-Rao bound (SLDCRB), gives the attainable precision, if the optimal measurements for estimating each individual parameter commute. When the optimal measurements do not commute, the SLDCRB is not necessarily attainable. In this regard, the Holevo Cram\'er-Rao bound (HCRB) plays a fundamental role, providing the ultimate attainable precisions when one allows simultaneous measurements on infinitely many copies of a quantum state. For practical purposes, the Nagaoka Cram\'er-Rao bound (NCRB) is more relevant, applying when restricted to measuring quantum states individually. The interplay between these three bounds dictates how rapidly the ultimate metrological precisions can be approached through collective measurements on finite copies of the probe state. We first consider two parameter estimation and prove that if the HCRB cannot be saturated with a single copy of the probe state, then it cannot be saturated for any finite number of copies of the probe state. With this, we show that it is impossible to saturate the HCRB for several physically motivated problems. For estimating any number of parameters, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the attainability of the SLDCRB with separable measurements. We further prove that if the SLDCRB cannot be reached with a single copy of the probe state, it cannot be reached with collective measurements on any finite number of copies of the probe state. These results together provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the attainability of the SLDCRB for any finite number of copies of the probe state. This solves a significant generalisation of one of the five problems recently highlighted by [P.Horodecki et al, Phys. Rev. X Quantum 3, 010101 (2022)].</description>

      <title>Simulating the quantum Fourier transform, Grover's algorithm, and the quantum counting algorithm with limited entanglement using tensor-networks</title>

Abstract: Quantum algorithms reformulate computational problems as quantum evolutions in a large Hilbert space. Most quantum algorithms assume that the time-evolution is perfectly unitary and that the full Hilbert space is available. However, in practice, the available entanglement may be limited, leading to a reduced fidelity of the quantum algorithms. To simulate the execution of quantum algorithms with limited entanglement, tensor-network methods provide a useful framework, since they allow us to restrict the entanglement in a quantum circuit. Thus, we here use tensor-networks to analyze the fidelity of the quantum Fourier transform, Grover's algorithm, and the quantum counting algorithm as the entanglement is reduced, and we map out the entanglement that is generated during the execution of each algorithm. In all three cases, we find that the algorithms can be executed with high fidelity even if the entanglement is somewhat reduced. Our results are promising for the execution of these algorithms on future quantum computers, and our simulation method based on tensor networks may also be applied to other quantum algorithms.</description>

Abstract: In order to characterize and benchmark computational hardware, software, and algorithms, it is essential to have many problem instances on-hand. This is no less true for quantum computation, where a large collection of real-world problem instances would allow for benchmarking studies that in turn help to improve both algorithms and hardware designs. To this end, here we present a large dataset of qubit-based quantum Hamiltonians. The dataset, called HamLib (for Hamiltonian Library), is freely available online and contains problem sizes ranging from 2 to 1000 qubits. HamLib includes problem instances of the Heisenberg model, Fermi-Hubbard model, Bose-Hubbard model, molecular electronic structure, molecular vibrational structure, MaxCut, Max-$k$-SAT, Max-$k$-Cut, QMaxCut, and the traveling salesperson problem. The goals of this effort are (a) to save researchers time by eliminating the need to prepare problem instances and map them to qubit representations, (b) to allow for more thorough tests of new algorithms and hardware, and (c) to allow for reproducibility and standardization across research studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.03120v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solid-state electron spin qubits, like the nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond, rely on control sequences of population inversion to enhance sensitivity and improve device coherence. But even for this paradigmatic system, the fundamental limits of population inversion and potential impacts on applications like quantum sensing have not been assessed quantitatively. Here, we perform high accuracy simulations beyond the rotating wave approximation, including explicit unitary simulation of neighboring nuclear spins. Using quantum optimal control, we identify analytical pulses for the control of a qubit subspace within the spin-1 ground state and quantify the relationship between pulse complexity, control duration, and fidelity. We find exponentially increasing amplitude and bandwidth requirements with reduced control duration and further quantify the emergence of non-Markovian effects for multipulse sequences using sub-nanosecond population inversion. From this, we determine that the reduced fidelity and non-Markovianity is due to coherent interactions of the electron spin with the nuclear spin environment. Ultimately, we identify a potentially realizable regime of nanosecond control duration for high-fidelity multipulse sequences. These results provide key insights into the fundamental limits of quantum information processing using electron spin defects in diamond.</description>

      <title>Relating Wigner's Friend Scenarios to Nonclassical Causal Compatibility, Monogamy Relations, and Fine Tuning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.12987v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonclassical causal modeling was developed in order to explain violations of Bell inequalities while adhering to relativistic causal structure and faithfulness -- that is, avoiding fine-tuned causal explanations. Recently, a no-go theorem that can be viewed as being stronger than Bell's theorem has been derived, based on extensions of the Wigner's friend thought experiment: the Local Friendliness (LF) no-go theorem. Here we show that the LF no-go theorem poses formidable challenges for the field of causal modeling, even when nonclassical and/or cyclic causal explanations are considered. We first recast the LF inequalities, one of the key elements of the LF no-go theorem, as special cases of monogamy relations stemming from a statistical marginal problem. We then further recast LF inequalities as causal compatibility inequalities stemming from a nonclassical causal marginal problem, for a causal structure implied by well-motivated causal-metaphysical assumptions. We find that the LF inequalities emerge from this causal structure even when one allows the latent causes of observed events to admit post-quantum descriptions, such as in a generalized probabilistic theory or in an even more exotic theory. We further prove that no nonclassical causal model can explain violations of LF inequalities without violating the No Fine-Tuning principle. Finally, we note that these obstacles cannot be overcome even if one appeals to cyclic causal models, and we discuss potential directions for further extensions of the causal modeling framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.17032v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate solar power forecasting is pivotal for the global transition towards sustainable energy systems. This study conducts a meticulous comparison between Quantum Long Short-Term Memory (QLSTM) and classical Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models for solar power production forecasting. The primary objective is to evaluate the potential advantages of QLSTMs, leveraging their exponential representational capabilities, in capturing the intricate spatiotemporal patterns inherent in renewable energy data. Through controlled experiments on real-world photovoltaic datasets, our findings reveal promising improvements offered by QLSTMs, including accelerated training convergence and substantially reduced test loss within the initial epoch compared to classical LSTMs. These empirical results demonstrate QLSTM's potential to swiftly assimilate complex time series relationships, enabled by quantum phenomena like superposition. However, realizing QLSTM's full capabilities necessitates further research into model validation across diverse conditions, systematic hyperparameter optimization, hardware noise resilience, and applications to correlated renewable forecasting problems. With continued progress, quantum machine learning can offer a paradigm shift in renewable energy time series prediction, potentially ushering in an era of unprecedented accuracy and reliability in solar power forecasting worldwide. This pioneering work provides initial evidence substantiating quantum advantages over classical LSTM models while acknowledging present limitations. Through rigorous benchmarking grounded in real-world data, our study illustrates a promising trajectory for quantum learning in renewable forecasting.</description>

Abstract: Self-assembled InAs quantum dots (QDs) are promising optomechanical elements due to their excellent photonic properties and sensitivity to local strain fields. Microwave-frequency modulation of photons scattered from these efficient quantum emitters has been recently demonstrated using surface acoustic wave (SAW) cavities. However, for optimal performance, a gate structure is required to deterministically control the charge state and reduce charge noise of the QDs. Here, we integrate gated QDs and SAW cavities using molecular beam epitaxy and nanofabrication. We demonstrate that with careful design of the substrate layer structure, integration of the two systems can be accomplished while retaining the optimal performance of each subsystem. These results mark a critical step toward efficient and low-noise optomechanical systems for microwave-to-optical quantum transduction.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Cooling on Contemporary Quantum Computers</title>

Abstract: We study the problem of dynamic cooling whereby a target qubit is cooled at the expense of heating up $N-1$ further identical qubits, by means of a global unitary operation. A standard back-of-the-envelope high temperature estimate establishes that the target qubit temperature can only be dynamically cooled by at most a factor of $1/\sqrt{N}$. Here, we provide the exact expression for the minimum temperature to which the target qubit can be cooled and reveal that there is a crossover from the high initial temperature regime where the scaling is in fact $1/\sqrt{N}$ to a low initial temperature regime where a much faster scaling of $1/N$ occurs. This slow $1/\sqrt{N}$ scaling, which was relevant for early high-temperature NMR quantum computers, is the reason dynamic cooling was dismissed as ineffectual around 20 years ago; the fact that current low-temperature quantum computers fall in the fast $1/N$ scaling regime, reinstates the appeal of dynamic cooling today. We further show that the associated work cost of cooling is exponentially more advantageous in the low temperature regime. We discuss the implementation of dynamic cooling in terms of quantum circuits and examine the effects of hardware noise. We successfully demonstrate dynamic cooling in a 3-qubit system on a real quantum processor. Since the circuit size grows quickly with $N$, scaling dynamic cooling to larger systems on noisy devices poses a challenge. We therefore propose a suboptimal cooling algorithm, whereby relinquishing a small amount of cooling capability results in a drastically reduced circuit complexity, greatly facilitating the implementation of dynamic cooling on near-future quantum computers.</description>

      <title>A Computational Tsirelson's Theorem for the Value of Compiled XOR Games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17301v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonlocal games are a foundational tool for understanding entanglement and constructing quantum protocols in settings with multiple spatially separated quantum devices. In this work, we continue the study initiated by Kalai et al. (STOC '23) of compiled nonlocal games, played between a classical verifier and a single cryptographically limited quantum device. Our main result is that the compiler proposed by Kalai et al. is sound for any two-player XOR game. A celebrated theorem of Tsirelson shows that for XOR games, the quantum value is exactly given by a semidefinite program, and we obtain our result by showing that the SDP upper bound holds for the compiled game up to a negligible error arising from the compilation. This answers a question raised by Natarajan and Zhang (FOCS '23), who showed soundness for the specific case of the CHSH game. Using our techniques, we obtain several additional results, including (1) tight bounds on the compiled value of parallel-repeated XOR games, (2) operator self-testing statements for any compiled XOR game, and (3) a ``nice'' sum-of-squares certificate for any XOR game, from which operator rigidity is manifest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16780v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe a superconducting qubit derived from operating a properly designed fluxonium circuit in a zero magnetic field. The qubit has a frequency of about 4 GHz and an energy relaxation quality factor $Q \approx 0.7\times 10^7$, even though the dielectric loss quality factor of the circuit components is in the low $10^5$ range. The Ramsey coherence time exceeds 100 $\mu$s, and the average fidelity of Clifford gates is benchmarked to $\mathcal{F} &gt; 0.999$. These figures are expected to improve with optimized fabrication and measurement procedures. Our work establishes a ready-to-use ``partially protected" superconducting qubit functioning in the frequency range of conventional transmons.</description>

      <title>Commitments are equivalent to statistically-verifiable one-way state generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03220v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One-way state generators (OWSG) are natural quantum analogs to classical one-way functions. We consider statistically-verifiable OWSGs (sv-OWSG), which are potentially weaker objects than OWSGs. We show that O(n/log(n))-copy sv-OWSGs (n represents the input length) are equivalent to poly(n)-copy sv-OWSGs and to quantum commitments. Since known results show that o(n/log(n))-copy OWSGs cannot imply commitments, this shows that O(n/log(n))-copy sv-OWSGs are the weakest OWSGs from which we can get commitments (and hence much of quantum cryptography).
  Our construction follows along the lines of Hastad, Impagliazzo, Levin and Luby, who obtained classical pseudorandom generators (PRG) from classical one-way functions (OWF), however with crucial modifications. Our construction, when applied to the classical case, provides an alternative to the classical construction to obtain a classical mildly non-uniform PRG from any classical OWF. Since we do not argue conditioned on the output $f(x)$, our construction and analysis is arguably simpler and may be of independent interest. For converting a mildly non-uniform PRG to a uniform PRG, we can use the classical construction.</description>

      <title>Topological photon pumping in quantum optical systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05570v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish the concept of topological pumping in one-dimensional systems with long-range couplings and apply it to the transport of a photon in quantum optical systems. In our theoretical investigation, we introduce an extended version of the Rice-Mele model with all-to-all couplings. By analyzing its properties, we identify the general conditions for topological pumping and theoretically and numerically demonstrate topologically protected and dispersionless transport of a photon on a one-dimensional emitter chain. As concrete examples, we investigate three different popular quantum optics platforms, namely Ryd\-berg atom lattices, dense lattices of atoms excited to low-lying electronic states, and atoms coupled to waveguides, using experimentally relevant parameters. We observe that despite the long-ranged character of the dipole-dipole interactions, topological pumping facilitates the transport of a photon with a fidelity per cycle which can reach 99.9\%. Moreover, we find that the photon pumping process remains topologically protected against local disorder in the coupling parameters.</description>

      <title>Dual-isometric Projected Entangled Pair States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16783v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient characterization of higher dimensional many-body physical states presents significant challenges. In this paper, we propose a new class of Project Entangled Pair State (PEPS) that incorporates two isometric conditions. This new class facilitates the efficient calculation of general local observables and certain two-point correlation functions, which have been previously shown to be intractable for general PEPS, or PEPS with only a single isometric constraint. Despite incorporating two isometric conditions, our class preserves the rich physical structure while enhancing the analytical capabilities. It features a large set of tunable parameters, with only a subleading correction compared to that of general PEPS. Furthermore, we analytically demonstrate that this class can encode universal quantum computations and can represent a transition from topological to trivial order.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09466v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a purely geometric formulation for two different measures addressed to quantify the entanglement between different parts of a tripartite qubit system. Our approach considers the entanglement-polytope defined by the smallest eigenvalues of the reduced density matrices of the qubit-components. The measures identify global and genuine entanglement, and are respectively associated with the projection and rejection of a given point of the polytope on the corresponding biseparable segments. Solving the so called `inverse problem', we also discuss a way to force the system to behave in a particular form, which opens the possibility of controlling and manipulating entanglement for practical purposes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19155v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Wannier-Stark localization dynamically alters the entanglement behavior of non-Hermitian free fermions. Utilizing the single-particle correlation matrix technique, we analyze the effective Hamiltonian of these fermions with a Wannier-Stark ladder. Under open boundary conditions, we observe the steady state half-chain entanglement entropy and identify two distinct area law regions and an algebraic scaling region. Finite-size scaling analysis reveals critical scaling behavior of the half-chain entanglement entropy. Notably, the system demonstrates unique entanglement characteristics under periodic boundary conditions, which diverge from the (1+1)d conformal field theory predictions for Anderson localization. Our findings highlight novel entanglement phases emerging from the interplay between the non-Hermitian skin effect and disorder-free localization.</description>

Abstract: The simulation of time-dynamics and thermal states of free fermions on $N = 2^n$ modes are known to require at most poly($2^n$) computational classical resources. We present several such free fermion problems that can be solved by a quantum algorithm with exponentially-improved, poly($n$) cost. The key technique is the block-encoding of the correlation matrix into a unitary. We demonstrate how such a unitary can be efficiently realized as a quantum circuit, in the context of dynamics and thermal states of tight-binding Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Quantum Entanglement Allocation through a Central Hub</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08173v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Establishing a fully functional quantum internet relies on the efficient allocation of multipartite entangled states, which enables advanced quantum communication protocols, secure multipartite quantum key distribution, and distributed quantum computing. In this work, we propose local operations and classical communication (LOCC) protocols for allocating generalized $N$-qubit W states within a centralized hub architecture, where the central hub node preshares Bell states with each end node. We develop a detailed analysis of the optimality of the resources required for our proposed W-state allocation protocol and the previously proposed GHZ-state protocol. Our results show that these protocols deterministically and exactly distribute states using only $N$ qubits of quantum memory within the central system, with communication costs of $2N - 2$ and $N$ classical bits for the W and GHZ states, respectively. These resource-efficient LOCC protocols are further proven to be optimal within the centralized hub architecture, outperforming conventional teleportation protocols for entanglement distribution in both memory and communication costs. Our results provide a more resource-efficient method for allocating essential multipartite entangled states in quantum networks, paving the way for the realization of a quantum internet with enhanced efficiency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11312v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum synchronizable codes are quantum error correcting codes that can correct not only Pauli errors but also errors in block synchronization. The code can be constructed from two classical cyclic codes $\mathcal{C}$, $\mathcal{D}$ satisfying $\mathcal{C}^{\perp} \subset \mathcal{C} \subset \mathcal{D}$ through the Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) code construction. In this work, we establish connections between quantum synchronizable codes, subsystem codes, and hybrid codes constructed from the same pair of classical cyclic codes. We also propose a method to construct a synchronizable hybrid subsystem code which can correct both Pauli and synchronization errors, is resilient to gauge errors by virtue of the subsystem structure, and can transmit both classical and quantum information, all at the same time. The trade-offs between the number of synchronization errors that the code can correct, the number of gauge qubits, and the number of logical classical bits of the code are also established. In addition, we propose general methods to construct hybrid and hybrid subsystem codes of CSS type from classical codes, which cover relevant codes from our main construction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.05253v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Continuous gauge theories, because of their bosonic degrees of freedom, have an infinite-dimensional local Hilbert space. Encoding these degrees of freedom on qubit-based hardware demands some sort of ``qubitization'' scheme, where one approximates the behavior of a theory while using only finitely many degrees of freedom. We propose a novel qubitization strategy for gauge theories, called ``fuzzy gauge theory,'' building on the success of the fuzzy $\sigma$-model in earlier work. We provide arguments that the fuzzy gauge theory lies in the same universality class as regular gauge theory, in which case its use would obviate the need of any further limit besides the usual spatial continuum limit. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these models are relatively resource-efficient for quantum simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10261v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strongly interacting non-equilibrium systems are of great fundamental interest, yet their inherent complexity make then notoriously hard to analyze. We demonstrate that the dynamics of the Bose-Hubbard model, which by itself evades solvability, can be solved exactly at any interaction strength in the presence of loss tuned to a rate matching the hopping amplitude. Remarkably, the full solvability of the corresponding Liouvillian, and the integrability of the pertinent effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, survives the addition of disorder and generic boundary conditions. By analyzing the Bethe ansatz solutions we find that even weak interactions change the qualitative features of the system, leading to an intricate dynamical phase diagram featuring non-Hermitian Mott-skin effects, disorder induced localization, highly degenerate exceptional points, and a Bose glass-like phase of fragmented condensates. We discuss realistic implementations of this model with cold atoms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12206v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a fundamental duality between the geometric properties of spacetime and the informational content of quantum fields. Specifically, we establish that the curvature of spacetime is directly related to the entanglement entropy of quantum states, with geometric invariants mapping to informational measures. This framework modifies Einstein's field equations by introducing an informational stress-energy tensor derived from quantum entanglement entropy. Our findings have implications for black hole thermodynamics, cosmology, and quantum gravity, suggesting that quantum information fundamentally shapes the structure of spacetime. We incorporate this informational stress-energy tensor into Einstein's field equations, leading to modified spacetime geometry, particularly in regimes of strong gravitational fields, such as near black holes. We compute corrections to Newton's constant (G) due to entanglement entropy contributions from various quantum fields and explore the consequences for black hole thermodynamics and cosmology. These corrections include explicit dependence on fundamental constants (h-bar, c, and k_B), ensuring dimensional consistency in our calculations. Our results indicate that quantum information plays a crucial role in gravitational dynamics, providing new insights into the nature of spacetime and potential solutions to long-standing challenges in quantum gravity.</description>

Abstract: Universality and scaling are fundamental concepts in equilibrium continuous phase transitions. Here, we unveil a unique and universal scaling behavior of the critical time in slowly driven dynamical quantum phase transition. Going beyond the analogy with equilibrium phase transition, we find that the critical time exhibits a power-law scaling with quenching rate and the scaling exponent is fully determined by underlining universality class. We explain this unique scaling behavior based on the adiabatic-impulse scenario in the Kibble-Zurek mechanism. This universal scaling behavior is verified to be valid not only in noninteracting single-particle system, but also in many-body interacting system, and not only in Hermitian system, but also in non-Hermitian system. Our study unravels a deep and fundamental relationship between dynamical phase transition and equilibrium phase tranition.</description>

Abstract: Tensor Networks (TNs) are a computational paradigm used for representing quantum many-body systems. Recent works have shown how TNs can also be applied to perform Machine Learning (ML) tasks, yielding comparable results to standard supervised learning techniques. In this work, we study the use of Tree Tensor Networks (TTNs) in high-frequency real-time applications by exploiting the low-latency hardware of the Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) technology. We present different implementations of TTN classifiers, capable of performing inference on classical ML datasets as well as on complex physics data. A preparatory analysis of bond dimensions and weight quantization is realized in the training phase, together with entanglement entropy and correlation measurements, that help setting the choice of the TTN architecture. The generated TTNs are then deployed on a hardware accelerator; using an FPGA integrated into a server, the inference of the TTN is completely offloaded. Eventually, a classifier for High Energy Physics (HEP) applications is implemented and executed fully pipelined with sub-microsecond latency.</description>
