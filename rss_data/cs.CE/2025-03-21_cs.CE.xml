      <title>Filters reveal emergent structure in computational morphogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Revolutionary advances in both manufacturing and computational morphogenesis raise critical questions about design sensitivity. Sensitivity questions are especially critical in contexts, such as topology optimization, that yield structures with emergent morphology. However, analyzing emergent structures via conventional, perturbative techniques can mask larger-scale vulnerabilities that could manifest in essential components. Risks that fail to appear in perturbative sensitivity analyses will only continue to proliferate as topology optimization-driven manufacturing penetrates more deeply into engineering design and consumer products. Here, we introduce Laplace-transform based computational filters that supplement computational morphogenesis with a set of nonperturbative sensitivity analyses. We demonstrate how this approach identifies important elements of a structure even in the absence of knowledge of the ultimate, optimal structure itself. We leverage techniques from molecular dynamics and implement these methods in open-source codes, demonstrating their application to compliance minimization problems in both 2D and 3D. Our implementation extends straightforwardly to topology optimization for other problems and benefits from the strong scaling properties observed in conventional molecular simulation.</description>

      <title>Deep Feynman-Kac Methods for High-dimensional Semilinear Parabolic Equations: Revisit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep Feynman-Kac method was first introduced to solve parabolic partial differential equations(PDE) by Beck et al. (SISC, V.43, 2021), named Deep Splitting method since they trained the Neural Networks step by step in the time direction. In this paper, we propose a new training approach with two different features. Firstly, neural networks are trained at all time steps globally, instead of step by step. Secondly, the training data are generated in a new way, in which the method is consistent with a direct Monte Carlo scheme when dealing with a linear parabolic PDE. Numerical examples show that our method has significant improvement both in efficiency and accuracy.</description>

      <title>Shap-MeD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Shap-MeD, a text-to-3D object generative model specialized in the biomedical domain. The objective of this study is to develop an assistant that facilitates the 3D modeling of medical objects, thereby reducing development time. 3D modeling in medicine has various applications, including surgical procedure simulation and planning, the design of personalized prosthetic implants, medical education, the creation of anatomical models, and the development of research prototypes. To achieve this, we leverage Shap-e, an open-source text-to-3D generative model developed by OpenAI, and fine-tune it using a dataset of biomedical objects. Our model achieved a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.089 in latent generation on the evaluation set, compared to Shap-e's MSE of 0.147. Additionally, we conducted a qualitative evaluation, comparing our model with others in the generation of biomedical objects. Our results indicate that Shap-MeD demonstrates higher structural accuracy in biomedical object generation.</description>

      <title>Impact of pH and chloride content on the biodegradation of magnesium alloys for medical implants: An in vitro and phase-field study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The individual contributions of pH and chloride concentration to the corrosion kinetics of bioabsorbable magnesium (Mg) alloys remain unresolved despite their significant roles as driving factors in Mg corrosion. This study demonstrates and quantifies hitherto unknown separate effects of pH and chloride content on the corrosion of Mg alloys pertinent to biomedical implant applications. The experimental setup designed for this purpose enables the quantification of the dependence of corrosion on pH and chloride concentration. The in vitro tests conclusively demonstrate that variations in chloride concentration, relevant to biomedical applications, have a negligible effect on corrosion kinetics. The findings identify pH as a critical factor in the corrosion of bioabsorbable Mg alloys. A variationally consistent phase-field model is developed for assessing the degradation of Mg alloys in biological fluids. The model accurately predicts the corrosion performance of Mg alloys observed during the experiments, including their dependence on pH and chloride concentration. The capability of the framework to account for mechano-chemical effects during corrosion is demonstrated in practical orthopaedic applications considering bioabsorbable Mg alloy implants for bone fracture fixation and porous scaffolds for bone tissue engineering. The strategy has the potential to assess the in vitro and in vivo service life of bioabsorbable Mg-based biomedical devices.</description>

      <title>WeirdFlows: Anomaly Detection in Financial Transaction Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the digitization and automation of anti-financial crime (AFC) investigative processes have faced significant challenges, particularly the need for interpretability of AI model results and the lack of labeled data for training. Network analysis has emerged as a valuable approach in this context.
  In this paper, we present WeirdFlows, a top-down search pipeline for detecting potentially fraudulent transactions and non-compliant agents. In a transaction network, fraud attempts are often based on complex transaction patterns that change over time to avoid detection. The WeirdFlows pipeline requires neither an a priori set of patterns nor a training set. In addition, by providing elements to explain the anomalies found, it facilitates and supports the work of an AFC analyst.
  We evaluate WeirdFlows on a dataset from Intesa Sanpaolo (ISP) bank, comprising 80 million cross-country transactions over 15 months, benchmarking our implementation of the algorithm. The results, corroborated by ISP AFC experts, highlight its effectiveness in identifying suspicious transactions and actors, particularly in the context of the economic sanctions imposed in the EU after February 2022. This demonstrates \textit{WeirdFlows}' capability to handle large datasets, detect complex transaction patterns, and provide the necessary interpretability for formal AFC investigations.</description>

      <title>Practical Portfolio Optimization with Metaheuristics:Pre-assignment Constraint and Margin Trading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Portfolio optimization is a critical area in finance, aiming to maximize returns while minimizing risk. Metaheuristic algorithms were shown to solve complex optimization problems efficiently, with Genetic Algorithms and Particle Swarm Optimization being among the most popular methods. This paper introduces an innovative approach to portfolio optimization that incorporates pre-assignment to limit the search space for investor preferences and better results. Additionally, taking margin trading strategies in account and using a rare performance ratio to evaluate portfolio efficiency. Through an illustrative example, this paper demonstrates that the metaheuristic-based methodology yields superior risk-adjusted returns compared to traditional benchmarks. The results highlight the potential of metaheuristics with help of assets filtering in enhancing portfolio performance in terms of risk adjusted return.</description>

      <title>Sustainable Open-Data Management for Field Research: A Cloud-Based Approach in the Underlandscape Project</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Field-based research projects require a robust suite of ICT services to support data acquisition, documentation, storage, and dissemination. A key challenge lies in ensuring the sustainability of data management - not only during the project's funded period but also beyond its conclusion, when maintenance and support often depend on voluntary efforts. In the Underlandscape project, we tackled this challenge by extensively leveraging public cloud services while minimizing reliance on complex custom infrastructure. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the project's final infrastructure, detailing the adopted data formats, the cloud-based solutions enabling data management, and the custom applications developed for system integration.</description>

      <title>AMReX: Block-Structured Adaptive Mesh Refinement for Multiphysics Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.12009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2009.12009v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Block-structured adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) provides the basis for the temporal and spatial discretization strategy for a number of ECP applications in the areas of accelerator design, additive manufacturing, astrophysics, combustion, cosmology, multiphase flow, and wind plant modelling. AMReX is a software framework that provides a unified infrastructure with the functionality needed for these and other AMR applications to be able to effectively and efficiently utilize machines from laptops to exascale architectures. AMR reduces the computational cost and memory footprint compared to a uniform mesh while preserving accurate descriptions of different physical processes in complex multi-physics algorithms. AMReX supports algorithms that solve systems of partial differential equations (PDEs) in simple or complex geometries, and those that use particles and/or particle-mesh operations to represent component physical processes. In this paper, we will discuss the core elements of the AMReX framework such as data containers and iterators as well as several specialized operations to meet the needs of the application projects. In addition we will highlight the strategy that the AMReX team is pursuing to achieve highly performant code across a range of accelerator-based architectures for a variety of different applications.</description>
