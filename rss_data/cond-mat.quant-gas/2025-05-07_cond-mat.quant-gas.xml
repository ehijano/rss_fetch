      <title>Proper Orthogonal Decomposition of a Superfluid Turbulent Wake</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superfluid turbulent wakes behind a square prism are studied theoretically and numerically by proper orthogonal decomposition (POD). POD is a data science approach that can efficiently extract the principal vibration modes of a physical system, and is widely used in hydrodynamics, including applications in wake structure analysis. It is not straightforward to apply the conventional POD method to superfluid wake systems, as the superfluid velocity field diverges at the center of a vortex whose circulation is quantized. We successfully established a POD method by applying appropriate blurring to the vorticity distribution in a two-dimensional superfluid wake. It is shown that a coherent structure corresponding to two parallel arrays of alternating quantum vortex bundles, called the "quasi-classical" K\'arm\'an vortex street, is latent as a distinctive major mode in the superfluid turbulent wakes that were naively thought to be "irregular". Since our method is also effective for fluid density, it can be applied to the experimental data analysis for ultra-cold atomic gases.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium, Relaxation and Fluctuations in homogeneous Bose-Einstein Condensates: Linearized Classical Field Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a thorough analysis of the linearized stochastic projected Gross-Pitaevskii equation (SPGPE) describing finite temperature in Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs). Our study reveals an optimal choice for the cut-off that divides the Bose gas into a low energy coherent region forming a classical wave and a high energy thermal cloud acting as a reservoir. Moreover, it highlights the relevance of energy damping, the number conserving scattering between thermal and coherent atoms. We analyze the equilibrium properties and near equilibrium relaxation of a homogeneous BEC in one, two and three dimensions at high phase space density, and calculate the autocorrelation function and power spectrum of the density and phase fluctuations. Simulations of the full non-linear SPGPE are in close agreement, and extend our arguments beyond the linear regime. Our work suggests the need for a re-examination of decay processes in BECs studied under the neglect of energy damping.</description>

      <title>Many-Body Quantum Optics in a Bose-Hubbard Waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Waveguide quantum electrodynamics (QED) studies the interaction between quantum emitters and guided photons in one-dimension. When the waveguide hosts interacting photons, it becomes a platform to explore many-body quantum optics. However, the influence of photonic correlations on emitter dynamics remains poorly understood. In this work, we study the collective decay and coherent interactions of quantum emitters coupled to a one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard waveguide, an array of coupled photonic modes with repulsive on-site interactions that supports superfluid and Mott insulating phases. We show that photon-photon interactions alone can trigger a superradiant burst, independent of emitter spacing and transition frequency. In the off-resonant regime, emitters exhibit two distinct types of mediated interactions: delocalized superfluid excitations yield distance-independent couplings, while Mott-insulator quasiparticles generate short-range interactions mediated by doublons and holons. Our work bridges many-body physics and waveguide QED, revealing how photonic many-body states shape emitter dynamics.</description>

      <title>Chiral Gravitons on the Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chiral graviton modes are elusive excitations arising from the hidden quantum geometry of fractional quantum Hall states. It remains unclear, however, whether this picture extends to lattice models, where continuum translations are broken and additional quasiparticle decay channels arise. We present a framework in which we explicitly derive a field theory incorporating lattice chiral graviton operators within the paradigmatic bosonic Harper-Hofstadter model. Extensive numerical evidence suggests that chiral graviton modes persist away from the continuum, and are well captured by the proposed lattice operators. We identify geometric quenches as a viable experimental probe, paving the way for the exploration of chiral gravitons in near-term quantum simulation experiments.</description>

      <title>Narrowline cooling of dysprosium atoms in an optical tweezer array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform narrowline cooling of single dysprosium atoms trapped in a 1D optical tweezers array, employing the narrow single-photon transition at 741 nm. At the trapping wavelength of 532 nm, the excited state is less trapped than the ground state. To obtain efficient cooling performances, we chirp the frequency of the cooling beam to subsequently address the red sidebands of different motional states. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the cooling protocol through Raman thermometry, which we characterize for our experimental conditions. We obtain an array of 75 atoms close to the motional ground state in the radial direction of the tweezers. Our results demonstrate the possibility to manipulate the motional degree of freedom of dysprosium in optical tweezers arrays, a key ingredient to exploit the potential of lanthanide-based tweezers platforms for quantum science.</description>

      <title>Projection Optimization Method for Open-Dissipative Quantum Fluids and its Application to a Single Vortex in a Photon Bose-Einstein Condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10027v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Open dissipative systems of quantum fluids have been well studied numerically. In view of a complementary analytical description we extend here the variational optimization method for Bose-Einstein condensates of closed systems to open-dissipative condensates. The resulting projection optimization method is applied to a complex Gross-Pitaevski equation, which models phenomenologically a photon Bose-Einstein condensate. Together with known methods from hydrodynamics we obtain an approximate vortex solution, which depends on the respective open system parameters and has the same properties as obtained numerically in the literature.</description>

      <title>Accuracy of time-dependent GGE under weak dissipation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01896v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unitary integrable models typically relax to a stationary Generalized Gibbs Ensemble (GGE), but in experimental realizations dissipation often breaks integrability. In this work, we use the recently introduced time-dependent GGE (t-GGE) approach to describe the open dynamics of a gas of bosons subject to atom losses and gains. We employ tensor network methods to provide numerical evidence of the exactness of the t-GGE in the limit of adiabatic dissipation, and of its accuracy in the regime of weak but finite dissipation. That accuracy is tested for two-point functions via the rapidity distribution, and for more complicated correlations through a non-Gaussianity measure. We combine this description with Generalized Hydrodynamics and we show that it correctly captures transport at the Euler scale. Our results demonstrate that the t-GGE approach is robust in both homogeneous and inhomogeneous settings.</description>

      <title>Universality in the microwave shielding of ultracold polar molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03170v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Microwave shielding is an important technique that can suppress the losses that arise from collisions of ultracold polar molecules. It has been instrumental in achieving molecular Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) for NaCs [Bigagli et al., Nature 631, 289 (2024)]. We demonstrate that microwave shielding is universal, in the sense that the 2-body collision properties of different molecules are very similar when expressed in suitable reduced units of length and energy. This applies to rate coefficients for inelastic scattering and loss, to scattering lengths, and to the properties of 2-molecule bound states. We also explore the small deviations from universality that arise at very large Rabi frequencies. In general, the collision properties are near-universal except when the Rabi frequency exceeds a few percent of the molecular rotational constant. The universality extends to elliptically polarized microwaves and to combinations of multiple fields. Our results indicate that the methods that have been used to achieve BEC for NaCs can be transferred directly to most other polar molecules.</description>

      <title>Observation of a zero-energy excitation mode in the open Dicke model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12155v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Approaching phase boundaries in many-body systems can give rise to intriguing signatures in their excitation spectra. Here, we explore the excitation spectrum of a Bose-Einstein condensate strongly coupled to an optical cavity and pumped by an optical standing wave, which simulates the famous Dicke-Hepp-Lieb phase transition of the open Dicke model with dissipation arising due to photon leakage from the cavity. For weak dissipation, the excitation spectrum displays two strongly polaritonic modes. Close to the phase boundary, we observe an intriguing regime where the lower-energetic of these modes, instead of showing the expected roton-type mode softening, is found to approach and persist at zero energy, well before the critical pump strength for the Dicke-Hepp-Lieb transition boundary is reached. Hence, a peculiar situation arises, where an excitation is possible at zero energy cost, but nevertheless no instability of the system is created.</description>

      <title>Three-body universality in the B meson sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.06176</link>
      <description>arXiv:1705.06176v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The charged exotic mesons Z_b(10610) and Z'_b(10650) observed by the Belle collaboration in 2011 are very close to the B* Bbar and B* Bbar* thresholds, respectively. This suggests their interpretation as shallow hadronic molecules of B and B* mesons. Using the masses of the Z_b(10610) and Z'_b(10650) as input, we rule out the possibility for universal bound states of three B and B* mesons arising from the Efimov effect based on their spin-isospin structure. As a consequence, we can predict the phase shifts for the scattering of B and B* mesons off the exotic mesons Z_b(10610) and Z'_b(10650) to leading order in a non-relativistic effective field theory with contact interactions based on two-body information alone.</description>

      <title>Continuous Transition between Bosonic Fractional Chern Insulator and Superfluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18269v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The properties of fractional Chern insulator (FCI) phases and the phase transitions between FCI and Mott insulators (MI) in bosonic systems are well studied. The continuous transitions between FCI and superfluid (SF), however, despite the inspiring field theoretical predictions, have not been directly verified. The existing numerical results of the FCI-SF transition are either indirect or clearly first-order. Here, by simply tuning the bandwidth of the Haldane honeycomb lattice model, we find direct transitions from a bosonic FCI at $\nu=1/2$ filling of a flat Chern band to two SF states with bosons condensed at momenta M or $\Gamma$, respectively. While the FCI-SF(M) transition is first-order, the FCI-SF($\Gamma$) transition is found continuous, and the bipartite entanglement entropy at the critical point with the area-law scaling is consistent with the critical theories. Through finite size criticality analysis, the obtained critical exponents $\beta\approx$ 0.35(5) and $\nu\approx$ 0.62(12) are both compatible with those of the 3D XY universality class within numerical uncertainty and possibly more exotic beyond-Landau ones. This letter thence presents a direct numerical demonstration of a continuous FCI-SF transition between topologically ordered phase and spontaneous continuous symmetry-breaking phase, and further indicates the zero-field bosonic FCI might be realized from a SF state by gradually flattening the dispersion of the Chern band, through the (quasi)adiabatic preparation in ultracold atom systems.</description>
