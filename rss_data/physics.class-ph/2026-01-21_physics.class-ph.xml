      <title>Inverse Reconstruction of Moving Contact Loads on an Elastic Half-Space Using Prescribed Surface Displacement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the elastic response of a two-dimensional semi-infinite medium subjected to a moving surface load with a prescribed displacement profile. As a fundamental step, we derive analytical Green's functions for the displacement and stress fields generated by a point load traveling at a constant velocity along the surface, explicitly incorporating elastodynamic effects through Mach number dependence. These moving-load solutions serve as building blocks for constructing more general loading scenarios via linear superposition. Based on Green's functions, an inverse problem is formulated to reconstruct the unknown surface traction responsible for a given surface displacement. The inverse analysis is performed through a Fourier-domain inversion with regularization, which enables a direct and computationally efficient determination of the contact pressure without iterative forward simulations. This framework is applied to a rigid wheel-ground contact problem, where the imposed displacement is dictated by the wheel geometry. The reconstructed surface traction exhibits a smooth, symmetric distribution within the contact region, while the resulting subsurface stress fields are obtained in closed analytical form and involve dilogarithm functions. The principal stress difference reveals characteristic spatial patterns similar to photoelastic fringes, and their asymmetry increases with the Mach number, reflecting the dynamic nature of the moving contact.</description>

      <title>Integrated nano electro-optomechanical spiking neuron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neuromorphic computing offers a pathway toward energy-efficient processing of data, yet hardware platforms combining nanoscale integration and multimodal functionality remain scarce. Here we demonstrate a gallium-phosphide electro-optomechanical spiking neuron that integrates optical and electromechanical interfaces within a single nanostructure on a silicon photonic chip operating at telecommunication wavelengths (1550 nm) and exploiting a 3 gigahertz-frequency mechanical mode. Our device displays excitable dynamics, generating optical spikes at its output, as in the spiking activity of neurons and cardiac cells and defined by the calibrated all-or-none response to external perturbations. This dynamic is consistent with the saddle-node on invariant circle scenario and associated features are demonstrated including control of excitable threshold, temporal summation and refractory period. Our device compact footprint and its CMOS-compatible platform make it well suited for edge-computing applications requiring low latency and establish a foundation for versatile brain-inspired optomechanical computing and advanced on-chip optical pulse sources.</description>

      <title>Topological aspects of zero modes in cavity resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the relationship between the zero modes of electromagnetic fields in a cavity resonator and the cavity's topological characteristics. We show that the dimension of the electromagnetic zero-mode space coincides with the dimension of the corresponding homology group of the cavity. Moreover, we prove that the alternating sum of the dimensions of the electromagnetic zero-mode spaces is closely related to the Euler characteristic of the cavity boundary, and hence to the integral of the curvature.</description>

      <title>Stochastic dynamics from maximum entropy in action space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an information-theoretic formulation of stochastic dynamics in which the fundamental stochastic variable is the total action connecting spacetime points, rather than individual paths. By maximizing Shannon entropy over a joint distribution of actions and endpoints, subject to normalization and a constraint on the mean action, we obtain a Boltzmann-like distribution in action space. This framework reproduces the standard Brownian propagator in the nonrelativistic limit and naturally extends to relativistic regimes, where the Wiener construction fails to preserve Lorentz covariance. The approach bypasses functional integration over paths, makes the role of entropic degeneracy explicit through an action-space density of states, and provides a transparent connection between the principle of least action and statistical inference. We derive the density of states explicitly using large deviation theory, showing that it takes a Gaussian form centered at the minimal action, and rigorously justify the saddle-point approximation in the diffusive regime. The Markovian property of the resulting propagator is verified to hold via the Chapman--Kolmogorov equation, following from the additivity of the minimal action for free-particle dynamics. In the diffusive regime, the resulting dynamics are governed by a competition between extremization of the action and entropic effects, which can be interpreted in terms of an effective action free energy. Our results establish an unified, covariant, and information-based foundation for classical and relativistic stochastic processes.</description>

      <title>The Global Food Trade Network as a Complex Adaptive System: A Review of Structure, Evolution, and Resilience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The global food system has metamorphosed from a loose aggregation of bilateral exchanges into a highly intricate, interdependent Global Food Trade Network (FTN). This comprehensive review synthesizes the extant literature to examine the FTN through the rigorous lens of complex network science, moving beyond traditional economic trade models to quantify the system's topological architecture. We delineate the network's historical transition from a unipolar, efficiency-driven system dominated by Western hegemony to a multipolar, regionalized structure characterized by high clustering and scale-free heterogeneity. Special emphasis is placed on the dual nature of connectivity, which functions simultaneously as a buffer against local production variances and a conduit for global contagion. By conceptualizing the FTN as a multiplex system-distinguishing between the robust topology of wheat, the brittle regionalism of rice, and the polarized "dumbbell" structure of soy-we elucidate the distinct structural vulnerabilities inherent in modern food security. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of recent high-magnitude shocks, specifically the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine conflict, illustrating the critical trade-off between logistical efficiency and systemic resilience. The review concludes by assessing the future trajectory of the network under anthropogenic climate change, predicting a poleward migration of comparative advantage that necessitates a paradigm shift from isolationist protectionism to cooperative network redundancy.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Hamiltonian as an emergent structure from information geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the relativistic energy-momentum relation can emerge as an effective ensemble-averaged structure from a multiplicative Hamiltonian when fluctuations of an auxiliary parameter are treated using maximum entropy inference. The resulting probability distribution is uniquely fixed by scale-invariant constraints, which are shown to arise naturally from the Fisher-Rao geometry of the associated statistical manifold. Within this information-geometric framework, the relativistic dispersion relation appears without initially imposing Lorentz symmetry, but as a consequence of statistical averaging and geometric invariance.</description>

      <title>Lattice-induced sound trapping in biperiodic metasurfaces of acoustic resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17750v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A referential example of a physical system that supports bound states in the continuum (BICs) with an infinite quality factor ($Q$ factor) is a metasurface of discrete scatterers (resonators), whose response can be significantly modified by exploiting lattice interactions. In this work, we explore the multipole-interference mechanism for realizing accidental acoustic BICs (trapped modes) at $\Gamma$-point (in-plane Bloch wave vector $\mathbf{k}_{\parallel} = \mathbf{0}$) of biperiodic metasurfaces of acoustic resonators with one resonator per unit cell. To do so, we expand the pressure field from the metasurface into a series of scalar zonal ($m = 0$) spherical multipoles, carried by a normally incident plane wave, and formulate analytical conditions on the resonator multipole moments under which an eigenmode becomes a BIC. The conditions enable us to determine the lattice constant and frequency values that facilitate the formation of an axisymmetric BIC with a specific parity, resulting from destructive interference between zonal multipoles of the same parity, despite each moment radiating individually. By employing the T-matrix method for acoustic metasurfaces, we numerically investigate the BIC resonance in various structures, including finite arrays, and also the transformation of such resonances into high-$Q$ quasi-BIC regimes, which can be excited by a plane wave at normal incidence.</description>

      <title>Conservation of Momentum and Energy in the Lorenz-Abraham-Dirac Equation of Motion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.02960v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: After a brief review of the modified causal Lorentz-Abraham (LA) classical equation of motion for an extended charged sphere and its limit to the mass-renormalized modified causal Lorentz-Abraham-Dirac (LAD) equation of motion as the radius of the charged sphere approaches zero, a concise derivation is given for the conditions on the velocity and external force required for these modified equations of motion to satisfy conservation of momentum and energy. The effects of mass renomalization on the radiated momentum-energy is clarified. The solutions to the unmodified and modified LAD equations of motion as well as the Landau-Lifshitz approximate solution to the unmodified LAD equation of motion are obtained for a charge traveling through a parallel-plate capacitor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.10184v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We review and study the correspondence between discrete lattice/chain models of interacting particles and their continuous counterparts represented by partial differential equations. We study the correspondence problem for nearest neighbour interaction lattice models as well as for multiple-neighbour interaction lattice models, and we gradually proceed from infinite lattices to periodic lattices and finally to finite lattices with fixed ends/zero Dirichlet boundary conditions. The whole study is framed as systematic specialisation of Fourier analysis tools from the continuous to the discrete setting and vice versa, and the correspondence between the discrete and continuous models is examined primarily with regard to the dispersion relation.</description>

      <title>Poynting Vector Spin in Gyromagnetic Medium and its Impact on Backward Power Flow in Waveguiding Structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15867v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the reactive power and spin of instantaneous Poynting vector in the bulk of gyromagnetic medium. It is shown that the gyromagnetic medium introduces a spin in the Poynting vector. The spin of the instantaneous Poynting vector and the relative strengths of the real and reactive power components are quantified using the Stokes plot method. Using this technique we investigate the presence of backward power propagation in a ferrite-filled waveguide. We present an analytical expression to locate the crossover point separating the forward and backward power propagation, where the real power propagation has a null. We further show that this backward power propagation leads to corresponding opposing surface currents on a waveguide plate of the ferrite-filled waveguide, while the potential difference between the two plates remain symmetric.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Symmetry Discovery for Integrable Hamiltonian Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14632v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a data-driven Machine-Learning Symmetry Discovery (MLSD) framework for identifying continuous symmetry generators and their Lie-algebraic structure directly from phase-space trajectory data expressed in canonical coordinates. MLSD parameterizes candidate conserved quantities with neural networks and learns antisymmetric structure coefficients by enforcing Poisson-bracket closure, supplemented by a weak independence regularizer. We validate MLSD on two integrable benchmark systems -- the three-dimensional Kepler problem and the three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator -- recovering the expected non-Abelian algebras (respectively $\mathfrak{so}(4)$ and $\mathfrak{su}(3)$) up to basis transformations. This work focuses on integrable benchmark dynamics, where global conserved quantities are well-defined and admit compact representations learnable from canonical-coordinate trajectories. Extending symmetry discovery to mixed or chaotic phase-space regimes is an important direction for future work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09817v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a decomposition of classical potentials into a conservative (gradient) component and a non-conservative component. The latter generalizes the curl component of the force in the three-dimensional case. The force is transformed into a differential $1$-form, known as the work form. This work form is decomposed into an exact (gradient) component and an antiexact component, which in turn generalizes the curl part of the force. The antiexact component is subsequently decomposed using the Frobenius theorem. This local decomposition is a useful tool for identifying the specific components of classical potentials.</description>

      <title>Metasurface-based Terahertz Three-dimensional Holography Enabled by Physics-Informed Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01221v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence, an emerging, powerful and efficient computational tool, has played a crucial role in the design of optical devices. For the design of holographic metasurfaces, traditional algorithms require multiple iterations between the metasurface and target planes, resulting in excessive computation time. Here, a physics-informed neural network (PINN) is proposed for the fast design of terahertz three-dimensional (3D) holographic metasurfaces. Trained in a self-supervised manner, the PINN eliminates the need for paired input-label datasets. After training, the PINN enables end-to-end mapping between the target holographic patterns and metasurface structures. Both simulation and experimental results of single-plane and 3D multi-plane holography demonstrate that metasurfaces designed by PINN offer higher imaging quality than traditional iterative algorithms. Moreover, the PINN can find approximate solutions of metasurface structures even in physically counterintuitive scenarios, where the holographic patterns of two parallel imaging planes are completely distinct. Furthermore, the inference process of PINN typically takes less than 1 second, much faster than the traditional algorithms requiring iterative computation. Notably, the PINN simultaneously accounts for both phase and amplitude modulation, thereby outperforming traditional phase-only modulation algorithms in handling complex physical scenarios and offering superior imaging quality. This end-to-end design approach has the potential to pave the way for the realization of high-quality, real-time, and large-scale terahertz 3D holographic display technology.</description>
