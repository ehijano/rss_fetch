      <title>Minuet: A Diffusion Autoencoder for Compact Semantic Compression of Multi-Band Galaxy Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Vera C. Rubin Observatory is slated to observe nearly 20 billion galaxies during its decade-long Legacy Survey of Space and Time. The rich imaging data it collects will be an invaluable resource for probing galaxy evolution across cosmic time, characterizing the host galaxies of transient phenomena, and identifying novel populations of anomalous systems. While machine learning models have shown promise for extracting galaxy features from multi-band astronomical imaging, the large dimensionality of the learned latent space presents a challenge for mechanistic interpretability studies. In this work, we present Minuet, a low-dimensional diffusion autoencoder for multi-band galaxy imaging. Minuet is trained to reconstruct 72x72-pixel $grz$ image cutouts of 6M galaxies within $z&lt;1$ from the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey using only five latent dimensions. By using a diffusion model conditioned on the transformer-based autoencoder's output for image reconstruction, we achieve semantically-meaningful latent representations of galaxy images while still allowing for high-fidelity, probabilistic reconstructions. We train a series of binary classifiers on Minuet's latent features to quantify their connection to morphological labels from Galaxy Zoo, and a conditional flow to produce posterior distributions of SED-derived redshifts, stellar masses, and star-formation rates. We further show the value of Minuet for nearest neighbor searches in the learned latent space. Minuet provides strong evidence for the low intrinsic dimensionality of galaxy imaging, and introduces a class of astrophysical models that produce highly compact representations for diverse science goals.</description>

      <title>Machine Phenomenology: A Simple Equation Classifying Fast Radio Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work shows how human physical reasoning can guide machine-driven symbolic regression toward discovering empirical laws from observations. As an example, we derive a simple equation that classifies fast radio bursts (FRBs) into two distinct Gaussian distributions, indicating the existence of two physical classes. This human-AI workflow integrates feature selection, dimensional analysis, and symbolic regression: deep learning first analyzes CHIME Catalog 1 and identifies six independent parameters that collectively provide a complete description of FRBs; guided by Buckingham-$\pi$ analysis and correlation analysis, humans then construct dimensionless groups; finally, symbolic regression performed by the machine discovers the governing equation. When applied to the newer CHIME Catalog, the equation produces consistent results, demonstrating that it captures the underlying physics. This framework is applicable to a broad range of scientific domains.</description>

      <title>LEBS Toolkit for Addressing Development Challenges through Astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The LEBS Toolkit provides a comprehensive framework for astronomers and natural scientists to address development challenges through their field. The toolkit aligns with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and offers practical actions to achieve development outcomes. It emphasises the importance of effective communication between astronomy and development, highlighting four key components: Leadership, Externalities, Break Barriers to Entry and Support Functioning Markets &amp; Institutions (LEBS). Using these components, scientists can promote accurate information dissemination, encourage positive community impacts, overcome monopolistic barriers, and improve market efficiency and institutional settings. The LEBS Toolkit serves as a guide for the scientific community in bridging the gap between scientific knowledge and practical development actions, ultimately contributing to global development goals.</description>

      <title>A review on fundamental bounds and estimators for photometry and astrometry of celestial point sources using array detectors, from first principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise astrometric and photometric measurements of celestial point sources are fundamental to modern astronomy. These measurements, used to determine object positions, motions, and fluxes, are based on observational models that have evolved from empirical centroiding rules to rigorous probabilistic formulations at the pixel level. This review summarizes key contributions that formalized this transition and analyzes seminal works addressing both the theoretical limits and the empirical performance of estimators. Central to these developments is the derivation of fundamental bounds, such as the Cram\'er-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB), and the assessment of widely used estimators, including Maximum Likelihood (ML), Least Squares (LS), and Weighted Least Squares (WLS). These studies show that, while the CRLB sets a theoretical benchmark, practical estimators achieve it only under specific signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes, with notable discrepancies in high-SNR conditions. Moreover, recent results demonstrate that jointly estimating source flux and background significantly improves photometric precision compared to sequential approaches. Looking ahead, the increasing complexity of astronomical surveys, driven by massive data volumes, dynamic observational conditions, and the integration of machine learning, poses new challenges to reliable inference. In this context, tools from statistical theory, including performance bounds and theoretically grounded estimators, remain critical to guide algorithm design and ensure robust astrometric and photometric pipelines.</description>

      <title>Design and dynamics experiment of filter wheel mechanism of space coronagraph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to realize multi-spectral imaging of space coronagraph, a compact filter wheel mechanism is designed. The filters with different spectral transmittance can be cut into the optical path at different times by this mechanism. Because the image contrast of space coronagraph is very high, the high stability requirement for the optical unit of coronagraph is put forward. Small modulus worm gear and worm are taken by the mechanism, in order to realize compact structure, high stiffness, the unidirectional 360 degrees rotation and reverse self-locking function. The precision, stiffness, mechanical properties and reliability of the mechanism are analyzed in the paper. The results show that the position accuracy of the filter wheel can meet the requirement of 0.5mm. The first order modal of the mechanism is 313Hz. The results of vibration test indicate that stiffness, dynamic performance and reliability of the mechanism can be meet. Therefore, the design of filter wheel in this paper can ensure the multi-spectral imaging requirements under complex spatial conditions.</description>

      <title>Towards Baikal-Top: Feasibility study of an onshore detector system for the joint registration of EAS with Baikal-GVD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the possibility of registering high-energy extensive air showers (EAS) by the onshore detector facility simultaneously with the trigger of the Baikal-GVD neutrino telescope. The location of the surface detector array on the shore of Lake Baikal is motivated by the fact that permanent placement of detectors on the surface of the lake is challenging. Within the given geometry, simultaneous registration is possible for EAS with a zenith angle of about 76 degrees within the limited solid angle. The corresponding inclined EAS are dominated by muons and significantly attenuated. The installation will make it possible to obtain an estimate of the number of high-energy muons in EAS. This, subsequently, would make it possible to verify EAS modeling and calculations of the atmospheric neutrino flux. The detector may also be used for cross-calibration of energy and direction measurements by the neutrino telescope. We use the CORSIKA program to simulate the registration of EAS on the shore close to the Baikal-GVD. The propagation of ultra-high energy muons produced by EAS through 3.5 km of water and their registration by Baikal-GVD is simulated using the PROPOSAL package. We calculate the minimal total area of the onshore detectors suitable for several cosmic ray energy thresholds, starting from 1 PeV. The report presents estimates of the number of events jointly registered by the onshore installation and the Baikal-GVD the EAS registration detector systems with different areas.</description>

      <title>Progress towards a microchannel plate detector with AlGaN photocathode and cross-strip anode for ultraviolet astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microchannel plates (MCPs) were the driving detector technology for ultraviolet (UV) astronomy over many years, and still today MCP-based detectors are the baseline for several planned UV instruments. The development of advanced MCP detectors is ongoing and pursues the major goals of maximizing sensitivity, resolution, and lifetime, while at the same time decreasing weight, volume, and power consumption.
  Development efforts for an MCP-based detector system for the UV are running at IAAT at the University of T\"ubingen. In this publication, we present our latest results towards coating aluminum gallium nitride (AlGaN) photocathodes directly on MCPs, to improve quantum detection efficiency in the far- and extreme-UV. Furthermore, we report on the implementation of a non-iterative centroiding algorithm for our coplanar cross-strip anode directly in an FPGA.</description>

      <title>Spaceflight KID Readout Electronics for PRIMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the design and testing of a prototype multiplexing kinetic inductance detector (KID) readout electronics for the PRobe far-Infrared Mission for Astrophysics (PRIMA) space mission. PRIMA is a Probe-class astrophysics mission concept that will answer fundamental questions about the formation of planetary systems, the co-evolution of stars and supermassive black holes in galaxies, and the rise of heavy elements and dust over cosmic time. The readout electronics for PRIMA must be compatible with operation at Earth-Sun L2 and capable of multiplexing more than 1000 detectors over 2.5 GHz bandwidth while consuming around 30 W per readout chain. The electronics must also be capable of switching between the two instruments, which have different readout bands: the hyperspectral imager (PRIMAger, 2.6-4.9 GHz) and the spectrometer (FIRESS, 0.4-2.4 GHz). The PRIMA readout electronics use high-heritage SpaceCube digital electronics with a build-to-print SpaceCube Mini v3.0 board using a radiation-tolerant Kintex KU060 field programmable gate array (FPGA) and a custom high-speed digitizer board, along with RF electronics that provide filtering and power conditioning. We present the driving requirements for the system, as well as the hardware, firmware, software, and system-level design that meets those requirements.</description>

      <title>aim-resolve: Automatic Identification and Modeling for Bayesian Radio Interferometric Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern radio interferometers deliver large volumes of data containing high-sensitivity sky maps over wide fields-of-view. These large area observations can contain various and superposed structures such as point sources, extended objects, and large-scale diffuse emission. To fully realize the potential of these observations, it is crucial to build appropriate sky emission models which separate and reconstruct the underlying astrophysical components. We introduce aim-resolve, an automatic and iterative method that combines the Bayesian imaging algorithm resolve with deep learning and clustering algorithms in order to jointly solve the reconstruction and source extraction problem. The method identifies and models different astrophysical components in radio observations while providing uncertainty quantification of the results. By using different model descriptions for point sources, extended objects, and diffuse background emission, the method efficiently separates the individual components and improves the overall reconstruction. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on synthetic image data containing multiple different sources. We further show the application of aim-resolve to an L-band (856 - 1712 MHz) MeerKAT observation of the radio galaxy ESO 137-006 and other radio galaxies in that environment. We observe a reasonable object identification for both applications, yielding a clean separation of the individual components and precise reconstructions of point sources and extended objects along with detailed uncertainty quantification. In particular, the method enables the creation of catalogs containing source positions and brightnesses and the corresponding uncertainties. The full decoupling of sky emission model and instrument response makes the method applicable to a wide variety of instruments or wavelength bands.</description>

      <title>Improving Posterior Inference of Galaxy Properties with Image-Based Conditional Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating physical properties of galaxies from wide-field surveys remains a central challenge in astrophysics. While spectroscopy provides precise measurements, it is observationally expensive, and photometry discards morphological information that correlates with mass, star formation history, metallicity, and dust. We present a conditional flow matching (CFM) framework that leverages pixel-level imaging alongside photometry to improve posterior inference of galaxy properties. Using $\sim10^5$ SDSS galaxies, we compare models trained on photometry alone versus photometry plus images. The image+photometry model outperforms the photometry-only model in posterior inference and more reliably recovers known scaling relations. Morphological information also helps mitigate the dust--age degeneracy. Our results highlight the potential of integrating morphology into photometric SED fitting pipelines, opening a pathway towards more accurate and physically informed constraints on galaxy properties.</description>

      <title>Responsible Discovery in Astrobiology: Lessons from Four Controversial Claims</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper examines four case studies of life-detection claims in astrobiology, covering both biosignatures and technosignatures: the 1877 "canals" on Mars, the 1976 Mars Viking landers experiments, the 2020 phosphine detection on Venus, and the 2020 Breakthrough Listen Candidate 1 (BLC1) signal. We analyse the process of discovery for each case, including how they were detected, the media reception, the ensuing scientific debate, the correction processes, and the time it took until an expert consensus was reached. We identify lessons learned while providing scientists, the scientific community, and science communicators with recommendations for approaching future claims of astrobiological discoveries. To avoid potential cognitive biases and mitigate premature conclusions, we stress the need for clear communication of uncertainties, as well as thorough debate and verification processes among the scientific community. These responsible approaches can strengthen the credibility of scientists, cultivate a supportive scientific community, and help astrobiology flourish as a field.</description>

Abstract: For kinetic modeling of plasma processes in space, a rejection-sampling procedure for generating a Kappa distribution in particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation is proposed. A Pareto distribution is employed as an envelope distribution. The procedure only requires uniform variates, and its acceptance efficiency is $\approx 0.73$--$0.8$.</description>

      <title>On angular dependent response to gravitational-wave signals for time-delay interferometry combinations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Space-based gravitational wave (GW) detectors are designed for wave sources in the millihertz band with different locations and orientations.
  Time-delay interferometry (TDI) technique is an indispensable ingredient in space-borne GW detection that effectively suppresses the laser phase noise.
  The abundant TDI solutions derived in the literature also feature distinct angular-dependent sensitivities.
  Because a GW source's angular location is unknown prior to the signals' detection, a solid-angle average is often performed when analyzing the sensitivity function of a given TDI combination.
  The present study explores the angular dependence of the detector's sensitivity.
  This detail is relevant, because once the initial detection is achieved, the source's location can be extracted and used to provide information on a refined TDI combination tailored for the specific GW source.
  As the TDI technique is a post-processing algorithm, such a procedure can be implemented in practice.
  We evaluate the angular dependence of the detector's response function to the GW signals for different TDI combinations as a function of the orientation angles.
  Moreover, we classify the response functions into seven categories at the low-frequency limit, leveraging the characteristics of the underlying geometrical TDI combinations.
  By further averaging out the azimuthal angle $\phi_D$ in the detector's plane, the main features of the resulting response functions and their zenithal dependence with respect to the GW source are scrutinized.
  The findings presented in this work provide pertinent insights for ongoing space-borne detector programs.</description>

Abstract: The detection of gravitational waves from compact binary coalescences has provided significant insights into our Universe, and the discovery of new and unique gravitational wave candidates from independent searches remains an ongoing field of research. In this work, we built a hybrid search pipeline that combines matched filtering and deep learning to identify stellar-mass binary black hole candidates from detector strain data. We first present results from a targeted injection study to benchmark the sensitivity of our method and compare it with existing search pipelines. We demonstrate that our hybrid approach has comparable sensitivity for injections with a source-frame chirp mass greater than 25$\,$M$_{\odot}$, and below this threshold our sensitivity drops off for signals with a network SNR less than 15. We also observe that our search method can identify a significant population of unique candidates. Furthermore, we conduct an offline search for gravitational wave candidates in the third observing run of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration (LVK), yielding 31 candidates previously reported by the LVK with a probability of astrophysical origin $p_{\rm astro}\geq0.5$. We identify two other candidates: one previously reported only in a search conducted by the Institute for Advanced Study, and one previously unreported promising new candidate with a $p_{\rm astro}$ of 0.63. This unique candidate has a high chirp mass and a high probability that the primary black hole is an intermediate-mass black hole.</description>

      <title>The role of distant pulsars in the detectability of continuous gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the imminent science goals of pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) is the detection of a continuous gravitational wave (CGW) emitted by an individual supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB). SMBHBs that cause CGWs with GW frequencies $f_\mathrm{GW} &gt; 10 \text{nHz}$ have undergone significant orbital evolution, hence a change of $f_\mathrm{GW}$ over time. In PTA data sets with sufficiently long observational time span, this means that the Earth and pulsar terms' contributions to the CGW signal signature can eventually become resolvable. Since the pulsar term is accumulated incoherently and thus often treated as an additional source of noise, this separation can prove to be beneficial for the detection of the CGW signal in the PTA data set. We aim to investigate to what extent resolvable Earth and pulsar terms affect currently used techniques for CGW searches with PTA data sets, that treat the pulsar term as an additional source noise. We focus on the dependency of the pulsar term frequencies on the pulsar's distance. We aim to answer the question of whether adding more distant pulsars to a PTA data set can mitigate biases and improve the detection of CGWs. We show that under ideal conditions, more distant pulsars can facilitate the CGW search with PTA data sets. Bayesian parameter estimation is yielding better parameter constraints and the frequentist per-frequentist optimal statistic search becomes more stable. However, using the realistic data set simulations, it was found that other configuration parameters of a PTA, such as the anisotropic distribution of pulsars and the effective number of pulsars in a PTA, can play a crucial role to the importance of this effect.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the Low-Mass Pre-Main-Sequence Population in the Low-Metallicity Star-Forming Region Dolidze 25 Using VLT-MUSE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The metallicity of the star-forming environment is a fundamental parameter shaping the evolution of protoplanetary disks and the formation of planetary systems, yet its influence remains poorly constrained. We present a spectroscopic study of low-mass pre-main sequence (PMS) stars ($M &lt; 1 \, M_\odot$) in the exceptionally metal-poor cluster Dolidze~25 ($Z \approx 0.2 \, Z_\odot$), using VLT/MUSE observations to probe accretion processes and disk evolution in a subsolar environment. We identify 132 cluster members using a combination of \textit{Gaia} astrometry and spectroscopic youth indicators, including lithium absorption and Balmer emission. The stellar parameters are derived using low-metallicity BT-Settl models yielding effective temperatures, extinctions, luminosities enabling robust estimates of stellar masses and ages. Mass accretion rates ($\dot{M}_\mathrm{acc}$) derived from H$\alpha$ emission span $10^{-10}$--$10^{-8} \, M_\odot\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ with a median value of \(8 \times 10^{-10}\,M_\odot\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}\). These rates are comparable to those in solar-metallicity regions of similar age, such as Lupus and Orion, indicating minimal metallicity dependence in accretion processes. Our analysis shows that using solar-metallicity templates to fit low-metallicity stars leads to systematic overestimations of \(T_\mathrm{eff}\) (by approximately \(300\,\mathrm{K}\)) and \(A_V\) (by around \(0.5\,\mathrm{mag}\)), underscoring the importance of employing metallicity-matched models for reliable characterization in low-\(Z\) environments. We present flux-calibrated, extinction-corrected spectra of these metal-poor PMS stars as a valuable resource for future investigations of disk evolution in subsolar regimes.</description>

      <title>287,872 Supermassive Black Holes Masses: Deep Learning Approaching Reverberation Mapping Accuracy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a population-scale catalogue of 287,872 supermassive black hole masses with high accuracy. Using a deep encoder-decoder network trained on optical spectra with reverberation-mapping (RM) based labels of 849 quasars and applied to all SDSS quasars up to $z=4$, our method achieves a root-mean-square error of $0.058$\,dex, a relative uncertainty of $\approx 14\%$, and coefficient of determination $R^{2}\approx0.91$ with respect to RM-based masses, far surpassing traditional single-line virial estimators. Notably, the high accuracy is maintained for both low ($&lt;10^{7.5}\,M_\odot$) and high ($&gt;10^{9}\,M_\odot$) mass quasars, where empirical relations are unreliable.</description>

      <title>Unveiling gravitational waves from core-collapse supernovae with MUSE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The core collapse of a massive star at the end of its life can give rise to one of the most powerful phenomena in the Universe. Because of violent mass motions that take place during the explosion, core-collapse supernovae have been considered a potential source of detectable gravitational waveforms for decades. However, their intrinsic stochasticity makes ineffective the use of modelled techniques such as matched filtering, forcing us to develop model independent technique to unveil their nature. In this work we present MUSE pipeline, which is based on a classification procedure of the time-frequency images using a Convolutional Neural Network. The network is trained on phenomenological waveforms that are built to mimic the main common features observed in numerical simulation. The method is finally tested on a representative 3D simulation catalog in the context of Einstein Telescope, a third generation GW telescope. Among the three detector geometries considered here, the 2L with a relative inclination of $45^\circ$ is the one achieving the best results, thus being able to detect a Kuroda2016-like waveform with an efficiency above $90\%$ at 50 kpc.</description>

      <title>Detecting relativistic black hole collisions near a massive black hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relativistic black hole collisions are one of the most dramatic astrophysical events that can be imagined. They could provide the ideal condition for searching for possible new physics beyond general relativity. However, such events are presumably rare and difficult to occur under normal conditions. Black holes in a triple system can be accelerated to the relativistic limit and may harbor the chance for a relativistic collision. In this paper, we study the relativistic black hole collisions in a massive black hole background and the capabilities of several current and future gravitational wave detectors in detecting such signals.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Optics-Enhanced Michelson Interferometer for Spectroscopy of Narrow-Band Light Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adaptive optics enables the deployment of interferometer-based spectroscopy without the need for moving parts necessary for scanning the interferometer arms. Here, we employ a Michelson Interferometer in conjunction with a Spatial Light Modulator (SLM) for determining the spectral profile of a narrow-band light source. Interestingly, we observe that the fringes across the interferometer output beam are inherently shifted in wavelength even when a constant phase profile is provided to the SLM. We calibrate the spectral shifts as a function of fringe spatial location by measuring the incident light spectrum at various points across the fringe pattern, and observe that the spectral peak traces out a `teardrop' shape, whose width is dependent on the spectral bandwidth of the source, the relative tilt and path difference between the two arms of the interferometer, and the divergence of the beam. Next, we demonstrate that this inherent spectral variation of the fringes can be used to perform fast single-snapshot spectroscopy of narrow-band light sources, while a time-varied phase profile provided to the SLM leads to multi-step spectroscopy with lower noise, higher resolution, and better contrast. Our findings establish that the Michelson Interferometer can be used to perform spectroscopy of any source within a certain spectral range from simple images of the fringe pattern, so as to facilitate exciting applications towards hyperspectral imaging.</description>

      <title>The position and resolvability of blended point sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we derive analytic expressions and numerical recipes for finding the effective observed position of sources close enough on sky that their Point Spread Functions (PSF), modelled as Gaussian profiles, overlap. In particularly we derive these for an elongated PSF, with a long and short axis, such as we would see from an instrument with a rectangular or elliptical mirror (relevant, for example, for the Gaia mission). We show that in this case the problem can be reduced to a one dimensional brightness profile with extrema along the line connecting the two sources, with an effective PSF width that depends on the relative orientation of the PSF and its degree of elongation. The problem can then be expressed in units of this effective width to be a function of the relative separation and light ratio alone (thus reducing to a rescaling of the un-elongated case). We derive the minimum light ratio, for a given separation and effective width, above which two sources will be resolved. We map out numerical procedures for finding the positions of these extrema across all possible cases. Finally we derive the positional offset and deviance associated with observing a fixed pair of blended sources from a variety of orientations, showing that this can be a significant source of excess noise.</description>

      <title>Exploring dark matter with quantum-enhanced haloscopes and time projection chambers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14897v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This thesis explores experimental and theoretical approaches to dark matter detection, from gas-based detectors to quantum sensors, tackling the challenge of identifying dark matter, which makes up 27% of the Universe's energy. It reviews astrophysical and cosmological evidence, highlights the Standard Model's limitations, and motivates searches for WIMPs, axions, and dark photons through direct, indirect, and collider-based strategies.
  The experimental work includes the Micromegas-based TREX-DM experiment for low-mass WIMPs, with studies of argon and neon-based gas mixtures, detector design, shielding, readout, and background suppression. GEM integration boosted gain by up to 45. A UV LED-based internal calibration system was developed for compact, low-background operation, while pressure-dependent gain studies optimized future low-background TPCs. The thesis also advances axion and dark photon searches via haloscopes and introduces the DarkQuantum prototype, a superconducting qubit coupled to microwave cavities for single-photon detection. This system enabled the most stringent exclusion limit on massive dark photon interactions at 5.051 GHz, demonstrating the feasibility of quantum-enhanced detectors.
  Overall, the work bridges classical and quantum detection techniques, advancing WIMP searches and pioneering compact quantum sensors for axion and dark photon detection, laying the foundation for future high-sensitivity dark matter experiments.</description>

      <title>Solar flare forecasting with foundational transformer models across image, video, and time-series modalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23400v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comparative study of transformer-based architectures for solar flare forecasting using heterogeneous data modalities, including images, video sequences, and time-series observations. Our analysis evaluates three recent foundational models - SigLIP2 for image encoding, VideoMAE for spatio-temporal video representation, and Moirai2 for multivariate time-series forecasting - applied to publicly available datasets of solar magnetograms from the SDO/HMI mission and soft X-ray fluxes acquired by GOES satellites. All models are trained and validated under consistent data splits and evaluation criteria, with the goal of assessing the strengths and limitations of transformer backbones across spatial and temporal representations of solar activity. We investigate multiple loss formulations (weighted BCE, focal, and score-oriented) and training balance strategies to mitigate class imbalance typical of flare datasets. Results show that while both SigLIP2 and VideoMAE achieve typical performance on image and video data (True Skill Statistic TSS~0.60-0.65), the time-series model Moirai2 reaches superior forecasting skill (TSS~0.74) using irradiance-based temporal evolution alone. These findings highlight the potential of pretrained transformer architectures and cross-modal learning for advancing operational space weather forecasting, paving the way toward unified multimodal models that integrate visual and temporal information.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Coma Cluster Structure: From the Core to the Hubble Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04135v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Coma cluster, embedded in a cosmic filament, is a complex and dynamically active structure in the local Universe. Applying a density-based member selection (\texttt{dbscan}) to data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), we identify its virialised core and zero-velocity boundary. Cross-correlating with the Cosmicflows-4 (CF4) catalogue enables a velocity-distance analysis, incorporating radial infall models and redshift-independent distance estimators. This reveals, for the first time, the Hubble flow surrounding Coma, a first step to investigate the entanglement between Coma's dark matter halo and the dark energy driving the expansion of the surroundings. The distance to the Coma centre is determined as $(69.959 \pm 0.012) \, h^{-1}~\text{Mpc}$. From \texttt{dbscan}, we infer a virial radius of $r_{\rm vir} = \left(1.95 \pm 0.12\right)\,h^{-1}~\text{Mpc}$ and a turnaround of $r_{\rm ta} \geq 4.87~{h}^{-1}~\mbox{Mpc}$. Combining the SDSS redshifts with the CF4 distances, we estimate the Hubble constant to be $H_0 = (73.10 \pm 0.92)~\mbox{km}/\mbox{s}/\mbox{Mpc}$, which varies between $[72, 80]$~km/s/Mpc with different calibrations for the distance moduli. Mass estimates via caustics, the virial theorem and the Hubble-flow method yield $M = [0.77, 2.0] \times 10^{15}\,h^{-1}\,M_{\odot}$, consistent with prior mass estimates. However, our mass estimates are based on fewer model assumptions in the member selection and require fewer members to attain the same precision. Our systematic approach maps the structure of Coma into the local Hubble flow and shows the degeneracies between dynamical parameters such as the Hubble constant, the virial radius, and the total mass.</description>
