      <title>Restricted CSPs and F-free Digraph Algorithmics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, much attention has been placed on the complexity of graph homomorphism problems when the input is restricted to ${\mathbb P}_k$-free and ${\mathbb P}_k$-subgraph-free graphs. We consider the directed version of this research line, by addressing the questions, is it true that digraph homomorphism problems CSP$({\mathbb H})$ have a P versus NP-complete dichotomy when the input is restricted to $\vec{\mathbb P}_k$-free (resp.\ $\vec{\mathbb P}_k$-subgraph-free) digraphs? Our main contribution in this direction shows that if CSP$({\mathbb H})$ is NP-complete, then there is a positive integer $N$ such that CSP$({\mathbb H})$ remains NP-hard even for $\vec{\mathbb P}_N$-subgraph-free digraphs. Moreover, it remains NP-hard for acyclic $\vec{\mathbb P}_N$-subgraph-free digraphs, and becomes polynomial-time solvable for $\vec{\mathbb P}_{N-1}$-subgraph-free acyclic digraphs. We then verify the questions above for digraphs on three vertices and a family of smooth tournaments. We prove these results by establishing a connection between $\mathbb F$-(subgraph)-free algorithmics and constraint satisfaction theory. On the way, we introduce restricted CSPs, i.e., problems of the form CSP$({\mathbb H})$ restricted to yes-instances of CSP$({\mathbb H}')$ -- these were called restricted homomorphism problems by Hell and Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il. Another main result of this paper presents a P versus NP-complete dichotomy for these problems. Moreover, this complexity dichotomy is accompanied by an algebraic dichotomy in the spirit of the finite domain CSP dichotomy.</description>

      <title>Simulating Time With Square-Root Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that for all functions $t(n) \geq n$, every multitape Turing machine running in time $t$ can be simulated in space only $O(\sqrt{t \log t})$. This is a substantial improvement over Hopcroft, Paul, and Valiant's simulation of time $t$ in $O(t/\log t)$ space from 50 years ago [FOCS 1975, JACM 1977]. Among other results, our simulation implies that bounded fan-in circuits of size $s$ can be evaluated on any input in only $\sqrt{s} \cdot poly(\log s)$ space, and that there are explicit problems solvable in $O(n)$ space which require $n^{2-\varepsilon}$ time on a multitape Turing machine for all $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, thereby making a little progress on the $P$ versus $PSPACE$ problem.
  Our simulation reduces the problem of simulating time-bounded multitape Turing machines to a series of implicitly-defined Tree Evaluation instances with nice parameters, leveraging the remarkable space-efficient algorithm for Tree Evaluation recently found by Cook and Mertz [STOC 2024].</description>

      <title>Property Testing in Bounded Degree Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the study of property testing on hypergraphs initiated by Czumaj and Sohler (Theoretical Computer Science, 2005). Provided oracle access to a hypergraph, our goal is to distinguish between the case it has a certain property and the case it is "far" from having this property. Here, we assume that hypergraphs are represented by bounded-length incidence lists and we measure distances between them as a fraction of the maximum possible number of hyperedges. This contrasts with previous work where representations were given by adjacency matrices and distances by fractions of all possible vertex tuples. Thus, while the previous model is better for studying dense hypergraphs, ours is more effective for testing those of bounded-degree. In particular, our model can be seen as an extension to hypergraphs of the graph testing framework introduced by Goldreich and Ron (Algorithmica, 2002). In this framework, we analyse the query complexity of three fundamental hypergraph properties: colorability, $k$-partiteness, and independence number. We show that $k$-partiteness within families of $k$-uniform $n$-vertex hypergraphs of bounded treewidth is strongly testable. Our algorithm always accepts when the hypergraph is $k$-partite, and rejects with high probability if it is $\varepsilon$-far from $k$-partiteness. In addition, we prove optimal lower bounds of $\Omega(n)$ on the query complexity of testing algorithms for $k$-colorability, $k$-partiteness, and independence number in $k$-uniform $n$-vertex hypergraphs of bounded degree. For each of these properties, as an independently interesting combinatorial question, we consider the problem of explicitly constructing $k$-uniform hypergraphs of bounded degree that differ in $\Theta(n)$ hyperedges from any hypergraph satisfying the property, but where violations of the latter cannot be detected in any neighborhood of $o(n)$ vertices.</description>

      <title>An unconditional lower bound for the active-set method on the hypercube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The existence of a polynomial-time pivot rule for the simplex method is a fundamental open question in optimization. While many super-polynomial lower bounds exist for individual or very restricted classes of pivot rules, there currently is little hope for an unconditional lower bound that addresses all pivot rules. We approach this question by considering the active-set method as a natural generalization of the simplex method to non-linear objectives. This generalization allows us to prove the first unconditional lower bound for all pivot rules. More precisely, we construct a multivariate polynomial of degree linear in the number of dimensions such that the active-set method started in the origin visits all vertices of the hypercube. We hope that our framework serves as a starting point for a new angle of approach to understanding the complexity of the simplex method.</description>

      <title>Pauli measurements are not optimal for single-copy tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum state tomography is a fundamental problem in quantum computing. Given $n$ copies of an unknown $N$-qubit state $\rho \in \mathbb{C}^{d \times d},d=2^N$, the goal is to learn the state up to an accuracy $\epsilon$ in trace distance, with at least probability 0.99. We are interested in the copy complexity, the minimum number of copies of $\rho$ needed to fulfill the task.
  Pauli measurements have attracted significant attention due to their ease of implementation in limited settings. The best-known upper bound is $O(\frac{N \cdot 12^N}{\epsilon^2})$, and no non-trivial lower bound is known besides the general single-copy lower bound $\Omega(\frac{8^n}{\epsilon^2})$, achieved by hard-to-implement structured POVMs such as MUB, SIC-POVM, and uniform POVM.
  We have made significant progress on this long-standing problem. We first prove a stronger upper bound of $O(\frac{10^N}{\epsilon^2})$. To complement it with a lower bound of $\Omega(\frac{9.118^N}{\epsilon^2})$, which holds under adaptivity. To our knowledge, this demonstrates the first known separation between Pauli measurements and structured POVMs.
  The new lower bound is a consequence of a novel framework for adaptive quantum state tomography with measurement constraints. The main advantage over prior methods is that we can use measurement-dependent hard instances to prove tight lower bounds for Pauli measurements. Moreover, we connect the copy-complexity lower bound to the eigenvalues of the measurement information channel, which governs the measurement's capacity to distinguish states. To demonstrate the generality of the new framework, we obtain tight-bounds for adaptive quantum tomography with $k$-outcome measurements, where we recover existing results and establish new ones.</description>

      <title>Factorization norms and Zarankiewicz problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $\gamma_2$-norm of Boolean matrices plays an important role in communication complexity and discrepancy theory. In this paper, we study combinatorial properties of this norm, and provide new applications, involving Zarankiewicz type problems. We show that if $M$ is an $m\times n$ Boolean matrix such that $\gamma_2(M)&lt;\gamma$ and $M$ contains no $t\times t$ all-ones submatrix, then $M$ contains $O_{\gamma,t}(m+n)$ one entries. In other words, graphs of bounded $\gamma_2$-norm are degree bounded. This addresses a conjecture of Hambardzumyan, Hatami, and Hatami for locally sparse matrices. We prove that if $G$ is a $K_{t,t}$-free incidence graph of $n$ points and $n$ homothets of a polytope $P$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$, then the average degree of $G$ is $O_{d,P}(t(\log n)^{O(d)})$. This is sharp up the $O(.)$ notations. In particular, we prove a more general result on semilinear graphs, which greatly strengthens the work of Basit, Chernikov, Starchenko, Tao, and Tran. We present further results about dimension-free bounds on the discrepancy of matrices based on oblivious data structures, and a simple method to estimate the $\gamma_2$-norm of Boolean matrices with no four cycles.</description>

      <title>Computability of extender sets in multidimensional subshifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07549v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Subshifts are colorings of $\mathbb{Z}^d$ defined by families of forbidden patterns. Given a subshift and a finite pattern, its extender set is the set of admissible completions of this pattern. It has been conjectured that the behavior of extender sets, and in particular their growth called extender entropy (arXiv:1711.07515), could provide a way to separate the classes of sofic and effective subshifts. We prove here that both classes have the same possible extender entropies: exactly the $\Pi_3$ real numbers of $[0,+\infty)$. We also consider computational properties of extender entropies for subshifts with some language or dynamical properties: computable language, minimal and some mixing properties.</description>

      <title>On the Unprovability of Circuit Size Bounds in Intuitionistic $\mathsf{S}^1_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11841v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that there is a constant $k$ such that Buss's intuitionistic theory $\mathsf{IS}^1_2$ does not prove that SAT requires co-nondeterministic circuits of size at least $n^k$. To our knowledge, this is the first unconditional unprovability result in bounded arithmetic in the context of worst-case fixed-polynomial size circuit lower bounds. We complement this result by showing that the upper bound $\mathsf{NP} \subseteq \mathsf{coNSIZE}[n^k]$ is unprovable in $\mathsf{IS}^1_2$.
  In order to establish our main result, we obtain new unconditional lower bounds against refuters that might be of independent interest. In particular, we show that there is no efficient refuter for the lower bound $\mathsf{NP} \nsubseteq \mathsf{i.o}\text{-}\mathsf{coNP}/\mathsf{poly}$, addressing in part a question raised by Atserias (2006).</description>

      <title>Transformer Encoder Satisfiability: Complexity and Impact on Formal Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18548v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyse the complexity of the satisfiability problem, or similarly feasibility problem, (trSAT) for transformer encoders (TE), which naturally occurs in formal verification or interpretation, collectively referred to as formal reasoning. We find that trSAT is undecidable when considering TE as they are commonly studied in the expressiveness community. Furthermore, we identify practical scenarios where trSAT is decidable and establish corresponding complexity bounds. Beyond trivial cases, we find that quantized TE, those restricted by fixed-width arithmetic, lead to the decidability of trSAT due to their limited attention capabilities. However, the problem remains difficult, as we establish scenarios where trSAT is NEXPTIME-hard and others where it is solvable in NEXPTIME for quantized TE. To complement our complexity results, we place our findings and their implications in the broader context of formal reasoning.</description>

      <title>Optimal Sensor and Actuator Selection for Factored Markov Decision Processes: Complexity, Approximability and Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07310v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Factored Markov Decision Processes (fMDPs) are a class of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) in which the states (and actions) can be factored into a set of state (and action) variables and can be encoded compactly using a factored representation. In this paper, we consider a setting where the state of the fMDP is not directly observable, and the agent relies on a set of potential sensors to gather information. Each sensor has a selection cost and the designer must select a subset of sensors under a limited budget. We formulate the problem of selecting a set of sensors for fMDPs (under a budget) to maximize the infinite-horizon discounted return provided by the optimal policy. We show the fundamental result that it is NP-hard to approximate this problem to within any non-trivial factor. Our inapproximability results for optimal sensor selection also extend to a general class of Partially Observable MDPs (POMDPs). We then study the dual problem of budgeted actuator selection (at design-time) to maximize the expected return under the optimal policy. Again, we show that it is NP-hard to approximate this problem to within any non-trivial factor. Furthermore, with explicit examples, we show the failure of greedy algorithms for both the sensor and actuator selection problems and provide insights into the factors that cause these problems to be challenging. Despite this, through extensive simulations, we show the practical effectiveness and near-optimal performance of the greedy algorithm for actuator and sensor selection in many real-world and randomly generated instances.</description>

Abstract: We exhibit a total search problem with classically verifiable solutions whose communication complexity in the quantum SMP model is exponentially smaller than in the classical two-way randomized model. Our problem is a bipartite version of a query complexity problem recently introduced by Yamakawa and Zhandry (JACM 2024). We prove the classical lower bound using the structure-vs-randomness paradigm for analyzing communication protocols.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the Distinguishability of Product Distributions through Multicalibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03562v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a sequence of samples $x_1, \dots , x_k$ promised to be drawn from one of two distributions $X_0, X_1$, a well-studied problem in statistics is to decide $\textit{which}$ distribution the samples are from. Information theoretically, the maximum advantage in distinguishing the two distributions given $k$ samples is captured by the total variation distance between $X_0^{\otimes k}$ and $X_1^{\otimes k}$. However, when we restrict our attention to $\textit{efficient distinguishers}$ (i.e., small circuits) of these two distributions, exactly characterizing the ability to distinguish $X_0^{\otimes k}$ and $X_1^{\otimes k}$ is more involved and less understood.
  In this work, we give a general way to reduce bounds on the computational indistinguishability of $X_0$ and $X_1$ to bounds on the $\textit{information-theoretic}$ indistinguishability of some specific, related variables $\widetilde{X}_0$ and $\widetilde{X}_1$. As a consequence, we prove a new, tight characterization of the number of samples $k$ needed to efficiently distinguish $X_0^{\otimes k}$ and $X_1^{\otimes k}$ with constant advantage as
  \[
  k = \Theta\left(d_H^{-2}\left(\widetilde{X}_0, \widetilde{X}_1\right)\right),
  \] which is the inverse of the squared Hellinger distance $d_H$ between two distributions $\widetilde{X}_0$ and $\widetilde{X}_1$ that are computationally indistinguishable from $X_0$ and $X_1$. Likewise, our framework can be used to re-derive a result of Geier (TCC 2022), proving nearly-tight bounds on how computational indistinguishability scales with the number of samples for arbitrary product distributions.</description>

      <title>The Complexity of Symmetric Equilibria in Min-Max Optimization and Team Zero-Sum Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08519v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of computing stationary points in min-max optimization, with a particular focus on the special case of computing Nash equilibria in (two-)team zero-sum games.
  We first show that computing $\epsilon$-Nash equilibria in $3$-player \emph{adversarial} team games -- wherein a team of $2$ players competes against a \emph{single} adversary -- is \textsf{CLS}-complete, resolving the complexity of Nash equilibria in such settings. Our proof proceeds by reducing from \emph{symmetric} $\epsilon$-Nash equilibria in \emph{symmetric}, identical-payoff, two-player games, by suitably leveraging the adversarial player so as to enforce symmetry -- without disturbing the structure of the game. In particular, the class of instances we construct comprises solely polymatrix games, thereby also settling a question left open by Hollender, Maystre, and Nagarajan (2024). We also provide some further results concerning equilibrium computation in adversarial team games.
  Moreover, we establish that computing \emph{symmetric} (first-order) equilibria in \emph{symmetric} min-max optimization is \textsf{PPAD}-complete, even for quadratic functions. Building on this reduction, we further show that computing symmetric $\epsilon$-Nash equilibria in symmetric, $6$-player ($3$ vs. $3$) team zero-sum games is also \textsf{PPAD}-complete, even for $\epsilon = \text{poly}(1/n)$. As an immediate corollary, this precludes the existence of symmetric dynamics -- which includes many of the algorithms considered in the literature -- converging to stationary points. Finally, we prove that computing a \emph{non-symmetric} $\text{poly}(1/n)$-equilibrium in symmetric min-max optimization is \textsf{FNP}-hard.</description>
