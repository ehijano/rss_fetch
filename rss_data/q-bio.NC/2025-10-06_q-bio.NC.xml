      <title>Accurate linear modeling of EEG-based cortical activity during a passive motor task with input: a sub-space identification approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies linear mathematical modeling of brain's cortical dynamics using electroencephalography (EEG) data in an experiment with continuous exogenous input. The EEG data were recorded while participants were seated with their wrist strapped to a haptic manipulator. The manipulator imposed a continuous multisine angular perturbation to the wrist as the exogenous input to the brain. We show that subspace identification, in particular the PO-MOESP algorithm, leads to a linear time-invariant state-space model that accurately represents the measurements, in a latent space, assuming that the EEG data are the models' output. The model is verified and validated using data from seven participants. Moreover, we construct linear maps to relate the latent space dynamics to the neural source space. We show that findings by our model align with those identified in previous studies.</description>

      <title>Pyk2 plays a critical role in synaptic dysfunction during the early stages of Alzheimer's disease</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: The locus of the gene PTK2B encoding the tyrosine kinase Pyk2 has been associated with the risk of late-onset Alzheimer's disease, the predominant form of dementia. Pyk2 is primarily expressed in neurons where it is involved in excitatory neurotransmission and synaptic functions. Although previous studies have implicated Pyk2 in amyloid-$\beta$ and Tau pathologies of Alzheimer's disease, its exact role remains unresolved, with evidence showing both detrimental and protective effects in mouse models. Here, we investigate the role of Pyk2 in hippocampal hyperactivity, Tau phosphorylation and synaptic loss associated with Alzheimer's disease-related alterations occurring in the early stages of the disease. Methods: Pyk2's involvement in amyloid-$\beta$ oligomer-induced hippocampal neuronal hyperactivity was investigated using whole cell patch-clamp in hippocampal slices from WT and Pyk2 KO mice. Various Pyk2 mutants were overexpressed in cultured cortical neurons to study Pyk2's role in synaptic loss. Pyk2 and Tau interaction was assessed with bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays in cultured neurons and co-immunoprecipitation in mouse cortex. Pyk2's ability to directly phosphorylate Tau was determined using in vitro kinase assays. To evaluate the impact of Pyk2 on Tau expression and phosphorylation in synapses, cellular fractionation was performed on hippocampi from WT and Pyk2 KO mice. Results: Genetic deletion of Pyk2 prevented amyloid-$\beta$ oligomer-induced hippocampal neuronal hyperactivity and synaptic loss. Overexpression of Pyk2 in neurons decreased dendritic spine density independently of its autophosphorylation or kinase activity, but through its proline-rich motif 1. Furthermore, Pyk2 interacted with Tau in synapses and directly phosphorylated it at Tyr18 in vitro, while Pyk2 deletion decreased Tau phosphorylation at Thr181 and its synaptic localization in the hippocampus. Conclusions: Pyk2 contributes to hippocampal neuronal hyperactivity and synaptic loss, two early events in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. It is also involved in Tau synaptic localization and phosphorylation, processes known to be detrimental in Alzheimer's disease. These findings highlight Pyk2 as a critical player in Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology and suggest its potential as a promising therapeutic target for early intervention.</description>

      <title>The Principle of Isomorphism: A Theory of Population Activity in Grid Cells and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying the principles that determine neural population activity is paramount in the field of neuroscience. We propose the Principle of Isomorphism (PIso): population activity preserves the essential mathematical structures of the tasks it supports. Using grid cells as a model system, we show that the neural metric task is characterized by a flat Riemannian manifold, while path integration is characterized by an Abelian Lie group. We prove that each task independently constrains population activity to a toroidal topology. We further show that these perspectives are unified naturally in Euclidean space, where commutativity and flatness are intrinsically compatible and can be extended to related systems including head-direction cells and 3D grid cells. To examine how toroidal topology maps onto single-cell firing patterns, we develop a minimal network architecture that explicitly constrains population activity to toroidal manifolds. Our model robustly generates hexagonal firing fields and reveals systematic relationships between network parameters and grid spacings. Crucially, we demonstrate that conformal isometry, a commonly proposed hypothesis, alone is insufficient for hexagonal field formation. Our findings establish a direct link between computational tasks and the hexagonal-toroidal organization of grid cells, thereby providing a general framework for understanding population activity in neural systems and designing task-informed architectures in machine learning.</description>

      <title>Selective disruption of reach-related saccade timing following a middle-cerebral artery stroke</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Coordinated control of eye and hand movements is critical for nearly all goal-directed actions, underpinning tasks ranging from simple object manipulation to complex tool use. This coordination relies on temporal coupling between reach and saccade. Stroke disrupts this process at several levels. Methods: We conducted a comparative eye-tracking study on patients with history of stroke vs. control performing various tasks. We used the Kinereach motion-tracking system with integrated eye-tracking functionality for data collection. Results: Stroke participants showed a flat distribution of saccade timing, with no clear peak or alignment to the onset of the reach. In terms of spatial performance, reach gain, the primary index of functional accuracy, revealed that stroke participants reaches were significantly hypometric compared to those of controls. In the segmented look-then-reach condition, stroke participants demonstrated a restoration of a unimodal saccade timing distribution, time-locked to the saccade cue. Conclusion: Our findings highlight a dissociation between motor execution and coordination in stroke, emphasizing that intact movement components do not guarantee intact motor integration. By identifying a reversible, cue-sensitive disruption in saccade timing linked specifically to its coordination within a reaching movement, this work points toward new opportunities for rehabilitation aimed not only at motor strength and speed, but at training and re-establishing the natural temporal structure of action.</description>

      <title>Stimulus-Voltage-Based Prediction of Action Potential Onset Timing: Classical vs. Quantum-Inspired Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate modeling of neuronal action potential (AP) onset timing is crucial for understanding neural coding of danger signals. Traditional leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) models, while widely used, exhibit high relative error in predicting AP onset latency, especially under strong or rapidly changing stimuli. Inspired by recent experimental findings and quantum theory, we present a quantum-inspired leaky integrate-and-fire (QI-LIF) model that treats AP onset as a probabilistic event, represented by a Gaussian wave packet in time. This approach captures the biological variability and uncertainty inherent in neuronal firing. We systematically compare the relative error of AP onset predictions between the classical LIF and QI-LIF models using synthetic data from hippocampal and sensory neurons subjected to varying stimulus amplitudes. Our results demonstrate that the QI-LIF model significantly reduces prediction error, particularly for high-intensity stimuli, aligning closely with observed biological responses. This work highlights the potential of quantum-inspired computational frameworks in advancing the accuracy of neural modeling and has implications for quantum engineering approaches to brain-inspired computing.</description>

      <title>Mean-field analysis of a neural network with stochastic STDP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analysing biological spiking neural network models with synaptic plasticity has proven to be challenging both theoretically and numerically. In a network with N all-to-all connected neurons, the number of synaptic connections is on the order of $N^2$, making these models computationally demanding. Furthermore, the intricate coupling between neuron and synapse dynamics, along with the heterogeneity generated by plasticity, hinder the use of classic theoretical tools such as mean-field or slow-fast analyses. To address these challenges, we introduce a new variable which we term a typical neuron X. Viewed as a post-synaptic neuron, X is composed of the activity state V , the time since its last spike S, and the empirical distribution $\xi$ of the triplet V , S and W (incoming weight) associated to the pre-synaptic neurons. In particular, we study a stochastic spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) model of connection in a probabilistic Wilson-Cowan spiking neural network model, which features binary neural activity. Taking the large N limit, we obtain from the empirical distribution of the typical neuron a simplified yet accurate representation of the original spiking network. This mean-field limit is a piecewise deterministic Markov process (PDMP) of McKean-Vlasov type, where the typical neuron dynamics depends on its own distribution. We term this analysis McKean-Vlasov mean-field (MKV-MF). Our approach not only reduces computational complexity but also provides insights into the dynamics of this spiking neural network with plasticity. The model obtained is mathematically exact and capable of tracking transient changes. This analysis marks the first exploration of MKV-MF dynamics in a network of spiking neurons interacting with STDP.</description>

      <title>Accurate identification of communication between multiple interacting neural populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19094v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural recording technologies now enable simultaneous recording of population activity across many brain regions, motivating the development of data-driven models of communication between brain regions. However, existing models can struggle to disentangle the sources that influence recorded neural populations, leading to inaccurate portraits of inter-regional communication. Here, we introduce Multi-Region Latent Factor Analysis via Dynamical Systems (MR-LFADS), a sequential variational autoencoder designed to disentangle inter-regional communication, inputs from unobserved regions, and local neural population dynamics. We show that MR-LFADS outperforms existing approaches at identifying communication across dozens of simulations of task-trained multi-region networks. When applied to large-scale electrophysiology, MR-LFADS predicts brain-wide effects of circuit perturbations that were held out during model fitting. These validations on synthetic and real neural data position MR-LFADS as a promising tool for discovering principles of brain-wide information processing.</description>

      <title>VarCoNet: A variability-aware self-supervised framework for functional connectome extraction from resting-state fMRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02120v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accounting for inter-individual variability in brain function is key to precision medicine. Here, by considering functional inter-individual variability as meaningful data rather than noise, we introduce VarCoNet, an enhanced self-supervised framework for robust functional connectome (FC) extraction from resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) data. VarCoNet employs self-supervised contrastive learning to exploit inherent functional inter-individual variability, serving as a brain function encoder that generates FC embeddings readily applicable to downstream tasks even in the absence of labeled data. Contrastive learning is facilitated by a novel augmentation strategy based on segmenting rs-fMRI signals. At its core, VarCoNet integrates a 1D-CNN-Transformer encoder for advanced time-series processing, enhanced with a robust Bayesian hyperparameter optimization. Our VarCoNet framework is evaluated on two downstream tasks: (i) subject fingerprinting, using rs-fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project, and (ii) autism spectrum disorder (ASD) classification, using rs-fMRI data from the ABIDE I and ABIDE II datasets. Using different brain parcellations, our extensive testing against state-of-the-art methods, including 13 deep learning methods, demonstrates VarCoNet's superiority, robustness, interpretability, and generalizability. Overall, VarCoNet provides a versatile and robust framework for FC analysis in rs-fMRI.</description>
