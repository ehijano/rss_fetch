      <title>The new combinatorial identities of symmetric functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide some novel binomial convolution related to symmetric functions, as well as convolution sums without the binomial symbol. Moreover we give some new convolution sums of Bernoulli, Euler, and Genocchi numbers and polynomials with symmetric functions , by making use of the elementary methods including exponential generating functions. From these convolutions we deduce several new combinatorial identities for bivariate polynomials, and we establish several new identities related Bernoulli, Euler and Genocchi numbers and polynomials with certain bivariate polynomials such as bivariate Fibonacci, bivariate Lucas, bivariate balancing and bivariate balancing-Lucas polynomials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We classify the complementary vectors of doubly Cohen-Macaulay complexes. This proves a conjecture of Swartz, negatively answers a question of Athanasiadis and Tzanaki, and gives new bounds on the number of independent sets in a matroid. Our technique works more generally for certain level quotients of Stanley-Reisner rings, giving new bounds on the face numbers of Buchsbaum* complexes.</description>

      <title>On the structure of (dart, odd hole)-free graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A hole is a chordless cycle with at least four vertices. A hole is odd if it has an odd number of vertices. A dart is a graph which vertices a, b, c, d, e and edges ab, bc, bd, be, cd, de. Dart-free graphs have been actively studied in the literature. We prove that a (dart, odd hole)-free graph is perfect, or does not contain a stable set on three vertices, or is the join or co-join of two smaller graphs. Using this structure result, we design a polynomial- time algorithm for finding an optimal colouring of (dart, odd hole)-free graphs. A graph G is perfectly divisible if every induced subgraph H of G contains a set X of vertices such that X meets all largest cliques of H, and X induces a perfect graph. The chromatic number of a perfectly divisible graph G is bounded by {\omega}^2 where {\omega} denotes the number of vertices in a largest clique of G. We prove that (dart, odd hole)-free graphs are perfectly divisible.</description>

      <title>Trees in the Largest Order With a Given Burning Number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph burning is modelled upon the spread of contagion, and the burning number measures the speed of the spread. By the fact that the burning number of a connected graph is the minimum burning number of its spanning trees, our work focuses on identifying the largest order of a general tree with a given burning number up to homeomorphism. In this work, we propose the concept of admissible sequences over a homeomorphically irreducible tree in addition to developing a general framework. We then determine whether an admissible sequence induces a tree with a given burning number of the largest order. Additionally, we obtain some results on the smallest attainable diameter of an $n$-spider having the largest order with a given burning number.</description>

      <title>On the minimum constant resistance curvature conjecture of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected graph with $n$ vertices. The resistance distance $\Omega_{G}(i,j)$ between any two vertices $i$ and $j$ of $G$ is defined as the effective resistance between them in the electrical network constructed from $G$ by replacing each edge with a unit resistor. The resistance matrix of $G$, denoted by $R_G$, is an $n \times n$ matrix whose $(i,j)$-entry is equal to $\Omega_{G}(i,j)$. The resistance curvature $\kappa_i$ in the vertex $i$ is defined as the $i$-th component of the vector $(R_G)^{-1}\mathbf{1}$, where $\mathbf{1}$ denotes the all-one vector. If all the curvatures in the vertices of $G$ are equal, then we say that $G$ has constant resistance curvature. Recently, Devriendt, Ottolini and Steinerberger \cite{kde} conjectured that the cycle $C_n$ is extremal in the sense that its curvature is minimum among graphs with constant resistance curvature. In this paper, we confirm the conjecture. As a byproduct, we also solve an open problem proposed by Xu, Liu, Yang and Das \cite{kxu} in 2016. Our proof mainly relies on the characterization of maximum value of the sum of resistance distances from a given vertex to all the other vertices in 2-connected graphs.</description>

      <title>Odd coloring of $k$-trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An odd coloring of a graph is a proper coloring such that every non-isolated vertex has a color that appears at an odd number of its neighbors. This notion was introduced by Petr\v{s}evski and \v{S}krekovski in 2022. In this paper, we focus on odd coloring of $k$-trees, where a $k$-tree is a graph obtained from the complete graph of order $k+1$ by recursively adding a new vertex that is joined to a clique of order $k$ in the former graph. It follows from a result of Cranston, Lafferty, and Song in 2023 that every $k$-tree is odd $(2k+1)$-colorable. We improve this bound to show that every $k$-tree is odd $\left(k+2\left\lfloor\log_2 k\right\rfloor+3\right)$-colorable. Furthermore, when $k=2,3$, we show the tight bound that every 2-tree is odd $4$-colorable and that every 3-tree is odd $5$-colorable.</description>

      <title>Unavoidable subgraphs in digraphs with large out-degrees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We ask the question, which oriented trees $T$ must be contained as subgraphs in every finite directed graph of sufficiently large minimum out-degree. We formulate the following simple condition: all vertices in $T$ of in-degree at least $2$ must be on the same 'level' in the natural height function of $T$. We prove this condition to be necessary and conjecture it to be sufficient. In support of our conjecture, we prove it for a fairly general class of trees.
  An essential tool in the latter proof, and a question interesting in its own right, is finding large subdivided in-stars in a directed graph of large minimum out-degree. We conjecture that any digraph and oriented graph of minimum out-degree at least $k\ell$ and $k\ell/2$, respectively, contains the $(k-1)$-subdivision of the in-star with $\ell$ leaves as a subgraph; this would be tight and generalizes a conjecture of Thomass\'e. We prove this for digraphs and $k=2$ up to a factor of less than $4$.</description>

      <title>Unimodality of the number of paths per length on polytopes: Examples, counter-examples, and central limit theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To solve a linear program, the simplex method follows a path in the graph of a polytope, on which a linear function increases. The length of this path is an key measure of the complexity of the simplex method. Numerous previous articles focused on the longest paths, or, following Borgwardt, computed the average length of a path for certain random polytopes. We detail more precisely how this length is distributed, i.e., how many paths of each length there are.
  It was conjectured by De Loera that the number of paths counted according to their length forms a unimodal sequence. We give examples (old and new) for which this holds; but we disprove this conjecture by constructing counterexamples for several classes of polytopes. However, De Loera is "statistically correct": We prove that the length of coherent paths on a random polytope (with vertices chosen uniformly on a sphere) admits a central limit theorem.</description>

      <title>Digraph-defined external difference families and new circular external difference families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: External difference families (EDFs) are combinatorial objects which were introduced in the early 2000s, motivated by information security applications; various generalizations have since been defined and investigated, in particular strong EDFs (SEDFs) and circular EDFs (CEDFs). We present a framework based on graphs and digraphs which offers a new unified way to view these structures, and leads to natural new research questions. We present constructions and structural results about these digraph-defined EDFs, and we obtain new explicit constructions for infinite families of CEDFs, in particular $(ml^2,m,l,1)$-CEDFs. We construct the first infinite family of such CEDFs in non-cyclic abelian groups; these have odd values of $m$ and $l$. We also present the first CEDF in a non-abelian group.</description>

      <title>Trapezodial property of the generalized Alexander polynomial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fox's conjecture from 1962, that the absolute values of the coefficients of the Alexander polynomial of an alternating link are trapezoidal, has remained stubbornly open to this date. Recently Fox's conjecture was settled for all special alternating links. In this paper we take a broad view of the Alexander polynomials of special alternating links, showing that they are a generating function for a statistic on certain vector configurations. We study three types of vector configurations: (1) vectors arising from cographic matroids, (2) vectors arising from graphic matroids, (3) vectors arising from totally positive matrices. We prove that Alexander polynomials of special alternating links belong to both classes (1) and (2), and prove log-concavity, respectively trapezoidal, properties for classes (2) and (3). As a special case of our results, we obtain a new proof of Fox's conjecture for special alternating links.</description>

      <title>The Redei-Berge function in noncommuting variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Stanley and Grinberg introduced a symmetric function associated to digraphs, called the Redei-Berge symmetric function. This function, however, does not satisfy the deletion-contraction property, which is a very powerful tool for proving various identities using induction. In this paper, we introduce an analogue of this function in noncommuting variables which does have such property. Furthermore, it specializes to the ordinary Redei-Berge function when the variables are allowed to commute. This modification allows us to further generalize properties that are already proved for the original function and to deduce many new ones.</description>

Abstract: Stanley and Grinberg introduced a symmetric function associated with digraphs and named it the Redei-Berge symmetric function. This function arises from a suitable combinatorial Hopf algebra on digraphs, which made it possible to assign the Redei-Berge function to posets. In this paper, we define a new combinatorial Hopf algebra of posets whose character is a close cousin of the Redei-Berge character for posets. Further, we investigate the properties of the symmetric function that arises from this algebra and explore its expansions in various natural bases of $QSym$ and $Sym$. Finally, we obtain an interesting method for decomposing a poset.</description>

      <title>Coloring graphs as complete graph invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a graph $G$, the $k$-coloring graph $\mathcal{C}_{k}(G)$ is obtained by taking the vertices to be the proper $k$-colorings of $G$ and two $k$-colorings are incident if they differ exactly on one vertex of $G$. Hogan, Scott, Tamitegama and Tan recently proved that $\mathcal{C}_{k_1}(G_1)\cong \mathcal{C}_{k_2}(G_2)$ with $k_1&gt;5n_1^2$ and $k_2&gt;5n_2^2$ implies $G_1\cong G_2$, where $n_i$ is the number of vertices of $G_i$ for $i=1,2$. We sharpen this result by showing that $\mathcal{C}_{k_1}(G_1)\cong \mathcal{C}_{k_2}(G_2)$ with $k_1&gt;\chi(G_1)$ and $k_2&gt;\chi(G_2)$ implies $G_1\cong G_2$, where $\chi(G)$ is the chromatic number of $G$. In other words, given any graph $\mathcal{C}$, there is at most one pair of $G$ and $k&gt;\chi(G)$ such that $\mathcal C=\mathcal C_k(G)$, and we additionally provide an algorithm to reconstruct $(G,k)$ from $\mathcal C$ or determine that no such pair exists. Moreover, our requirement that $k&gt;\chi$ is tight because coloring graphs are empty for $k&lt;\chi$ and there exist examples of non-isomorphic $G_1,G_2$ with $k=\chi(G_1)=\chi(G_2)$ such that $\mathcal C_k(G_1)\cong \mathcal C_k(G_2)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the Dani-Mainkar construction, we extend the notion of independence polynomial of graphs to arbitrary 2-step nilpotent Lie algebras. After establishing efficiently computable upper and lower bounds for the independence number, we discuss a metric-dependent generalization motivated by a quantum mechanical interpretation of our construction. As an application, we derive elementary bounds for the dimension of abelian subalgebras of 2-step nilpotent Lie algebras.</description>

      <title>Approximately Dominating Sets in Elections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Condorcet's paradox is a fundamental result in social choice theory which states that there exist elections in which, no matter which candidate wins, a majority of voters prefer a different candidate. In fact, even if we can select any $k$ winners, there still may exist another candidate that would beat each of the winners in a majority vote. That is, elections may require arbitrarily large dominating sets.
  We show that approximately dominating sets of constant size always exist. In particular, for every $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, every election (irrespective of the number of voters or candidates) can select $O(\frac{1}{\varepsilon ^2})$ winners such that no other candidate beats each of the winners by a margin of more than $\varepsilon$ fraction of voters.
  Our proof uses a simple probabilistic construction using samples from a maximal lottery, a well-studied distribution over candidates derived from the Nash equilibrium of a two-player game. In stark contrast to general approximate equilibria, which may require support logarithmic in the number of pure strategies, we show that maximal lotteries can be approximated with constant support size. These approximate maximal lotteries may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Young Diagram Decompositions for Almost Symmetric Numerical Semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces new structural decompositions for almost symmetric numerical semigroups through the combinatorial lens of Young diagrams. To do that, we use the foundational correspondence between numerical sets and Young diagrams, which enables a visual and algorithmic approach to studying properties of numerical semigroups. Central to the paper, a decomposition theorem for almost symmetric numerical semigroups is proved, which reveals that such semigroups can be uniquely expressed as a combination of a numerical semigroup, its dual and an ordinary numerical semigroup.</description>

      <title>Periodicity and local complexity of Delone sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study complexity and periodicity of Delone sets by applying an algebraic approach to multidimensional symbolic dynamics. In this algebraic approach, $\mathbb{Z}^d$-configurations $c: \mathbb{Z}^d \to \mathcal{A}$ for a finite set $\mathcal{A} \subseteq \mathbb{C}$ and finite $\mathbb{Z}^d$-patterns are regarded as formal power series and Laurent polynomials, respectively. In this paper we study also functions $c: \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathcal{A}$ where $\mathcal{A}$ is as above. These functions are called $\mathbb{R}^d$-configurations. Any Delone set may be regarded as an $\mathbb{R}^d$-configuration by simply presenting it as its indicator function. Conversely, any $\mathbb{R}^d$-configuration whose support (that is, the set of cells for which the configuration gets non-zero values) is a Delone set can be seen as a colored Delone set. We generalize the concept of annihilators and periodizers of $\mathbb{Z}^d$-configurations for $\mathbb{R}^d$-configurations. We show that if an $\mathbb{R}^d$-configuration has a non-trivial annihilator, that is, if a linear combination of some finitely many of its translations is the zero function, then it has an annihilator of a particular form. Moreover, we show that $\mathbb{R}^d$-configurations with integer coefficients that have non-trivial annihilators are sums of finitely many periodic functions $c_1,\ldots,c_m: \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{Z}$. Also, $\mathbb{R}^d$-pattern complexity is studied alongside with the classical patch-complexity of Delone sets. We point out the fact that sufficiently low $\mathbb{R}^d$-pattern complexity of an $\mathbb{R}^d$-configuration implies the existence of non-trivial annihilators. Moreover, it is shown that if a Meyer set has sufficiently slow patch-complexity growth, then it has a non-trivial annihilator. Finally, a condition for forced periodicity of colored Delone sets of finite local complexity is provided.</description>

      <title>New Capacity Bounds for PIR on Graph and Multigraph-Based Replicated Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of private information retrieval (PIR) in both graph-based and multigraph-based replication systems, where each file is stored on exactly two servers, and any pair of servers shares at most $r$ files. We derive upper bounds on the PIR capacity for such systems and construct PIR schemes that approach these bounds. For graph-based systems, we determine the exact PIR capacity for path graphs and improve upon existing results for complete bipartite graphs and complete graphs. For multigraph-based systems, we propose a PIR scheme that leverages the symmetry of the underlying graph-based construction, yielding a capacity lower bound for such multigraphs. Furthermore, we establish several general upper and lower bounds on the PIR capacity of multigraphs, which are tight in certain cases.</description>

      <title>A generalization of Ramanujan's sum over finite groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite group, and let $x \in G$. Denote by $\langle x^G \rangle$ the normal subgroup of $G$ generated by the conjugacy class of $x$, and define $[x^G] := \{ y \in G : \langle x^G \rangle = \langle y^G \rangle \}$. For any irreducible character $\chi$ of $G$, we define the character sum \begin{align} C_{\chi}(x):= \frac{1}{\chi(\textbf{1})} \sum_{s \in [x^G]} \chi(s),\nonumber \end{align} where $\textbf{1}$ is the identity of $G$. In 1979, Babai proved that $C_{\chi}(x)$ is an eigenvalue of the Cayley graph $\text{Cay}(G, [x^G])$. When $G$ is a finite cyclic group and $x$ is a generator, this sum coincides with the classical Ramanujan sum. Thus, $C_{\chi}(x)$ can be viewed as a generalization of the Ramanujan sum to arbitrary finite groups. A well-known formula for the classical Ramanujan sum involves the M$\ddot{\text{o}}$bius function and Euler's phi function. In this work, we derive an explicit formula for the character sum $C_{\chi}(x)$, which extends the formula of classical Ramanujan sum to the context of finite groups. This generalization not only enrich the theory of Ramanujan's sum but also provide new tools in spectral graph theory, representation theory, and algebraic number theory.</description>

      <title>Note about the complexity of the acyclic orientation with parity constraint problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let G = (V, E) be a connected graph, and let T in V be a subset of vertices. An orientation of G is called T -odd if any vertex v in V has odd in-degree if and only if it is in T . Finding a T -odd orientation of G can be solved in polynomial time as shown by Chevalier, Jaeger, Payan and Xuong (1983). Since then, T -odd orientations have continued to attract interest, particularly in the context of global constraints on the orientation. For instance, Frank and Kir\'aly (2002) investigated k-connected T -odd orientations and raised questions about acyclic T -odd orientations. This problem is now recognized as an Egres problem and is known as the "Acyclic orientation with parity constraints" problem. Szegedy ( 2005) proposed a randomized polynomial algorithm to address this problem. An easy consequence of his work provides a polynomial time algorithm for planar graphs whenever |T | = |V | - 1. Nevertheless, it remains unknown whether it exists in general. In this paper we contribute to the understanding of the complexity of this problem by studying a more general one. We prove that finding a T -odd acyclic orientation on graphs having some directed edges is NP-complete.</description>

      <title>Extensions of a Family for Sunflowers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.04219v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores the structure of the combinatorial domain $2^X$ in relation to sunflowers. The previous study found some intrinsic properties of the $l$-extension \[ Ext \left( \mathcal{F}, l \right) = \left\{ V ~:~ V \in {X \choose l},~ \exists U \in \mathcal{F}~ U \subset V \right\} \] of a family $\mathcal{F}$ of $m$-cardinality sets. Subsequently, it lead to the proof that such an $\mathcal{F}$ includes three mutually disjoint sets if it satisfies the $\Gamma(b)$-condition, that is, \[ \left| \mathcal{F}[S] \right| &lt; b^{-|S|} |\mathcal{F}| \quad \textrm{for every nonempty set}~ S, \qquad \textrm{where} \quad \mathcal{F} [S] := \left\{ U : U \in \mathcal{F},~ S \subset U \right\}, \] for $b= m^{\frac{1}{2}+ \epsilon}$ with an $m$ sufficiently larger than a given constant $1/\epsilon$. It is stronger than the statement that $\mathcal{F}$ includes a 3-sunflower if $|\mathcal{F}| &gt; b^m$, where $k$-sunflower refers to a family of $k$ different sets with a common pair-wise intersection. Further refining the theory, we show that an $\mathcal{F}$ includes $k$ mutually disjoint sets if it satisfies the $\Gamma \left( 8^{\sqrt{\log_2 m}} \sqrt m ~k \log_2 k \right)$-condition with an $m$ sufficiently larger than $k$.</description>

      <title>K\H{o}v\'ari-S\'os-Tur\'an theorem for hereditary families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10853v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The celebrated K\H{o}v\'ari-S\'os-Tur\'an theorem states that any $n$-vertex graph containing no copy of the complete bipartite graph $K_{s,s}$ has at most $O_s(n^{2-1/s})$ edges. In the past two decades, motivated by the applications in discrete geometry and structural graph theory, a number of results demonstrated that this bound can be greatly improved if the graph satisfies certain structural restrictions. We propose the systematic study of this phenomenon, and state the conjecture that if $H$ is a bipartite graph, then an induced $H$-free and $K_{s,s}$-free graph cannot have much more edges than an $H$-free graph. We provide evidence for this conjecture by considering trees, cycles, the cube graph, and bipartite graphs with degrees bounded by $k$ on one side, obtaining in all the cases similar bounds as in the non-induced setting. Our results also have applications to the Erd\H{o}s-Hajnal conjecture, the problem of finding induced $C_4$-free subgraphs with large degree and bounding the average degree of $K_{s, s}$-free graphs which do not contain induced subdivisions of a fixed graph.</description>

      <title>A degree bound for planar functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04570v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using Stickelberger's theorem on Gauss sums, we show that if $F$ is a planar function on a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$, then for all non-zero functions $G : \mathbb{F}_q \to \mathbb{F}_q$, we have \begin{equation*} d_{\mathsf{alg}}(G \circ F) - d_{\mathsf{alg}}(G) \le \frac{n(p-1)}{2}, \end{equation*} where $q = p^n$ with $p$ a prime and $n$ a positive integer, and $d_{\mathsf{alg}}(F)$ is the algebraic degree of $F$, i.e., the maximum degree of the corresponding system of $n$ lowest-degree interpolating polynomials for $F$ considered as a function on $\mathbb{F}_p^n$. This bound implies the (known) classification of planar polynomials over $\mathbb{F}_p$ and planar monomials over $\mathbb{F}_{p^2}$. As a new result, using the same degree bound, we complete the classification of planar monomials for all $n = \smash{2^k}$ with $p&gt;5$ and $k$ a non-negative integer. Finally, we state a conjecture on the sum of the base-$p$ digits of integers modulo $q-1$ that implies the complete classification of planar monomials over finite fields of characteristic $p&gt;5$.</description>

Abstract: McConnell [FOCS 2001] presented a flipping transformation from circular-arc graphs to interval graphs with certain patterns of representations. Beyond its algorithmic implications, this transformation is instrumental in identifying all minimal graphs that are not circular-arc graphs. We conduct a structural study of this transformation, and for $C_{4}$-free graphs, we achieve a complete characterization of these patterns. This characterization allows us, among other things, to identify all minimal chordal graphs that are not circular-arc graphs in a companion paper.</description>

      <title>Periodic orbits on 2-regular circulant digraphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23417v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Periodic orbits (equivalence classes of closed paths up to cyclic shifts) play an important role in applications of graph theory. For example, they appear in the definition of the Ihara zeta function and exact trace formulae for the spectra of quantum graphs. Circulant graphs are Cayley graphs of $\mathbb{Z}_n$. Here we consider directed Cayley graphs with two generators (2-regular Cayley digraphs). We determine the number of primitive periodic orbits of a given length (total number of directed edges) in terms of the number of times edges corresponding to each generator appear in the periodic orbit (the step count). Primitive periodic orbits are those periodic orbits that cannot be written as a repetition of a shorter orbit. We describe the lattice structure of lengths and step counts for which periodic orbits exist and characterize the repetition number of a periodic orbit by its winding number (the sum of the step sequence divided by the number of vertices) and the repetition number of its step sequence. To obtain these results, we also evaluate the number of Lyndon words on an alphabet of two letters with a given length and letter count.</description>

      <title>Ellipsoidal designs and the Prouhet--Tarry--Escott problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17106v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The notion of ellipsoidal design was first introduced by Pandey (2022) as a full generalization of spherical designs on the unit circle $S^1$. In this paper, we elucidate the advantages of examining the connections between ellipsoidal design and the two-dimensional Prouhet--Tarry--Escott problem, say ${\mathrm PTE}_2$, originally introduced by Alpers and Tijdeman (2007) as a natural generalization of the classical one-dimensional PTE problem (${\mathrm PTE}_1$). We first provide a combinatorial criterion for the construction of solutions of ${\mathrm PTE}_2$ from a pair of ellipsoidal designs. We also give an arithmetic proof of the Stroud-type bound for ellipsoidal designs, and then establish a classification theorem for designs with equality. Such a classification result is closely related to an open question on the existence of rational spherical $4$-designs on $S^1$, discussed in Cui, Xia and Xiang (2019). As far as the authors know, a solution found by Alpers and Tijdeman is the first and the only known parametric ideal solution of degree $5$ for ${\mathrm PTE}_2$. Moreover, as one of our main theorems, we prove that the Alpers--Tijdeman solution is equivalent to a certain two-dimensional extension of the famous Borwein solution for ${\mathrm PTE}_1$. As a by-product of this theorem, we discover a family of ellipsoidal $5$-designs among the Alpers--Tijdeman solution.</description>

      <title>On the perfect $k$-divisibility of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10206v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A graph $G$ is perfectly divisible if, for every induced subgraph $H$ of $G$, either $V(H)$ is a stable set or admits a partition into two sets $X_1$ and $X_2$ such that $\omega(H[X_1]) &lt; \omega(H)$ and $H[X_2]$ is a perfect graph. In this article, we propose the following generalisation of perfectly divisible graphs. A graph $G$ is perfectly $1$-divisible if $G$ is perfect and perfectly $k$-divisible if, for every induced subgraph $H$ of $G$, either $V(H)$ is a stable set or admits a partition into two sets $X_1$ and $X_2$ such that $\omega(H[X_1]) &lt; \omega(H)$ and $H[X_2]$ is perfectly $(k-1)$-divisible, $k \in \mathbb{N}_{&gt; 1}$. Our main result establishes that every perfectly $k$-divisible graph $G$ satisfies $\chi(G) \leq \binom{\omega(G)+k-1}{k}$ which generalises the known bound for perfectly divisible graphs.</description>

      <title>Hereditary classes of graphs and matroids with finitely many exclusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20954v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A class $\mathcal{G}$ of graphs closed under taking induced subgraphs is called hereditary. We denote by $\mathcal{G}^\mathrm{add}$ the class of graphs at most one edge addition away from $\mathcal{G}$, and by $\mathcal{G}^\mathrm{epex}$ the class of graphs at most one edge deletion away. We previously showed that if $\mathcal{G}$ has finitely many forbidden induced subgraphs, then so does the hereditary class $\mathcal{G}^\mathrm{epex}$. In this paper, we prove the corresponding result for $\mathcal{G}^\mathrm{add}$. Consequently, we show that the class of graphs within a fixed number of vertex deletions, edge deletions, and edge additions from $\mathcal{G}$ also has finitely many forbidden induced subgraphs provided that $\mathcal{G}$ does. We also present the binary and ternary matroid analogue of this result.
  Additionally, if $\mathcal{G}$ is closed under complementation, the forbidden induced subgraphs of $\mathcal{G}^\mathrm{add}$ and $\mathcal{G}^\mathrm{epex}$ are complements of each other. We provide explicit lists of the forbidden induced subgraphs for $\mathcal{G}^\mathrm{add}$, and consequently for $\mathcal{G}^\mathrm{epex}$, when $\mathcal{G}$ is the class of split graphs, cographs, or threshold graphs. Following Gy\'{a}rf\'{a}s's framework, we introduce $(p,q)$-edge split graphs, analogous to his $(p,q)$-split graphs, and prove they have finitely many forbidden induced subgraphs.</description>

      <title>Grassmannian Persistence Diagrams: Special Properties in the 1-Parameter Setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06077v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the discriminative power of Grassmannian persistence diagrams of 1-parameter filtrations, examine their relationships with other related constructions, and study their computational aspects. Grassmannian persistence diagrams are defined through Orthogonal Inversion, a notion analogous to M\"obius inversion. We focus on the behavior of this inversion for the poset of segments of a linear poset. We demonstrate how Grassmannian persistence diagrams of 1-parameter filtrations are connected to persistent Laplacians via a variant of orthogonal inversion tailored for the reverse-inclusion order on the poset of segments. Additionally, we establish an explicit isomorphism between Grassmannian persistence diagrams and Harmonic Barcodes via a projection. Finally, we show that degree-0 Grassmannian persistence diagrams are equivalent to treegrams, a generalization of dendrograms. Consequently, we conclude that finite ultrametric spaces can be recovered from the degree-0 Grassmannian persistence diagram of their Vietoris-Rips filtrations.</description>

      <title>Average Case Analysis of Leaf-Centric Binary Tree Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.10396</link>
      <description>arXiv:1804.10396v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the average number of distinct fringe subtrees in random trees generated by leaf-centric binary tree sources as introduced by Zhang, Yang and Kieffer. A leaf-centric binary tree source induces for every $n \geq 2$ a probability distribution on the set of binary trees with $n$ leaves. We generalize a result by Flajolet, Gourdon, Martinez and Devroye, according to which the average number of distinct fringe subtrees in a random binary search tree of size $n$ is in $\Theta(n/\log n)$, as well as a result by Flajolet, Sipala and Steayert, according to which the number of distinct fringe subtrees in a uniformly random binary tree of size $n$ is in $\Theta(n/\sqrt{\log n})$.</description>

      <title>Bilateral Bailey Lattices and Andrews-Gordon Type Identities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.02346v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the Bailey lattice can be extended to a bilateral version in just a few lines from the bilateral Bailey lemma, using a very simple lemma transforming bilateral Bailey pairs relative to $a$ into bilateral Bailey pairs relative to $a/q$. Using this and similar lemmas, we give bilateral versions and simple proofs of other (new and known) Bailey lattices, including a Bailey lattice of Warnaar and the inverses of Bailey lattices of Lovejoy. As consequences of our bilateral point of view, we derive new $m$-versions of the Andrews-Gordon identities, Bressoud's identities, a new companion to Bressoud's identities, and the Bressoud-G\"ollnitz-Gordon identities. Finally, we give a new elementary proof of another very general identity of Bressoud using one of our Bailey lattices.</description>

      <title>Free Sets in Planar Graphs: History and Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17090v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A subset $S$ of vertices in a planar graph $G$ is a free set if, for every set $P$ of $|S|$ points in the plane, there exists a straight-line crossing-free drawing of $G$ in which vertices of $S$ are mapped to distinct points in $P$. In this survey, we review - several equivalent definitions of free sets, - results on the existence of large free sets in planar graphs and subclasses of planar graphs, - and applications of free sets in graph drawing. The survey concludes with a list of open problems in this still very active research area.</description>

      <title>NPA Hierarchy for Quantum Isomorphism and Homomorphism Indistinguishability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10635v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Man\v{c}inska and Roberson [FOCS'20] showed that two graphs are quantum isomorphic if and only if they are homomorphism indistinguishable over the class of planar graphs. Atserias et al. [JCTB'19] proved that quantum isomorphism is undecidable in general. The NPA hierarchy gives a sequence of semidefinite programming relaxations of quantum isomorphism. Recently, Roberson and Seppelt [ICALP'23] obtained a homomorphism indistinguishability characterization of the feasibility of each level of the Lasserre hierarchy of semidefinite programming relaxations of graph isomorphism. We prove a quantum analogue of this result by showing that each level of the NPA hierarchy of SDP relaxations for quantum isomorphism of graphs is equivalent to homomorphism indistinguishability over an appropriate class of planar graphs. By combining the convergence of the NPA hierarchy with the fact that the union of these graph classes is the set of all planar graphs, we are able to give a new proof of the result of Man\v{c}inska and Roberson [FOCS'20] that avoids the use of the theory of quantum groups. This homomorphism indistinguishability characterization also allows us to give a randomized polynomial-time algorithm deciding exact feasibility of each fixed level of the NPA hierarchy of SDP relaxations for quantum isomorphism.</description>

      <title>Counting the fission trees and nonabelian Hodge graphs (untwisted case)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23358v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Any algebraic connection on a vector bundle on a smooth complex algebraic curve determines an irregular class and in turn a fission tree at each puncture. The fission trees are the discrete data classifying the admissible deformation classes. Here we explain how to count the fission trees with given slope and number of leaves, in the untwisted case. This also leads to a clearer picture of the ``periodic table'' of the atoms that play the role of building blocks in 2d gauge theory.</description>

      <title>A positive Siegel theorem: Dynkin friezes and positive Mordell-Schinzel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08800v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We determine the number of positive integral points on $n$-dimensional affine varieties associated to arbitrary $n \times n$ generalized Cartan matrices. An application to the theory of cluster algebras and combinatorics is the resolution of the Fontaine-Plamondon conjecture, which says that there are exactly $4400$ and $26952$ positive integral friezes of type $E_7$ and $E_8$ respectively. An application to number theory refines and generalizes theorems of Mohanty, Mordell, and Schinzel to the positive integers and higher dimensions by exhibiting examples of Diophantine equations $xyz = G(x, y)$ and $xyzw = G(x, y, z)$ of every degree greater than $3$ with infinitely many positive integral solutions.</description>

      <title>A Dense Neighborhood Lemma: Applications of Partial Concept Classes to Domination and Chromatic Number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02992v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In its Euclidean form, the Dense Neighborhood Lemma (DNL) asserts that if $V$ is a finite set of points of $\mathbb{R}^N$ such that for each $v \in V$ the ball $B(v,1)$ intersects $V$ on at least $\delta |V|$ points, then for every $\varepsilon &gt;0$, the points of $V$ can be covered with $f(\delta,\varepsilon)$ balls $B(v,1+\varepsilon)$ with $v \in V$. DNL also applies to other metric spaces and to abstract set systems, where elements are compared pairwise with respect to (near) disjointness. In its strongest form, DNL provides an $\varepsilon$-clustering with size exponential in $\varepsilon^{-1}$, which amounts to a Regularity Lemma with 0/1 densities of some trigraph.
  Trigraphs are graphs with additional red edges. They are natural instances of partial concept classes, introduced by Alon, Hanneke, Holzman and Moran [FOCS 2021]. This paper is mainly a combinatorial study of the generalization of Vapnik-Cervonenkis dimension to partial concept classes. The main point is to show how trigraphs can sometimes explain the success of random sampling even though the VC-dimension of the underlying graph is unbounded. All the results presented here are effective in the sense of computation: they primarily rely on uniform sampling with the same success rate as in classical VC-dimension theory.
  Among some applications of DNL, we show that $\left(\frac{3t-8}{3t-5}+\varepsilon\right)\cdot n$-regular $K_t$-free graphs have bounded chromatic number. Similarly, triangle-free graphs with minimum degree $n/3-n^{1-\varepsilon}$ have bounded chromatic number (this does not hold with $n/3-n^{1-o(1)}$). For tournaments, DNL implies that the domination number is bounded in terms of the fractional chromatic number. Also, $(1/2-\varepsilon)$-majority digraphs have bounded domination, independently of the number of voters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17326v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a relation between the quantum corner VOA $q\widetilde{Y}_{L,0,N}[\Psi]$, which can be regarded as a generalization of quantum $W_N$ algebra, and Sergeev-Veselov super Macdonald polynomials. We demonstrate precisely that, under a specific map, the correlation functions of the currents of $q\widetilde{Y}_{L,0,N}[\Psi]$, coincide with the Sergeev-Veselov super Macdonald polynomials.</description>
