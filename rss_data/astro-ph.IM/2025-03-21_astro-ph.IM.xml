      <title>The Future of Stellar Populations with the Maunakea Spectroscopic Explorer (MSE)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Maunakea Spectroscopic Explorer (MSE) ia a massively multiplexed spectroscopic survey facility that is proposed to replace the Canada-France-Hawai'i-Telescope in the 2040s. Since 2019, due to the uncertainty for new facilities on Maunakea, the project has been focused on new technology enabling greater capabilities beyond the concept design reviewed facility plan. Enhanced fiber density, and thereby survey speed, is made possible by using a new quad mirror (QM) 11.5-meter telescope design with 18,000+ fibers and a 1.5 square degree field-of-view. The MSE spectrographs will be moderate-resolution (360 nm through H-band at R=7,000) and high-resolution (R=40,000). MSE's baseline NIR capabilities will enable studies of highly-reddened regions in the Local Group, unlike other proposed next generation facilities. The MSE large-scale survey instrument suite will enable the equivalent to a full SDSS Legacy Survey every several weeks. This work presents the current status of the project after the Fall 2024 MSE science Workshop.</description>

      <title>Neuromorphic Cameras in Astronomy: Unveiling the Future of Celestial Imaging Beyond Conventional Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To deepen our understanding of optical astronomy, we must advance imaging technology to overcome conventional frame-based cameras' limited dynamic range and temporal resolution. Our Perspective paper examines how neuromorphic cameras can effectively address these challenges. Drawing inspiration from the human retina, neuromorphic cameras excel in speed and high dynamic range by utilizing asynchronous pixel operation and logarithmic photocurrent conversion, making them highly effective for celestial imaging. We use 1300 mm terrestrial telescope to demonstrate the neuromorphic camera's ability to simultaneously capture faint and bright celestial sources while preventing saturation effects. We illustrate its photometric capabilities through aperture photometry of a star field with faint stars. Detection of the faint gas cloud structure of the Trapezium cluster during a full moon night highlights the camera's high dynamic range, effectively mitigating static glare from lunar illumination. Our investigations also include detecting meteorite passing near the Moon and Earth, as well as imaging satellites and anthropogenic debris with exceptionally high temporal resolution using a 200mm telescope. Our observations show the immense potential of neuromorphic cameras in advancing astronomical optical imaging and pushing the boundaries of observational astronomy.</description>

      <title>Open Science and Artificial Intelligence for supporting the sustainability of the SRC Network: The espSRC case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The SKA Observatory (SKAO), a landmark project in radio astronomy, seeks to address fundamental questions in astronomy. To process its immense data output, approximately 700 PB/year, a global network of SKA Regional Centres (SR-CNet) will provide the infrastructure, tools, computational power needed for scientific analysis and scientific support. The Spanish SRC (espSRC) focuses on ensuring the sustainability of this network by reducing its environmental impact, integrating green practices into data platforms, and developing Open Science technologies to enable reproducible research. This paper discusses and summarizes part of the research and development activities that the team is conducting to reduce the SRC energy consumption at the espSRC and SRCNet. The paper also discusses fundamental research on trusted repositories to support Open Science practices.</description>

      <title>Astrometric detection of exoplanets in face-on orbits using vortex filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a method to detect exoplanets based on their host star's intensity centroid after it passes thru a vortex filter. Based on our calculations with planets in face-on orbits, exoplanets with relative proximity to their host stars and with low mass ratios ($m_p/m_s$) can have discernible signals that can be amplified by the topological charge $\ell$ of the vortex filter. For exoplanets that have higher mass ratios and are far from their host stars, a clear signal can also be obtained but these are not affected by the value of $\ell$ and other planet detection methods may be more suitable. We present a simple table-top optical experiment to support our calculations. Our proposed method adds to the arsenal of techniques for astrometric exoplanet detection.</description>

      <title>Study of Wind pattern at the incursion site of Pangong Tso near Merak Village</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study analyzes twelve years of wind speed and direction data collected at the proposed National Large Solar Telescope (NLST) site near Pangong Tso, Merak village, Leh-Ladakh. A weather station from Campbell Scientific Instruments, installed in 2008, has been continuously monitoring meteorological parameters, including wind speed and direction. The data reveals a consistent pattern of predominantly northwest winds, particularly during morning hours, with speeds generally below 5 m/s. While seasonal variations influence wind speed and direction, the overall trend remains stable. To assess the site's suitability for astronomical observations, we compared high-altitude wind speeds at various renowned astronomical sites using reanalysis data from 2008 to 2020. Strong correlations were observed between surface and high-altitude wind speeds at 10~m, 50~m, and 500~m. Statistical analysis of 200-mbar pressure level wind speeds identified La Palma as the most favorable site with a wind speed of 18.76~m/s. La Silla, on the other hand, exhibited the highest wind speed at 34.76~m/s. Merak's estimated wind speed of 30.99~m/s, coupled with its favorable wind direction and low surface wind speeds, suggests its potential as a promising site for astronomical observations.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Random Telegraph Noise in an H2RG X-ray Hybrid CMOS Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid CMOS detectors (HCDs) have several excellent features as high-performance X-ray detectors, including rapid readout, deep-depletion silicon for high quantum efficiency, radiation hardness, and low power. Random telegraph noise (RTN) is a type of noise that can reduce the performance of HCDs and other CMOS sensors. After finding and quantifying RTN in the recently developed engineering grade Speedster-EXD550 HCDs, this form of noise has also been found in other X-ray HCDs. This paper aims to investigate its presence and characteristics in the relatively mature H2RG X-ray HCD and to compare it with that of the Speedster-EXD550. We use archival data taken with an H2RG X-ray HCD at two different temperatures to determine the percentage of pixels that are being impacted by RTN. We identify RTN in 0.42% of pixels when the detector is operated at 140 K, while we are only able to identify RTN in 0.060% of pixels when the detector is operated at 160 K. We characterize RTN in two Speedster-EXD550 detectors, identifying 5.1% of pixels with RTN in one detector and 7.1% in another, which is significantly more than the H2RG. These results verify the difference between two different HCDs and provide techniques that can be applied to future hybrid CMOS detectors.</description>

      <title>3D radio data visualisation in open science platforms for next-generation observatories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Next-generation telescopes will bring groundbreaking discoveries but they will also present new technological challenges. The Square Kilometre Array Observatory (SKAO) will be one of the most demanding scientific infrastructures, with a projected data output of 700 PB per year to be distributed to a network of SKA Regional Centres. Current tools are not fully suited to manage such massive data volumes, therefore, new research is required to transform science archives from data providers into service providers. In this paper we examine how a science archive can deliver advanced visualisation capabilities for the SKA science archive. In particular, we have conducted a thorough exploration of existing visualisation software for astronomy and other fields to identify tools capable of addressing Big Data requirements. Using selected technologies, we have developed a prototype archive that provides access to interactive visualisations of 3D radio data through web-based interfaces, adhering to International Virtual Observatory Alliance (IVOA) recommendations to favour interoperability and Open Science practices. In addition, we discuss how current IVOA recommendations support these visualisation capabilities and how they could be expanded. Our prototype archive includes a service to generate 3D models on the fly as a server operation, enabling remote visualisations in a flexible manner; for instance, a set of parameters can be used to customise the models and their visualisation. We have used SKA precursor and pathfinder data to test its usability and scalability, concluding that remote visualisation is a viable solution for handling high-volume data. However, our prototype is constrained by memory limitations, requiring techniques to reduce memory usage.</description>

      <title>Characterising the Atmosphere of 55 Cancri e: 1D Forward Model Grid for Current and Future JWST Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent JWST observations with NIRCam and MIRI of the ultra-short-period super-Earth 55 Cancri e indicate a possible volatile atmosphere surrounding the planet. Previous analysis of the NIRCam spectra suggested potential absorption features from \ce{CO2} or \ce{CO} and significant sub-weekly variability. The MIRI low-resolution spectrum does not contain substantial features but was found to be consistent with effective heat redistribution models. In this work, we computed a grid of over 25000 self-consistent 1D forward models incorporating H-N-O-C-S-P-Si-Ti equilibrium chemistry and assessed plausible atmospheric compositions based on the current JWST data. Despite exhaustive analysis, the composition and properties of the atmosphere remain elusive. While our results statistically favour a global, hydrogen-free, nitrogen-dominated atmosphere enriched in \ce{PO} and \ce{CO2}, various alternative compositions, including \ce{H2O}-,\ce{CO}-, \ce{PH3}-, or Si-bearing remain viable explanations. Unconstrained heat redistribution efficiency and absolute NIRCam flux are among the largest sources of uncertainty in our analysis. We also find that the heat redistribution factor and surface pressure are highly degenerate with atmospheric composition, and that these parameters cannot be independently constrained using current JWST observations. Furthermore, we show that the observed variability may arise from dynamic interactions between the atmosphere and an underlying magma ocean, driving rapid shifts in atmospheric chemistry and thermal emission. Our results highlight the importance of using self-consistent forward models when analysing novel JWST spectra with limited signal-to-noise ratios -- such as those of 55 Cancri e -- as it allows for a more comprehensive evaluation of potential atmospheric scenarios while also being less sensitive to subtle spectral differences than retrievals...</description>

      <title>A multi-model approach using XAI and anomaly detection to predict asteroid hazards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The potential for catastrophic collision makes near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) a serious concern. Planetary defense depends on accurately classifying potentially hazardous asteroids (PHAs), however the complexity of the data hampers conventional techniques. This work offers a sophisticated method for accurately predicting hazards by combining machine learning, deep learning, explainable AI (XAI), and anomaly detection. Our approach extracts essential parameters like size, velocity, and trajectory from historical and real-time asteroid data. A hybrid algorithm improves prediction accuracy by combining several cutting-edge models. A forecasting module predicts future asteroid behavior, and Monte Carlo simulations evaluate the likelihood of collisions. Timely mitigation is made possible by a real-time alarm system that notifies worldwide monitoring stations. This technique enhances planetary defense efforts by combining real-time alarms with sophisticated predictive modeling.</description>

      <title>DIPLI: Deep Image Prior Lucky Imaging for Blind Astronomical Image Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contemporary image restoration and super-resolution techniques effectively harness deep neural networks, markedly outperforming traditional methods. However, astrophotography presents unique challenges for deep learning due to limited training data. This work explores hybrid strategies, such as the Deep Image Prior (DIP) model, which facilitates blind training but is susceptible to overfitting, artifact generation, and instability when handling noisy images. We propose enhancements to the DIP model's baseline performance through several advanced techniques. First, we refine the model to process multiple frames concurrently, employing the Back Projection method and the TVNet model. Next, we adopt a Markov approach incorporating Monte Carlo estimation, Langevin dynamics, and a variational input technique to achieve unbiased estimates with minimal variance and counteract overfitting effectively. Collectively, these modifications reduce the likelihood of noise learning and mitigate loss function fluctuations during training, enhancing result stability. We validated our algorithm across multiple image sets of astronomical and celestial objects, achieving performance that not only mitigates limitations of Lucky Imaging, a classical computer vision technique that remains a standard in astronomical image reconstruction but surpasses the original DIP model, state of the art transformer- and diffusion-based models, underscoring the significance of our improvements.</description>

      <title>Parameter Estimation with Nonstationary Noise in Gravitational-wave Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2202.12762v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The sensitivity of gravitational-wave (GW) detectors is characterized by their noise curves, which determine the detector's reach and ability to measure the parameters of astrophysical sources accurately. The detector noise is typically modeled as stationary and Gaussian for many practical purposes and is characterized by its Power Spectral Density (PSD). However, due to environmental and instrumental factors, physical changes in the state of detectors may introduce non-stationarity into the noise. Misestimation of the noise behavior directly impacts the posterior width of the signal parameters. It becomes an issue for studies that depend on accurate localization volumes, such as i) probing cosmological parameters (e.g., Hubble constant) using cross-correlation methods with galaxies, ii) doing electromagnetic follow-up using localization information from parameter estimation (PE) done from pre-merger data. We study the effects of dynamical noise on the PE of the GW events. We develop a new method to correct dynamical noise by estimating a locally valid pseudo-PSD normalized along a potential signal's time-frequency track. We do simulations by injecting binary neutron star (BNS) merger signals in various scenarios where the detector goes through a period of non-stationarity with reference noise curves of third-generation detectors (Cosmic Explorer, Einstein telescope). As an example, for a source where mis-modeling of the noise biases the signal-to-noise estimate by even $10\%$, one would expect the estimated sky localization to be either under or over-reported by $\sim 20\%$; errors like this, especially in low-latency, could potentially cause follow-up campaigns to miss the actual source location.</description>

Abstract: With their wide field of view and high duty cycle, water-Cherenkov-based observatories are integral to studying the very high-energy gamma-ray sky. For gamma-ray observations, precise event reconstruction and highly effective background rejection are crucial and have been continuously improving in recent years. In this work, we investigate the application of graph neural networks (GNNs) to background rejection and energy reconstruction and benchmark their performance against state-of-the-art methods. In our simulation study, we find that GNNs outperform hand-designed classification algorithms and observables in background rejection and find an improved energy resolution compared to template-based methods.</description>

      <title>A method of Extracting Flat Field from Real Time Solar Observation Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15094v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing methods for obtaining flat field rely on observed data collected under specific observation conditions to determine the flat field. However, the telescope pointing and the column fixed pattern noise of the CMOS detector change during actual observations, causing residual signals in real time observation data after flat field correction, such as interference fringes and column fixed pattern noise. In actual observations, the slight wobble of the telescope caused by the wind leads to shifts in the observed data. In this paper, a method of extracting the flat field from the real time solar observation data is proposed. Firstly, the average flat field obtained by multi-frame averaging is used as the initial value. A set of real-time observation data is input into the KLL method to calculate the correction amount for the average flat field. Secondly, the average flat field is corrected using the calculated correction amount to obtain the real flat field for the current observation conditions. To overcome the residual solar structures caused by atmospheric turbulence in the correction amount, real-time observation data are grouped to calculate the correction amounts. These residual solar structures are suppressed by averaging multiple groups, improving the accuracy of the correction amount. The test results from space and ground-based simulated data demonstrate that our method can effectively calculate the correction amount for the average flat field. The NVST 10830 A/Ha data were also tested. High-resolution reconstruction confirms that the correction amount effectively corrects the average flat field to obtain the real flat field for the current observation conditions. Our method works for chromosphere and photosphere data.</description>

      <title>Euclid Quick Data Release (Q1): From images to multiwavelength catalogues: the Euclid MERge Processing Function</title>

Abstract: The Euclid satellite is an ESA mission that was launched in July 2023. \Euclid is working in its regular observing mode with the target of observing an area of $14\,000~\text{deg}^2$ with two instruments, the Visible Camera (VIS) and the Near IR Spectrometer and Photometer (NISP) down to $I_{\rm E} = 24.5~\text{mag}$ ($10\, \sigma$) in the Euclid Wide Survey. Ground-based imaging data in the \textit{ugriz} bands complement the \Euclid data to enable photo-$z$ determination and VIS PSF modeling for week lensing analysis. Euclid investigates the distance-redshift relation and the evolution of cosmic structures by measuring shapes and redshifts of galaxies and clusters of galaxies out to $z\sim 2$. Generating the multi-wavelength catalogues from \Euclid and ground-based data is an essential part of the \Euclid data processing system. In the framework of the \Euclid Science Ground Segment (SGS), the aim of the MER Processing Function (PF) pipeline is to detect objects in the \Euclid imaging data, measure their properties, and MERge them into a single multi-wavelength catalogue. The MER PF pipeline performs source detection on both visible (VIS) and near-infrared (NIR) images and offers four different photometric measurements: Kron total flux, aperture photometry on PSF-matched images, template fitting photometry, and S\'ersic fitting photometry. Furthermore, the MER PF pipeline measures a set of ancillary quantities, spanning from morphology to quality flags, to better characterise all detected sources. In this paper, we show how the MER PF pipeline is designed, detailing its main steps, and we show that the pipeline products meet the tight requirements that Euclid aims to achieve on photometric accuracy. We also present the other measurements (e.g. morphology) that are included in the OU-MER output catalogues and we list all output products coming out of the MER PF pipeline.</description>

      <title>Optimal, fast, and robust inference of reionization-era cosmology with the 21cmPIE-INN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04174v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern machine learning will allow for simulation-based inference from reionization-era 21cm observations at the Square Kilometre Array. Our framework combines a convolutional summary network and a conditional invertible network through a physics-inspired latent representation. It allows for an efficient and extremely fast determination of the posteriors of astrophysical and cosmological parameters, jointly with well-calibrated and on average unbiased summaries. The sensitivity to non-Gaussian information makes our method a promising alternative to the established power spectra.</description>

      <title>From Stars to Molecules: AI Guided Device-Agnostic Super-Resolution Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18637v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Super-resolution imaging has revolutionized the study of systems ranging from molecular structures to distant galaxies. However, existing super-resolution methods require extensive calibration and retraining for each imaging setup, limiting their practical deployment. We introduce a device-agnostic deep-learning framework for super-resolution imaging of point-like emitters that eliminates the need for calibration data or explicit knowledge of optical system parameters. Our model is trained on a diverse, numerically simulated dataset encompassing a broad range of imaging conditions, enabling generalization across different optical setups. Once trained, it reconstructs super-resolved images directly from a single resolution-limited camera frame with superior accuracy and computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods. We experimentally validate our approach using a custom microscopy setup with ground-truth emitter positions. We also demonstrate its versatility on astronomical and single-molecule localization microscopy datasets, achieving unprecedented resolution without prior information. Our findings establish a pathway toward universal, calibration-free super-resolution imaging, expanding its applicability across scientific disciplines.</description>
