      <title>Conformal prediction for uncertainties in nucleon-nucleon scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conformal prediction is a distribution-free and model-agnostic uncertainty-quantification method that provides finite-sample prediction intervals with guaranteed coverage. In this work, for the first time, we apply conformal-prediction to generate uncertainty bands for physical observables in nuclear physics, such as the total cross section and nucleon-nucleon phase shifts. We demonstrate the method's flexibility by considering three scenarios: (i) a pointwise model, where expansion coefficients in chiral effective field theory are treated as random variables; (ii) a Gaussian-Process model for the coefficients; and (iii) phase shifts at various energies and partial waves calculated using local interactions from chiral effective field theory. In each case, conformal-prediction intervals are constructed and validated empirically. Our results show that conformal prediction provides reliable and adaptive uncertainty bands even in the presence of non-Gaussian behavior, such as skewness and heavy tails. These findings highlight conformal prediction as a robust and practical framework for quantifying theoretical uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of bound-state $\beta^-$-decay half-lives of fully ionized atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bound-state $\beta^-$-decay is a rare radioactive process where the created electron is trapped in an atomic orbital instead of being emitted. It can be observed in highly ionized atoms in particular when normal beta decay is energetically forbidden, but bound-state decay is still possible. In this work we present a systematic theoretical study on the bound-state $\beta^-$-decay of fully ionized atoms where key nuclear inputs include the nuclear matrix elements (expressed through $ft$ values) and the lepton phase-space volume function. We present a method to evaluate nuclear matrix elements for fully forbidden $\beta^-$ transitions in neutral atoms, from the inverse electron capture process using the Takahashi-Yokoi model and account for the impact of electron capture to different atomic orbitals on the resulting half-lives. Decay rates for bound-state $\beta^-$-decays of nuclei $^{163}$Dy, $^{193}$Ir, $^{194}$Au, $^{202}$Tl, $^{205}$Tl, $^{215}$At, $^{222}$Rn, $^{243}$Am, and $^{246}$Bk are calculated, where the normal beta decay is forbidden. In addition, we compute the bound-state $\beta^-$ decay rates for nuclei $^{187}$Re, $^{227}$Ac, and $^{228}$Ra, observing enhancements by factors of $10^2$ to $10^4$ relative to their neutral-atom counterparts. Our results show that the half-lives of certain bare nuclei are significantly shorter than those of the corresponding neutral atoms, identifying them as promising candidates for future experimental investigation. The theoretically predicted half-lives of the bound-state $\beta^-$ decay could provide valuable inputs for various astrophysical studies.</description>

      <title>Ab initio lattice study of neutron-alpha scattering with chiral forces at N3LO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first ab initio lattice calculation of neutron-alpha ($n$-$\alpha$) scattering using nuclear lattice effective field theory (NLEFT) with chiral interactions at next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (N3LO). Building on the high-fidelity chiral Hamiltonian introduced in Ref. [1], we compute scattering phase shifts in the $S$- and $P$-wave channels using the L\"uscher finite-volume method. Our results demonstrate excellent agreement with empirical $R$-matrix phase shifts in the $^2S_{1/2}$ and $^2P_{3/2}$ channels, while revealing persistent discrepancies in the $^2P_{1/2}$ channel for neutron energies above 5 MeV. To systematically investigate these discrepancies, we construct and analyze a simplified neutron-alpha toy model, demonstrating that these discrepancies are not due to the use of the L\"uscher finite-volume method. Additionally, we revisit our three-nucleon (3N) force fitting procedure, explicitly incorporating neutron-alpha scattering data through comprehensive Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. This analysis confirms the stability of nuclear binding-energy predictions and highlights the need for further refinements in the lattice N3LO three-nucleon forces to fully describe neutron-alpha scattering in the challenging ${}^2P_{1/2}$ channel.</description>

      <title>The breakdown scale of pionless effective field theory in the three-nucleon sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We make order-by-order predictions of neutron-deuteron total cross sections up to next-to-next-to-leading order in pionless effective field theory. Using Bayesian methods, we infer a posterior distribution for the breakdown scale. The result shows a mode near 100 MeV, and a combined analysis with neutron-proton scattering further sharpens the inference, placing the mode close to the pion mass scale, consistent with the expected range of pionless effective field theory.</description>

      <title>Chiral and Deconfinement Transitions in Spin-Polarized Quark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of spin polarization in strongly interacting matter by introducing a finite spin potential, $\mu_\Sigma$, which effectively controls the spin density of the system without requiring rotation or specific boundary conditions. Inspired by recent lattice QCD simulations that incorporated such a potential, we implement this approach within an effective QCD framework. Our results show that increasing spin polarization leads to a simultaneous decrease in both the chiral and deconfinement restoration temperatures. The resulting phase structure is qualitatively consistent with lattice findings, and notably, we observe the emergence of a first-order chiral phase transition at low temperature. These results suggest that spin-polarized environments can significantly impact the QCD phase diagram and offer a controlled route for studying spin effects in hot and dense matter.</description>

      <title>Hadron-Hadron Interactions from Lattice QCD: Theory meets Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We summarize recent developments in the study of hadron-hadron interactions using lattice QCD near the physical pion mass ($m_{\pi} \simeq 146$ MeV), based on the HAL QCD method and its connection to experimental data. In particular, we focus on several key interaction channels shown below. Also, we examine the two-pion exchange (TPE) mechanism, which governs the long-range behavior of interactions between flavor-singlet hadrons, as well as between nucleons and flavor-singlet hadrons.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic and femtoscopic insights into vector-baryon interactions in the strangeness $-1$ sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the strangeness $-1$ sector of the interaction between vector mesons of the $\rho-$nonet and $1/2^+$ ground state baryons ($VB$), within the unitary coupled-channel hidden gauge formalism. We adopt a renormalization scheme that induces a reasonable short-distance behavior of the two-hadron wave functions, which is the major limitation of femtoscopy techniques at this time. We perform an exhaustive spectroscopy study, implementing different improvements and considerations, and find compatibilities between the poles extracted from the present approach, and some of the states listed in the Review of Particle Physics. Finally, we predict several correlation functions (CFs) associated with various meson-baryon pairs in this sector, paying special attention to the distinctive and clear signatures produced by the dynamically generated states. To obtain realistic estimates for the CFs, we have calculated the production weights using the Thermal-FIST package. Such studies will shed light into the odd-parity $\Lambda^*$ and $\Sigma^*$ hadron spectra, up to 2 GeV, and will open the strategy to improve effective field theories by using low-energy constants fitted to femtoscopy data.</description>

      <title>Effects of perturbation for transition operator of double-${\beta}$ decay on nuclear matrix element, effective axial-vector current coupling, and half-life</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22339v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We calculate the nuclear matrix element (NME), effective axial-vector current coupling $g_A^\mathrm{eff}$, and half-life of the double-$\beta$ ($\beta\beta$) decay using the transition operator perturbed by the nuclear interaction. The correction terms for the NME are obtained by extending the hadron sector to a higher order in terms of the Rayleigh-Schr\"{o}dinger perturbation theory. The NME calculations are performed for the neutrinoless $\beta\beta$ ($0\nu\beta\beta$) and the two-neutrino $\beta\beta$ ($2\nu\beta\beta$) decays of $^{136}$Xe. The nuclear wave functions are calculated by the quasiparticle random-phase approximation (QRPA) with the Skyrme, the Coulomb, and the contact pairing interactions. Sufficiently large single-particle valence spaces are used. The correction terms for the NME are comparable with the leading term in absolute value, and the sum of the corrections has the opposite sign to that of the leading term. The $g_A^\mathrm{eff}$'s for the $\beta\beta$ NME are calculated by a few methods depending on the truncation of the NME and the half-life referred to. Similarities are found between some of these $g_A^\mathrm{eff}$'s including those of the $0\nu\beta\beta$ NME. This leads to the conclusion that the value of $g_A^\mathrm{eff}$ can indeed be determined by the perturbed transition operator. It is in a comparable range of the $g_A$ for the $2\nu\beta\beta$ NME. The perturbation effect on the $2\nu\beta\beta$ half-life is discussed by comparing the calculated half-lives with the different $g_A$'s and the NME components.</description>

      <title>Fermi Operator Expansion for the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04735v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A variety of phases in the inner crust of neutron stars are crucial for understanding the pulsar phenomena. However, the three-dimensional coordinate-space calculation of the phases is computationally demanding. We aim to generalize the Fermi operator expansion (FOE) method that is effective for finite-temperature coordinate-space simulation, from the Hartree-Fock theory to Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) theory including the pairing effects. Furthermore, the periodic structure with free neutrons in the inner crust requires us to treat the system with the band theory. We give a concise proof that the generalized density matrix in the HFB theory can be obtained with the FOE. The Chebyshev polynomial expansion is used for calculations of the HFB band theory. Using a model for a slab phase of the inner crust, the FOE method produces results in good agreement with those based on the diagonalization of the HFB Hamiltonian. The FOE method for the HFB band theory is a powerful tool for studying the nontrivial exotic structures in neutron stars. The FOE method is suitable for parallelization and further acceleration is possible with nearsightedness.</description>

      <title>Deciphering the mechanism of $J/\psi$-nucleon scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19526v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The low-energy $J/\psi N$ scattering is important for various reasons: it is related to the hidden-charm $P_c$ pentaquark states, provides insights into the role of gluons in nucleon structures, and is relevant to the $J/\psi$ properties in nuclear medium. The scattering can happen through two distinct mechanisms: the coupled-channel mechanism via open-charm meson-baryon intermediate states, and the soft-gluon exchange mechanism. We investigate the $J/\psi N$ $S$-wave scattering length through both mechanisms, and find that the soft-gluon exchange mechanism leads to a scattering length at least one order of magnitude larger than that from the coupled-channel mechanism and thus is the predominant one. The findings can be verified by lattice calculations and will enhance our understanding of the scattering processes breaking the Okubo-Zweig-Iizuka rule.</description>

      <title>The hyperfine anomaly in mercury and test of the Moskowitz-Lombardi rule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09912v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Moskowitz-Lombardi rule gives a simple relation between the magnetic moment of an atomic nucleus and the effect of its radial distribution on the hyperfine structure - the magnetic hyperfine anomaly or "Bohr-Weisskopf" effect. It was originally formulated for mercury, for which experimental data for nuclear magnetic moments and hyperfine constants were available for a number of isotopes. While the relation for the differential effect between isotopes may be completely determined experimentally, the value for the additive constant that is needed to give the Bohr-Weisskopf (BW) effect for a single isotope has remained untested. In this work, we determine the BW effect in singly-ionized and neutral mercury from experimental muonic Hg-199 data together with our atomic calculations. We check this result by directly extracting the BW effect from the hyperfine constant for singly-ionized Hg-199 using state-of-the-art atomic many-body calculations. From this we deduce an empirical value for the additive constant in the Moskowitz-Lombardi rule, which differs significantly from the values advocated previously.</description>

      <title>Exploring QGP-like phenomena with Charmonia in $p+p$ collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00753v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In ultrarelativistic collisions of nuclei at the Large Hadron Collider, the created QCD environment rapidly changes, leading to a non-adiabatic evolution of the quantum states involved. Considering this, we first examine the pre-equilibrium state of QCD matter and its effect on the initially produced charmonium using a temperature-independent Hamiltonian. As the QCD matter reaches local thermal equilibrium, this Hamiltonian transforms to its finite temperature counterpart. To model the pre-equilibrium stage, we use the bottom-up thermalization approach to determine the effective temperature of the QCD matter, followed by a Gubser-type expansion for the thermalized medium. Additionally, we consider collisional damping, gluonic dissociation, and regeneration mechanisms, which specifically modify the charmonium yield in the thermalized medium. Mainly, the gluonic dissociation and collisional damping cause a reduction in the yield conversely, regeneration through gluonic deexcitation enhances the yield of charmonium. Further, we explore the combined effects of these mechanisms on the collective yield of charmonium states with transverse momentum ($p_{\rm T}$) and event multiplicity in the proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV. Based on our findings, we contend that the combined effects of these mechanisms can serve as a robust probe for determining the possible existence of a thermalized QCD medium in such a small collision system.</description>

      <title>Hidden-Strangeness Tetraquarks in the Dynamical Diquark Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15704v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dynamical diquark model describes multiquark exotic hadrons in terms of diquark components nucleated by heavy quarks, and successfully explains multiple features of hidden-charm and -bottom exotics. Here we apply the model to the marginally heavy case of hidden-strange states to probe whether mesons near 2 GeV with peculiar properties, such as $\phi(2170)$, $f_2(2340)$, and X(2370), are possible tetraquark candidates. We calculate spin-multiplet average masses using potentials obtained through lattice simulations and quark models, and we also describe the detailed spectra of the expected multiplets as a diagnostic to discern the nature of future hadrons likely to be discovered in this mass region by experiments at facilities such as BESIII, JLab, and the EIC.</description>
