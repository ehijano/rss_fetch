      <title>Brain2Vec: A Deep Learning Framework for EEG-Based Stress Detection Using CNN-LSTM-Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mental stress has become a pervasive factor affecting cognitive health and overall well-being, necessitating the development of robust, non-invasive diagnostic tools. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals provide a direct window into neural activity, yet their non-stationary and high-dimensional nature poses significant modeling challenges. Here we introduce Brain2Vec, a new deep learning tool that classifies stress states from raw EEG recordings using a hybrid architecture of convolutional, recurrent, and attention mechanisms. The model begins with a series of convolutional layers to capture localized spatial dependencies, followed by an LSTM layer to model sequential temporal patterns, and concludes with an attention mechanism to emphasize informative temporal regions. We evaluate Brain2Vec on the DEAP dataset, applying bandpass filtering, z-score normalization, and epoch segmentation as part of a comprehensive preprocessing pipeline. Compared to traditional CNN-LSTM baselines, our proposed model achieves an AUC score of 0.68 and a validation accuracy of 81.25%. These findings demonstrate Brain2Vec's potential for integration into wearable stress monitoring platforms and personalized healthcare systems.</description>

      <title>Design of 3D Beamforming and Deployment Strategies for ISAC-based HAPS Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores high-altitude platform station (HAPS) systems enabled by integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), in which a HAPS simultaneously transmits communication signals and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging signals to support multi-user communication while performing ground target sensing. Taking into account the operational characteristics of SAR imaging, we consider two HAPS deployment strategies: (i) a quasi-stationary HAPS that remains fixed at an optimized location during SAR operation, following the stop-and-go scanning model; and (ii) a dynamic HAPS that continuously adjusts its flight trajectory along a circular path. For each strategy, we aim at maximizing the weighted sum-rate throughput for communication users while ensuring that SAR imaging requirements, such as beampattern gain and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), are satisfied. This is achieved by jointly optimizing the HAPS deployment strategy, i.e., its placement or trajectory, along with three-dimensional (3D) transmit beamforming, under practical constraints including transmit power limits, energy consumption, and flight dynamics. Nevertheless, the formulated optimization problems corresponding to the two deployment strategies are inherently non-convex. To address the issue, we propose efficient algorithms that leverage both convex and non-convex optimization techniques to obtain high-quality suboptimal solutions. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed approaches over benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>A Compact Dynamic Omnidirectional Antenna</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel omnidirectional antenna design incorporating directional modulation for secure narrow planar information transmission. The proposed antenna features a compact size and stable omnidirectional radiation performance by employing two tightly spaced, printed meander line monopole antennas, acting as a single radiating element. To achieve a narrow information secure region, the proposed antenna is fed by differential power excitation of two ports with real-time dynamic switching. This leads to phase pattern modulation only along the electrical polarization, resulting in directionally confined information recoverable region in the E-plane, while maintaining highly constant or static omnidirectional H-plane pattern, inducing a $360^\circ$ information recoverable region. The dynamic antenna is designed and fabricated on a single layer of Rogers RO4350B which provides a miniaturized planar size of $0.36 \times 0.5 , \lambda_0^2$ at 2.7 GHz and easy integration. To validate the wireless communication performance, the fabricated antenna is directly fed with a 10 dB power ratio by a radio frequency (RF) switching system and evaluated for 16-QAM and 256-QAM transmission in a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) environment. Experimental results demonstrate that for 16-QAM transmission, a narrow E-plane information beam (IB) of approximately $34^\circ$ and omnidirectional H-plane IB are obtained, and a narrower E-plane IB is achieved around $15^\circ$ for 256-QAM. These results confirm that the proposed antenna offers a simple yet effective approach to enhance planar physical information security with a compact dynamic antenna system.</description>

      <title>Movable-Antenna Array Enhanced Downlink NOMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Movable antenna (MA) has gained increasing attention in the field of wireless communications due to its exceptional capability to proactively reconfigure wireless channels via localized antenna movements. In this paper, we investigate the resource allocation design for an MA array-enabled base station serving multiple single-antenna users in a downlink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) system. We aim to maximize the sum rate of all users by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming and the positions of all MAs at the BS, subject to the constraints of transmit power budget, finite antenna moving region, and the conditions for successive interference cancellation decoding rate. The formulated problem, inherently highly non-convex, is addressed by successive convex approximation (SCA) and alternating optimization methods to obtain a high-quality suboptimal solution. Simulation results unveil that the proposed MA-enhanced downlink NOMA system can significantly improve the sum rate performance compared to both the fixed-position antenna (FPA) system and the traditional orthogonal multiple access (OMA) system.</description>

      <title>Joint Angle and Velocity-Estimation for Target Localization in Bistatic mmWave MIMO Radar in the Presence of Clutter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparse Bayesian learning (SBL)-aided target localization is conceived for a bistatic mmWave MIMO radar system in the presence of unknown clutter, followed by the development of an angle-Doppler (AD)-domain representation of the target-plus-clutter echo model for accurate target parameter estimation. The proposed algorithm exploits the three-dimensional (3D) sparsity arising in the AD domain of the scattering scene and employs the powerful SBL framework for the estimation of target parameters, such as the angle-of-departure (AoD), angle-of-arrival (AoA) and velocity. To handle a practical scenario where the actual target parameters typically deviate from their finite-resolution grid, a super-resolution-based improved off-grid SBL framework is developed for recursively updating the parameter grid, thereby progressively refining the estimates. We also determine the Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB) and Bayesian CRB for target parameter estimation in order to benchmark the estimation performance. Our simulation results corroborate the superior performance of the proposed approach in comparison to the existing algorithms, and also their ability to approach the bounds derived.</description>

      <title>MMWiLoc: A Multi-Sensor Dataset and Robust Device-Free Localization Method Using Commercial Off-The-Shelf Millimeter Wave Wi-Fi Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Device-free Wi-Fi sensing has numerous benefits in practical settings, as it eliminates the requirement for dedicated sensing devices and can be accomplished using current low-cost Wi-Fi devices. With the development of Wi-Fi standards, millimeter wave Wi-Fi devices with 60GHz operating frequency and up to 4GHz bandwidth have become commercially available. Although millimeter wave Wi-Fi presents great promise for Device-Free Wi-Fi sensing with increased bandwidth and beam-forming ability, there still lacks a method for localization using millimeter wave Wi-Fi. Here, we present two major contributions: First, we provide a comprehensive multi-sensor dataset that synchronously captures human movement data from millimeter wave Wi-Fi, 2.4GHz Wi-Fi, and millimeter wave radar sensors. This dataset enables direct performance comparisons across different sensing modalities and facilitates reproducible researches in indoor localization. Second, we introduce MMWiLoc, a novel localization method that achieves centimeter-level precision with low computational cost. MMWiLoc incorporates two components: beam pattern calibration using Expectation Maximization and target localization through Multi-Scale Compression Sensing. The system processes beam Signal-to-Noise Ratio (beamSNR) information from the beam-forming process to determine target Angle of Arrival (AoA), which is then fused across devices for localization. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates that MMWiLoc achieves centimeter-level precision, outperforming 2.4GHz Wi-Fi systems while maintaining competitive performance with high-precision radar systems. The dataset and examples processing code will be released after this paper is accepted at https://github.com/wowoyoho/MMWiLoc.</description>

      <title>Energy Efficiency Optimization of Finite Block Length STAR-RIS-aided MU-MIMO Broadcast Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energy-efficient designs are proposed for multi-user (MU) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) broadcast channels (BC), assisted by simultaneously transmitting and reflecting (STAR) reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) operating at finite block length (FBL). In particular, we maximize the sum energy efficiency (EE), showing that STAR-RIS can substantially enhance it. Our findings demonstrate that the gains of employing STAR-RIS increase when the codeword length and the maximum tolerable bit error rate decrease, meaning that a STAR-RIS is more energy efficient in a system with more stringent latency and reliability requirements.</description>

      <title>FieldFormer: Self-supervised Reconstruction of Physical Fields via Tensor Attention Prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconstructing physical field tensors from \textit{in situ} observations, such as radio maps and ocean sound speed fields, is crucial for enabling environment-aware decision making in various applications, e.g., wireless communications and underwater acoustics. Field data reconstruction is often challenging, due to the limited and noisy nature of the observations, necessitating the incorporation of prior information to aid the reconstruction process. Deep neural network-based data-driven structural constraints (e.g., ``deeply learned priors'') have showed promising performance. However, this family of techniques faces challenges such as model mismatches between training and testing phases. This work introduces FieldFormer, a self-supervised neural prior learned solely from the limited {\it in situ} observations without the need of offline training. Specifically, the proposed framework starts with modeling the fields of interest using the tensor Tucker model of a high multilinear rank, which ensures a universal approximation property for all fields. In the sequel, an attention mechanism is incorporated to learn the sparsity pattern that underlies the core tensor in order to reduce the solution space.
  In this way, a ``complexity-adaptive'' neural representation, grounded in the Tucker decomposition, is obtained that can flexibly represent
  various types of fields. A theoretical analysis is provided to support the recoverability of the proposed design. Moreover, extensive experiments, using various physical field tensors, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>Recursive KalmanNet: Deep Learning-Augmented Kalman Filtering for State Estimation with Consistent Uncertainty Quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State estimation in stochastic dynamical systems with noisy measurements is a challenge. While the Kalman filter is optimal for linear systems with independent Gaussian white noise, real-world conditions often deviate from these assumptions, prompting the rise of data-driven filtering techniques. This paper introduces Recursive KalmanNet, a Kalman-filter-informed recurrent neural network designed for accurate state estimation with consistent error covariance quantification. Our approach propagates error covariance using the recursive Joseph's formula and optimizes the Gaussian negative log-likelihood. Experiments with non-Gaussian measurement white noise demonstrate that our model outperforms both the conventional Kalman filter and an existing state-of-the-art deep learning based estimator.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-based mmWave MIMO Channel Estimation using sub-6 GHz Channel Information: CNN and UNet Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future wireless multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems will integrate both sub-6 GHz and millimeter wave (mmWave) frequency bands to meet the growing demands for high data rates. MIMO link establishment typically requires accurate channel estimation, which is particularly challenging at mmWave frequencies due to the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In this paper, we propose two novel deep learning-based methods for estimating mmWave MIMO channels by leveraging out-of-band information from the sub-6 GHz band. The first method employs a convolutional neural network (CNN), while the second method utilizes a UNet architecture. We compare these proposed methods against deep-learning methods that rely solely on in-band information and with other state-of-the-art out-of-band aided methods. Simulation results show that our proposed out-of-band aided deep-learning methods outperform existing alternatives in terms of achievable spectral efficiency.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exponential growth of wireless users and bandwidth constraints necessitates innovative communication paradigms for next-generation networks. Semantic Communication (SemCom) emerges as a promising solution by transmitting extracted meaning rather than raw bits, enhancing spectral efficiency and enabling intelligent resource allocation. This paper explores the integration of SemCom with conventional Bit-based Communication (BitCom) in heterogeneous networks, highlighting key challenges and opportunities. We analyze multiple access techniques, including Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA), to support coexisting SemCom and BitCom users. Furthermore, we examine multi-modal SemCom frameworks for handling diverse data types and discuss their applications in satellite networks, where semantic techniques mitigate bandwidth limitations and harsh channel conditions. Finally, we identify future directions for deploying semantic-aware systems in 6G and beyond.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-Based Electrocardiography Noise Quantification via Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrocardiography (ECG) signals are often degraded by noise, which complicates diagnosis in clinical and wearable settings. This study proposes a diffusion-based framework for ECG noise quantification via reconstruction-based anomaly detection, addressing annotation inconsistencies and the limited generalizability of conventional methods. We introduce a distributional evaluation using the Wasserstein-1 distance ($W_1$), comparing the reconstruction error distributions between clean and noisy ECGs to mitigate inconsistent annotations. Our final model achieved robust noise quantification using only three reverse diffusion steps. The model recorded a macro-average $W_1$ score of 1.308 across the benchmarks, outperforming the next-best method by over 48%. External validations demonstrated strong generalizability, supporting the exclusion of low-quality segments to enhance diagnostic accuracy and enable timely clinical responses to signal degradation. The proposed method enhances clinical decision-making, diagnostic accuracy, and real-time ECG monitoring capabilities, supporting future advancements in clinical and wearable ECG applications.</description>

      <title>Interference in Spectrum-Sharing Integrated Terrestrial and Satellite Networks: Modeling, Approximation, and Robust Transmit Beamforming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates robust transmit (TX) beamforming from the satellite to user terminals (UTs), based on statistical channel state information (CSI). The proposed design specifically targets the mitigation of satellite-to-terrestrial interference in spectrum-sharing integrated terrestrial and satellite networks. By leveraging the distribution information of terrestrial UTs, we first establish an interference model from the satellite to terrestrial systems without shared CSI. Based on this, robust TX beamforming schemes are developed under both the interference threshold and the power budget. Two optimization criteria are considered: satellite weighted sum rate maximization and mean square error minimization. The former achieves a superior achievable rate performance through an iterative optimization framework, whereas the latter enables a low-complexity closed-form solution at the expense of reduced rate, with interference constraints satisfied via a bisection method. To avoid complex integral calculations and the dependence on user distribution information in inter-system interference evaluations, we propose a terrestrial base station position-aided approximation method, and the approximation errors are subsequently analyzed. Numerical simulations validate the effectiveness of our proposed schemes.</description>

      <title>DMRS-Based Uplink Channel Estimation for MU-MIMO Systems with Location-Specific SCSI Acquisition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the growing number of users in multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) systems, demodulation reference signals (DMRSs) are efficiently multiplexed in the code domain via orthogonal cover codes (OCC) to ensure orthogonality and minimize pilot interference. In this paper, we investigate uplink DMRS-based channel estimation for MU-MIMO systems with Type II OCC pattern standardized in 3GPP Release 18, leveraging location-specific statistical channel state information (SCSI) to enhance performance. Specifically, we propose a SCSI-assisted Bayesian channel estimator (SA-BCE) based on the minimum mean square error criterion to suppress the pilot interference and noise, albeit at the cost of cubic computational complexity due to matrix inversions. To reduce this complexity while maintaining performance, we extend the scheme to a windowed version (SA-WBCE), which incorporates antenna-frequency domain windowing and beam-delay domain processing to exploit asymptotic sparsity and mitigate energy leakage in practical systems. To avoid the frequent real-time SCSI acquisition, we construct a grid-based location-specific SCSI database based on the principle of spatial consistency, and subsequently leverage the uplink received signals within each grid to extract the SCSI. Facilitated by the multilinear structure of wireless channels, we formulate the SCSI acquisition problem within each grid as a tensor decomposition problem, where the factor matrices are parameterized by the multi-path powers, delays, and angles. The computational complexity of SCSI acquisition can be significantly reduced by exploiting the Vandermonde structure of the factor matrices. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed location-specific SCSI database construction method achieves high accuracy, while the SA-BCE and SA-WBCE significantly outperform state-of-the-art benchmarks in MU-MIMO systems.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are used to evaluate accelerometer and microphone data for bearing and induction motor diagnosis. A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network is used to combine sensor information effectively, highlighting the benefits of data fusion. This approach encourages researchers to focus on multi model diagnosis for constant speed data collection by proposing a comprehensive way to use deep learning and sensor fusion and encourages data scientists to collect more multi-sensor data, including acoustic and accelerometer datasets.</description>

      <title>Tracking of Intermittent and Moving Speakers : Dataset and Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the problem of tracking intermittent and moving sources, i.e, sources that may change position when they are inactive. This issue is seldom explored, and most current tracking methods rely on spatial observations for track identity management. They are either based on a previous localization step, or designed to perform joint localization and tracking by predicting ordered position estimates. This raises concerns about whether such methods can maintain reliable track identity assignment performance when dealing with discontinuous spatial tracks, which may be caused by a change of direction during silence. We introduce LibriJump, a novel dataset of acoustic scenes in the First Order Ambisonics format focusing on speaker tracking. The dataset contains speakers with changing positions during inactivity periods, thus simulating discontinuous tracks. To measure the identity assignment performance, we propose to use tracking association metrics adapted from the computer vision community. We provide experiments showing the complementarity of association metrics with previously used tracking metrics, given continuous and discontinuous spatial tracks.</description>

      <title>Improved in-car sound pick-up using multichannel Wiener filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With advancements in automotive electronics and sensors, the sound pick-up using multiple microphones has become feasible for hands-free telephony and voice command in-car applications. However, challenges remain in effectively processing multiple microphone signals due to bandwidth or processing limitations. This work explores the use of the Multichannel Wiener Filter algorithm with a two-microphone in-car system, to enhance speech quality for driver and passenger voice, i.e., to mitigate notch-filtering effects caused by echoes and improve background noise reduction. We evaluate its performance under various noise conditions using modern objective metrics like Deep Noise Suppression Mean Opinion Score. The effect of head movements of driver/passenger is also investigated. The proposed method is shown to provide significant improvements over a simple mixing of microphone signals.</description>

      <title>uPVC-Net: A Universal Premature Ventricular Contraction Detection Deep Learning Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Introduction: Premature Ventricular Contractions (PVCs) are common cardiac arrhythmias originating from the ventricles. Accurate detection remains challenging due to variability in electrocardiogram (ECG) waveforms caused by differences in lead placement, recording conditions, and population demographics. Methods: We developed uPVC-Net, a universal deep learning model to detect PVCs from any single-lead ECG recordings. The model is developed on four independent ECG datasets comprising a total of 8.3 million beats collected from Holter monitors and a modern wearable ECG patch. uPVC-Net employs a custom architecture and a multi-source, multi-lead training strategy. For each experiment, one dataset is held out to evaluate out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. Results: uPVC-Net achieved an AUC between 97.8% and 99.1% on the held-out datasets. Notably, performance on wearable single-lead ECG data reached an AUC of 99.1%. Conclusion: uPVC-Net exhibits strong generalization across diverse lead configurations and populations, highlighting its potential for robust, real-world clinical deployment.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Uplink Adaptive Compression for Cell-Free MIMO with Limited Fronthaul</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of uplink compression for cell-free multi-input multi-output networks with limited fronthaul capacity. In compress-forward mode, remote radio heads (RRHs) compress the received signal and forward it to a central unit for joint processing. While previous work has focused on a transform-based approach, which optimizes the transform matrix that reduces signals of high dimension to a static pre-determined lower dimension, we propose a rate-based approach that simultaneously finds both dimension and compression adaptively. Our approach accommodates for changes to network traffic and fronthaul limits. Using mutual information as the objective, we obtain the theoretical network capacity for adaptive compression and decouple the expression to enable decentralization. Furthermore, using channel statistics and user traffic density, we show different approaches to compute an efficient representation of side information that summarizes global channel state information and is shared with RRHs to assist compression. While keeping the information exchange overhead low, our decentralized implementation of adaptive compression shows competitive overall network performance compared to a centralized approach.</description>

      <title>Robust Filtering -- Novel Statistical Learning and Inference Algorithms with Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: State estimation or filtering serves as a fundamental task to enable intelligent decision-making in applications such as autonomous vehicles, robotics, healthcare monitoring, smart grids, intelligent transportation, and predictive maintenance. Standard filtering assumes prior knowledge of noise statistics to extract latent system states from noisy sensor data. However, real-world scenarios involve abnormalities like outliers, biases, drifts, and missing observations with unknown or partially known statistics, limiting conventional approaches. This thesis presents novel robust nonlinear filtering methods to mitigate these challenges. Based on insights from our filtering proposals, we extend the formulations to offline estimation/learning setups and propose smoothing extensions. Our methods leverage Bayesian inference frameworks, employing both deterministic and stochastic approximation techniques including Variational Inference (VI) and Particle Filters/Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC). We also study theoretical estimation limits using Bayesian Cram\'er-Rao bounds (BCRBs) in the context of measurement abnormalities. To validate the performance gains of the proposed methods, we perform simulations and experiments in scenarios including target tracking, indoor localization, 3D point cloud registration, mesh registration, and pose graph optimization. The fundamental nature of the work makes it useful in diverse applications, with possible future extensions toward developing outlier-robust machine learning pipelines, learning system dynamics from anomalous data, and addressing challenges in generative AI where standard diffusion models struggle with outliers, imbalanced datasets, and mode collapse.</description>

      <title>Wi-CBR: WiFi-based Cross-domain Behavior Recognition via Multimodal Collaborative Awareness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: WiFi-based human behavior recognition aims to recognize gestures and activities by analyzing wireless signal variations. However, existing methods typically focus on a single type of data, neglecting the interaction and fusion of multiple features. To this end, we propose a novel multimodal collaborative awareness method. By leveraging phase data reflecting changes in dynamic path length and Doppler Shift (DFS) data corresponding to frequency changes related to the speed of gesture movement, we enable efficient interaction and fusion of these features to improve recognition accuracy. Specifically, we first introduce a dual-branch self-attention module to capture spatial-temporal cues within each modality. Then, a group attention mechanism is applied to the concatenated phase and DFS features to mine key group features critical for behavior recognition. Through a gating mechanism, the combined features are further divided into PD-strengthen and PD-weaken branches, optimizing information entropy and promoting cross-modal collaborative awareness. Extensive in-domain and cross-domain experiments on two large publicly available datasets, Widar3.0 and XRF55, demonstrate the superior performance of our method.</description>

      <title>Tracking of Spatially Dynamic Room Impulse Responses Along Locally Linearized Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measuring room impulse responses (RIRs) at multiple spatial points is a time-consuming task, while simulations require detailed knowledge of the room's acoustic environment. In prior work, we proposed a method for estimating the early part of RIRs along a linear trajectory in a time-varying acoustic scenario involving a static sound source and a microphone moving at constant velocity. This approach relies on measured RIRs at the start and end points of the trajectory and assumes that the time intervals occupied by the direct sound and individual reflections along the trajectory are non-overlapping. The method's applicability is therefore restricted to relatively small areas within a room, and its performance has yet to be validated with real-world data. In this paper, we propose a practical extension of the method to more realistic scenarios by segmenting longer trajectories into smaller linear intervals where the assumptions approximately hold. Applying the method piecewise along these segments extends its applicability to more complex room environments. We demonstrate its effectiveness using the trajectoRIR database, which includes moving microphone recordings and RIR measurements at discrete points along a controlled L-shaped trajectory in a real room.</description>

      <title>Confidence-Based Self-Training for EMG-to-Speech: Leveraging Synthetic EMG for Robust Modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Voiced Electromyography (EMG)-to-Speech (V-ETS) models reconstruct speech from muscle activity signals, facilitating applications such as neurolaryngologic diagnostics. Despite its potential, the advancement of V-ETS is hindered by a scarcity of paired EMG-speech data. To address this, we propose a novel Confidence-based Multi-Speaker Self-training (CoM2S) approach, along with a newly curated Libri-EMG dataset. This approach leverages synthetic EMG data generated by a pre-trained model, followed by a proposed filtering mechanism based on phoneme-level confidence to enhance the ETS model through the proposed self-training techniques. Experiments demonstrate our method improves phoneme accuracy, reduces phonological confusion, and lowers word error rate, confirming the effectiveness of our CoM2S approach for V-ETS. In support of future research, we will release the codes and the proposed Libri-EMG dataset-an open-access, time-aligned, multi-speaker voiced EMG and speech recordings.</description>

      <title>Towards Unified AI Models for MU-MIMO Communications: A Tensor Equivariance Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09022v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a unified framework based on equivariance for the design of artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted technologies in multi-user multiple-input-multiple-output (MU-MIMO) systems. We first provide definitions of multidimensional equivariance, high-order equivariance, and multidimensional invariance (referred to collectively as tensor equivariance). On this basis, by investigating the design of precoding and user scheduling, which are key techniques in MU-MIMO systems, we delve deeper into revealing tensor equivariance of the mappings from channel information to optimal precoding tensors, precoding auxiliary tensors, and scheduling indicators, respectively. To model mappings with tensor equivariance, we propose a series of plug-and-play tensor equivariant neural network (TENN) modules, where the computation involving intricate parameter sharing patterns is transformed into concise tensor operations. Building upon TENN modules, we propose the unified tensor equivariance framework that can be applicable to various communication tasks, based on which we easily accomplish the design of corresponding AI-assisted precoding and user scheduling schemes. Simulation results demonstrate that the constructed precoding and user scheduling methods achieve near-optimal performance while exhibiting significantly lower computational complexity and generalization to inputs with varying sizes across multiple dimensions. This validates the superiority of TENN modules and the unified framework.</description>

      <title>Real-Time AIoT for UAV Antenna Interference Detection via Edge-Cloud Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03055v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the fifth-generation (5G) era, eliminating communication interference sources is crucial for maintaining network performance. Interference often originates from unauthorized or malfunctioning antennas, and radio monitoring agencies must address numerous sources of such antennas annually. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can improve inspection efficiency. However, the data transmission delay in the existing cloud-only (CO) artificial intelligence (AI) mode fails to meet the low latency requirements for real-time performance. Therefore, we propose a computer vision-based AI of Things (AIoT) system to detect antenna interference sources for UAVs. The system adopts an optimized edge-cloud collaboration (ECC+) mode, combining a keyframe selection algorithm (KSA), focusing on reducing end-to-end latency (E2EL) and ensuring reliable data transmission, which aligns with the core principles of ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC). At the core of our approach is an end-to-end antenna localization scheme based on the tracking-by-detection (TBD) paradigm, including a detector (EdgeAnt) and a tracker (AntSort). EdgeAnt achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with a mean average precision (mAP) of 42.1% on our custom antenna interference source dataset, requiring only 3 million parameters and 14.7 GFLOPs. On the COCO dataset, EdgeAnt achieves 38.9% mAP with 5.4 GFLOPs. We deployed EdgeAnt on Jetson Xavier NX (TRT) and Raspberry Pi 4B (NCNN), achieving real-time inference speeds of 21.1 (1088) and 4.8 (640) frames per second (FPS), respectively. Compared with CO mode, the ECC+ mode reduces E2EL by 88.9%, increases accuracy by 28.2%. Additionally, the system offers excellent scalability for coordinated multiple UAVs inspections. The detector code is publicly available at https://github.com/SCNU-RISLAB/EdgeAnt.</description>

      <title>New Characteristics and Modeling of 6G Channels: Toward a Unified Channel Model for Standardization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07336v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As 6G research advances, the growing demand leads to the emergence of novel technologies such as integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), new antenna arrays like extremely large MIMO (XL-MIMO) and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS), along with multi-frequency bands (new mid-band, above 100 GHz). Standardized unified channel models are crucial for research and performance evaluation across generations of mobile communication, but the existing 5G 3GPP channel model based on geometry-based stochastic model (GBSM) requires further extension to accommodate these 6G technologies. In response to this need, this article first investigates several distinctive channel characteristics introduced by 6G technologies, such as ISAC target radar cross-section (RCS), sparsity in the new mid-band, and others. Subsequently, an extended GBSM (E-GBSM) is proposed, integrating these characteristics into a unified modeling framework. The proposed model not only accommodates 6G technologies with flexibility but also maintains backward compatibility with 5G, ensuring a smooth evolution between generations. Finally, the implementation process of the proposed model is detailed, and experiments and simulations are presented to validate its effectiveness and accuracy, providing support for 6G channel modeling standardization efforts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12316v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The high computational complexity of the multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm is mainly caused by the subspace decomposition and spectrum search, especially for frequent real-time applications or massive sensors. In this paper, we propose a low-complexity MUSIC algorithm from a finite-precision arithmetic perspective. First, we analyze the computational bottlenecks of the classic low-complexity randomized unitary-based MUSIC (RU-MUSIC), formulating this computational issue as an inner product problem. Then, a mixed-precision method is introduced to address this problem. Specifically, this method partitions summations in inner products into blocks, where intra-block computations use low-precision arithmetic and inter-block sums use high-precision arithmetic. To further improve computational accuracy, we develop an adaptive-precision method that supports adaptive block sizes and multiple precision levels. Finally, simulation results show that the proposed finite-precision MUSIC design achieves direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation performance similar to that using full-precision arithmetic while reducing more than 50\% computational cost.</description>

      <title>Simplicity is Key: An Unsupervised Pretraining Approach for Sparse Radio Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13055v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the Sparse pretrained Radio Transformer (SpaRTran), an unsupervised representation learning approach based on the concept of compressed sensing for radio channels. Our approach learns embeddings that focus on the physical properties of radio propagation, to create the optimal basis for fine-tuning on radio-based downstream tasks. SpaRTran uses a sparse gated autoencoder that induces a simplicity bias to the learned representations, resembling the sparse nature of radio propagation. For signal reconstruction, it learns a dictionary that holds atomic features, which increases flexibility across signal waveforms and spatiotemporal signal patterns. Our experiments show that SpaRTran reduces errors by up to 85 % compared to state-of-the-art methods when fine-tuned on radio fingerprinting, a challenging downstream task. In addition, our method requires less pretraining effort and offers greater flexibility, as we train it solely on individual radio signals. SpaRTran serves as an excellent base model that can be fine-tuned for various radio-based downstream tasks, effectively reducing the cost for labeling. In addition, it is significantly more versatile than existing methods and demonstrates superior generalization.</description>

Abstract: Linear fusion of estimates under the condition of no knowledge of correlation of estimation errors has reached maturity. On the other hand, various cases of partial knowledge are still active research areas. A frequent motivation is to deal with "common information" or "common noise", whatever it means. A fusion rule for a strict meaning of the former expression has already been elaborated. Despite the dual relationship, a strict meaning of the latter one has not been considered so far. The paper focuses on this area. The assumption of unknown "common noise" is formulated first, analysis of theoretical properties and illustrations follow. Although the results are disappointing from the perspective of a single upper bound of mean square error matrices, the partial knowledge demonstrates improvement over no knowledge in suboptimal cases and from the perspective of families of upper bounds.</description>

      <title>Relaxation-Free Min-k-Partition for PCI Assignment in 5G Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10362v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Physical Cell Identity (PCI) is a critical parameter in 5G networks. Efficient and accurate PCI assignment is essential for mitigating mod-3 interference, mod-30 interference, collisions, and confusions among cells, which directly affect network reliability and user experience. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for PCI assignment by decomposing the problem into Min-3-Partition, Min-10-Partition, and a graph coloring problem, leveraging the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT). Furthermore, we develop a relaxation-free approach to the general Min-k-Partition problem by reformulating it as a quadratic program with a norm-equality constraint and solving it using a penalized mirror descent (PMD) algorithm. The proposed method demonstrates superior computational efficiency and scalability, significantly reducing interference while eliminating collisions and confusions in large-scale 5G networks. Numerical evaluations on real-world datasets show that our approach reduces computational time by up to 20 times compared to state-of-the-art methods, making it highly practical for real-time PCI optimization in large-scale networks. These results highlight the potential of our method to improve network performance and reduce deployment costs in modern 5G systems.</description>

      <title>SBMA: A Multiple Access Scheme Combining SCMA and BIA for MU-MISO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.11959v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sparse Code Multiple Access (SCMA) and Blind Interference Alignment (BIA) are key enablers for multi-user communication, yet each suffers from distinct limitations: SCMA faces high complexity and limited multiplexing gain, while BIA requires a long temporal channel pattern and incurs significant decoding delay. This paper proposes SBMA (Sparsecode-and-BIA-based Multiple Access), a novel framework that synergizes SCMA's diversity and BIA's multiplexing while addressing their drawbacks. We design two decoders: a low-complexity two-stage decoder (Zero-forcing + Message Passing Algorithm (MPA)) and a Joint MPA (JMPA) decoder leveraging a virtual factor graph for improved BER. Theoretical analysis derives closed-form BER expressions for a 6-user 2x1 MISO system, validated by simulations. Compared to existing schemes, SBMA with JMPA achieves a diversity gain equivalent to STBC-SCMA and a multiplexing gain comparable to BIA, while simultaneously offering enhanced privacy (relative to STBC-SCMA) and reduced reliance on channel coherence time (compared to BIA). These advancements position SBMA as a compelling solution for next-generation wireless communication systems, particularly in IoT applications demanding high throughput, robust data privacy, and adaptability to dynamic channel conditions.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Robotic Radio Source Localization via a Novel Gaussian Mixture Filtering Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10349v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study proposes a new Gaussian Mixture Filter (GMF) to improve the estimation performance for the autonomous robotic radio signal source search and localization problem in unknown environments. The proposed filter is first tested with a benchmark numerical problem to validate the performance with other state-of-the-practice approaches such as Particle Filter (PF) and Particle Gaussian Mixture (PGM) filters. Then the proposed approach is tested and compared against PF and PGM filters in real-world robotic field experiments to validate its impact for real-world applications. The considered real-world scenarios have partial observability with the range-only measurement and uncertainty with the measurement model. The results show that the proposed filter can handle this partial observability effectively whilst showing improved performance compared to PF, reducing the computation requirements while demonstrating improved robustness over compared techniques.</description>

      <title>Covariance matrix estimation in the singular case using regularized Cholesky factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16302v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider estimating the population covariance matrix when the number of available samples is less than the size of the observations. The sample covariance matrix (SCM) being singular, regularization is mandatory in this case. For this purpose we consider minimizing Stein's loss function and we investigate a method based on augmenting the partial Cholesky decomposition of the SCM. We first derive the finite sample optimum estimator which minimizes the loss for each data realization, then the Oracle estimator which minimizes the risk, i.e., the average value of the loss. Finally a practical scheme is presented where the missing part of the Cholesky decomposition is filled. We conduct a numerical performance study of the proposed method and compare it with available related methods. In particular we investigate the influence of the condition number of the covariance matrix as well as of the shape of its spectrum.</description>

      <title>On the Stability of Graph Convolutional Neural Networks: A Probabilistic Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01213v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph convolutional neural networks (GCNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for analyzing graph-structured data, achieving remarkable success across diverse applications. However, the theoretical understanding of the stability of these models, i.e., their sensitivity to small changes in the graph structure, remains in rather limited settings, hampering the development and deployment of robust and trustworthy models in practice. To fill this gap, we study how perturbations in the graph topology affect GCNN outputs and propose a novel formulation for analyzing model stability. Unlike prior studies that focus only on worst-case perturbations, our distribution-aware formulation characterizes output perturbations across a broad range of input data. This way, our framework enables, for the first time, a probabilistic perspective on the interplay between the statistical properties of the node data and perturbations in the graph topology. We conduct extensive experiments to validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate their benefits over existing baselines, in terms of both representation stability and adversarial attacks on downstream tasks. Our results demonstrate the practical significance of the proposed formulation and highlight the importance of incorporating data distribution into stability analysis.</description>
