      <title>Using Neural Networks to Accelerate TALYS-2.0 Nuclear Reaction Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent efforts to improve the predictability of TALYS-2.0 calculated charged-particle residual product cross sections have focused on adjusting parameters related to the optical model potential and pre-equilibrium process. Although adjusted TALYS-2.0 outputs show marked improvements in agreement with experimental data over the default parameters, the procedure is generally time-consuming due to the need for sequential TALYS-2.0 calculations. Since the models and model parameters must be defined and constrained prior to adjustment, we show in this work that an artificial neural network can serve as a surrogate model to successfully predict TALYS-2.0 outputs within this domain of input parameters. No practical differences were observed in the trained model's performance between uniform random, Latin hypercube and Sobol sequence sampling for generating the training datasets. Once validated, trained neural network models were used to adjust TALYS-2.0 nuclear model parameters, where a multi-parameter fitting procedure was not only feasible but optimal for this process. The neural network approach is &gt;1000x faster at generating residual product cross sections than using TALYS-2.0 directly, and a high-fidelity surrogate model could be implemented with about 1500 TALYS-2.0 files to achieve adjusted cross sections comparable to the previous publication.</description>

      <title>Generalized Onsager-Regularized Lattice Boltzmann Method for error-free Navier-Stokes models on standard lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a novel strategy to address Navier-Stokes modelling errors arising on first-nearest neighbour lattice Boltzmann (LB) methods and introduces fully local corrections through Onsager-Regularized (OReg) non-equilibrium populations. The proposed mechanism, which admits partially and completely corrected OReg models, is used to develop representative partially and completely corrected models for the six-moment-constrained guided equilibrium (GEq) representation on the D2Q9 lattice. The former realization only addresses compatibility condition violations and improves the accuracy by two/four orders of magnitude at reference/arbitrary lattice temperatures respectively, while the latter additionally corrects stress tensor modelling errors, resulting in a fully corrected exact model. Numerical benchmarks of the corrected schemes demonstrate improved accuracy and stability in comparison to the Lattice-BGK and uncorrected OReg-GEq schemes thus presenting a promising avenue for OReg based thermohydrodynamic extensions.</description>

      <title>Physics Constrained Neural Collision Operators for Variable Hard Sphere Surrogates and Ab Initio Angle Prediction in Direct Simulation Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method is the gold standard for non-equilibrium rarefied gas dynamics, yet its computational cost can be prohibitive, especially for near-continuum regimes and high-fidelity \emph{ab initio} potentials. This work develops a unified, physics-constrained neural-operator framework that accelerates DSMC while preserving physical invariants and stochasticity required for long-time kinetic simulations. First, we introduce a local neural collision kernel replacing the phenomenological Variable Hard Sphere (VHS) model. To overcome the variance suppression and artificial cooling inherent to purely deterministic regression surrogates, we augment inference with a physics-constrained stochastic layer. Controlled latent-noise injection restores thermal fluctuations, while cell-wise moment-matching strictly enforces momentum and kinetic-energy conservation. Remarkably, this operator exhibits zero-shot spatial and thermodynamic generalization: a model trained exclusively on 1D Couette flow accurately simulates a complex 2D lid-driven cavity, capturing high-order non-equilibrium moments without retraining.Second, to bypass the extreme cost of quantum-mechanical scattering, we develop a dedicated \emph{ab initio} neural operator for the J\"ager interaction potential. Trained via a \emph{physics harvesting} strategy on large-scale collision pairs, it efficiently captures the high-energy scattering dynamics dominating hypersonic regimes. Validated on a Mach~10 rarefied argon flow over a cylinder, the framework reproduces transport behaviors and shock features with high fidelity, achieving an approximate 20\% cost reduction relative to direct numerical integration.</description>

      <title>Efficient and Accurate Method for Separating Variant Components from Invariant Background and Component Model Fusion for Fast RFIC Design Space Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design of RFIC often involves exploring a large number of design variations in an invariant background composed of the processing stack and unchanged circuit blocks. Conventional electromagnetic solvers require a full-domain simulation for every design variation. In this work, we present a fast method that effectively separates the variant components from the invariant background. It algebraically decomposes the total field solution into the contributions from the design-dependent variations and the invariant background. Hence, the field response due to the invariant background can be simulated once and reused for all design variations. Only the variant components need to be simulated at each design variation, the size of which is small. We also develop an efficient way of reusing the model of each component and fusing them accurately to obtain the model of a system composed of many components. The reduced system of variant components involves computing the field solutions in the invariant background due to all possible sources located at variant components, the number of which can be large. We develop a fast algorithm to reduce them to a few field solutions, the number of which is on the order of the layer number. The proposed method has been applied to RFIC design space exploration. Its accuracy, robustness, and efficiency have been demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Emergent Rate Laws for Collective Lying-Standing Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lying-standing transitions in the first molecular monolayer at organic-inorganic interfaces strongly influence interface dipoles, energy-level alignment, and growth modes, yet their collective kinetics remain difficult to predict. Here, we establish a quantitative adsorbate-to-kinetics relationship using first-principles-based kinetic Monte Carlo simulations combined with a mean-field coarse-graining strategy. Focusing on tetracyanoethylene on Cu(111), we show that the collective transition rate cannot be inferred from any single elementary step but emerges from coupled microscopic processes, including reorientation, adsorption, and diffusion. A local two-step reorientation mechanism captures the diffusion-limited regime, while diffusion of lying molecules accelerates the transition in diffusion-enhanced regimes by suppressing back-reorientation via vacancy-molecule decoupling. This effect is described by a regime-dependent geometric factor accounting for deviations between single-molecule and collective rate constants. By varying molecular size and footprint ratio, we demonstrate that geometry is an intrinsic control parameter. While the collective rate scales approximately with molecular area, increasing the footprint ratio between lying and standing configurations yields order-of-magnitude accelerations due to enhanced vacancy creation and diffusion-assisted stabilization. Finally, we derive an analytical expression for the collective reorientation rate constant linking temperature- and pressure-dependent microscopic rate constants to geometric parameters. The formulation reproduces the simulations across kinetic regimes and provides transferable design principles for engineering lying-standing transition timescales at organic-inorganic interfaces.</description>

      <title>Phase-Dependent Excitonic Light Harvesting and Photovoltaic Limits in Monolayer Y2TeO2 MOenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate phase-dependent electronic and excitonic phenomena in monolayer Y2TeO2 MOenes in the 1T and 2H polymorphs using first-principles theory and an effective many-body framework. Phonon spectra and elastic stability criteria establish both phases as dynamically and mechanically stable. Quasiparticle band structures reveal direct gaps in the near-infrared to visible range, with gap values increasing systematically from semilocal to hybrid exchange treatments. Optical spectra computed using a tight-binding Bethe-Salpeter approach demonstrate pronounced excitonic resonances arising from reduced dimensionality and weak dielectric screening. The exciton binding energies reach 152 meV in the 1T phase and 126 meV in the 2H phase, reflecting enhanced quantum confinement in the structurally denser phase. Our results identify Y2TeO2monolayers as a rare class of stable, direct-gap MOenes with strong excitonic effects, providing a platform for exploring many-body physics in low-dimensional oxychalcogenide systems especially for photovoltaic applications.</description>

      <title>Conductive Heat Flux Driven by a Pressure Gradient in Non-Maxwellian Reference States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Standard Navier--Stokes--Fourier theory and Maxwellian-based Grad 13-moment closures yield no independent pressure-gradient driving of the conductive heat flux in an isothermal, single-component gas in the hydrodynamic (small-Knudsen) regime. This absence is specific to the Maxwellian local-equilibrium weight. We show that when the closure is constructed about a generalized class of isotropic non-Maxwellian reference weights with finite fourth moment -- characterized by a single shape parameter (a kurtosis-like moment ratio) that deforms the distribution continuously away from a Maxwellian -- the small-Knudsen constitutive reduction retains a bulk pressure-gradient (barothermal) contribution to the conductive heat flux. This mechanism predicts pressure-driven conduction as a direct kinetic signature of non-Maxwellian equilibrium moment structure.</description>

      <title>Ab Initio Random Matrix Theory of Molecular Electronic Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use ab initio electronic-structure methods to investigate random-matrix theory (RMT) universality in molecular electronic structure. Using single-reference electronic structure methods, including Hartree-Fock, configuration-interaction singles (CIS), density functional theory, and linear-response time-dependent density-functional theory, we compute single-particle orbital energies and many-electron excitations of several representative molecules (benzene, alanine, 1-phenylethylamine, methyloxirane, and helicene chains). For generic low-symmetry geometries, the unfolded spectra of these ab initio Hamiltonians exhibit Wigner-Dyson level statistics of the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble (GOE). For extended helicene chains we explicitly restrict to bound valence excitations below the ionization threshold and still observe GOE statistics, indicating that the RMT universality is present for physical states of direct relevance to real molecules. We further explore the electric and magnetic field dependence of the molecular electronic spectra. The variance of electric polarizability (level curvature K) is predicted to be non-analytic in the magnetic field which serves as an infrared cutoff, &lt;K^2&gt; proportional to log(1/|B|). We observe a transition to the Gaussian unitary ensemble (GUE) by increasing the magnetic fields, although it occurs only at magnetic fields far beyond experimentally accessible scales. Our results indicate that random matrix universality provides a general framework for organizing ab initio predictions of interacting electron spectra in complex systems.</description>

      <title>Towards single-shot coherent imaging via overlap-free ptychography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ptychographic imaging at synchrotron and XFEL sources requires dense overlapping scans, limiting throughput and increasing dose. Extending coherent diffractive imaging to overlap-free operation on extended samples remains an open problem. Here, we extend PtychoPINN (O. Hoidn \emph{et al.}, \emph{Scientific Reports} \textbf{13}, 22789, 2023) to deliver \emph{overlap-free, single-shot} reconstructions in a Fresnel coherent diffraction imaging (CDI) geometry while also accelerating conventional multi-shot ptychography. The framework couples a differentiable forward model of coherent scattering with a Poisson photon-counting likelihood; real-space overlap enters as a tunable parameter via coordinate-based grouping rather than a hard requirement. On synthetic benchmarks, reconstructions remain accurate at low counts ($\sim\!10^4$ photons/frame), and overlap-free single-shot reconstruction with an experimental probe reaches amplitude structural similarity (SSIM) 0.904, compared with 0.968 for overlap-constrained reconstruction. Against a data-saturated supervised model with the same backbone (16,384 training images), PtychoPINN achieves higher SSIM with only 1,024 images and generalizes to unseen illumination profiles. Per-graphics processing unit (GPU) throughput is approximately $40\times$ that of least-squares maximum-likelihood (LSQ-ML) reconstruction at matched $128\times128$ resolution. These results, validated on experimental data from the Advanced Photon Source and the Linac Coherent Light Source, unify single-exposure Fresnel CDI and overlapped ptychography within one framework, supporting dose-efficient, high-throughput imaging at modern light sources.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically Fast Clebsch-Gordan Tensor Products with Vector Spherical Harmonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: $E(3)$-equivariant neural networks have proven to be effective in a wide range of 3D modeling tasks. A fundamental operation of such networks is the tensor product, which allows interaction between different feature types. Because this operation scales poorly, there has been considerable work towards accelerating this interaction. However, recently \citet{xieprice} have pointed out that most speedups come from a reduction in expressivity rather than true algorithmic improvements on computing Clebsch-Gordan tensor products. A modification of Gaunt tensor product \citep{gaunt} can give a true asymptotic speedup but is incomplete and misses many interactions. In this work, we provide the first complete algorithm which truly provides asymptotic benefits Clebsch-Gordan tensor products. For full CGTP, our algorithm brings runtime complexity from the naive $O(L^6)$ to $O(L^4\log^2 L)$, close to the lower bound of $O(L^4)$. We first show how generalizing fast Fourier based convolution naturally leads to the previously proposed Gaunt tensor product \citep{gaunt}. To remedy antisymmetry issues, we generalize from scalar signals to irrep valued signals, giving us tensor spherical harmonics. We prove a generalized Gaunt formula for the tensor harmonics. Finally, we show that we only need up to vector valued signals to recover the missing interactions of Gaunt tensor product.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.21808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Matrix representations of quantum operators are computationally complete but often obscure the structural topology of information flow within a quantum circuit \cite{nielsen2000}. In this paper, we introduce a generalized graph-theoretic framework for analyzing quantum operators by mapping unitary matrices to directed graphs; we term these structures \emph{Imperfect Graphs} or more formally as \emph{Topological Structure of Superpositions}(TSS) as a tool to devise better Quantum Algorithms. In this framework, we represent computational basis states as vertices. A directed edge exists between two vertices if and only if there is a non-zero amplitude transition between them, effectively mapping the support of the unitary operator. In this paper we deliberately discard probability amplitudes and phase information to isolate the connectivity and reachability properties of the operator. We demonstrate how TSS intuitively helps describe gates such as the Hadamard, Pauli-(X,Y,Z) gates, etc \cite{nielsen2000}. This framework provides a novel perspective for viewing quantum circuits as discrete dynamical systems \cite{childs2009,aharonov2001}

      <title>Computing Nonequilibrium Transport from Short-Time Transients: From Lorentz Gas to Heat Conduction in One Dimensional Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We test the Transient Time Correlation Function (TTCF) method to compute nonequilibrium transport coefficients, highlighting its conceptual and practical difference from the standard time-average approach. While time averages extract transport properties from long stationary trajectories and discard transient dynamics, TTCF adopts the complementary strategy: it exploits the information contained in short-time transients following the onset of an external perturbation, while discarding the long-time evolution once stationarity is reached. We revisit the theoretical framework of TTCF and assess its numerical performance through representative case studies, the Lorentz gas and a many-body system, namely a chain of oscillators with anharmonic pinning potential. By direct comparison with time averages, we show that for the Lorentz gas TTCF yields consistent transport coefficients in both linear and nonlinear regimes at a reduced computational cost. Moreover, the TTCF displays superior precision in the linear-response regime, and remains reliable in non-ergodic situations, revealing the presence of regions of phase space corresponding to different behaviors, as well as the possibility of phase transitions. For the anharmonic chain, we show that TTCF is a scalable and efficient alternative for the numerical study of nonequilibrium transport.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamics of Dense Active Fluids: Turbulence-Like States and the Role of Advected Activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dense suspensions of self-propelled bacteria and related active fluids exhibit spontaneous flow generation, vortex formation, and spatiotemporally chaotic dynamics despite operating at vanishingly small Reynolds numbers. These phenomena, commonly referred to as active turbulence, display striking visual and statistical similarities to classical inertial turbulence while arising from fundamentally different nonequilibrium mechanisms. In this article, we present a combined review and theoretical study of hydrodynamic models for dense active fluids, with particular emphasis on bacterial suspensions described by the Toner--Tu--Swift--Hohenberg (TTSH) framework. We review key experimental and theoretical developments underlying the analogy between active and inertial turbulence, highlighting the emergence of multiple dynamical regimes and the conditions under which universal spectral and intermittent behavior arises in homogeneous systems. Moving beyond the conventional assumption of spatially uniform activity, we introduce a minimal model in which the activity field is heterogeneous and dynamically advected by the flow it generates. Thus treating activity as a spatiotemporally evolving field coupled to the TTSH dynamics, we investigate how advection and diffusion lead to sharp activity fronts, confinement of turbulent motion, and complex interfacial morphologies. Our numerical results demonstrate that spatial variations in activity can induce transient coexistence of distinct spectral regimes and that universality in active turbulence is inherently local and time-dependent in heterogeneous systems. These findings underscore the importance of treating activity as a dynamical field in its own right and provide a framework for studying active turbulence in more realistic, spatially structured biological and synthetic active matter systems.</description>

      <title>MBD-ML: Many-body dispersion from machine learning for molecules and materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Van der Waals (vdW) interactions are essential for describing molecules and materials, from drug design and catalysis to battery applications. These omnipresent interactions must also be accurately included in machine-learned force fields. The many-body dispersion (MBD) method stands out as one of the most accurate and transferable approaches to capture vdW interactions, requiring only atomic $C_6$ coefficients and polarizabilities as input. We present MBD-ML, a pretrained message passing neural network that predicts these atomic properties directly from atomic structures. Through seamless integration with libMBD, our method enables the immediate calculation of MBD-inclusive total energies, forces, and stress tensors. By eliminating the need for intermediate electronic structure calculations, MBD-ML offers a practical and streamlined tool that simplifies the incorporation of state-of-the-art vdW interactions into any electronic structure code, as well as empirical and machine-learned force fields.</description>

      <title>High-pressure single-crystal X-ray diffraction study of ErVO4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an investigation into the crystal structure of ErVO4 under variable pressure conditions. The high-pressure single crystal X-ray diffraction experiments performed employing helium as the pressure medium facilitated structure refinements up to 24.1(2) GPa. The transition from zircon to scheelite was observed at a pressure of 7.9(1) GPa. In contrast to previous reports, we did not detect any sign of phase coexistence. We also did not observe the second phase transitions previously predicted by density-functional theory to occur below 20 GPa. The determination of the pressure dependence of unit-cell parameters and volume yields precise values for linear compressibility of each axis and the pressure-volume equation of state for both the zircon and scheelite phases. Additional information on the mechanical properties of ErVO4, obtained from density-functional theory calculations, is also reported.</description>

      <title>Modular hybrid machine learning and physics-based potentials for scalable modeling of van der Waals heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12985v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurately modeling the structural reconstruction and thermodynamic behavior of van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures remains a significant challenge due to the limitations of conventional force fields in capturing their complex mechanical, thermal, electronic, and tribological properties. To address these limitations, we develop a hybrid framework that combines single-layer machine-learned potential ($s$MLP) with physics-based anisotropic interlayer potential (ILP), effectively decoupling intralayer and interlayer interactions. This $s$MLP+ILP approach modularizes the modeling of vdW heterostructures like assembling LEGOs, reducing the required training configurations by at least an order of magnitude compared to the pure MLP approach, while retaining predictive accuracy and computational efficiency. We validate our framework by accurately reproducing the mechanical and thermal transport properties of graphite and bulk hexagonal boron nitride ($h$-BN), and by resolving intricate Moir\'e patterns in graphene/$h$-BN bilayer and graphene/graphene/$h$-BN trilayer heterostructures, achieving excellent agreement with experimental observations. Leveraging the developed $s$MLP+ILP approach, we reveal the stacking order-dependent formation of Moir{\'e} superlattice in trilayer graphene/$h$-BN/MoS$_2$ heterostructures, demonstrating its ability to accurately model large-scale vdW systems comprising hundreds of thousands of atoms with near $ab$ $initio$ precision. These findings demonstrate that the hybrid $s$MLP+ILP framework remarkably outperforms existing pure machine-learned or empirical potentials, offering a scalable and transferable solution for accurately and extensively modeling complex vdW materials across diverse applications, including sliding ferroelectricity, thermal management, resistive switching, and superlubric nanodevices.</description>

      <title>Entropy stability analysis of smoothed dissipative particle dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:1905.06332v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article presents an entropy stability analysis of smoothed dissipative particle dynamics (SDPD) to review the validity of particle discretization of entropy equations. First, we consider the simplest SDPD system: a simulation of incompressible flows using an explicit time integration scheme, assuming a quasi-static scenario with constant volume, constant number of particles, and infinitesimal time shift. Next, we derive a form of entropy from the discretized entropy equation of SDPD by integrating it with respect to time. We then examine the properties of a two-particle system for a constant temperature gradient. Interestingly, our theoretical analysis suggests that there exist eight different types of entropy stability conditions, which depend on the types of kernel functions. It is found that the Lucy kernel, poly6 kernel, and spiky kernel produce the same types of entropy stability conditions, whereas the spline kernel produces different types of entropy stability conditions. Our results contribute to a deeper understanding of particle discretization.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic recurrent neural network as the first type of non-Euclidean neural quantum state ansatz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22083v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce the first type of non-Euclidean neural quantum state (NQS) ansatz, in the form of the hyperbolic GRU (a variant of recurrent neural networks (RNNs)), to be used in the Variational Monte Carlo method of approximating the ground state energy for quantum many-body systems. In particular, we examine the performances of NQS ansatzes constructed from both conventional or Euclidean RNN/GRU and from hyperbolic GRU in the prototypical settings of the one- and two-dimensional transverse field Ising models (TFIM) and the one-dimensional Heisenberg $J_1J_2$ and $J_1J_2J_3$ systems. By virtue of the fact that, for all of the experiments performed in this work, hyperbolic GRU can yield performances comparable to or better than Euclidean RNNs, which have been extensively studied in these settings in the literature, our work is a proof-of-concept for the viability of hyperbolic GRU as the first type of non-Euclidean NQS ansatz for quantum many-body systems. Furthermore, in settings where the Hamiltonian displays a clear hierarchical interaction structure, such as the 1D Heisenberg $J_1J_2$ &amp; $J_1J_2J_3$ systems with the 1st, 2nd and even 3rd nearest neighbor interactions, our results show that hyperbolic GRU definitively outperforms its Euclidean version in almost all instances. The fact that these results are reminiscent of the established ones from natural language processing where hyperbolic GRU almost always outperforms Euclidean RNNs when the training data exhibit a tree-like or hierarchical structure leads us to hypothesize that hyperbolic GRU NQS ansatz would likely outperform Euclidean RNN/GRU NQS ansatz in quantum spin systems that involve different degrees of nearest neighbor interactions. Finally, with this work, we hope to initiate future studies of other types of non-Euclidean NQS beyond hyperbolic GRU.</description>

      <title>Stability of Continuous Time Quantum Walks in Complex Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17880v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the stability of continuous-time quantum walks (CTQW) across cycle, complete, star, Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi, small-world, and scale-free topologies under energy-based intrinsic decoherence, node-based Haken-Strobl noise, and edge-based quantum stochastic walk (QSW) decoherence. Defining stability as the preservation of quantum properties, we characterize it using node probabilities, $\ell_1$-norm of coherence, fidelity, quantum-classical distance, and von Neumann entropy. Our results show that intrinsic decoherence preserves coherence longest while QSW causes rapid decay. Stability rankings vary and depend on the decoherence types, network structure, and properties of node where the walker is initialized specifically in heterogeneous networks. Dense connected network like complete and heterogenous networks, for instance, star, and scale-free are stable under Haken-Strobl noise but become uniquely fragile under QSW when initialized on high degree nodes. However, these same networks, due to their inherent localization, exhibit lower coherence in the noiseless regime, highlighting a fundamental trade-off between localization and coherence. Furthermore, the centrality of the initialization node has a pronounced impact on relaxation time and stability measures, underscoring the critical role of local topological features in quantum dynamics.</description>

      <title>Mitigating the sign problem by quantum computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13017v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The notorious sign problem severely limits the applicability of quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations, as statistical errors grow exponentially with system size and inverse temperature. A recent proposal of a quantum-computing stochastic series expansion (qc-SSE) method suggested that the problem could be avoided by introducing constant energy shifts into the Hamiltonian. Here we critically examine this framework and show that it does not strictly resolve the sign problem for Hamiltonians with non-commuting terms. Instead, it provides a practical mitigation strategy that suppresses the occurrence of negative weights. Using the antiferromagnetic anisotropic XY chain as a test case, we analyze the dependence of the average sign on system size, temperature, anisotropy, and shift parameters. An operator contraction method is introduced to improve efficiency. Our results demonstrate that moderate shifts optimally balance sign mitigation and statistical accuracy, while large shifts amplify errors, leaving the sign problem unresolved but alleviated.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Phase Transitions in Mean-Field Ginzburg-Landau Models: Conjugate Fields and Fourier-Mode Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21803v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamic phase transitions of periodically forced mean-field ferromagnets are often described by a single order parameter and a scalar conjugate field. Building from previous work, we show that, at the critical period $P_c$ of the mean-field Ginzburg-Landau (MFGL) dynamics with energy $F(m)=am^2+bm^4-hm$, the correct conjugate field is the entire even-Fourier component part of the applied field. The correct order parameter is $z_k=\sqrt{\bigl|\,m_k^2-|m_{k,c}|^2\,\bigr|}$, where $m_k$ is the $k^{th}$ Fourier component of the magnetization m(t), and $m_{k,c}$ is the $k^{th}$ Fourier component at the critical period. Using high-accuracy limit-cycle integration and Fourier analysis, we first confirm that, for periodic fields that contain only odd components, the symmetry-broken branch below $P_c$ exhibits $z_k \propto \varepsilon^{1/2}$ (computationally tested for modes $k\le30$), where $\varepsilon=(P_c-P)/P_c$. This provides strong evidence that the 1/2 scaling holds for all Fourier modes. We then find three robust facts: (1) Exactly at $P_c$, adding a small perturbation composed of even Fourier components with an overall field multiplier $h_{mult}$ yields $z_k \propto h_{mult}^{1/3}$ across many $k$. (2) Mode-resolved deviations obey a parity rule: $|\delta m_{2n}| \propto h_{mult}^{1/3}$ and $|\delta m_{2n+1}| \propto h_{mult}^{2/3}$. (3) These scalings persist in two MFGL models with higher-order nonlinearities.</description>

      <title>Quantum error mitigation using energy sampling and extrapolation enhanced Clifford data regression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03556v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Error mitigation is essential for the practical implementation of quantum algorithms on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. This work explores and extends Clifford Data Regression (CDR) to mitigate noise in quantum chemistry simulations using the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE). Using the H$_4$ molecule with the tiled Unitary Product State (tUPS) ansatz, we perform noisy simulations with the ibm torino noise model to investigate in detail the effect of various hyperparameters in CDR on the error mitigation quality. Building on these insights, two improvements to the CDR framework are proposed. The first, Energy Sampling (ES), improves performance by selecting only the lowest-energy training circuits for regression, thereby further biasing the sample energies toward the target state. The second, Non-Clifford Extrapolation (NCE), enhances the regression model by including the number of non-Clifford parameters as an additional input, enabling the model to learn how the noisy-ideal mapping evolves as the circuit approaches the optimal one. Our numerical results demonstrate that both strategies outperform the original CDR.</description>

      <title>Topology optimization of type-II superconductors with superconductor-dielectric/vacuum interfaces based on Ginzburg-Landau theory under Weyl gauge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14261v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Geometrical design is a crucial and challenging strategy for improving the performance of type-II superconductors, because the proper placement of intended defects in the current path contribute to flux pinning, a reduction in dissipation, and an increase in achievable current density. Topology optimization is currently one of the most powerful approaches used to determine consistent structural geometries. Therefore, a topology optimization approach is presented to inversely design structural geometries of low- and high-temperature type-II superconductors with superconductor-dielectric/vacuum interfaces. In the presented approach, the magnetic response of type-II superconductors is modeled using the Ginzburg-Landau theory, where the temporal evolution of the order parameter and vector potential is described by the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equations under the Weyl gauge.</description>
