      <title>ProTDyn: a foundation Protein language model for Thermodynamics and Dynamics generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation has long been the principal computational tool for exploring protein conformational landscapes and dynamics, but its application is limited by high computational cost. We present ProTDyn, a foundation protein language model that unifies conformational ensemble generation and multi-timescale dynamics modeling within a single framework. Unlike prior approaches that treat these tasks separately, ProTDyn allows flexible independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) ensemble sampling and dynamic trajectory simulation. Across diverse protein systems, ProTDyn yields thermodynamically consistent ensembles, faithfully reproduces dynamical properties over multiple timescales, and generalizes to proteins beyond its training data. It offers a scalable and efficient alternative to conventional MD simulations.</description>

      <title>In vivo solid stress is associated with poor patient survival in glioma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solid stress is increasingly being recognized as a key driver of tumor progression and aggressiveness, yet it has not been directly measured in patients so far. Here, we combine multifrequency magnetic resonance elastography with 3D magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based diffeomorphic deformable image registration network analysis to noninvasively quantify glioma-induced solid stress. In both a mouse model and patients, we identified spatially heterogeneous deformation patterns extending well beyond tumor margins. While deformation magnitude was not found to correlate with tumor size or clinical outcome, excess solid stress - defined as the product of peritumoral volumetric strain and stiffness differential between unaffected brain and peritumoral tissue - was inversely associated with patient survival. To our knowledge, these findings provide the first in vivo indication that tumor-associated mechanical stress affects clinical outcomes and can thus serve as a quantitative, imaging-derived biomarker with potential utility for prognostication and treatment guidance in patients with glioma.</description>

      <title>An infection-responsive collagen-based wet-spun textile fibre for wound monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wound infections are a significant clinical and socioeconomic challenge, contributing to delayed healing and increased wound chronicity. To enable early infection detection and inform therapeutic decisions, this study investigated the design of pH-responsive collagen fibres using a scalable wet spinning process, evaluating product suitability for textile dressings and resorbable sutures. Type I collagen was chemically functionalised with 4-vinylbenzyl chloride, enabling UV-induced crosslinking and yielding mechanically robust fibres. Bromothymol blue, a halochromic dye responsive to pH changes, was incorporated via drop-casting to impart visual infection-responsive colour change. Gravimetric analysis and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy confirmed high dye loading, whereby a Loading Efficiency of 99+/-3 wt.% was achieved. The fibres exhibited controlled swelling in aqueous environments (Swelling Ratio: 323+/-79 - 492+/-73 wt.%) and remarkable wet-state Ultimate Tensile Strength (UTS: 12+/-3 - 15+/-7 MPa), while up to ca. 30 wt.% of their initial crosslinked mass was retained after 24 hours in a collagenase-rich buffer (pH 7.4, 37{\deg}C, 2 CDU) and ethanol series dehydration. Importantly, distinct and reversible colour transitions were observed between acidic (pH 5) and alkaline (pH 8) environments, with up to 88 wt.% dye retention following 72-hour incubation. The fibres were successfully processed into woven dressing prototypes and demonstrated knotting ability suitable for suture applications. Overall, these wet-spun collagen fibres integrate infection-responsive capability, biodegradability, and scalable fabrication, representing a promising platform for smart wound dressings and resorbable sutures.</description>

      <title>Information and the living tree of life: A theory of measurement grounded in biology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend a formal framework that previously derived time from the multifractal structure of biological lineages (Hudnall \&amp; D'Souza, 2025). That work showed that time itself is multifractal -- not a universal background dimension, but an observer-dependent geometry. Here we develop the corresponding theory of measurement: showing that a multifractal conception of time not only permits measurement, but grounds it more rigorously in the structure of biology. The tree of life is modeled as the outcome of stochastic, convex branching, and we show how information-theoretic and fractal measures render its multifractal geometry into measurable, observer-relative time intervals. At the core is a dilation equation that expresses relative time elapse between entities as dimensionless ratios. Operational standards such as the SI second remain valid, but our framework makes explicit their lineage-dependence. This framework unifies measurement theory with biological form, preserves full compatibility with established science, and provides a biologically grounded theory of observation. It enables comparative analyses of duration and kinematics across lineages, with predictions that are directly open to experimental validation.</description>

      <title>Analytical Model of Resonant Quantum Excitation Transport in Molecular Chains at finite Temperatures: Application of Integral Transforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the potential impact of intramolecular excitations on the active regions of biomolecular chains, which may play a role in physiological processes within living cells. We assumed that an excitation localized in a specific chain segment can modify its physical properties (e.g., local charge distribution or electric dipole moments), thereby altering its role in biochemical processes. As a consequence, the biochemical functionality of the molecular chain may be altered, or even disrupted. Moreover, quantum resonance effects may cause an excitation induced at one structural element to delocalize and appear at a distant site, potentially affecting the functionality of regions located far from the site where the excitation was initially induced.
  To investigate this phenomenon, we developed and analyzed a theoretical model in which a single excitation is induced in a particular structural element of a finite molecular chain in thermal equilibrium with its environment. The interaction between the excitation and the thermal oscillations of the chain was taken into account. Differential equations for the correlation functions were derived and solved analytically using integral transformations, providing information on the probability of finding the excitation at each site of the chain. The results show that both the probability of finding the excitation at distant sites and its residence time depend on the chain's physical characteristics, temperature, and initial excitation location.</description>

      <title>Advection selects pattern in multi-stable emulsions of active droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlling the size of droplets, for example in biological cells, is challenging because large droplets typically outcompete smaller droplets due to surface tension. This coarsening is generally accelerated by hydrodynamic effects, but active chemical reactions can suppress it. We show that the interplay of these processes leads to three different dynamical regimes: (i) Advection dominates the coalescence of small droplets, (ii) diffusion leads to Ostwald ripening for intermediate sizes, and (iii) reactions finally suppress coarsening. Interestingly, a range of final droplet sizes is stable, of which one is selected depending on initial conditions. Our analysis demonstrates that hydrodynamic effects control initial droplet sizes, but they do not affect the later dynamics, in contrast to passive emulsions.</description>

      <title>Dispersion Relations for Active Undulators in Overdamped Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13037v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Organisms that locomote by propagating waves of body bending can maintain performance across heterogeneous environments by modifying their gait frequency $\omega$ or wavenumber $k$. We identify a unifying relationship between these parameters for overdamped undulatory swimmers (including nematodes, spermatozoa, and mm-scale fish) moving in diverse environmental rheologies, in the form of an active `dispersion relation' $\omega\propto k^{\pm2}$. A model treating the organisms as actively driven viscoelastic beams reproduces the experimentally observed scaling. The relative strength of rate-dependent dissipation in the body and the environment determines whether $k^2$ or $k^{-2}$ scaling is observed. The existence of these scaling regimes reflects the $k$ and $\omega$ dependence of the various underlying force terms and how their relative importance changes with the external environment and the neuronally commanded gait.</description>

      <title>From reductionism to realism: Holistic mathematical modelling for complex biological systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20511v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: At its core, the physics paradigm adopts a reductionist approach, aiming to understand fundamental phenomena by decomposing them into simpler, elementary processes. While this strategy has been tremendously successful in physics, it has often fallen short in addressing fundamental questions in the biological sciences. This arises from the inherent complexity of biological systems, characterised by heterogeneity, polyfunctionality and interactions across spatiotemporal scales. Nevertheless, the traditional framework of complex systems modelling falls short, as its emphasis on broad theoretical principles has often failed to produce predictive, empirically-grounded insights. To advance towards actionable mathematical models in biology, we argue, using neuroscience as a case study, that it is necessary to move beyond reductionist approaches and instead embrace the complexity of biological systems - leveraging the growing availability of high-resolution data and advances in high-performance computing. We advocate for a holistic mathematical modelling paradigm that harnesses rich representational structures such as annotated and multilayer networks, employs agent-based models and simulation-based approaches, and focuses on the inverse problem of inferring system dynamics from observations. We emphasise that this approach is fully compatible with the search for fundamental biophysical principles, and highlight the potential it holds to drive progress in mathematical biology over the next two decades.</description>

      <title>Non-linear inhibitory responses enhance performance in collective decision-making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20927v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The precise modulation of activity through inhibitory signals ensures that both insect colonies and neural circuits operate efficiently and adaptively, highlighting the fundamental importance of inhibition in biological systems. Modulatory signals are produced in various contexts and are known for subtly shifting the probability of receiver behaviors based on response thresholds. Here we propose a non-linear function to introduce inhibitory responsiveness in collective decision-making inspired by honeybee house-hunting. We show that, compared with usual linear functions, non-linear responses enhance final consensus and reduce deliberation time. This improvement comes at the cost of reduced accuracy in identifying the best option. Nonetheless, for value-based tasks, the benefits of faster consensus and enhanced decision-making might outweigh this drawback.</description>
