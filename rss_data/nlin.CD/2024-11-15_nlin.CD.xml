      <title>Chaos in hyperscaling violating Lifshitz theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We holographically study quantum chaos in hyperscaling-violating Lifshitz (HVL) theories (with charge). Particularly, we present a detailed computation of the out-of-time ordered correlator (OTOC) via the shockwave analysis in the bulk HVL geometry with a planar horizon topology. We also compute the butterfly velocity ($v_{B}$) using the entanglement wedge reconstruction and find that the result matches the one obtained from shockwave analysis. Furthermore, we analyze in detail, the behavior of $v_{B}$ with respect to the dynamical critical exponent (z), hyperscaling-violating parameter ($\theta$), charge (Q) and the horizon radius ($r_{h}$). We interestingly find non-monotonic behavior of $v_{B}$ with respect to z (in the allowed region and for certain (not all) fixed, permissible values of $\theta$, Q and $r_{h}$) and $\theta$ (in the allowed region and for certain (not all) fixed, permissible values of z, Q and $r_{h}$). Moreover, $v_{B}$ is found to monotonically decrease with an increase in charge (for all permissible, fixed values of z, $\theta$ and $r_{h}$), whereas it is found to monotonically increase with $r_{h}$ (for all fixed, permissible values of z, $\theta$ and Q). Unpacking these features can offer some valuable insights into the chaotic nature of HVL theories.</description>

      <title>Properties of covariant Lyapunov vectors as continuous vector fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.12543v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of ``covariant Lyapunov field'', which assigns all the components of covariant Lyapunov vectors at almost all points of the phase space of a dynamical system. We focus on the case in which these fields are overall continuous and also differentiable along individual trajectories. We show that in ergodic systems such fields can be characterized as the global solutions of a differential equation on the phase space. Due to the arbitrariness in the choice of a multiplicative scalar factor for the Lyapunov vector at each point of the phase space, this differential equation presents a gauge invariance that is formally analogous to that of quantum electrodynamics. Under the hypothesis that the covariant Lyapunov field is overall differentiable, we give a geometric interpretation of our result: each 2-dimensional foliation of the space that contains whole trajectories is univocally associated with a Lyapunov exponent and the corresponding covariant Lyapunov field is one of the generators of the foliation.</description>

      <title>The interplay of inertia and elasticity in polymeric flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14752v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Addition of polymers modifies a turbulent flow in a manner that depends non-trivially on the interplay of fluid inertia, quantified by the Reynolds number $Re$, and the elasticity of the dissolved polymers, given by the Deborah number $De$. We use direct numerical simulations to study polymeric flows at different $Re$ and $De$ numbers, and uncover various features of their dynamics. Polymeric flows exhibit a multiscaling energy spectrum that is a function of $Re$ and $De$, owing to different dominant contributions to the total energy flux across scales. This behaviour is also manifested in the real space scaling of structure functions. We also shed light on how the addition of polymers results in slowing down the fluid non-linear cascade resulting in a depleted flux, as velocity fluctuations with less energy persist for longer times in polymeric flows. These velocity fluctuations exhibit intermittent, large deviations similar to that in a Newtonian flow at large $Re$, but differ more and more as $Re$ becomes smaller. This observation is further supported by the statistics of fluid energy dissipation in polymeric flows, whose distributions collapse on to the Newtonian at large $Re$, but increasingly differ from it as $Re$ decreases. We also show that polymer dissipation is significantly less intermittent compared to fluid dissipation, and even less so when elasticity becomes large. Polymers, on an average, dissipate more energy when they are stretched more, which happens in extensional regions of the flow. However, owing to vortex stretching, regions with large rotation rates also correlate with large polymer extensions, albeit to a relatively less degree than extensional regions.</description>

      <title>Second law of thermodynamics: Spontaneous cold-to-hot heat transfer in a nonchaotic medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09161v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has long been known that, fundamentally different from a large body of rarefied gas, when a Knudsen gas is immersed in a thermal bath, it may never reach thermal equilibrium. The root cause is nonchaoticity: as the particle-particle collisions are sparse, the particle trajectories tend to be independent of each other. Usually, this counterintuitive phenomenon is studied through kinetic theory and is not considered a thermodynamic problem. In current research, we show that if incorporated in a compound setup, such an intrinsically nonequilibrium behavior has nontrivial consequences and cannot circumvent thermodynamics: cold-to-hot heat transfer may happen spontaneously, either continuously (with an energy barrier) or cyclically (with time-dependent entropy barriers). It allows for production of useful work by absorbing heat from a single thermal reservoir without any other effect. As the system obeys the first law of thermodynamics, it breaks the boundaries of the second law of thermodynamics.</description>
