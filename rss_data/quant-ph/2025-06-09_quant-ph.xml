      <title>Spin textures in curved paths on a curved surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the quantum dynamics of a spin-1/2 particle confined to a curved path from the dynamics of a two-dimensional curved thin-layer system incorporating spin connection contributions. We demonstrate that the geodesic curvature, normal curvature, and geodesic torsion of the curve govern the emergent non-Abelian gauge potential and effective scalar potential in the system's Hamiltonian. The resulting spin precession dynamics induced by the gauge potential are analyzed, revealing that the rotation angle of spin orientation along a surface boundary and the pseudo-magnetic flux are topologically governed by the surface geometry. Spin texture evolution along helices illustrates distinct behaviors under geodesic versus non-geodesic propagation. Further, spin evolution in a closed trajectory-Viviani's curve, exemplifies the surface-dependent spin orientation and path-ordering sensitivity of the non-Abelian gauge potential. Our theory establishes a framework for spin-state manipulation via engineered nanostructured channels, enabling novel topological quantum control strategies.</description>

      <title>Transient and steady-state chaos in dissipative quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dissipative quantum chaos plays a central role in the characterization and control of information scrambling, non-unitary evolution, and thermalization, but it still lacks a precise definition. The Grobe-Haake-Sommers conjecture, which links Ginibre level repulsion to classical chaotic dynamics, was recently shown to fail [Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 240404 (2024)]. We properly restore the quantum-classical correspondence through a dynamical approach based on entanglement entropy and out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs), which reveal signatures of chaos beyond spectral statistics. Focusing on the open anisotropic Dicke model, we identify two distinct regimes: transient chaos, marked by rapid early-time growth of entanglement and OTOCs followed by low saturation values, and steady-state chaos, characterized by high long-time values. We introduce a random matrix toy model and show that Ginibre spectral statistics signals short-time chaos rather than steady-state chaos. Our results establish entanglement dynamics and OTOCs as reliable diagnostics of dissipative quantum chaos across different timescales.</description>

      <title>Orbit classification and analysis of qutrit graph states under local complementation and local scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph states and their entanglement properties are pivotal for the development of quantum computing and technologies. For qubits, local complementation, a graphical rule that connects all the equivalent states under Local Clifford (LC) operations, was used for the complete characterization of all the LC equivalence classes up until 12 particles, assisting applications in quantum error correction and state preparation protocols optimization. This concept has been extended for qudits. In this work, we provide a complete characterization of the entanglement classes up until 7 qutrits, mapping each class into an orbit. The graph-theoretic properties of the orbits are studied, illuminating the rich structure they have. Clear connections between the connectivity of the orbits and the entanglement properties are observed. The correlations between the graph-theoretic properties and the Schmidt measure provide useful insights regarding qudit state preparation and fault-tolerance. This work is accompanied by a repository consisting of the code to extract the orbits and perform the presented statistical analysis. The strong interplay between quantum theory and graph theory is well-known and extensively studied for qubits. Our work provides practical tools and results to assist this endeavor for the qudit case.</description>

      <title>Impact of Temporally Correlated Dephasing Noise on the Fidelity of the 2-Qubit Deutsch-Jozsa Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the influence of realistic noise on quantum algorithms is paramount for the advancement of quantum computation. While often modeled as Markovian, environmental noise in quantum systems frequently exhibits temporal correlations, leading to non-Markovian dynamics that can significantly alter algorithmic performance. This paper investigates the impact of temporally correlated dephasing noise, modeled by the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process, on the fidelity of the 2-qubit Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm. We perform numerical simulations using Qiskit, systematically varying the noise strength ($\sigma_{\text{OU}}$) and correlation time ($\tau_c$) of the OU process. Our results demonstrate that the algorithm's fidelity exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on $\tau_c$, particularly at higher noise strengths, with certain intermediate correlation times proving more detrimental than others. We find that a standard Markovian dephasing model, matched to the single-step error variance of the OU process, accurately predicts fidelity only in the limit of very short correlation times. For longer correlation times, the Markovian approximation often overestimates the algorithm's fidelity, failing to capture the complex error dynamics introduced by the noise memory. These findings highlight the necessity of incorporating non-Markovian characteristics for accurate performance assessment of quantum algorithms on near-term devices and underscore the limitations of simpler, memoryless noise models.</description>

      <title>Quantum circuits as a game: A reinforcement learning agent for quantum compilation and its application to reconfigurable neutral atom arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the "quantum circuit daemon" (QC-Daemon), a reinforcement learning agent for compiling quantum device operations aimed at efficient quantum hardware execution. We apply QC-Daemon to the move synthesis problem called the Atom Game, which involves orchestrating parallel circuits on reconfigurable neutral atom arrays. In our numerical simulation, the QC-Daemon is implemented by two different types of transformers with a physically motivated architecture and trained by a reinforcement learning algorithm. We observe a reduction of the logarithmic infidelity for various benchmark problems up to 100 qubits by intelligently changing the layout of atoms. Additionally, we demonstrate the transferability of our approach: a Transformer-based QC-Daemon trained on a diverse set of circuits successfully generalizes its learned strategy to previously unseen circuits.</description>

      <title>Towards objectivity of classical reference frames in quantum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in our understanding of foundations of quantum mechanics have shown that information can be made objective through quantum states. Such objectification processes, predicted e.g. in a variety of quantum open systems, must accompany any realistic quantum-to-classical transition mechanism in order to reproduce the objective character of the classical limit of our world. However, so far only examples of simple, unstructured information, such as a value of an observable, have been studied. In this work we show that a more complicated form of information, given by a Cartesian reference frame, can also be made (at least partially) objective in quantum mechanics. The non-trivial internal gauge structure of reference frames, given by the transformation group, leads to a more general form of objectivity, where all observers see the same but modulo their relative orientations, like it happens in modern understanding of geometry. This opens a way to extend quantum objectivity beyond simple scenarios and possibly link it to the foundations of modern geometry.</description>

      <title>Mechanism behind creating qubit gates expressed as interfering quantum pathway amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hamiltonian encoding was introduced as a technique for revealing the mechanism of controlled quantum systems. It does so by decomposing the evolution into pathways between the computational basis states, where each pathway has an associated complex amplitude. The magnitude of a pathway amplitude determines its significance and many pathways constructively and/or destructively interfere to produce the final evolution of the system. In this paper, we apply Hamiltonian encoding to reveal the mechanism behind creating qubit gates implemented via optimal control pulses. An X gate, two CNOT gates, and a SWAP gate are examined to determine the degree of interference involved and to demonstrate that different optimal controls produce distinct mechanisms. Although the detailed mechanism for creating any gate depends on the nature of the control field, the mechanism analysis tools are generic. The presented gates and their mechanisms in this paper are thus illustrative and a researcher may apply these same tools to any gate with a suitable optimal control field.</description>

      <title>40Gbps Tri-type Quantum Random Number Generator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional quantum random number generators can produce only one type of random number, while the optimal distribution of random numbers for different applications is usually distinct. The typical solution to this challenge is either using different quantum phenomena for different types of random number, or converting one distribution of random numbers to another type. However, the former solution requires multiple hardware systems, while the latter one sacrifices a lot of secure bits. Here, we develop a quantum random number generator that can on-demand produce three distribution types of random numbers at over 60 Gbits/s (Gbps) raw bits by measuring the quantum vacuum noise. After randomness extraction, over 42 Gbps secure bit rate is demonstrated for uniform random numbers, and over 14 Gbps secure bit rate for Gaussian random number. Due to the lack of Rayleigh randomness extraction, only denoised Rayleigh raw bits are generated. Switching between different types of random numbers is achieved in electronics, which does not affect the generation rate. The random numbers pass NIST and Dieharder tests, and are available for various applications, which can be continuously accessed via Cisco Quantum Random Number web service.</description>

      <title>Effect of Weak Measurement Reversal on Quantum Correlations in a Correlated Amplitude Damping Channel, with a Neural Network Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the evolution of quantum correlations in Bell, Werner, and maximally entangled mixed states of two qubits subjected to correlated amplitude-damping channels. Our primary focus is to evaluate the robustness of entanglement as a resource for quantum information protocols such as dense coding, teleportation, and Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering under the influence of noise. In addition, we investigate the behaviour of other quantum correlations, including quantum discord and coherence, and analyze their hierarchy under decoherence. To counteract the detrimental effects of the channels, we apply the weak measurement and quantum measurement reversal (WMR) protocol, comparing the effectiveness of single-qubit and two-qubit WMR techniques. Our results show that the two-qubit WMR protocol significantly outperforms the single-qubit approach in preserving quantum correlations. Furthermore, we employ a neural network model to enhance our analysis of the relationship between different quantum correlation measures during the evolution. Using a MATLAB-based artificial neural network with 80 neurons across three hidden layers and trained with the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, we successfully predict trace distance discord from other correlations, achieving low prediction errors. Besides, our analysis of the neural network weights suggests that concurrence and EPR steering have the most positive influence on the accurate discord predictions.</description>

      <title>State Dependent Optimization with Quantum Circuit Cutting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum circuits can be reduced through optimization to better fit the constraints of quantum hardware. One such method, initial-state dependent optimization (ISDO), reduces gate count by leveraging knowledge of the input quantum states.
  Surprisingly, we found that ISDO is broadly applicable to the downstream circuits produced by circuit cutting. Circuit cutting also requires measuring upstream qubits and has some flexibility of selection observables to do reconstruction. Therefore, we propose a state-dependent optimization (SDO) framework that incorporates ISDO, our newly proposed measure-state dependent optimization (MSDO), and a biased observable selection strategy. Building on the strengths of the SDO framework and recognizing the scalability challenges of circuit cutting, we propose non-separate circuit cutting-a more flexible approach that enables optimizing gates without fully separating them.
  We validate our methods on noisy simulations of QAOA, QFT, and BV circuits. Results show that our approach consistently mitigates noise and improves overall circuit performance, demonstrating its promise for enhancing quantum algorithm execution on near-term hardware.</description>

      <title>Noise-reduction of multimode Gaussian Boson Sampling circuits via Unitary Averaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We improve Gaussian Boson Sampling (GBS) circuits by integrating the unitary averaging (UA) protocol, previously demonstrated to protect unknown Gaussian states from phase errors [Phys. Rev. A 110, 032622]. Our work extends the applicability of UA to mitigate arbitrary interferometric noise, including beam-splitter and phase-shifter imperfections. Through comprehensive numerical analysis, we demonstrate that UA consistently achieves higher fidelity and success probability compared to unprotected circuits, establishing its robustness in noisy conditions. Remarkably, enhancement is maintained across varying numbers of modes with respect to the noise. We further derive a power-law formula predicting performance gains in large-scale systems, including 100-mode and 216-mode configurations. A detailed step-by-step algorithm for implementing the UA protocol is also provided, offering a practical roadmap for advancing near-term quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>On generating direct powers of dynamical Lie algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The expressibility and trainability of parameterized quantum circuits has been shown to be intimately related to their associated dynamical Lie algebras (DLAs). From a quantum algorithm design perspective, given a set $A$ of DLA generators, two natural questions arise: (i) what is the DLA $\mathfrak{g}_{A}$ generated by ${A}$; and (ii) how does modifying the generator set lead to changes in the resulting DLA. While the first question has been the subject of significant attention, much less has been done regarding the second. In this work we focus on the second question, and show how modifying ${A}$ can result in a generator set ${A}'$ such that $\mathfrak{g}_{{A}'}\cong \bigoplus_{j=1}^{K}\mathfrak{g}_{A}$, for some $K \ge 1$. In other words, one generates the direct sum of $K$ copies of the original DLA.
  In particular, we give qubit- and parameter-efficient ways of achieving this, using only $\log K$ additional qubits, and only a constant factor increase in the number of DLA generators. For cyclic DLAs, which include Pauli DLAs and QAOA-MaxCut DLAs as special cases, this can be done with $\log K $ additional qubits and the same number of DLA generators as ${A}$.</description>

      <title>Two-parameter estimation via photon subtraction operation within a feedback-assisted interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze how multi-photon subtraction operations in a feedback-assisted interferometer can enhance measurement precision for single-parameter and two-parameter estimation under both ideal and photon-loss conditions. We examine the effects of the feedback strength R, the optical parametric amplifier's gain g, the coherent state amplitude {\alpha}, and the order of multi-photon subtraction on system performance. We demonstrate that an optimal feedback strength R_{opt} exists in both conditions. Selecting a suitable R can significantly boost the system's robustness to photon loss, and markedly improve measurement precision. And the photon subtraction operations within a feedback-assisted interferometer can further enhance measurement precision effectively. Additionally, we find that increasing intramode correlations while decreasing intermode correlations can improve estimation accuracy. This work investigates a new method through the synergistic integration of feedback topology and non-Gaussian operations into a multiparameter estimation system, along with their systematic study under both ideal and loss conditions. The findings may contribute to improving quantum-enhanced measurements and hold promise for high-precision quantum sensing research.</description>

      <title>Pathfinding Quantum Simulations of Neutrinoless Double-$\beta$ Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present results from co-designed quantum simulations of the neutrinoless double-$\beta$ decay of a simple nucleus in 1+1D quantum chromodynamics using IonQ's Forte-generation trapped-ion quantum computers. Electrons, neutrinos, and up and down quarks are distributed across two lattice sites and mapped to 32 qubits, with an additional 4 qubits used for flag-based error mitigation. A four-fermion interaction is used to implement weak interactions, and lepton-number violation is induced by a neutrino Majorana mass. Quantum circuits that prepare the initial nucleus and time evolve with the Hamiltonian containing the strong and weak interactions are executed on IonQ Forte Enterprise. A clear signal of neutrinoless double-$\beta$ decay is measured, making this the first quantum simulation to observe lepton-number violation in real time. This was made possible by co-designing the simulation to maximally utilize the all-to-all connectivity and native gate-set available on IonQ's quantum computers. Quantum circuit compilation techniques and co-designed error-mitigation methods, informed from executing benchmarking circuits with up to 2,356 two-qubit gates, enabled observables to be extracted with high precision. We discuss the potential of future quantum simulations to provide yocto-second resolution of the reaction pathways in these, and other, nuclear processes.</description>

      <title>Optically accessible high-finesse millimeter-wave resonator for cavity quantum electrodynamics with atom arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) is a powerful tool in quantum science, enabling preparation of non-classical states of light and scalable entanglement of many atoms coupled to a single field mode. While the most coherent atom-photon interactions have been achieved using superconducting millimeter-wave cavities coupled to Rydberg atoms, these platforms so far lack the optical access required for trapping and addressing individual atomic qubits. We present a millimeter-wave Fabry-P\'erot cavity with finesse $5.8(1) \times 10^7$ at a temperature of 1 K providing generous transverse optical access (numerical aperture 0.56). Conflicting goals of strong atom-photon coupling and optical access motivate a near-confocal geometry. Close to confocality, however, post-paraxial corrections to the cavity spectrum introduce unexpected degeneracies between transverse modes, leading to excess cavity loss. Modeling these corrections allows for tuning the cavity geometry to evade this loss, producing a high finesse that will enable cavity QED experiments with trapped atoms deep in the strong coupling regime.</description>

      <title>Variational Inference for Quantum HyperNetworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binary Neural Networks (BiNNs), which employ single-bit precision weights, have emerged as a promising solution to reduce memory usage and power consumption while maintaining competitive performance in large-scale systems. However, training BiNNs remains a significant challenge due to the limitations of conventional training algorithms. Quantum HyperNetworks offer a novel paradigm for enhancing the optimization of BiNN by leveraging quantum computing. Specifically, a Variational Quantum Algorithm is employed to generate binary weights through quantum circuit measurements, while key quantum phenomena such as superposition and entanglement facilitate the exploration of a broader solution space. In this work, we establish a connection between this approach and Bayesian inference by deriving the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO), when direct access to the output distribution is available (i.e., in simulations), and introducing a surrogate ELBO based on the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) metric for scenarios involving implicit distributions, as commonly encountered in practice. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform standard Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), improving trainability and generalization.</description>

      <title>Ancilla measurement-based Quantum Otto engine using double-pair spin architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a quantum heat engine model utilizing a dual spin-pair architecture, wherein an Otto-like cycle is implemented using a single heat bath. The conventional cold bath is replaced by a measurement protocol, enabling engine operation without the need for a second thermal reservoir. Unlike standard quantum heat engines, our framework employs an ancillary spin pair in a two-dimensional configuration to regulate performance. Operating in finite time, the engine attains finite power, which is enhanced through quantum correlations, specifically correlation between spin pairs and projective measurements on the ancillary pair. The system consists of dual qubit pairs, where one pair serves as the working medium and the other as an ancillary system facilitating measurement-induced heat exchange. We demonstrate that the engine efficiency can exceed the standard quantum Otto limit through local control of the ancillary pair while maintaining nonzero power output. Moreover, correlation between spin pairs enables efficiency modulation via the measurement basis, underscoring the role of quantum resources in optimizing quantum thermal machines.</description>

      <title>Quantum Checkers: The Development and Analysis of a Quantum Combinatorial Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops and analyses a novel quantum combinatorial game: quantum checkers (codenamed Cheqqers). The concepts of superposition, entanglement, measurements and interference from quantum mechanics are integrated into the game of checkers by adding new types of legal moves. The addition of these new rules is done gradually by introducing several levels of `quantumness'. Quantum checkers provides a framework for interpolating between a known and solved classical game and a more complex quantum game, and serves as 1) a benchmark for AI players learning to play quantum games and 2) an interesting game for human players that allows them to build intuition for quantum phenomena. We provide the initial analysis on the complexity of this game using random agents and a Monte Carlo tree search agent.</description>

Abstract: Practical implementations of quantum information networks require frequency conversion of individual photons. Approaches based on a molecular gas as the nonlinear medium cover a wide range of the optical spectrum and promise high efficiency at negligible background. We present polarization-preserving frequency conversion in a hydrogen-loaded hollow core fiber using continuous-wave pump fields. We demonstrate conversion efficiency at the level of a few per mille, discuss various limitations and loss mechanisms, and present a route to increase conversion efficiency to near unity.</description>

      <title>Anomalous flow in correlated quantum systems: No-go result and multiple-charge scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Correlated quantum systems can exhibit thermodynamic behaviors that defy classical expectations, with anomalous energy flow (AEF) against temperature gradients serving as a paradigmatic example. While AEF has been shown to arise from the consumption of initial quantum correlations, little is known about whether AEF can occur without correlation depletion, or if analogous anomalous transport exists for conserved charges beyond energy. Here, we develop a general global-local thermodynamic approach to describe charge exchange between arbitrary correlated quantum systems. For energy-conserving systems, we analytically rule out AEF in initially uncorrelated states, even with the involvement of quantum catalysts, thereby complementing existing studies. In contrast, in systems with multiple conserved charges, we uncover a mechanism for AEF that requires no initial correlations but is instead induced by a drag effect from normal flows of non-energy charges. Furthermore, by treating all conserved charges on equal footing, we generalize AEF to a broader concept of anomalous charge flow, applicable to any conserved charge. We confirm theoretical expectations with numerical examples. These findings deepen our understanding of nonequilibrium quantum thermodynamics and open new avenues for controlling transport phenomena in correlated quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Beating joint quantum estimation limits with stepwise multiparameter metrology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional multiparameter quantum sensing relies on joint estimation, but this approach faces two key limitations: theoretical bounds may be unattainable due to measurement incompatibility, and sensing may fail due to parameter interdependencies. We propose stepwise estimation and identify regimes where it outperforms joint estimation. For multiple quantum sensors, this scheme achieves far lower error bounds than joint estimation. With many-body probes, stepwise sensing retains a quantum-enhanced scaling advantage often lost in joint estimation due to parameter correlations. We demonstrate its concrete advantages through Bayesian implementations across diverse examples.</description>

      <title>Optimizing entanglement distribution via noisy quantum channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement distribution is a crucial problem in quantum information science, owing to the essential role that entanglement plays in enabling advanced quantum protocols, including quantum teleportation and quantum cryptography. We investigate strategies for distributing quantum entanglement between two distant parties through noisy quantum channels. Specifically, we compare two configurations: one where the entanglement source is placed at the midpoint of the communication line, and another where it is located at one end. For certain families of qubit channels we show analytically that the midpoint strategy is optimal. Based on extensive numerical analysis, we conjecture that this strategy is generally optimal for all qubit channels. Focusing on the midpoint configuration, we develop semidefinite programming (SDP) techniques to assess whether entanglement can be successfully distributed through the network, and to quantify the amount of entanglement that can be distributed in the process. In many relevant cases the SDP formulation reliably captures the maximal amount of entanglement which can be distributed, if entanglement is quantified using the negativity. We analyze several channel models and demonstrate that, for various combinations of amplitude damping and depolarizing noise, entanglement distribution is only possible with weakly entangled input states. Excessive entanglement in the input state can hinder the channel's ability to establish entanglement. Our findings have implications for optimizing entanglement distribution in realistic quantum communication networks.</description>

      <title>Optimal absorption and emission of itinerant fields into a spin ensemble memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum memories integrated in a modular quantum processing architecture can rationalize the resources required for quantum computation. This work focuses on spin-based quantum memories, where itinerant electromagnetic fields are stored in large ensembles of effective two-level systems, such as atomic or solid-state spin ensembles, embedded in a cavity. Using a mean-field framework, we model the ensemble as an effective spin communication channel and develop a cascaded quantum model to describe both absorption and emission processes. We derive optimal time-dependent modulations of the cavity linewidth that maximize storage and retrieval efficiency for finite-duration wavepackets. Our analysis yields an upper bound on efficiency, which can be met in the narrow bandwidth regime. It also shows the existence of a critical bandwidth above which the efficiency severely decreases. Numerical simulations are presented in the context of microwave-frequency quantum memories interfaced with superconducting quantum processors, highlighting the protocol's relevance for modular quantum architectures.</description>

      <title>A low-loss telecom-band nanofiber cavity for interfacing Yb atomic qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the fabrication of an optical nanofiber cavity designed for efficient interface with ytterbium (Yb) atoms at telecom-wavelength transitions. Replacing the conventional hydrogen-oxygen flame with a deuterium-oxygen flame in the heat-and-pull method suppresses hydroxyl-induced absorption losses and enables low-loss nanofiber production with minimal modifications to the existing fabrication system. Using this technique, we fabricate a nanofiber cavity at 1389 nm that exhibits an intrinsic round-trip loss of $0.31(2)\%$ and a finesse of $2.0(1)\times 10^{3}$. This performance corresponds to a projected cooperativity of 90 when interfaced with Yb atoms, indicating that the cavity is well suited for efficient atom-photon coupling at telecom wavelength transitions. Our results establish a practical route for developing fiber-integrated atom-photon interfaces in the telecom band, a critical step toward scalable quantum communication and distributed quantum computing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first experimental realization of a photon Bose-Einstein condensate was demonstrated more than a decade ago. However, the polarization of the condensate has not been fully understood and measured in this weakly driven-dissipative system. In this letter, we experimentally investigate the polarization of thermal and condensed light depending on the power and polarization of the pump beam. With full control over the polarization of the pump, it is possible to create arbitrary states on the surface of the Poincar\'e sphere. We show that, in agreement with previous theoretical work, there is a remarkable increase in the polarization strength of the condensate above the threshold for a fully linearly polarized pump. Above a certain threshold also the degenerate orthogonal polarized state of the cavity is occupied, limiting the degree of polarization to approximately 90%.</description>

      <title>Metainformation in Quantum Guessing Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06197v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum guessing games offer a structured approach to analyzing quantum information processing, where information is encoded in quantum states and extracted through measurement. An additional aspect of this framework is the influence of partial knowledge about the input on the optimal measurement strategies. This kind of side information can significantly influence the guessing strategy and earlier work has shown that the timing of such side information, whether revealed before or after the measurement, can affect the success probabilities. In this work, we go beyond this established distinction by introducing the concept of metainformation. Metainformation is information about information, and in our context it is knowledge that additional side information of certain type will become later available, even if it is not yet provided. We show that this seemingly subtle difference between having no expectation of further information versus knowing it will arrive can have operational consequences for the guessing task. Our results demonstrate that metainformation can, in certain scenarios, enhance the achievable success probability up to the point that post-measurement side information becomes as useful as prior-measurement side information, while in others it offers no benefit. By formally distinguishing metainformation from actual side information, we uncover a finer structure in the interplay between timing, information, and strategy, offering new insights into the capabilities of quantum systems in information processing tasks.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Projection Postulate and Back: Quantum Theories with Generalised State-Update Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Are there consistent and physically reasonable alternatives to the projection postulate? Does it have unique properties compared to acceptable alternatives? We answer these questions by systematically investigating hypothetical state-update rules for quantum systems that nature could have chosen over the L\"uders rule. Among other basic properties, any prospective rule must define unique post-measurement states and not allow for superluminal signalling. Particular attention will be paid to consistently defining post-measurement states when performing local measurements in composite systems. Explicit examples of valid unconventional update rules are presented, each of them resulting in a distinct, well-defined foil of quantum theory. This framework of state-update rules allows us to identify operational properties that distinguish the projective update rule from all others and to put earlier derivations of the projection postulate into perspective.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum networking can be realized by distributing pairs of entangled qubits between remote quantum processing nodes. Devoted communication qubits within each node can naturally interface with photons which bus quantum information between nodes. With the introduction of CQED to enhance interactions between communication qubits and photons, advanced protocols capable of achieving high entanglement distribution rates with high fidelity become feasible. In this paper, we consider two such protocols based on trapped ion communication qubits strongly coupled to small optical cavities. We study the rate and fidelity performance of these protocols as a function of critical device parameters and the photonic degree of freedom used to carry the quantum information. We compare the performance of these protocols with the traditional two-photon interference scheme, subjecting all protocols to the same experimentally relevant constraints. We find that adoption of the strong-coupling protocols could provide substantial distribution rate improvements of $30-75\%$ while maintaining the high-fidelities $\mathcal{F}\gtrsim99\%$ of the traditional scheme.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study SU($N$) spin systems that mimic the behavior of particles in $N$-dimensional de Sitter space for $N=2,3$. Their Hamiltonians describe a dynamical system with hyperbolic fixed points, leading to emergent quasinormal modes at the quantum level. These manifest as quasiparticle peaks in the density of states. For a particle in 2-dimensional de Sitter, we find both principal and complementary series densities of states from a PT-symmetric version of the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model, having two hyperbolic fixed points in the classical phase space. We then study different spectral and dynamical properties of this class of models, including level spacing statistics, two-point functions, squared commutators, spectral form factor, Krylov operator and state complexity. We find that, even though the early-time properties of these quantities are governed by the saddle points -- thereby in some cases mimicking corresponding properties of chaotic systems, a close look at the late-time behavior reveals the integrable nature of the system.</description>

Abstract: We show that two- and three-pion states produced in the decay of neutral kaons are contextual, entangled, and Bell nonlocal in isospin space. By reinterpreting the experimental values of the different isospin amplitudes, we can determine the amount of entanglement enjoyed by these states and the extent to which they violate the non-contextuality and Bell locality inequalities. Notably, the three-pion state offers a genuine multipartite test of Bell nonlocality with qutrits.</description>

      <title>Compression, simulation, and synthesis of turbulent flows with tensor trains</title>

Abstract: Numerical simulations of turbulent fluids are paramount to real-life applications, from predicting and modeling flows to diagnostic purposes in engineering. However, they are also computationally challenging due to their intrinsically non-linear dynamics, which requires a very high spatial resolution to accurately describe them. A promising idea is to represent flows on a discrete mesh using tensor trains (TTs), featuring a convenient scaling of the number of parameters with the mesh size. However, it is yet not clear how the compression power of TTs is affected by the complexity of the flows, measured by the Reynolds number. In fact, no TT fluid solver has been extensively validated in a fully developed turbulent regime yet. We fill this gap. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of TTs as an Ansatz to compress, simulate, and synthetically generate fiducial turbulent snapshots in 3D. Specifically, first, we exhaustively investigate the effect of TT compression of given snapshots on key turbulence signatures, including the energy spectrum and different accuracy metrics. Second, we present a TT solver to simulate time evolution of 3D fluid fields according to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations entirely within the compressed representation. Third, we develop a TT algorithm to generate artificial snapshots displaying all the signatures of turbulence. In all three cases, a number of parameters scaling polylogarithmically with the mesh size is enough for accurate descriptions. Our findings confirm that fluids in truly turbulent regimes admit an efficient TT description and offer a powerful, quantum-inspired toolkit for their computational treatment.</description>

      <title>Dictionary-Based Reconstruction of Spatio-Temporal 3D Magnetic Field Images from Quantum Diamond Microscope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Three-dimensional magnetic imaging with high spatio-temporal resolution is critical for probing current paths in various systems, from biosensing to microelectronics. Conventional 2D Fourier-based current source localization methods are ill-posed in multilayer or dynamic systems due to signal overlap and noise. In this work, we demonstrate an innovative nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center-based wide-field magnetic microscopy technique for dynamic three-dimensional imaging and localization of current sources. Using custom-fabricated multilayer micro-coil platform to emulate localized, time-varying currents similar to neuronal activity, we acquire magnetic field maps with micrometre-scale spatial and millisecond-scale temporal resolution using per-pixel lock-in-based detection. Source localization and image reconstruction are achieved using a Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO)-based reconstruction framework that incorporates experimentally measured basis maps as spatial priors. Our method enables robust identification of active current sources across space and time, and significantly advances the accuracy of dynamic 3D current imaging and NV-based magnetometry for complex systems.</description>

      <title>Challenging Spontaneous Quantum Collapse with XENONnT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the search for X-ray radiation as predicted from dynamical quantum collapse with low-energy electronic recoil data in the energy range of 1-140 keV from the first science run of the XENONnT dark matter detector. Spontaneous radiation is an unavoidable effect of dynamical collapse models, which were introduced as a possible solution to the long-standing measurement problem in quantum mechanics. The analysis utilizes a model that for the first time accounts for cancellation effects in the emitted spectrum, which arise in the X-ray range due to the opposing electron-proton charges in xenon atoms. New world-leading limits on the free parameters of the Markovian continuous spontaneous localization and Di\'osi-Penrose models are set, improving previous best constraints by two orders of magnitude and a factor of five, respectively. The original values proposed for the strength and the correlation length of the continuous spontaneous localization model are excluded experimentally for the first time.</description>

      <title>Effects of inert background gases and photo-illumination on three-color electromagnetically induced transparency of rubidium vapor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Three-color Rydberg electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) of room-temperature Rb vapor in the presence of inert gases (Ar, Ne, and N$_2$) at 50~mTorr and 500~mTorr is investigated. The observed EIT lines shift and develop blue-detuned satellite lines, dependent on inert-gas species and pressure. The separations of the satellite from the main EIT lines are approximately pressure-independent, while their strength increases with inert-gas pressure. The satellite lines are attributed to hyperfine collisions of the intermediate $5D_{3/2}$ state. Further, analyzing the Stark effect of Rydberg levels, it is found that the inert gases suppress static electric fields in the vapor cells, which we induce by photo-illumination of the cell walls with an auxiliary 453-nm laser. In the work, we utilize Rydberg levels with principal quantum numbers $n$ = 25 and 50 and angular momenta $\ell$ = 3 up to 6, excited by the EIT lasers and optional radio-frequency dressing fields. The work is of interest in the spectroscopic study of mixed-species warm vapors, in sensing applications of Rydberg atoms in vapor cells, and in non-invasive electric-field diagnostics of low-pressure discharge plasma.</description>

      <title>Strong Mitigation of the Magnetic-Field-Induced Frequency Shift in Coherent-Population-Trapping Atomic Clocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the magnetic-field-induced frequency shift (MFS) of the clock (``0--0'') transition in coherent-population-trapping (CPT) microwave atomic clock. It is shown that the use of the Pound-Drever-Hall-like (PDH) technique for frequency locking provides brilliant opportunities for mitigating the MFS. Using a $0.125$ cm$^3$ rubidium vapor cell with a buffer gas, we have measured a residual sensitivity of the clock transition frequency to be $\approx\,72$ $\mu$Hz/mG over $\approx\,$$6$ mG interval. It means that a fractional frequency shift is extremely small ($\approx\,$$1$$\,\times\,$$10^{-14}$ mG$^{-1}$). The results contribute to the development of a new-generation CPT-based miniature atomic clock (MAC) with improved long-term frequency stability. The proposed method is quite general and can be used for other excitation schemes in atomic clocks, including Ramsey-like techniques.</description>

      <title>Exciton-polariton condensates in van der Waals magnetic microwires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasiparticle condensates are among the most spectacular solid-state manifestations of quantum physics. Coupling macroscopic real-space wave functions to other degrees of freedom, such as the electron spin, could add valuable control knobs for quantum applications. While creating spin-carrying superconducting condensates has attracted enormous attention, man-made condensates of light-matter hybrids known as exciton-polaritons have lacked a comparable spin-related perspective. Here we open a new door by demonstrating exciton-polariton condensation in the antiferromagnetic semiconductor CrSBr, a van der Waals material with strongly intertwined optical and magnetic properties. Under photoexcitation, CrSBr microwires embedded in an optical cavity show the hallmarks of polariton condensation: a dramatic increase of the emission intensity from an excited laterally confined polariton state by multiple orders of magnitude, spectral narrowing of the emission line, and an intriguing continuous shift of the peak energy. Interferometry evidences an increase of spatial and temporal coherence. The conditions for efficient optical pumping suggest a crucial role of surface excitons and ultrafast polariton-magnon scattering. Our results highlight CrSBr microwires as a promising platform for exploring magnetically tunable polariton condensates, their directional propagation and their potential for spin-based quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Redundant parameter dependencies in truncated classic and quantum Linear Response and Equation of Motion theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extracting molecular properties from a wave function can be done through the linear response (LR) formalism or, equivalently, the equation of motion (EOM) formalism. For a simple model system, He in a 6-31G basis, it is here shown that calculated excitation energies depend on the specifically chosen orbitals, even when the ground-state is the FCI solution, if the LR is truncated to a singles expansion. This holds for naive, projected, self-consistent, and state-transfer parametrizations of the LR operators. With a focus on the state-transfer parameterization, this problem is shown to also hold for more complicated systems, and is also present when the LR is truncated to singles and doubles. This problem can be alleviated by performing a ground-state constrained trace optimization of the Hessian matrix before performing the LR calculation. It is finally shown that spectra can be further improved for small LR expansions by targeting only a few states in the constrained trace optimization using constrained state-averaged UCC.</description>

      <title>Squeezing and quantum control of antiferromagnetic magnon pseudospin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Antiferromagnets have been shown to harbor strong magnon squeezing in equilibrium, making them a potential resource for quantum correlations and entanglement. Recent experiments have also found them to host coherently coupled magnonic excitations forming a magnon pseudospin, in analogy to electronic spin. Here, we delineate the quantum properties of antiferromagnetic magnon pseudospin by accounting for spin non-conserving interactions and going beyond the rotating wave approximation. Employing concrete examples of nickel oxide and hematite, we find strong squeezing of the magnon pseudospin highlighting its important role in determining the eigenmode quantum properties. Via ground state quantum fluctuations engineering, this pseudospin squeezing enables an enhancement and control of coupling between the magnonic modes and other excitations. Finally, we evaluate the quantum superpositions that comprise a squeezed pseudospin ground state and delineate a qubit spectroscopy protocol to detect them. Our results are applicable to any system of coupled bosons and thus introduce quantum fluctuations engineering of a general bosonic pseudospin.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding time-resolved quantum transport is crucial for developing next-generation quantum technologies, particularly in nano- and molecular junctions subjected to time-dependent perturbations. Traditional steady-state approaches to quantum transport are not designed to capture the transient dynamics necessary for controlling electronic behavior at ultrafast time scales. In this work, we present a non-equilibrium Green's function formalism, within the recently-developed iterated generalized Kadanoff-Baym ansatz ($i$GKBA), to study thermoelectric quantum transport beyond the wide-band limit approximation (WBLA). We employ the Meir-Wingreen formula for both charge and energy currents and analyze the transition from Lorentzian line-width functions to the WBLA, identifying unphysical divergences in the latter. Our results highlight the importance of finite-bandwidth effects and demonstrate the efficiency of the $i$GKBA approach in modeling time-resolved thermoelectric transport, also providing benchmark comparisons against the full Kadanoff-Baym theory. We exemplify the developed theory in the calculation of time-resolved thermopower and thermoelectric energy conversion efficiency in a cyclobutadiene molecular junction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly advancing across diverse domains, yet their application in theoretical physics research is not yet mature. This position paper argues that LLM agents can potentially help accelerate theoretical, computational, and applied physics when properly integrated with domain knowledge and toolbox. We analyze current LLM capabilities for physics -- from mathematical reasoning to code generation -- identifying critical gaps in physical intuition, constraint satisfaction, and reliable reasoning. We envision future physics-specialized LLMs that could handle multimodal data, propose testable hypotheses, and design experiments. Realizing this vision requires addressing fundamental challenges: ensuring physical consistency, and developing robust verification methods. We call for collaborative efforts between physics and AI communities to help advance scientific discovery in physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the finite-temperature properties of a bosonic Josephson junction composed of N interacting atoms confined by a quasi-one-dimensional asymmetric double-well potential, modeled by the two-site Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian. We compute numerically the spectral decomposition of the statistical ensemble of states, the thermodynamic and entanglement entropies, the population imbalance, the quantum Fisher information, and the coherence visibility. We analyze their dependence on the system parameters, showing in particular how finite temperature and on-site energy asymmetry affect the entanglement and coherence properties of the system. Moreover, starting from a quantum phase model which accurately describes the system over a wide range of interactions, we develop a reliable description of the strong tunneling regime, where thermal averages may be computed analytically using a modified Boltzmann weight involving an effective temperature. We discuss the possibility of applying this effective description to other models in suitable regimes.</description>

      <title>Diosi-Penrose criterion for solids and electrical components in quantum superpositions and application to a single-photon detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.00353</link>
      <description>arXiv:1701.00353v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Diosi-Penrose criterion is applied to solids in quantum superpositions that are slightly displaced against each other or have different expansions in the superposed states. The calculations take the microscopic mass distribution of the solid's nuclei into account, where the spatial variation of the nuclei is calculated with Debye's model for acoustical phonons. The contribution resulting from the mass concentration in the solid's nuclei can be neglected for displacements larger than ten lattice constants but dominates the superposition's decay for displacements smaller than the spatial variation of the nuclei in the order of a tenth of an Angstroem. In this regime, the parameter-free Diosi-Penrose model predicts significantly higher decay rates than the version in which the mass density is averaged. With the results for solids, formulas for the decay of superposed electrical components, as plate capacitors, resistors, wires and piezo actuators, are derived, which are used to analyse how long a single-photon detector can stay in a superposition of a photon-detected and a no-photon-detected state, and how its lifetime shortens when it displaces a mass with a piezo actuator.</description>

Abstract: We present broadly applicable tools for determining the behavior of eigenvalues and eigenvectors under the addition of self-adjoint operators and under the multiplication of unitaries, in finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. The new tools provide explicit non-perturbative expressions for the eigenvalues and eigenvectors. To illustrate the broad applicability of the new tools, we outline several applications, for example, to Shannon sampling in information theory. A longer companion paper applies the new tools to adiabatic quantum evolution, thereby shedding new light on the connection between an adiabatic quantum computation's usage of the resource of entanglement and the quantum computation's speed.</description>

      <title>Driven-dissipative quantum battery with nonequilibrium reservoirs</title>

Abstract: We investigate a quantum battery system under both external driving and dissipation. The system consists of a coupled two-level charger and battery immersed in nonequilibrium fermionic reservoirs. By considering the changes in the energy spectrum induced by external driving and charger-battery coupling in a non-perturbative manner, we go beyond the secular approximation to derive the Redfield master equation. In the nonequilibrium scenario, both charging efficiency and power of the quantum battery can be optimized through a compensation mechanism. When the charger and battery are off-resonance, a significant chemical potential difference between the reservoirs, which characterizes the degree of nonequilibrium, plays a crucial role. Specifically, the charger's frequency should be higher (lower) than that of the battery when the average chemical potential is negative (positive) to achieve enhanced charging efficiency and power under strong nonequilibrium conditions. Remarkably, the efficiency in the nonequilibrium case can surpass that in the equilibrium setup. Moreover, we find no positive correlation between entanglement and efficiency, challenging the prevailing assumption that entanglement necessarily enhances the performance of quantum devices. Our results provide insights into the design and optimization of quantum batteries in nonequilibrium open systems.</description>

      <title>A generalization of Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm with multiple secret keys and a probabilistic oracle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.10014v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A probabilistic version of the Bernstein-Vazirani problem (which is a generalization of the original Bernstein-Vazirani problem) and a quantum algorithm to solve it are proposed. The problem involves finding one or more secret keys from a set of multiple secret keys (encoded in binary form) using a quantum oracle. From a set of multiple unknown keys, the proposed quantum algorithm is capable of (a) obtaining any key (with certainty) using a single query to the probabilistic oracle and (b) finding all keys with a high probability (approaching 1 in the limiting case). In contrast, a classical algorithm will be unable to find even a single bit of a secret key with certainty (in the general case). Owing to the probabilistic nature of the oracle, a classical algorithm can only be useful in obtaining limiting probability distributions of $ 0 $ and $ 1 $ for each bit-position of secret keys (based on multiple oracle calls) and this information can further be used to infer some estimates on the distribution of secret keys based on combinatorial considerations. For comparison, it is worth noting that a classical algorithm can be used to exactly solve the original Bernstein-Vazirani problem (involving a deterministic oracle and a single hidden key containing $n$ bits) with a query complexity of $\mathcal{O}(n)$. An interesting class of problems similar to the probabilistic version of the Bernstein-Vazirani problem can be construed, where quantum algorithms can provide efficient solutions with certainty or with a high degree of confidence and classical algorithms would fail to do so.</description>

      <title>Model Reduction for Quantum Systems: Discrete-time Quantum Walks and Open Markov Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.06319v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A general approach to obtain reduced models for a wide class of discrete-time quantum systems is proposed. The obtained models not only reproduce exactly the output of a given quantum model, but are also guaranteed to satisfy physical constraints, namely complete positivity and preservation of total probability. A fundamental framework for exact model reduction of quantum systems is constructed leveraging on algebraic methods, as well as novel results on quantum conditional expectations in finite-dimensions. The proposed reduction algorithm is illustrated and tested on prototypical examples, including the quantum walk realizing Grover's algorithm.</description>

      <title>Space-time-symmetric non-relativistic quantum mechanics: Time and position of arrival and an extension of a Wheeler-DeWitt-type equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.04376v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We generalize a space-time-symmetric (STS) extension of non-relativistic quantum mechanics (QM) to describe a particle moving in three spatial dimensions. In addition to the conventional time-conditional (Schr\"odinger) wave function $\psi(x, y, z | t)$, we introduce space-conditional wave functions such as $\phi(t, y, z | x)$, where $x$ plays the role of the evolution parameter. The function $\phi(t, y, z | x)$ represents the probability amplitude for the particle to arrive on the plane $x = \text{constant}$ at time $t$ and transverse position $(y, z)$. Within this framework, the coordinate $x^\mu \in \{t, x, y, z\}$ can be conveniently chosen as the evolution parameter, depending on the experimental context under consideration. This leads to a unified formalism governed by a generalized Schr\"odinger-type equation, $\hat{P}^{\mu} |\phi^\mu(x^\mu)\rangle = -i\hbar \, \eta^{\mu\nu} \frac{d}{dx^\nu} |\phi^\mu(x^\mu)\rangle$. It reproduces standard QM when $x^\mu = t$, with $|\phi^0(x^0)\rangle = |\psi(t)\rangle$, and recovers the STS extension when $x^\mu = x^i \in \{x, y, z\}$. For a free particle, we show that $\phi(t, y, z | x) = \langle t, y, z | \phi(x) \rangle$ naturally reproduces the same dependence on the momentum wave function as the axiomatic Kijowski distribution. Possible experimental tests of these predictions are discussed. Finally, we demonstrate that the different states $|\phi^\mu(x^\mu)\rangle$ can emerge by conditioning (i.e., projecting) a timeless and spaceless physical state onto the eigenstate $|x^\mu\rangle$, leading to constraint equations of the form $\hat{\mathbb{P}}^\mu |\Phi^\mu\rangle = 0$. This formulation generalizes the spirit of the Wheeler-DeWitt-type equation: instead of privileging time as the sole evolution parameter, it treats all coordinates on equal footing.</description>

      <title>Topologically protected non-Hermitian super-volume-law entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03259v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The entanglement entropy encodes fundamental characteristics of quantum many-body systems, and is particularly subtle in non-Hermitian settings where eigenstates generically become non-orthogonal. In this work, we find that negative biorthogonal entanglement generically arises from topologically protected non-orthogonal edge states in free fermion systems, especially within topological flat bands. Departing from previous literature which associated negative entanglement with exceptional gapless points, we show that robustly negative entanglement can still occur in gapped systems. Gapless 2D topological flat bands, however, exhibits novel $S_A\sim -\frac1{2}L_y^2\log L$ super-volume-law entanglement behavior which scales quadratically with the transverse dimension $L_y$, independent of system parameters. This dramatically negative scaling can be traced to a new mechanism known as non-Hermitian critical skin compression (nHCSC), where topological and skin localization in one direction produces a hierarchy of extensively many probability non-conserving entanglement eigenstates across a cut in another direction. Our discovery sheds light on new avenues where topology interplays with criticality and non-Hermitian localization, unrelated to traditional notions of topological entanglement entropy. This topologically protected negative entanglement also manifests in the second R\'enyi entropy, which can be measured through SWAP operator expectation values.</description>

      <title>Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz for the Preparation and Detection of Long-Lived Singlet States in NMR</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05015v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Designing efficient and robust quantum control strategies is vital for developing quantum technologies. One recent strategy is the Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz (QAOA) sequence that alternatively propagates under two noncommuting Hamiltonians, whose control parameters can be optimized to generate a gate or prepare a state. Here, we describe the design of a QAOA sequence to prepare long-lived singlet states (LLS) from the thermal state in NMR. With extraordinarily long lifetimes exceeding the spin-lattice relaxation time constant $T_1$, LLS have been of great interest for various applications, from spectroscopy to medical imaging. Accordingly, designing sequences for efficiently preparing LLS in a general spin system is crucial. Using numerical analysis, we study the efficiency and robustness of our QAOA sequence over a wide range of errors in the control parameters. Using a two-qubit NMR register, we conduct an experimental study to benchmark our QAOA sequence against other prominent methods of LLS preparation and observe superior performance, especially under noisy conditions. Finally, we numerically demonstrate the applicability of our QAOA sequence beyond two-qubit registers, specifically for polychromatic excitation of delocalized LLS in a six-proton system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17574v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is proposed that measurement devices can be modelled to have an open decoherence dynamics that is faster than any other relevant timescale, which is referred to as the ultradecoherence limit. In this limit, the measurement device always assumes a definite state upto the accuracy set by the fast decoherence timescale. Further, it is shown that the clicking rate of measurement devices can be derived from its underlying parameters, not only for the von Neumann ideal measurement devices but also for photon detectors in equal footing. This study offers a glimpse into the intriguing physics of measurement processes in quantum mechanics, with many aspects open for further investigation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02398v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological order is a promising basis for quantum error correction, a key milestone towards large-scale quantum computing. Floquet codes provide a dynamical scheme for this while also exhibiting Floquet-enriched topological order (FET) where anyons periodically undergo a measurement-induced automorphism that acts uniformly in space. We study disordered Floquet codes where automorphisms have a spatiotemporally heterogeneous distribution -- the automorphisms "compete". We characterize the effect of this competition, showing how key features of the purification dynamics of mixed codestates can be inferred from anyon and automorphism properties for any Abelian topological order. This perspective can explain the protection or measurement of logical information in a dynamic automorphism (DA) code when subjected to a noise model of missing measurements. We demonstrate this using a DA color code with perturbed measurement sequences. The framework of competing automorphisms captures essential features of Floquet codes and robustness to noise, and may elucidate key mechanisms involving topological order, automorphisms, and fault-tolerance.</description>

      <title>Mapping of a many-qubit state onto an oscillator using controlled displacements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22385v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the controlled displacement interaction between a qubit and a harmonic oscillator to the multi-qubit (qudit) case. We define discrete quadratures of the qudit and show how the qudit state can be displaced in these quadratures controlled by an oscillator quadrature. Using this interaction, a periodic repetition of the state encoded in the qudit, can be deterministically mapped onto the oscillator, which is initialized in a squeezed state. Based on this controlled displacement interaction, we present a full circuit that encodes quantum information in a superposition of qudit quadrature states, and successively prepares the oscillator in the corresponding superposition of approximate Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) states. This preparation scheme is found to be similar to phase estimation, with the addition of a disentanglement gate. Our protocol for GKP state preparation is efficient in the sense, that the set of qubits need only interact with the oscillator through two time-independent interactions, and in the sense that the squeeze factor (in dB) of the produced GKP state grows linearly in the number of qubits used.</description>

      <title>Testing and learning structured quantum Hamiltonians</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00082v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problems of testing and learning an unknown $n$-qubit Hamiltonian $H$ from queries to its evolution operator $e^{-iHt}$ under the normalized Frobenius norm. We prove:
  1. Local Hamiltonians: We give a tolerant testing protocol to decide if $H$ is $\epsilon_1$-close to $k$-local or $\epsilon_2$-far from $k$-local, with $O(1/(\epsilon_2-\epsilon_1)^{4})$ queries, solving open questions posed in a recent work by Bluhm et al. For learning a $k$-local $H$ up to error $\epsilon$, we give a protocol with query complexity $\exp(O(k^2+k\log(1/\epsilon)))$ independent of $n$, by leveraging the non-commutative Bohnenblust-Hille inequality.
  2. Sparse Hamiltonians: We give a protocol to test if $H$ is $\epsilon_1$-close to being $s$-sparse (in the Pauli basis) or $\epsilon_2$-far from being $s$-sparse, with $O(s^{6}/(\epsilon_2^2-\epsilon_1^2)^{6})$ queries. For learning up to error $\epsilon$, we show that $O(s^{4}/\epsilon^{8})$ queries suffice.
  3. Learning without memory: The learning results stated above have no dependence on $n$, but require $n$-qubit quantum memory. We give subroutines that allow us to learn without memory; increasing the query complexity by a $(\log n)$-factor in the local case and an $n$-factor in the sparse case.
  4. Testing without memory: We give a new subroutine called Pauli hashing, which allows one to tolerantly test $s$-sparse Hamiltonians with $O(s^{14}/(\epsilon_2^2-\epsilon_1^2)^{18})$ queries. A key ingredient is showing that $s$-sparse Pauli channels can be tolerantly tested under the diamond norm with $O(s^2/(\epsilon_2-\epsilon_1)^6)$ queries.
  Along the way, we prove new structural theorems for local and sparse Hamiltonians. We complement our learning results with polynomially weaker lower bounds. Furthermore, our algorithms use short time evolutions and do not assume prior knowledge of the terms in the support of the Pauli spectrum.</description>

      <title>Optimal estimates of trace distance between bosonic Gaussian states and applications to learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02368v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gaussian states of bosonic quantum systems enjoy numerous technological applications and are ubiquitous in nature. Their significance lies in their simplicity, which in turn rests on the fact that they are uniquely determined by two experimentally accessible quantities, their first and second moments. But what if these moments are only known approximately, as is inevitable in any realistic experiment? What is the resulting error on the Gaussian state itself, as measured by the most operationally meaningful metric for distinguishing quantum states, namely, the trace distance? In this work, we fully resolve this question by demonstrating that if the first and second moments are known up to an error $\varepsilon$, the trace distance error on the state also scales as $\varepsilon$, and this functional dependence is optimal. To prove this, we establish tight bounds on the trace distance between two Gaussian states in terms of the norm distance of their first and second moments. As an application, we improve existing bounds on the sample complexity of tomography of Gaussian states.</description>

Abstract: We introduce and analyze an active steering protocol designed to target multipartite entangled states. The protocol involves multiple qubits subjected to weak Bell pair measurements with active feedback, where the feedback operations are optimized to maximize the Quantum Fisher Information. Our scheme efficiently reaches a genuinely entangled one-parameter state manifold. Numerical simulations for systems with up to 22 qubits suggest that the protocol is scalable and allows high multipartite entanglement across the system.</description>

      <title>The Jacobi Factoring Circuit: Quantum Factoring with Near-Linear Gates and Sublinear Space and Depth</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12558v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a compact quantum circuit for factoring a large class of integers, including some whose classical hardness is expected to be equivalent to RSA (but not including RSA integers themselves). Most notably, we factor $n$-bit integers of the form $P^2 Q$ with $\log Q = \Theta(n^a)$ for $a \in (2/3, 1)$ in space and depth sublinear in n (specifically, $\tilde{O}(\log Q)$) using $\tilde{O}(n)$ quantum gates; for these integers, no known classical algorithms exploit the relatively small size of $Q$ to run asymptotically faster than general-purpose factoring algorithms. To our knowledge, this is the first polynomial-time circuit to achieve sublinear qubit count for a classically-hard factoring problem. We thus believe that factoring such numbers has potential to be the most concretely efficient classically-verifiable proof of quantumness currently known.
  Our circuit builds on the quantum algorithm for squarefree decomposition discovered by Li, Peng, Du, and Suter (Nature Scientific Reports 2012), which relies on computing the Jacobi symbol in quantum superposition. The technical core of our contribution is a new space-efficient quantum algorithm to compute the Jacobi symbol of $A$ mod $B$, in the regime where $B$ is classical and much larger than $A$. Our circuit for computing the Jacobi symbol generalizes to related problems such as computing the greatest common divisor and modular inverses, and thus could be of independent interest.</description>

Abstract: Proposed experiments for obtaining empirical evidence for a quantum description of gravity in a table-top setting focus on detecting quantum information signatures, such as entanglement or non-Gaussianity production, in gravitationally interacting quantum systems. Here, we explore an alternative approach where the quantization of gravity could be inferred through measurements of macroscopic, thermodynamical quantities, without the need for addressability of individual quantum systems. To demonstrate the idea, we take as a case study a gravitationally self-interacting Bose gas, and consider its heat capacity. We find a clear-cut distinction between the predictions of a classical gravitational interaction and a quantum gravitational interaction in the heat capacity of the Bose gas.</description>

      <title>When Clifford benchmarks are sufficient; estimating application performance with scalable proxy circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05943v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The goal of benchmarking is to determine how far the output of a noisy system is from its ideal behavior; this becomes exceedingly difficult for large quantum systems where classical simulations become intractable. A common approach is to turn to circuits comprised of elements of the Clifford group (e.g., CZ, CNOT, $\pi$ and $\pi/2$ gates), which probe quantum behavior but are nevertheless efficient to simulate classically. However, there is some concern that these circuits may overlook error sources that impact the larger Hilbert space. In this manuscript, we show that for a broad class of error models these concerns are unwarranted. In particular, we show that, for error models that admit noise tailoring by Pauli twirling, the diamond norm and fidelity of any generic circuit is well approximated by the fidelities of proxy circuits composed only of Clifford gates. We discuss methods for extracting the fidelities of these Clifford proxy circuits in a manner that is robust to errors in state preparation and measurement and demonstrate these methods in simulation and on IBM Quantum's fleet of deployed heron devices.</description>

      <title>A quantum algorithm for linear autonomous differential equations via Pad\'e approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06948v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel quantum algorithm for solving linear autonomous ordinary differential equations (ODEs) using the Pad\'e approximation. For linear autonomous ODEs, the discretized solution can be represented by a product of matrix exponentials. The proposed algorithm approximates the matrix exponential by the diagonal Pad\'e approximation, which is then encoded into a large, block-sparse linear system and solved via quantum linear system algorithms (QLSA). The detailed quantum circuit is given based on quantum oracle access to the matrix, the inhomogeneous term, and the initial state. The complexity of the proposed algorithm is analyzed. Compared to the method based on Taylor approximation, which approximates the matrix exponential using a $k$-th order Taylor series, the proposed algorithm improves the approximation order $k$ from two perspectives: 1) the explicit complexity dependency on $k$ is improved, and 2) a smaller $k$ suffices for the same precision. Numerical experiments demonstrate the advantages of the proposed algorithm comparing to other related algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22142v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Good quantum error-correcting codes that fulfill practical considerations, such as simple encoding circuits and efficient decoders, are essential for functional quantum information processing systems. Quantum polar codes satisfy some of these requirements but lack certain critical features, thereby hindering their widespread use. Existing constructions either require entanglement assistance to produce valid quantum codes, suffer from poor finite-size performance, or fail to tailor polar codes to the underlying channel properties. Meanwhile, quantum Reed-Muller (RM) codes demonstrate strong performance, though no known efficient decoding algorithm exists for them. In this work, we propose strategies to interpolate between quantum polar codes and quantum RM codes, thus addressing the challenges of designing valid quantum polar codes without entanglement assistance and improving finite-size code performance.</description>

Abstract: In this work, I analyze the quantum fluctuations and the thermal fluctuations in the framework of quantum mechanics. Being recognized as incoherent perturbations with different features, fluctuations of these two types lead to dissipative terms in the optical Bloch equations. The method allows one to deal with the processes where the impact of the fluctuations of these two types are not negligible. The numerical results show that the deexcitation is the limit of the equilibration at zero temperature. The impact of the fluctuations on the coherent excitations are also discussed.</description>

Abstract: Matterwaves made up of ultra-cold quantum-degenerate atoms have enabled the creation of tools having unprecedented sensitivity and precision in measuring gravity, rotation or magnetic fields. Applications range from gravitational wave detection and tests of Einstein's equivalence principle to inertial sensing for navigation and gravitational gradient sensing for oil and mineral exploration. In this letter, we introduce atom-optics as a novel tool of manipulating matterwaves in ring-shaped coherent waveguides. We collimate and focus matterwaves derived from Bose-Einstein Condensates (BECs) and ultra-cold thermal atoms in ring-shaped time-averaged adiabatic potentials. We demonstrate `delta-kick cooling' of BECs, reducing their expansion energies by a factor of 34. The atomtronic waveguide ring has a radius of only $485\,\mu m$, compared to other state-of-the-art experiments requiring zero gravity or chambers of ten meter. This level of control with extremely reduced spatial requirements is an important step towards atomtronic quantum sensors.</description>

      <title>Thermal avalanches in isolated many-body localized systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04834v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many-body localization is a profound phase of matter affecting the entire spectrum which emerges in the presence of disorder in interacting many-body systems. Recently, the stability of many-body localization has been challenged by the avalanche mechanism, in which a small thermal region can spread, destabilizing localization and leading to global thermalization of the system. A key unresolved question is the critical competition between the thermal region's influence and the disorder strength required to trigger such an avalanche. Here, we numerically investigate many-body localization stability in an isolated Heisenberg spin chain of size $L$ subjected to a disordered magnetic field. By embedding a tunable thermal region of size $P$, we analyze the system's behavior in both static and dynamical regimes using entanglement entropy and the gap ratio. Our study yields two main findings. Firstly, for strong disorder, the avalanche only occurs if the thermal region scales with system size, specifically when $P/L$ exceeds a threshold value. Secondly, at strong disorder, we identify an intermediate phase between many-body localization and ergodic behavior as $P$ increases. This intermediate phase leaves its finger print in both static and dynamic properties of the system and tends to vanish in the thermodynamic limit. Although our simulations are restricted to finite system sizes, the analysis suggests that these results hold in the thermodynamic limit for isolated many-body systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04891v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hardware-efficient circuits employed in Quantum Machine Learning are typically composed of alternating layers of uniformly applied gates. High-speed numerical simulators for such circuits are crucial for advancing research in this field. In this work, we numerically benchmark universal and gate-specific techniques for simulating the action of layers of gates on quantum state vectors, aiming to accelerate the overall simulation of Quantum Machine Learning algorithms. Our analysis shows that the optimal simulation method for a given layer of gates depends on the number of qubits involved, and that a tailored combination of techniques can yield substantial performance gains in the forward and backward passes for a given circuit. Building on these insights, we developed a numerical simulator, named TQml Simulator, that employs the most efficient simulation method for each layer in a given circuit. We evaluated TQml Simulator on circuits constructed from standard gate sets, such as rotations and CNOTs, as well as on native gates from IonQ and IBM quantum processing units. In most cases, our simulator outperforms equivalent Pennylane's default_qubit simulator by up to a factor of 10, depending on the circuit, the number of qubits, the batch size of the input data, and the hardware used.</description>

      <title>Thermally activated detection of dark particles in a weakly coupled quantum Ising ladder</title>

Abstract: The Ising$_h^2$ integrable field theory emerges when two quantum critical Ising chains are weakly coupled. This theory possesses eight types of relativistic particles, among which the lightest one ($B_1$) has been predicted to be a dark particle, which cannot be excited from the ground state through (quasi-)local operations. The stability on one hand highlights its potential for applications, and on the other hand makes it challenging to be observed. Here, we point out that the mass of the $B_1$ dark particle $m_{B_1}$ appears as a thermally activated gap extracted from local spin dynamical structure factor at low frequency ($\omega \ll m_{B_1}$) and low temperatures ($T \ll m_{B_1}$). We then further propose that this gapped behavior can be directly detected via the NMR relaxation rate measurement in a proper experimental setup. Our results provide a practical criterion for verifying the existence of dark particles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18985v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a model of collective behavior in self-propelled active agents that incorporates a perceptual decision-making process. In this framework, the decision-making dynamics is modeled using quantum formalism. The perceptual decision state of each agent is an entangled or superposed state of the decision states for the neighboring agents within the vision cone. We suggest that in this framework, the force driving the movement of active agents is governed by the quantum average of its perception operator, providing a bridge between perceptual decision-making processes and classical dynamics. Additionally, we introduce two perceptual measures of cohesion in the flock, namely, perception strength and perceptual energy, to characterize collective behavior in terms of decision-making dynamics. Our model demonstrates that, with an appropriate choice of perceptual decision state, the well-known Vicsek model of flocking behavior can be derived as a specific case of this quantum-inspired approach. This approach provides fresh insights into collective behavior and multi-agent coordination, revealing how classical patterns of collective behavior emerge naturally from perception.</description>

      <title>Exactly solvable models for fermionic symmetry-enriched topological phases and fermionic 't Hooft anomaly</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19126v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interplay between symmetry and topological properties plays a very important role in modern physics. In the past decade, the concept of symmetry-enriched topological (SET) phases was proposed and their classifications have been systematically studied for bosonic systems. Very recently, the concept of SET phases has been generalized into fermionic systems and their corresponding classification schemes are also proposed. Nevertheless, how to realize all these fermionic SET (fSET) phases in lattice models remains to be a difficult open problem. In this paper, we first construct exactly solvable models for non-anomalous non-chiral 2+1D fSET phases, namely, the symmetry-enriched fermionic string-net models, which are described by commuting-projector Hamiltonians whose ground states are the fixed-point wavefunctions of each fSET phase. Mathematically, we provide a partial definition to $G$-graded super fusion category, which is the input data of a symmetry-enriched fermionic string-net model. Next, we construct exactly solvable models for non-chiral 2+1D fSET phases with 't Hooft anomaly, especially the $H^3(G,\mathbb{Z}_2)$ fermionic 't Hooft anomaly which is different from the well known bosonic $H^4(G,U(1)_T)$ anomaly. In our construction, this $H^3(G,\mathbb{Z}_2)$ fermionic 't Hooft anomaly is characterized by a violation of fermion-parity conservation in some of the surface ${F}$-moves (a kind of renormalization moves for the ground state wavefunctions of surface SET phases), and also by a new fermionic obstruction $\Theta$ in the surface pentagon equation. We demonstrate this construction in a concrete example that the surface topological order is a $\mathbb{Z}_4$ gauge theory embedded into a fermion system and the total symmetry $G^f=\mathbb{Z}_2^f\times\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_4$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16830v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum emitters are a key component in photonic quantum technologies. Enhancing their single-photon emission by engineering the photonic environment using cavities can significantly improve the overall efficiency in quantum information processing. However, this enhancement is often constrained by the need for precise nanoscale control over the emitter's position within micro- or nano-cavities. Inspired by the fascinating physics of moir\'e patterns, we present an approach to strongly modify the spontaneous emission rate of a quantum emitter using a finely designed multilayer moir\'e photonic crystal with a robust isolated-flatband dispersion. Theoretical analysis reveals that, due to its nearly infinite photonic density of states, the moir\'e cavity can simultaneously achieve a high Purcell factor and exhibit large tolerance over the emitter's position. We experimentally demonstrate the coupling between this moir\'e cavity and a quantum dot through the cavity-determined polarization of the dot's emission. The radiative lifetime of the quantum dot can be tuned by a factor of 40, ranging from 42 ps to 1692 ps, which is attributed to strong Purcell enhancement and Purcell inhibition effects. Our findings pave the way for moir\'e flatband cavity-enhanced quantum light sources, quantum optical switches, and quantum nodes for quantum internet applications.</description>

Abstract: Fully automated self-driving laboratories are promising to enable high-throughput and large-scale scientific discovery by reducing repetitive labour. However, effective automation requires deep integration of laboratory knowledge, which is often unstructured, multimodal, and difficult to incorporate into current AI systems. This paper introduces the k-agents framework, designed to support experimentalists in organizing laboratory knowledge and automating experiments with agents. Our framework employs large language model-based agents to encapsulate laboratory knowledge including available laboratory operations and methods for analyzing experiment results. To automate experiments, we introduce execution agents that break multi-step experimental procedures into agent-based state machines, interact with other agents to execute each step and analyze the experiment results. The analyzed results are then utilized to drive state transitions, enabling closed-loop feedback control. To demonstrate its capabilities, we applied the agents to calibrate and operate a superconducting quantum processor, where they autonomously planned and executed experiments for hours, successfully producing and characterizing entangled quantum states at the level achieved by human scientists. Our knowledge-based agent system opens up new possibilities for managing laboratory knowledge and accelerating scientific discovery.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a hydrodynamic framework for describing monitored classical stochastic processes. We study the conditional ensembles for these monitored processes -- i.e., we compute spacetime correlation functions conditioned on a fixed, typical measurement record. In the presence of global symmetries we show that these conditional ensembles can undergo measurement-induced "sharpening" phase transitions as a function of the monitoring rate; moreover, even weak monitoring can give rise to novel critical phases, derived entirely from a classical perspective. We give a simple hydrodynamic derivation of the known charge-sharpening transition for diffusive many-body quantum systems. We show that although the unmonitored symmetric and asymmetric exclusion processes are in different universality classes of transport, their conditional ensembles flow to the same fixed point with emergent relativistic invariance under monitoring. On the other hand, weakly monitored systems with non-Abelian symmetries enter a novel strongly coupled fixed point with non-trivial dynamical exponent, which we characterize. Our formalism naturally accounts for monitoring general observables, such as currents or density gradients, and allows for a direct calculation of information-theoretic diagnostics of sharpening transitions, including the Shannon entropy of the measurement record.</description>

      <title>Can spacetime fluctuations generate entanglement between co-moving accelerated detectors?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12674v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies [Class. Quant. Grav. 42, 03LT01 (2025); Phys. Rev. D 111, 045023 (2025)] indicate that in a nested sequence of Rindler wedges, vacuum of former Rindler frame appears to be thermally populated for an observer in shifted Rindler frame. Interestingly, this thermality is independent of shift parameter as long as it is non-zero and therefore arises even if the shift parameter is as small as Planck length. Building on this insight, we propose a set-up involving two atoms accelerating with identical acceleration. We find that if their Rindler frames (consequently their trajectories) get infinitesimally separated, the atoms become entangled. Remarkably again, this entanglement, like the perceived thermality, is independent of the shift parameter, provided it is non-vanishing. Further we observe the vanishing of mutual information and discord. It implies the absence of both classical and non-classical correlations which are not related to entanglement. We investigate the dependence of entanglement on acceleration of the detectors. The present study indicates that the entanglement between two detectors, moving on the same Rindler wedge, is possible. Moreover, small spacetime fluctuations can lead to entanglement between detectors, moving along same classical trajectory. Hence we feel that such theoretical prediction has potential to probe the Planck length nature of spacetime.</description>

Abstract: We consider a ladder system where one leg, referred to as the ``bath", is governed by an Aubry-Andr\'{e} (AA) type Hamiltonian, while the other leg, termed the ``subsystem", follows a standard tight-binding Hamiltonian. We investigate the localization properties in the subsystem induced by its coupling to the bath. For the coupling strength larger than a critical value ($t'&gt;t'_c$), the analysis of the static properties show that there are three distinct phases as the AA potential strength $V$ is varied: a fully delocalized phase at low $V$, a localized phase at intermediate $V$, and a weakly delocalized (fractal) phase at large $V$. An analysis of the wavepacket dynamics shows that the delocalized phase exhibits a ballistic behavior, whereas the weakly delocalized phase is subdiffusive. Interestingly, we also find a superdiffusive narrow crossover regime along the line separating the delocalized and localized phases. When $t'&lt;t'_c$, the intermediate localized phase disappears, and we find a delocalized (ballistic) phase at low $V$ and a weakly delocalized (subdiffusive) phase at large $V$. Between those two phases, there is also a crossover regime where the system can be super- or subdiffusive. Finally, in some limiting scenario, we also establish a mapping between our ladder system and a well-studied one-dimensional generalized Aubry-Andr\'{e} (GAA) model.</description>
