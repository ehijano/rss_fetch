      <title>Optimal Execution under Incomplete Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study optimal liquidation strategies under partial information for a single asset within a finite time horizon. We propose a model tailored for high-frequency trading, capturing price formation driven solely by order flow through mutually stimulating marked Hawkes processes. The model assumes a limit order book framework, accounting for both permanent price impact and transient market impact. Importantly, we incorporate liquidity as a hidden Markov process, influencing the intensities of the point processes governing bid and ask prices. Within this setting, we formulate the optimal liquidation problem as an impulse control problem. We elucidate the dynamics of the hidden Markov chain's filter and determine the related normalized filtering equations. We then express the value function as the limit of a sequence of auxiliary continuous functions, defined recursively. This characterization enables the use of a dynamic programming principle for optimal stopping problems and the determination of an optimal strategy. It also facilitates the development of an implementable algorithm to approximate the original liquidation problem. We enrich our analysis with numerical results and visualizations of candidate optimal strategies.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Investment Analysis: Optimizing AI-Agent Collaboration in Financial Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the application of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) in financial analysis and investment decision-making has gained significant attention. However, most existing approaches rely on single-agent systems, which fail to fully utilize the collaborative potential of multiple AI agents. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-agent collaboration system designed to enhance decision-making in financial investment research. The system incorporates agent groups with both configurable group sizes and collaboration structures to leverage the strengths of each agent group type. By utilizing a sub-optimal combination strategy, the system dynamically adapts to varying market conditions and investment scenarios, optimizing performance across different tasks. We focus on three sub-tasks: fundamentals, market sentiment, and risk analysis, by analyzing the 2023 SEC 10-K forms of 30 companies listed on the Dow Jones Index. Our findings reveal significant performance variations based on the configurations of AI agents for different tasks. The results demonstrate that our multi-agent collaboration system outperforms traditional single-agent models, offering improved accuracy, efficiency, and adaptability in complex financial environments. This study highlights the potential of multi-agent systems in transforming financial analysis and investment decision-making by integrating diverse analytical perspectives.</description>

      <title>Optimal position-building strategies in competition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03586v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops a mathematical framework for building a position in a stock over a fixed period of time while in competition with one or more other traders doing the same thing. We develop a game-theoretic framework that takes place in the space of trading strategies where action sets are trading strategies and traders try to devise best-response strategies to their adversaries. In this setup trading is guided by a desire to minimize the total cost of trading arising from a mixture of temporary and permanent market impact caused by the aggregate level of trading including the trader and the competition. We describe a notion of equilibrium strategies, show that they exist and provide closed-form solutions.</description>
