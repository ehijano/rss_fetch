      <title>Breast Lump Detection and Localization with a Tactile Glove Using Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Breast cancer is the leading cause of mortality among women. Inspection of breasts by palpation is the key to early detection. We aim to create a wearable tactile glove that could localize the lump in breasts using deep learning (DL). In this work, we present our flexible fabric-based and soft wearable tactile glove for detecting the lumps within custom-made silicone breast prototypes (SBPs). SBPs are made of soft silicone that imitates the human skin and the inner part of the breast. Ball-shaped silicone tumors of 1.5-, 1.75- and 2.0-cm diameters are embedded inside to create another set with lumps. Our approach is based on the InceptionTime DL architecture with transfer learning between experienced and non-experienced users. We collected a dataset from 10 naive participants and one oncologist-mammologist palpating SBPs. We demonstrated that the DL model can classify lump presence, size and location with an accuracy of 82.22%, 67.08% and 62.63%, respectively. In addition, we showed that the model adapted to unseen experienced users with an accuracy of 95.01%, 88.54% and 82.98% for lump presence, size and location classification, respectively. This technology can assist inexperienced users or healthcare providers, thus facilitating more frequent routine checks.</description>

      <title>Non-Linear Flow Matching for Full-Atom Peptide Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Peptide design plays a pivotal role in therapeutic applications, yet existing AI-assisted methods often struggle to generate stable peptides with high affinity due to their inability to accurately simulate the dynamic docking process. To address this challenge, we propose NLFlow, a novel multi-manifold approach based on non-linear flow matching. Specifically, we design a polynomial-based conditional vector field to accelerate the convergence of the peptide's position towards the target pocket, effectively capturing the temporal inconsistencies across position, rotation, torsion, and amino acid type manifolds. This enables the model to better align with the true conformational changes observed in biological docking processes. Additionally, we incorporate interaction-related information, such as polarity, to enhance the understanding of peptide-protein binding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NLFlow outperforms existing methods in generating peptides with superior stability, affinity, and diversity, offering a fast and efficient solution for peptide design and advancing the peptide-based therapeutic development.</description>

      <title>Multidimensional Classification Framework for Human Breast Cancer Cell Lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Breast cancer cell lines are indispensable tools for unraveling disease mechanisms, developing new drugs and personalized medicine, yet their heterogeneity and inconsistent classification pose significant challenges in model selection and data reproducibility. This article aims at providing a comprehensive and user-friendly framework for broadly mapping the essential features of publicly available human breast cancer cell lines. The cells are classified using (1) absolute criteria, i.e. objective features such as origin (e.g., MDA-MB, MCF), histological subtype (ductal, lobular), hormone receptor status (ER/PR/HER2), and genetic mutations (BRCA1, TP53), and (2) relative criteria, which contextualize functional behaviors like metastatic potential, drug sensitivity and genomic instability. We systematically catalog over 70 cell lines, detailing their molecular profiles, research applications and clinical relevance. Critical gaps are addressed, including the underrepresentation of cell lines from young patients, male breast cancer, and diverse ethnicities, as well as genetic drift during long-term culture. This article bridges in vitro studies with meaningful applications, offering a tool for easily selecting lines that mirror specific research objectives in a clinical setting. The goal is to empower researchers to optimize experimental design, enhance translational relevance and accelerate therapeutic development to advance precision oncology in breast cancer research.</description>

      <title>Integrating protein sequence embeddings with structure via graph-based deep learning for the prediction of single-residue properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the intertwined contributions of amino acid sequence and spatial structure is essential to explain protein behaviour. Here, we introduce INFUSSE (Integrated Network Framework Unifying Structure and Sequence Embeddings), a Deep Learning framework that combines sequence embeddings, generated by a Large Language Model (LLM), with graph-based representations of protein structures, integrated through a diffusive Graph Convolutional Network (diff-GCN), to predict single-residue properties within proteins. Our approach follows two steps. First, we fine-tune LLM sequence embeddings obtained from bidirectional transformers to make predictions from protein sequence alone. Second, we combine these enriched sequence representations with a geometric graph Laplacian within diff-GCN to refine the initial predictions. This approach leads to improved predictions while allowing us to systematically disentangle the contribution of sequence and structure. We illustrate our framework by applying it to the prediction of local residue flexibility (B-factors) of antibody-antigen complexes, and show that it provides improved performance compared to current Machine Learning (ML) approaches. The addition of structural information via geometric graphs is shown to enhance predictions especially for intrinsically disordered regions, protein-protein interaction sites, and highly variable amino acid positions.</description>

      <title>A non-parametric optimal design algorithm for population pharmacokinetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a non-parametric estimation algorithm designed to effectively estimate the joint distribution of model parameters with application to population pharmacokinetics. Our research group has previously developed the non-parametric adaptive grid (NPAG) algorithm, which while accurate, explores parameter space using an ad-hoc method to suggest new support points. In contrast, the non-parametric optimal design (NPOD) algorithm uses a gradient approach to suggest new support points, which reduces the amount of time spent evaluating non-relevant points and by this the overall number of cycles required to reach convergence. In this paper, we demonstrate that the NPOD algorithm achieves similar solutions to NPAG across two datasets, while being significantly more efficient in both the number of cycles required and overall runtime. Given the importance of developing robust and efficient algorithms for determining drug doses quickly in pharmacokinetics, the NPOD algorithm represents a valuable advancement in non-parametric modeling. Further analysis is needed to determine which algorithm performs better under specific conditions.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian mixed-effects model to evaluate the determinants of COVID-19 vaccine uptake in the US</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected US public health, resulting in over a hundred million cases and more than one million deaths. Vaccination is the key intervention against the COVID-19 pandemic. Multiple COVID-19 vaccines are now available for human use. However, a number of factors, including socio-demographic variables, impact the uptake of COVID-19 vaccines. In this study, we apply a Bayesian mixed-effects model to assess different socio-demographic and spatial factors that influence the acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines in the US. The fitted mixed-effects model provides the probabilistic inference about the vaccine acceptance determinants with uncertainty quantification.</description>

      <title>Co-evolution-based Metal-binding Residue Prediction with Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In computational structural biology, predicting metal-binding sites and their corresponding metal types is challenging due to the complexity of protein structures and interactions. Conventional sequence- and structure-based prediction approaches cannot capture the complex evolutionary relationships driving these interactions to facilitate understanding, while recent co-evolution-based approaches do not fully consider the entire structure of the co-evolved residue network. In this paper, we introduce MBGNN (Metal-Binding Graph Neural Network) that utilizes the entire co-evolved residue network and effectively captures the complex dependencies within protein structures via graph neural networks to enhance the prediction of co-evolved metal-binding residues and their associated metal types. Experimental results on a public dataset show that MBGNN outperforms existing co-evolution-based metal-binding prediction methods, and it is also competitive against recent sequence-based methods, showing the potential of integrating co-evolutionary insights with advanced machine learning to deepen our understanding of protein-metal interactions. The MBGNN code is publicly available at https://github.com/SRastegari/MBGNN.</description>

      <title>BioMaze: Benchmarking and Enhancing Large Language Models for Biological Pathway Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The applications of large language models (LLMs) in various biological domains have been explored recently, but their reasoning ability in complex biological systems, such as pathways, remains underexplored, which is crucial for predicting biological phenomena, formulating hypotheses, and designing experiments. This work explores the potential of LLMs in pathway reasoning. We introduce BioMaze, a dataset with 5.1K complex pathway problems derived from real research, covering various biological contexts including natural dynamic changes, disturbances, additional intervention conditions, and multi-scale research targets. Our evaluation of methods such as CoT and graph-augmented reasoning, shows that LLMs struggle with pathway reasoning, especially in perturbed systems. To address this, we propose PathSeeker, an LLM agent that enhances reasoning through interactive subgraph-based navigation, enabling a more effective approach to handling the complexities of biological systems in a scientifically aligned manner. The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/zhao-ht/BioMaze.</description>

      <title>Efficient gPC-based quantification of probabilistic robustness for systems in neuroscience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13489v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Robustness analysis is very important in biology and neuroscience, to unravel behavioral patterns of systems that are conserved despite large parametric uncertainties. To make studies of probabilistic robustness more efficient and scalable in addressing complex neuroscience models, we propose an alternative to computationally expensive Monte Carlo (MC) methods by introducing and analysing the generalised polynomial chaos (gPC) framework for uncertainty quantification. We consider both intrusive and non-intrusive gPC approaches, which turn out to be scalable and allow for a fast comprehensive exploration of parameter spaces. Focusing on widely used models of neural dynamics as case studies, we explore the trade-off between efficiency and accuracy of gPC methods, and we select effective computational settings to investigate parametric uncertainties in models that feature multiple dynamic regimes.</description>

      <title>Machine-Learning Enabled Multidimensional Data Utilization Through Multi-Resonance Architecture: A Pathway to Enhanced Accuracy in Biosensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20245v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel framework is proposed that combines multi-resonance biosensors with machine learning (ML) to significantly enhance the accuracy of parameter prediction in biosensing. Unlike traditional single-resonance systems, which are limited to one-dimensional datasets, this approach leverages multi-dimensional data generated by a custom-designed nanostructure, a periodic array of silicon nanorods with a triangular cross-section over an aluminum reflector. High bulk sensitivity values are achieved for this multi-resonant structure, with certain resonant peaks reaching up to 1706 nm/RIU. The field analysis reveals Mie resonances as the physical reason behind the peaks. The predictive power of multiple resonant peaks from transverse magnetic (TM) and transverse electric (TE) polarizations is evaluated using Ridge Regression modeling. Systematic analysis reveals that incorporating multiple resonances yields up to three orders of magnitude improvement in refractive index detection precision compared to single-peak analyses. This precision enhancement is achieved without modifications to the biosensor hardware, highlighting the potential of data-centric strategies in biosensing. The findings establish a new paradigm in biosensing, demonstrating that the synergy between multi-resonance data acquisition and ML-based analysis can significantly enhance detection accuracy. This study provides a scalable pathway for advancing high-precision biosensing technologies.</description>

      <title>Hypergraph Representations of scRNA-seq Data for Improved Clustering with Random Walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11760v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing data is often conducted through network projections such as coexpression networks, primarily due to the abundant availability of network analysis tools for downstream tasks. However, this approach has several limitations: loss of higher-order information, inefficient data representation caused by converting a sparse dataset to a fully connected network, and overestimation of coexpression due to zero-inflation. To address these limitations, we propose conceptualizing scRNA-seq expression data as hypergraphs, which are generalized graphs in which the hyperedges can connect more than two vertices. In the context of scRNA-seq data, the hypergraph nodes represent cells and the edges represent genes. Each hyperedge connects all cells where its corresponding gene is actively expressed and records the expression of the gene across different cells. This hypergraph conceptualization enables us to explore multi-way relationships beyond the pairwise interactions in coexpression networks without loss of information. We propose two novel clustering methods: (1) the Dual-Importance Preference Hypergraph Walk (DIPHW) and (2) the Coexpression and Memory-Integrated Dual-Importance Preference Hypergraph Walk (CoMem-DIPHW). They outperform established methods on both simulated and real scRNA-seq datasets. The improvement brought by our proposed methods is especially significant when data modularity is weak. Furthermore, CoMem-DIPHW incorporates the gene coexpression network, cell coexpression network, and the cell-gene expression hypergraph from the single-cell abundance counts data altogether for embedding computation. This approach accounts for both the local level information from single-cell level gene expression and the global level information from the pairwise similarity in the two coexpression networks.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Mutation Theory of SARS-CoV-2 Variants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10471v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predicting the future evolutionary trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 remains a critical challenge, particularly due to the pivotal role of spike protein mutations. Developing an evolutionary model capable of continuously integrating new experimental data is an urgent priority. By employing well-founded assumptions for mutant representation (four-letter and two-letter formats) and the n-mer distance algorithm, we constructed an evolutionary tree of SARS-CoV-2 mutations that accurately reflects observed viral strain evolution. We introduce a stochastic method for generating new strains on this tree based on spike protein mutations. For a given set A of existing mutation sites, we define a set X of x randomly generated sites on the spike protein. Our analysis reveals that the position of a generated strain on the tree is determined by x. Through large-scale stochastic sampling, we predict the emergence of new macro-lineages. As x increases, the proportions of macro-lineages shift: lineage O surpasses lineage N, lineage P overtakes O, and ultimately, new lineage Q surpasses P. We identified threshold values of x that distinguish between macro-lineages. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the linear regression of the number of mutated sites (x) against sample collection dates (t) provides a robust approximation, enabling the prediction of new lineage emergence based on the x-t relationship. To conclude, we demonstrated that the SARS-CoV-2 evolution adheres to statistical principles: the emergence of new strains on the evolutionary tree can be driven by randomly generated spike protein sites; and the large-scale stochastic sampling uncovers evolutionary patterns governing the emergence of diverse macro-lineages.</description>

      <title>MIML: Multiplex Image Machine Learning for High Precision Cell Classification via Mechanical Traits within Microfluidic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.08421v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Label-free cell classification is advantageous for supplying pristine cells for further use or examination, yet existing techniques frequently fall short in terms of specificity and speed. In this study, we address these limitations through the development of a novel machine learning framework, Multiplex Image Machine Learning (MIML). This architecture uniquely combines label-free cell images with biomechanical property data, harnessing the vast, often underutilized morphological information intrinsic to each cell. By integrating both types of data, our model offers a more holistic understanding of the cellular properties, utilizing morphological information typically discarded in traditional machine learning models. This approach has led to a remarkable 98.3\% accuracy in cell classification, a substantial improvement over models that only consider a single data type. MIML has been proven effective in classifying white blood cells and tumor cells, with potential for broader application due to its inherent flexibility and transfer learning capability. It's particularly effective for cells with similar morphology but distinct biomechanical properties. This innovative approach has significant implications across various fields, from advancing disease diagnostics to understanding cellular behavior.</description>

      <title>Optimistic Games for Combinatorial Bayesian Optimization with Application to Protein Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18582v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) is a powerful framework to optimize black-box expensive-to-evaluate functions via sequential interactions. In several important problems (e.g. drug discovery, circuit design, neural architecture search, etc.), though, such functions are defined over large $\textit{combinatorial and unstructured}$ spaces. This makes existing BO algorithms not feasible due to the intractable maximization of the acquisition function over these domains. To address this issue, we propose $\textbf{GameOpt}$, a novel game-theoretical approach to combinatorial BO. $\textbf{GameOpt}$ establishes a cooperative game between the different optimization variables, and selects points that are game $\textit{equilibria}$ of an upper confidence bound acquisition function. These are stable configurations from which no variable has an incentive to deviate$-$ analog to local optima in continuous domains. Crucially, this allows us to efficiently break down the complexity of the combinatorial domain into individual decision sets, making $\textbf{GameOpt}$ scalable to large combinatorial spaces. We demonstrate the application of $\textbf{GameOpt}$ to the challenging $\textit{protein design}$ problem and validate its performance on four real-world protein datasets. Each protein can take up to $20^{X}$ possible configurations, where $X$ is the length of a protein, making standard BO methods infeasible. Instead, our approach iteratively selects informative protein configurations and very quickly discovers highly active protein variants compared to other baselines.</description>

Abstract: Augmenting classical epidemiological models with information from the social sciences helps unveil the interplay between contagion dynamics and social responses. However, multidisciplinary integration of social analysis and epidemiological modelling is often challenging, due to scarcity of vast and reliable data sources and because ad hoc modelling assumptions may not reproduce empirically observed patters. Here, we test the hypothesis that awareness and information spreading straightforwardly translates into behavioural responses, analysing empirical data to generate insights about their dynamics and relationships. We employ such results to build a data-informed behavioural-epidemiological model that elucidates the impact of compliant behaviours and the role of centralised regulations in mitigating epidemics. We investigate model properties and its benefits in integrating theoretical modelling and data.</description>

      <title>Relating dynamics and structure of discrete and continuous time systems</title>

Abstract: In numerous subjects there are instances of dynamical variables that change in discrete time. One such example is a population's size, which changes in discrete generations which we label by $n$ ($= 0, 1, 2, . ..$). There are some exactly soluble cases where the population's size at discrete time $n$, written $x_{n}$, can be related to a different problem, where change occurs in continuous time, $t$, and the population's size is then written as $x(t)$. The relation is that $x(t = n)$ precisely coincides with $x_{n}$. In such a case, we say the two models are 'equivalent', even though $x_{n}$ obeys a difference equation and $x(t)$ obeys a differential equation. A comparison of the difference equation and the differential equation allows us to make a correspondence between coefficients in these equations. This exposes structural similarities and sometimes appreciable structural differences of discrete and continuous time dynamics. We present cases of such equivalences for both time homogeneous and time inhomogeneous problems. Beyond this, when the equation that $x_{n}$ obeys is modified so there is no exact solution, we show how to construct an approximate continuous time solution that can capture rapid change, such as growth, of $x_{n}$. Additionally, in some discrete time problems, the solution has an oscillatory component that changes sign as $n \rightarrow n + 1$. We show that the way an equivalent continuous time solution replicates this oscillatory behaviour is to become complex. We give concrete examples of this 'complexification' of the continuous time solution, which is real at $t = 0,1,2,...$ but is complex away from the integers.</description>
