      <title>Instrumental variables: A non-asymptotic viewpoint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a non-asymptotic analysis of the linear instrumental variable estimator allowing for the presence of exogeneous covariates. In addition, we introduce a novel measure of the strength of an instrument that can be used to derive non-asymptotic confidence intervals. For strong instruments, these non-asymptotic intervals match the asymptotic ones exactly up to higher order corrections; for weaker instruments, our intervals involve adaptive adjustments to the instrument strength, and thus remain valid even when asymptotic predictions break down. We illustrate our results via an analysis of the effect of PM2.5 pollution on various health conditions, using wildfire smoke exposure as an instrument. Our analysis shows that exposure to PM2.5 pollution leads to statistically significant increases in incidence of health conditions such as asthma, heart disease, and strokes.</description>

      <title>A Likelihood Based Approach to Distribution Regression Using Conditional Deep Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the theoretical properties of conditional deep generative models under the statistical framework of distribution regression where the response variable lies in a high-dimensional ambient space but concentrates around a potentially lower-dimensional manifold. More specifically, we study the large-sample properties of a likelihood-based approach for estimating these models. Our results lead to the convergence rate of a sieve maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) for estimating the conditional distribution (and its devolved counterpart) of the response given predictors in the Hellinger (Wasserstein) metric. Our rates depend solely on the intrinsic dimension and smoothness of the true conditional distribution. These findings provide an explanation of why conditional deep generative models can circumvent the curse of dimensionality from the perspective of statistical foundations and demonstrate that they can learn a broader class of nearly singular conditional distributions. Our analysis also emphasizes the importance of introducing a small noise perturbation to the data when they are supported sufficiently close to a manifold. Finally, in our numerical studies, we demonstrate the effective implementation of the proposed approach using both synthetic and real-world datasets, which also provide complementary validation to our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Ranking Perspective for Tree-based Methods with Applications to Symbolic Feature Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tree-based methods are powerful nonparametric techniques in statistics and machine learning. However, their effectiveness, particularly in finite-sample settings, is not fully understood. Recent applications have revealed their surprising ability to distinguish transformations (which we call symbolic feature selection) that remain obscure under current theoretical understanding. This work provides a finite-sample analysis of tree-based methods from a ranking perspective. We link oracle partitions in tree methods to response rankings at local splits, offering new insights into their finite-sample behavior in regression and feature selection tasks. Building on this local ranking perspective, we extend our analysis in two ways: (i) We examine the global ranking performance of individual trees and ensembles, including Classification and Regression Trees (CART) and Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART), providing finite-sample oracle bounds, ranking consistency, and posterior contraction results. (ii) Inspired by the ranking perspective, we propose concordant divergence statistics $\mathcal{T}_0$ to evaluate symbolic feature mappings and establish their properties. Numerical experiments demonstrate the competitive performance of these statistics in symbolic feature selection tasks compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Estimating Generalization Performance Along the Trajectory of Proximal SGD in Robust Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the generalization performance of iterates obtained by Gradient Descent (GD), Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and their proximal variants in high-dimensional robust regression problems. The number of features is comparable to the sample size and errors may be heavy-tailed. We introduce estimators that precisely track the generalization error of the iterates along the trajectory of the iterative algorithm. These estimators are provably consistent under suitable conditions. The results are illustrated through several examples, including Huber regression, pseudo-Huber regression, and their penalized variants with non-smooth regularizer. We provide explicit generalization error estimates for iterates generated from GD and SGD, or from proximal SGD in the presence of a non-smooth regularizer. The proposed risk estimates serve as effective proxies for the actual generalization error, allowing us to determine the optimal stopping iteration that minimizes the generalization error. Extensive simulations confirm the effectiveness of the proposed generalization error estimates.</description>

      <title>On Lai's Upper Confidence Bound in Multi-Armed Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this memorial paper, we honor Tze Leung Lai's seminal contributions to the topic of multi-armed bandits, with a specific focus on his pioneering work on the upper confidence bound. We establish sharp non-asymptotic regret bounds for an upper confidence bound index with a constant level of exploration for Gaussian rewards. Furthermore, we establish a non-asymptotic regret bound for the upper confidence bound index of \cite{lai1987adaptive} which employs an exploration function that decreases with the sample size of the corresponding arm. The regret bounds have leading constants that match the Lai-Robbins lower bound. Our results highlight an aspect of Lai's seminal works that deserves more attention in the machine learning literature.</description>

      <title>Polynomial approximation of noisy functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Approximating a univariate function on the interval $[-1,1]$ with a polynomial is among the most classical problems in numerical analysis. When the function evaluations come with noise, a least-squares fit is known to reduce the effect of noise as more samples are taken. The generic algorithm for the least-squares problem requires $O(Nn^2)$ operations, where $N+1$ is the number of sample points and $n$ is the degree of the polynomial approximant. This algorithm is unstable when $n$ is large, for example $n\gg \sqrt{N}$ for equispaced sample points. In this study, we blend numerical analysis and statistics to introduce a stable and fast $O(N\log N)$ algorithm called NoisyChebtrunc based on the Chebyshev interpolation. It has the same error reduction effect as least-squares and the convergence is spectral until the error reaches $O(\sigma \sqrt{{n}/{N}})$, where $\sigma$ is the noise level, after which the error continues to decrease at the Monte-Carlo $O(1/\sqrt{N})$ rate. To determine the polynomial degree, NoisyChebtrunc employs a statistical criterion, namely Mallows' $C_p$. We analyze NoisyChebtrunc in terms of the variance and concentration in the infinity norm to the underlying noiseless function. These results show that with high probability the infinity-norm error is bounded by a small constant times $\sigma \sqrt{{n}/{N}}$, when the noise {is} independent and follows a subgaussian or subexponential distribution. We illustrate the performance of NoisyChebtrunc with numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Adjusted Expected Improvement for Cumulative Regret Minimization in Noisy Bayesian Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.04901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.04901v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The expected improvement (EI) is one of the most popular acquisition functions for Bayesian optimization (BO) and has demonstrated good empirical performances in many applications for the minimization of simple regret. However, under the evaluation metric of cumulative regret, the performance of EI may not be competitive, and its existing theoretical regret upper bound still has room for improvement. To adapt the EI for better performance under cumulative regret, we introduce a novel quantity called the evaluation cost which is compared against the acquisition function, and with this, develop the expected improvement-cost (EIC) algorithm. In each iteration of EIC, a new point with the largest acquisition function value is sampled, only if that value exceeds its evaluation cost. If none meets this criteria, the current best point is resampled. This evaluation cost quantifies the potential downside of sampling a point, which is important under the cumulative regret metric as the objective function value in every iteration affects the performance measure. We establish in theory a high-probability regret upper bound of EIC based on the maximum information gain, which is tighter than the bound of existing EI-based algorithms. It is also comparable to the regret bound of other popular BO algorithms such as Thompson sampling (GP-TS) and upper confidence bound (GP-UCB). We further perform experiments to illustrate the improvement of EIC over several popular BO algorithms.</description>

      <title>Approximate Bayesian computation for Markovian binary trees in phylogenetics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.00194v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Phylogenetic trees describe the relationships between species in the evolutionary process, and provide information about the rates of diversification. To understand the mechanisms behind macroevolution, we consider a class of multitype branching processes called Markovian binary trees (MBTs). MBTs allow for trait-based variation in diversification rates, and provide a flexible and realistic probabilistic model for phylogenetic trees. We develop an approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) scheme to infer the rates of MBT parameters by exploiting the information in the shapes of phylogenetic trees.We evaluate the accuracy of this inference method using simulation studies, and find that our method is able to detect variation in the diversification rates, with accuracy comparable to, and generally better than, likelihood-based methods. In an application to a real-life phylogeny of squamata, we reinforce conclusions drawn from earlier studies, in particular supporting the existence of ovi-/viviparity transitions in both directions. Our method demonstrates the potential for more complex models of evolution to be employed in phylogenetic inference, in conjunction with likelihood-free schemes.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Process Regression under Computational and Epistemic Misspecification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09225v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gaussian process regression is a classical kernel method for function estimation and data interpolation. In large data applications, computational costs can be reduced using low-rank or sparse approximations of the kernel. This paper investigates the effect of such kernel approximations on the interpolation error. We introduce a unified framework to analyze Gaussian process regression under important classes of computational misspecification: Karhunen-Lo\`eve expansions that result in low-rank kernel approximations, multiscale wavelet expansions that induce sparsity in the covariance matrix, and finite element representations that induce sparsity in the precision matrix. Our theory also accounts for epistemic misspecification in the choice of kernel parameters.</description>

      <title>GIST: Gibbs self-tuning for locally adaptive Hamiltonian Monte Carlo</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15253v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel and flexible framework for constructing locally adaptive Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) samplers by Gibbs sampling the algorithm's tuning parameters conditionally based on the position and momentum at each step. For adaptively sampling path lengths, this framework -- which we call Gibbs self-tuning (GIST) -- encompasses randomized HMC, multinomial HMC, the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), and the Apogee-to-Apogee Path Sampler as special cases. The GIST framework is illustrated with a novel alternative to NUTS for locally adapting path lengths, evaluated with an exact Hamiltonian for a high-dimensional, ill-conditioned Gaussian measure and with the leapfrog integrator for a suite of diverse models.</description>

Abstract: Generative models have gained significant prominence in Natural Language Processing (NLP), especially in tackling the complex task of modeling and evaluating long text sequences. This task is crucial for advancing various downstream applications, such as text generation and machine translation. Recent methods that utilize stochastic processes to capture the intrinsic dynamics of sequences have shown superior performance in generative modeling. However, the accurate encoding of both temporal and structural dependencies from text datasets, as well as leveraging this encoded information for sequence evaluation, remains an open area of research. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to learn the stochastic dynamics of long text sequences, utilizing a negative log-likelihood-based encoder that outperforms contrastive learning methods. We also introduce a likelihood-based evaluation metric for long-text assessment, which measures sequence coherence and can be applied to downstream tasks such as Human-AI discrimination. Our encoder preserves sequence coherence effectively and performs robustly on out-of-domain datasets. Additionally, the proposed evaluation metric captures both temporal and structural information comprehensively. Theoretical analysis demonstrates the superiority of our metric in sequence evaluation, and experimental results highlight its flexibility and exceptional performance across a variety of tasks, showcasing its utility in diverse NLP applications.</description>

      <title>A General Framework of the Consistency for Large Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14123v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural networks have shown remarkable success, especially in overparameterized or "large" models. Despite increasing empirical evidence and intuitive understanding, a formal mathematical justification for the behavior of such models, particularly regarding overfitting, remains incomplete. In this paper, we propose a general regularization framework to study the Mean Integrated Squared Error (MISE) of neural networks. This framework includes many commonly used neural networks and penalties, such as ReLu and Sigmoid activations and $L^1$, $L^2$ penalties. Based on our frameworks, we find the MISE curve has two possible shapes, namely the shape of double descents and monotone decreasing. The latter phenomenon is new in literature and the causes of these two phenomena are also studied in theory. These studies challenge conventional statistical modeling frameworks and broadens recent findings on the double descent phenomenon in neural networks.</description>

      <title>WHOMP: Optimizing Randomized Controlled Trials via Wasserstein Homogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18504v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate methods for partitioning datasets into subgroups that maximize diversity within each subgroup while minimizing dissimilarity across subgroups. We introduce a novel partitioning method called the $\textit{Wasserstein Homogeneity Partition}$ (WHOMP), which optimally minimizes type I and type II errors that often result from imbalanced group splitting or partitioning, commonly referred to as accidental bias, in comparative and controlled trials. We conduct an analytical comparison of WHOMP against existing partitioning methods, such as random subsampling, covariate-adaptive randomization, rerandomization, and anti-clustering, demonstrating its advantages. Moreover, we characterize the optimal solutions to the WHOMP problem and reveal an inherent trade-off between the stability of subgroup means and variances among these solutions. Based on our theoretical insights, we design algorithms that not only obtain these optimal solutions but also equip practitioners with tools to select the desired trade-off. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of WHOMP through numerical experiments, highlighting its superiority over traditional methods.</description>
