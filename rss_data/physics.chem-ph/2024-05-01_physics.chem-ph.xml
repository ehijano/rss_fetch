      <title>Striking the Right Balance of Encoding Electron Correlation in the Hamiltonian and the Wavefunction Ansatz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-configurational electronic structure theory delivers the most versatile approximations to many-electron wavefunctions, flexible enough to deal with all sorts of transformations, ranging from electronic excitations, to open-shell molecules and chemical reactions. Multi-configurational models are therefore essential to establish universally applicable, predictive ab initio methods for chemistry. Here, we present a discussion of explicit correlation approaches which address the nagging problem of dealing with static and dynamic electron correlation in multi-configurational active-space approaches. We review the latest developments and then point to their key obstacles. Our discussion is supported by new data obtained with tensor network methods. We argue in favor of simple electrons-only correlator expressions that may allow one to define transcorrelated models in which the correlator does not bear a dependence on molecular structure.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the effects of Cu doping on the H2 activation by CeO2 surface frustrated Lewis pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the solid-state frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) on the surface of CeO2 have been demonstrated to effectively catalyze the selective hydrogenation of unsaturated substrates, hence, the relationship between their intrinsic properties and H2 activation at the atomic scale has attracted great attention. In this work, the effects of Cu doping on the intrinsic FLPs properties for different facets of CeO2 is investigated by using density functional theory calculations, including the geometric parameters between Lewis acid-base centers, and the reactivity of Lewis acid-base towards H2 activation. The study demonstrates that introducing O vacancies on different crystal facets of CeO2 creates FLPs with the ability to efficiently cleavage hydrogen molecules. After the substitution of Ce with Cu, the inadequate electron availability of Cu to bond with O contributes to a reduction in the formation energy of O vacancies. Importantly, Cu exert an influence not only on the intrinsic properties of FLPs but also on the formation of new Ce-O and Cu-O FLPs. Considering the H2 activation, the doping of Cu results in an enhancement for the thermodynamics by decreasing the reaction energies, while a hinderance for the kinetics by increasing the energy barriers. Overall, with these theoretical investigations, we propose certain hints for the future experimental studies concerning the synthesis of Cu doped CeO2 catalysts for the H2 activation and hydrogenation reactions.</description>

      <title>Exploring the role of mean-field potentials and short-range wave function behavior in the adiabatic connection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we explore the construction of Hamiltonians with long-range interactions and their corrections using the short-range behavior of the wave function. A key aspect of our investigation is the examination of the one-particle potential, kept constant in our previous work, and the effects of its optimization on the adiabatic connection.
  Our methodology involves the use of a parameter-dependent potential dependent on a single parameter to facilitate practical computations. We analyze the energy errors and densities in a two-electron system (harmonium) under various conditions, employing different confinement potentials and interaction parameters. The study reveals that while the mean-field potential improves the expectation value of the physical Hamiltonian, it does not necessarily improve the energy of the system within the bounds of chemical accuracy.
  We also delve into the impact of density variations in adiabatic connections, challenging the common assumption that a mean field improves results. Our findings indicate that as long as energy errors remain within chemical accuracy, the mean field does not significantly outperform a bare potential. This observation is attributed to the effectiveness of corrections based on the short-range behavior of the wave function, a universal characteristic that diminishes the distinction between using a mean field or not.</description>

      <title>Advanced analysis of single-molecule spectroscopic data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Full SMS, a multipurpose graphical user interface (GUI)-based software package for analysing single-molecule spectroscopy (SMS) data. SMS typically delivers multiparameter data -- such as fluorescence brightness, lifetime, and spectra -- of molecular- or nanometre-scale particles such as single dye molecules, quantum dots, or fluorescently labelled biological macromolecules. Full SMS allows an unbiased statistical analysis of fluorescence brightness through level resolution and clustering, analysis of fluorescence lifetimes through decay fitting, as well as the calculation of second-order correlation functions and the display of fluorescence spectra and raster-scan images. Additional features include extensive data filtering options, a custom HDF5-based file format, and flexible data export options. The software is open source and written in Python but GUI-based so it may be used without any programming knowledge. A multi-process architecture was employed for computational efficiency. The software is also designed to be easily extendable to include additional import data types and analysis capabilities.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric transport properties of the quasi-one-dimensional dimer-Mott insulator $\beta'$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$ICl$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-dimensional materials, in which the electronic and transport properties are drastically modified in comparison to those of three-dimensional bulk materials, yield a key class of thermoelectric materials with high conversion efficiency. Among such materials, the organic compounds may serve peculiar properties owing to their unique molecular-based low-dimensional structures with highly anisotropic molecular orbitals. Here we present the thermoelectric transport properties of the quasi-one-dimensional dimer-Mott insulator $\beta'$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$ICl$_2$, where BEDT-TTF stands for bis(ethylenedithio)-tetrathiafulvalene. We find that the thermopower exhibits typical activation-type temperature variation expected for insulators but its absolute value is anomalously large compared to the expected value from the activation-type temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity. Successively, the Jonker-plot analysis, in which the thermopower is usually scaled by the logarithm of the resistivity, shows an unusual relation among such transport quantities. We discuss a role of the low dimensionality for the enhanced thermopower along with recent observations of such a large thermopower in several low-dimensional materials.</description>

      <title>Parity and time-reversal symmetry violation in diatomic molecules: LaO, LaS and LuO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The violation of parity (P) and time-reversal (T) symmetry is enhanced in the LaS, LaO and LuO molecules due to the existence of states of opposite parity with small energy differences and the presence of heavy nuclei. We calculate the molecular enhancement for the P, T-violating electron electric dipole moment ($W_{\mathrm{d}}$), scalar-pseudoscalar nucleon-electron interaction ($W_{\mathrm{s}}$), nuclear magnetic quadrupole moment ($W_{\mathrm{M}}$), and for the nuclear spin-dependent P-violating anapole moment ($W_{\mathrm{A}}$). We use the relativistic 4-components coupled cluster method and perform a systematic study to estimate the associated uncertainties in our approach. We find that the individual contribution of each computational parameter to the total uncertainty in a system is approximately the same for all the calculated enhancement factors, summing up to a total uncertainty of $\sim7$\%. We discuss the energy shifts and matrix elements associated with the calculated molecular enhancement factors and relate them to higher-energy P- and P, T- violating interactions.</description>

      <title>Proper Orthogonal Descriptors for Multi-element Chemical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.14549v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the proper orthogonal descriptors for efficient and accurate interatomic potentials of multi-element chemical systems. The potential energy surface of a multi-element system is represented as a many-body expansion of parametrized potentials which are functions of atom positions, atom types, and parameters. The proper orthogonal decomposition is employed to decompose the parametrized potentials {as a linear combination} of orthogonal basis functions. The orthogonal basis functions are used to construct proper orthogonal descriptors based on the elements of atoms, thus leading to multi-element descriptors. We compose the multi-element proper orthogonal descriptors to develop linear and quadratic interatomic potentials. We devise an algorithm to efficiently compute the total energy and forces of the interatomic potentials constructed from the proper orthogonal descriptors. The potentials are demonstrated for indium phosphide and titanium dioxide in comparison with the spectral neighbor analysis potential (SNAP) and atomic cluster expansion (ACE) potentials.</description>

      <title>Chemical Potentials and the One-Electron Hamiltonian of the Second-Order Perturbation Theory from the Functional Derivative Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06405v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a functional derivative approach to calculate the chemical potentials of the second-order perturbation theory (MP2). In the functional derivative approach, the correlation part of the MP2 chemical potential, which is the derivative of the MP2 correlation energy with respect to the occupation number of frontier orbitals, is obtained from the chain rule via the non-interacting Green's function. First, the MP2 correlation energy is expressed in terms of the non-interacting Green's function and its functional derivative to the non-interacting Green's function is the second-order self-energy. Then the derivative of the non-interacting Green's function to the occupation number is obtained by including the orbital relaxation effect. We show that the MP2 chemical potentials obtained from the functional derivative approach agrees with that obtained from the finite difference approach. The one-electron Hamiltonian, defined as the derivative of the MP2 energy with respect to the one particle density matrix, is also derived using the functional derivative approach, which can be used in the self-consistent calculations of MP2 and double-hybrid density functionals. The developed functional derivative approach is promising for calculating the chemical potentials and the one-electron Hamiltonian of approximate functionals and many-body perturbation approaches dependent explicitly on the non-interacting Green's function.</description>

      <title>DMRG-tailored coupled cluster method in the 4c-relativistic domain: General implementation and application to the NUHFI and NUF$_3$ molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18473v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Heavy atom compounds represent a challenge for computational chemistry, due to the need for simultaneous treatment of relativistic and correlation effects. Often such systems exhibit also strong correlation which hampers the application of perturbation theory or single-reference coupled cluster (CC) methods. As a viable alternative, we have proposed to externally correct the CC method using the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) wave functions, yielding the DMRG-tailored CC method. In a previous paper [J. Chem. Phys. {\bf 152}, 174107 (2020)] we have reported a first implementation of this method in the relativistic context, which was restricted to molecules with real double group symmetry. In this work we present a fully general implementation of the method, covering complex and quaternion double groups as well. The 4c-TCC method thus becomes applicable to polyatomic molecules including heavy atoms. For assessment of the method, we performed calculations of the chiral uranium compound NUHFI, which was previously studied in the context of the enhancement of parity violation effects. In particular, we performed calculations of a cut of the potential energy surface of this molecule along the dissociation of the N-U bond, where the system exhibits a strong multireference character. Since there are no experimental data for NUHFI, we have performed also an analogous study of the (more symmetric) NUF$_3$ molecule, where the vibrational frequency of the N-U bond can be compared with spectroscopic data.</description>

      <title>Understanding inner-shell excitations in molecules through spectroscopy of the 4f hole states of YbF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10692v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Molecules containing a lanthanide atom have sets of electronic states arising from excitation of an inner-shell electron. These states have received little attention, but are thought to play an important role in laser cooling of such molecules and may be a useful resource for testing fundamental physics. We study a series of inner-shell excited states in YbF using resonance-enhanced multi-photon ionisation spectroscopy. We investigate the excited states of lowest energy, 8474, 9013 and 9090 cm$^{-1}$ above the ground state, all corresponding to the configuration 4f$^{13}$6s$^{2}$ ${}^{2}F_{7/2}$ of the Yb$^+$ ion. They are metastable, since they have no electric dipole allowed transitions to the ground state. We also characterize a state at 31050 cm$^{-1}$ that is easily excited from both the ground and metastable states, which makes it especially useful for this spectroscopic study. Finally, we study a state at 48729 cm$^{-1}$, which is above the ionization limit and features strong auto-ionizing resonances that prove useful for efficient detection of the molecules and for identifying the rotational quantum number of each line in the spectrum. We resolve the rotational structures of all these states and find that they can all be described by a very simple model based on Hund's case (c). Our study provides information necessary for laser slowing and magneto-optical trapping of YbF, which is an important species for testing fundamental physics. We also consider whether the low-lying inner-shell states may themselves be useful as probes of the electron's electric dipole moment or of varying fundamental constants, since they are long-lived states in a laser-coolable molecule featuring closely-spaced levels of opposite parity.</description>
