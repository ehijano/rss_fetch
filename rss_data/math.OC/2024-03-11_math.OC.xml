      <title>The stochastic Ravine accelerated gradient method with general extrapolation coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a real Hilbert space domain setting, we study the convergence properties of the stochastic Ravine accelerated gradient method for convex differentiable optimization. We consider the general form of this algorithm where the extrapolation coefficients can vary with each iteration, and where the evaluation of the gradient is subject to random errors. This general treatment models a breadth of practical algorithms and numerical implementations. We show that, under a proper tuning of the extrapolation parameters, and when the error variance associated with the gradient evaluations or the step-size sequences vanish sufficiently fast, the Ravine method provides fast convergence of the values both in expectation and almost surely. We also improve the convergence rates from O(.) to o(.). Moreover, we show almost sure summability property of the gradients, which implies the fast convergence of the gradients towards zero. This property reflects the fact that the high-resolution ODE of the Ravine method includes a Hessian-driven damping term. When the space is also separable, our analysis allows also to establish almost sure weak convergence of the sequence of iterates provided by the algorithm. We finally specialize the analysis to consider different parameter choices, including vanishing and constant (heavy ball method with friction) damping parameter, and present a comprehensive landscape of the tradeoffs in speed and accuracy associated with these parameter choices and statistical properties on the sequence of errors in the gradient computations. We provide a thorough discussion of the similarities and differences with the Nesterov accelerated gradient which satisfies similar asymptotic convergence rates.</description>

      <title>Modifications of the Frank-Wolfe algorithm in the problem of finding an equilibrium distribution of traffic flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper presents various modifications of the Frank-Wolfe algorithm in the equilibrium traffic assignment problem. The Beckman model is used as a model for experiments. In this article, first of all, attention is paid to the choice of the direction of the basic step of the Frank-Wolfe algorithm. Algorithms will be presented: Conjugate Frank-Wolfe (CFW), Bi -conjugate Frank-Wolfe (BFW), Fukushima Frank-Wolfe (FFW). Each modification corresponds to different approaches to the choice of this direction. Some of these modifications are described in previous works of the authors. In this article, following algorithms will be proposed: N-conjugate Frank-Wolfe (NFW), Weighted Fukushima Frank-Wolfe (WFFW). These algorithms are some ideological continuation of the BFW and FFW algorithms. Thus, if the first algorithm used at each iteration the last two directions of the previous iterations to select the next direction conjugate to them, then the proposed algorithm NFW is using more than N previous directions. In the case of Fukushima Frank-Wolfe, the average of several previous directions is taken as the next direction. According to this algorithm, a modification WFFW is proposed, which uses a exponential smoothing from previous directions. Experiments with various modifications were carried out on several datasets representing urban structures and taken from publicly available sources. The relative gap value was taken as the quality metric. The experimental results showed the advantage of algorithms using the previous directions for step selection over the classic Frank-Wolfe algorithm. In addition, an improvement in efficiency was revealed when using more than two conjugate directions. For example, on various datasets, the modification 3FW showed the best convergence. In addition, the proposed modification WFFW often overtook FFW and CFW, although performed worse than NFW.</description>

      <title>Linear Programs Where Every Shadow Simplex Path is Exponentially Long</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It remains open whether there is a version of the simplex method guaranteed to run in strongly polynomial time. One variant, the shadow simplex method, has been shown to have strongly polynomial expected run-time both for random linear programs and in the smoothed analysis model. The shadow simplex method solves a linear program by implicitly projecting the feasible region onto a two dimensional polygon. The choice of projection is not canonical, so for each method of choosing a projection one finds a different shadow simplex method. Examples are known in one which a single choice of projection leads to an exponential run-time, but the possibility has remained that one could construct a variant of the shadow simplex method that always chooses some projection guaranteeing a strongly polynomial run-time. We show that no such strongly polynomial time variant of the shadow simplex method exists by constructing families of linear programs where every choice of projection leads to an exponential run-time.</description>

      <title>Deep Backward and Galerkin Methods for the Finite State Master Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes and analyzes two neural network methods to solve the master equation for finite-state mean field games (MFGs). Solving MFGs provides approximate Nash equilibria for stochastic, differential games with finite but large populations of agents. The master equation is a partial differential equation (PDE) whose solution characterizes MFG equilibria for any possible initial distribution. The first method we propose relies on backward induction in a time component while the second method directly tackles the PDE without discretizing time. For both approaches, we prove two types of results: there exist neural networks that make the algorithms' loss functions arbitrarily small, and conversely, if the losses are small, then the neural networks are good approximations of the master equation's solution. We conclude the paper with numerical experiments on benchmark problems from the literature up to dimension 15, and a comparison with solutions computed by a classical method for fixed initial distributions.</description>

      <title>A Sinkhorn-type Algorithm for Constrained Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entropic optimal transport (OT) and the Sinkhorn algorithm have made it practical for machine learning practitioners to perform the fundamental task of calculating transport distance between statistical distributions. In this work, we focus on a general class of OT problems under a combination of equality and inequality constraints. We derive the corresponding entropy regularization formulation and introduce a Sinkhorn-type algorithm for such constrained OT problems supported by theoretical guarantees. We first bound the approximation error when solving the problem through entropic regularization, which reduces exponentially with the increase of the regularization parameter. Furthermore, we prove a sublinear first-order convergence rate of the proposed Sinkhorn-type algorithm in the dual space by characterizing the optimization procedure with a Lyapunov function. To achieve fast and higher-order convergence under weak entropy regularization, we augment the Sinkhorn-type algorithm with dynamic regularization scheduling and second-order acceleration. Overall, this work systematically combines recent theoretical and numerical advances in entropic optimal transport with the constrained case, allowing practitioners to derive approximate transport plans in complex scenarios.</description>

      <title>A global Barzilai and Borwein's gradient normalization descent method for multiobjective optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the unconstrained multiobjective optimization problem. In recent years, researchers pointed out that the steepest decent method may generate small stepsize which leads to slow convergence rates. To address the issue, we propose a global Barzilai and Borwein's gradient normalization descent method for multiobjective optimization (GBBN). In our method, we propose a new normalization technique to generate new descent direction. We demonstrate that line search can achieve better stepsize along the descent direction. Furthermore, we prove the global convergence of accumulation points generated by GBBN as Pareto critical points and establish a linear rate of convergence under reasonable assumptions. Finally, we evaluated the effectiveness of the proposed GBBN method based on the quality of the approximated Pareto frontier and computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Evolving efficiency of the BRICS markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates a time-varying version of weak-form market efficiency in the BRICS countries. A moving window test for sample autocorrelations is applied alongside a Kalman filter approach to recover the hidden dynamics of the market efficiency process through appropriate time-varying autoregressive models with both homoscedastic and heteroscedastic conditional variance. Monthly data covers the period from January 1995 to December 2020, which includes the 2008-2009 global financial crisis and the recent COVID-19 recession. The results reveal that all the BRICS stock markets were affected during both periods, but generally remained weak-form efficient, with the exception of China.</description>

      <title>System Identification using Energy-Bounded Noise Models: A Full Characterization of Chebyshev Centers and Radii</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the identification of linear time-invariant systems using noisy input-output data in a set-membership framework. It is assumed that the noise sequence belongs to a bounded set, induced by a quadratic matrix inequality, that allows for capturing various energy-bounded noise models. In this framework, the identification problem is to find an estimation for the true system so that the worst-case estimation error with respect to a given norm is minimized. For such a problem, we present closed-form solutions with respect to arbitrary unitarily invariant matrix norms. Examples of these norms include the Frobenius norm, spectral norm, Schatten p-norms, and Ky Fan k-norms.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Theoretical Guarantees of Direct-Search Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimizing a function without using derivatives is a challenging paradigm, that precludes from using classical algorithms from nonlinear optimization and may thus seem intractable other than by using heuristics. However, the field of derivative-free optimization has succeeded in producing algorithms that do not rely on derivatives and yet are endowed with convergence guarantees. One class of such methods, called direct search, is particularly popular thanks to its simplicity of implementation, even though its theoretical underpinnings are not always easy to grasp. In this work, we survey contemporary direct-search algorithms from a theoretical viewpoint, with the aim of highlighting the key theoretical features of these methods. Our study goes beyond the classical, textbook cases and tackles the presence of nonsmoothness, noise, and constraints in the problem at hand. In addition to reviewing classical results in the field, we provide new perspectives on existing results, as well as novel proofs that illustrate the versatility of direct-search schemes.</description>

      <title>On the Set of Possible Minimizers of a Sum of Convex Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a sum of convex functions, where the only information known about each individual summand is the location of a minimizer. In this work, we give an exact characterization of the set of possible minimizers of the sum. Our results cover several types of assumptions on the summands, such as smoothness or strong convexity. Our main tool is the use of necessary and sufficient conditions for interpolating the considered function classes, which leads to shorter and more direct proofs in comparison with previous work. We also address the setting where each summand minimizer is assumed to lie in a unit ball, and prove a tight bound on the norm of any minimizer of the sum.</description>

      <title>Sampling-Based Risk-Aware Path Planning Around Dynamic Engagement Zones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing methods for avoiding dynamic engagement zones (EZs) and minimizing risk leverage the calculus of variations to obtain optimal paths. While such methods are deterministic, they scale poorly as the number of engagement zones increases. Furthermore, optimal-control based strategies are sensitive to initial guesses and often converge to local, rather than global, minima. This paper presents a novel sampling-based approach to obtain a feasible flight plan for a Dubins vehicle to reach a desired location in a bounded operating region in the presence of a large number of engagement zones. The dynamic EZs are coupled to the vehicle dynamics through its heading angle. Thus, the dynamic two-dimensional obstacles in the (x,y) plane can be transformed into three-dimensional static obstacles in a lifted (x,y,{\psi}) space. This insight is leveraged in the formulation of a Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT*) algorithm. The algorithm is evaluated with a Monte Carlo experiment that randomizes EZ locations to characterize the success rate and average path length as a function of the number of EZs and as the computation time made available to the planner is increased.</description>

      <title>Almost Global Asymptotic Trajectory Tracking for Fully-Actuated Mechanical Systems on Homogeneous Riemannian Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we address the design of tracking controllers that drive a mechanical system's state asymptotically towards a reference trajectory. Motivated by aerospace and robotics applications, we consider fully-actuated systems evolving on the broad class of homogeneous spaces (encompassing all vector spaces, Lie groups, and spheres of any dimension). In this setting, the transitive action of a Lie group on the configuration manifold enables an intrinsic description of the tracking error as an element of the state space, even in the absence of a group structure on the configuration manifold itself (e.g., for $\mathbb{S}^2$). Such an error state facilitates the design of a generalized control policy depending smoothly on state and time that drives this geometric tracking error to a designated origin from almost every initial condition, thereby guaranteeing almost global convergence to the reference trajectory. Moreover, the proposed controller simplifies naturally when specialized to a Lie group or the $n$-sphere. In summary, we propose a unified, intrinsic controller guaranteeing almost global asymptotic trajectory tracking for fully-actuated mechanical systems evolving on a broader class of manifolds. We apply the method to an axisymmetric satellite and an omnidirectional aerial robot.</description>

      <title>Provably Time-Optimal Cooling of Markovian Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of cooling a Markovian quantum system to a pure state in the shortest amount of time possible. Here the system drift takes the form of a Lindblad master equation and we assume fast unitary control. This setting allows for a natural reduction of the control system to the eigenvalues of the state density matrix. We give a simple necessary and sufficient characterization of systems which are (asymptotically) coolable and present a powerful result which allows to considerably simplify the search for optimal cooling solutions. With these tools at our disposal we derive explicit provably time-optimal cooling protocols for rank one qubit systems, inverted $\Lambda$-systems on a qutrit, and a certain system consisting of two coupled qubits.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Continuous Time to Understand Momentum When Training Diagonal Linear Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the effect of momentum on the optimisation trajectory of gradient descent. We leverage a continuous-time approach in the analysis of momentum gradient descent with step size $\gamma$ and momentum parameter $\beta$ that allows us to identify an intrinsic quantity $\lambda = \frac{ \gamma }{ (1 - \beta)^2 }$ which uniquely defines the optimisation path and provides a simple acceleration rule. When training a $2$-layer diagonal linear network in an overparametrised regression setting, we characterise the recovered solution through an implicit regularisation problem. We then prove that small values of $\lambda$ help to recover sparse solutions. Finally, we give similar but weaker results for stochastic momentum gradient descent. We provide numerical experiments which support our claims.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generalizations and variations of the fundamental lemma by Willems et al. are an active topic of recent research. In this note, we explore and formalize the links between kernel regression and known nonlinear extensions of the fundamental lemma. Applying a transformation to the usual linear equation in Hankel matrices, we arrive at an alternative implicit kernel representation of the system trajectories while keeping the requirements on persistency of excitation. We show that this representation is equivalent to the solution of a specific kernel regression problem. We explore the possible structures of the underlying kernel as well as the system classes to which they correspond.</description>

      <title>Online Contention Resolution Schemes for Network Revenue Management and Combinatorial Auctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the Network Revenue Management (NRM) problem, products composed of up to L resources are sold to stochastically arriving customers. We take a randomized rounding approach to NRM, motivated by developments in Online Contention Resolution Schemes (OCRS). The goal is to take a fractional solution to NRM that satisfies the resource constraints in expectation, and implement it in an online policy that satisfies the resource constraints in any state, while (approximately) preserving all of the sales that were prescribed by the fractional solution.
  OCRS cannot be naively applied to NRM or revenue management problems in general, because customer substitution induces a negative correlation in products being demanded. We start by deriving an OCRS that achieves a guarantee of 1/(1+L) for NRM with customer substitution, matching a common benchmark in the literature. We then show how to beat this benchmark for all integers L&gt;1 assuming no substitution, i.e., in the standard OCRS setting. By contrast, we show that this benchmark is unbeatable using OCRS or any fractional relaxation if there is customer substitution, for all integers L that are the power of a prime number. Finally, we show how to beat 1/(1+L) even with customer substitution, if the products comprise one item from each of up to L groups.
  Our results have corresponding implications for Online Combinatorial Auctions, in which buyers bid for bundles of up to L items, and buyers being single-minded is akin to no substitution. Our final result also beats 1/(1+L) for Prophet Inequality on the intersection of L partition matroids. All in all, our paper provides a unifying framework for applying OCRS to these problems, delineating the impact of substitution, and establishing a separation between the guarantees achievable with vs. without substitution under general resource constraints parametrized by L.</description>

      <title>Hidden monotonicity and canonical transformations for mean field games and master equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we unveil novel monotonicity conditions applicable for Mean Field Games through the exploration of finite dimensional $canonical\ transformations$. Our findings contribute to establishing new global well-posedness results for the associated master equations, also in the case of potentially degenerate idiosyncratic noise. Additionally, we show that recent advancements in global well-posedness results, specifically those related to displacement semi-monotone and anti-monotone data, can be easily obtained as a consequence of our main results.</description>

      <title>Finite Codimensionality Method in Infinite-dimensional Optimization Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2102.00652v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to establishing an enhanced Fritz John type first-order necessary condition for a general constrained nonlinear infinite-dimensional optimization problem. Unlike traditional constraint qualifications in optimization theory, a condition of finite codimensionality is employed to ensure the existence of nontrivial Lagrange multipliers. As applications, first-order necessary conditions for optimal control problems of some deterministic/stochastic control systems are derived in a unified manner. Compared with the existing constraint qualifications, the finite codimensionality condition, which is equivalent to some suitable {\it a priori} estimates, can offer a more straightforward verification process in these applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2108.02648v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies an optimal consumption problem for a loss-averse agent with reference to past consumption maximum. To account for loss aversion on relative consumption, an S-shaped utility is adopted that measures the difference between the non-negative consumption rate and a fraction of the historical spending peak. We consider the concave envelope of the utility with respect to consumption, allowing us to focus on an auxiliary HJB variational inequality on the strength of concavification principle and dynamic programming arguments. By applying the dual transform and smooth-fit conditions, the auxiliary HJB variational inequality is solved in piecewise closed-form and some thresholds of the wealth variable are obtained. The optimal consumption and investment control can be derived in the piecewise feedback form. The rigorous verification proofs on optimality and concavification principle are provided. Some numerical sensitivity analysis and financial implications are also presented.</description>

      <title>Distributionally Preference Robust Optimization in Multi-Attribute Decision Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.04491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.04491v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Utility preference robust optimization (PRO) has recently been proposed to deal with optimal decision making problems where the decision maker's (DM) preference over gains and losses is ambiguous. In this paper, we take a step further to investigate the case that the DM's preference is not only ambiguous but also potentially inconsistent or even displaying some kind of randomness. We propose a distributionally preference robust optimization (DPRO) approach where the DM's preference is represented by a random utility function and the ambiguity is described by a set of probability distributions of the random utility. An obvious advantage of the new DPRO model is that it no longer concerns the DM's preference inconsistency. In the case when the random utility functions are of piecewise linear structure, we propose two statistical methods for constructing the ambiguity set: an ellipsoidal method and a bootstrap method both of which are fundamentally based on the idea of confidence region with the sample mean of the random parameters, and demonstrate how the resulting DPRO can be solved by a cutting surface algorithm and an MISOCP respectively. We also show how the DPRO models with general random utility functions may be approximated by those with piecewise linear random utility functions. Finally, we apply the proposed DPRO model in car manufacturing and facility location planning and show how the random samples may be extracted by multinomial logit method and conjoint analysis/machine learning. The paper is the first attempt to use distributionally robust optimization methods for PRO.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.05564v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a singularly perturbed system of stochastic differential equations proposed by Chaudhari et al. (Res. Math. Sci. 2018) to approximate the Entropic Gradient Descent in the optimization of deep neural networks, via homogenisation. We embed it in a much larger class of two-scale stochastic control problems and rely on convergence results for Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations with unbounded data proved recently by ourselves (ESAIM Control Optim. Calc. Var. 2023). We show that the limit of the value functions is itself the value function of an effective control problem with extended controls, and that the trajectories of the perturbed system converge in a suitable sense to the trajectories of the limiting effective control system. These rigorous results improve the understanding of the convergence of the algorithms used by Chaudhari et al., as well as of their possible extensions where some tuning parameters are modelled as dynamic controls.</description>

      <title>Renewable Energy Integration Strategies: A Transmission Operator's Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.10562v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper aims to investigate the role of a transmission system operator within a carbon footprint reduction strategy incorporating carbon taxes and renewable generation subsidies in the decentralised energy market. Moreover, this manuscript offers insights into the influence of various compositions of aforementioned policies on generation mix and social welfare. For that, we employ an optimisation bi-level model in which a welfare-maximizing transmission system operator makes investments in transmission lines at the upper level while considering power market dynamics at the lower level. To account for the deregulated energy market structure, we assume that the generation companies at the lower level make capacity investments as price-takers in perfect competition. Considering alternative transmission infrastructure expansion budgets, carbon emission taxes and monetary incentives for renewable generation capacity expansion, we study how alternative compositions of these factors affect three output factors: the share of renewable generation in the generation mix, total generation amount, and social welfare. We apply the proposed modelling assessment to an illustrative three-node instance and a case study considering a simplified representation of the energy system of the Nordic and Baltic countries. The findings of this study can serve as an additional reference for policymakers seeking to simultaneously increase the proportion of renewable energy generation and total generation amount to meet increasing demand.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.13970v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of estimating the convex hull of the image $f(X)\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ of a compact set $X\subset\mathbb{R}^m$ with smooth boundary through a smooth function $f:\mathbb{R}^m\to\mathbb{R}^n$. Assuming that $f$ is a submersion, we derive a new bound on the Hausdorff distance between the convex hull of $f(X)$ and the convex hull of the images $f(x_i)$ of $M$ sampled inputs $x_i$ on the boundary of $X$. When applied to the problem of geometric inference from a random sample, our results give error bounds that are tighter and more general than in previous work. We present applications to the problems of robust optimization, of reachability analysis of dynamical systems, and of robust trajectory optimization under bounded uncertainty.</description>

      <title>An extended Merton problem with relaxed benchmark tracking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.10802v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies a Merton's optimal portfolio and consumption problem in an extended formulation incorporating the tracking of a benchmark process described by a geometric Brownian motion. We consider a relaxed tracking formulation such that the wealth process compensated by a fictitious capital injection outperforms the benchmark at all times. The fund manager aims to maximize the expected utility of consumption deducted by the cost of the capital injection, where the latter term can also be regarded as the expected largest shortfall of the wealth with reference to the benchmark. By introducing an auxiliary state process with reflection, we formulate and tackle an equivalent stochastic control problem by means of the dual transform and probabilistic representation, where the dual PDE can be solved explicitly. On the strength of the closed-form results, we can derive and verify the optimal feedback control for the primal control problem, allowing us to discuss some new and interesting financial implications induced by the additional risk-taking from the capital injection and the goal of tracking.</description>

      <title>On the Hardness of Short and Sign-Compatible Circuit Walks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01066v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The circuits of a polyhedron are a superset of its edge directions. Circuit walks, a sequence of steps along circuits, generalize edge walks and are "short" if they have few steps or small total length. Both interpretations of short are relevant to the theory and application of linear programming.
  We study the hardness of several problems relating to the construction of short circuit walks. We establish that for a pair of vertices of a $0/1$-network-flow polytope, it is NP-complete to determine the length of a shortest circuit walk, even if we add the requirement that the walk must be sign-compatible. Our results also imply that determining the minimal number of circuits needed for a sign-compatible decomposition is NP-complete. Further, we show that it is NP-complete to determine the smallest total length (for $p$-norms $\lVert \cdot \rVert_p$, $1 &lt; p \leq \infty$) of a circuit walk between a pair of vertices. One method to construct a short circuit walk is to pick up a correct facet at each step, which generalizes a non-revisiting walk. We prove that it is NP-complete to determine if there is a circuit direction that picks up a correct facet; in contrast, this problem can be solved in polynomial time for TU polyhedra.</description>

      <title>A Composite Decomposition Method for Large-Scale Global Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01192v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cooperative co-evolution (CC) algorithms, based on the divide-and-conquer strategy, have emerged as the predominant approach to solving large-scale global optimization (LSGO) problems. The efficiency and accuracy of the grouping stage significantly impact the performance of the optimization process. While the general separability grouping (GSG) method has overcome the limitation of previous differential grouping (DG) methods by enabling the decomposition of non-additively separable functions, it suffers from high computational complexity. To address this challenge, this article proposes a composite separability grouping (CSG) method, seamlessly integrating DG and GSG into a problem decomposition framework to utilize the strengths of both approaches. CSG introduces a step-by-step decomposition framework that accurately decomposes various problem types using fewer computational resources. By sequentially identifying additively, multiplicatively and generally separable variables, CSG progressively groups non-separable variables by recursively considering the interactions between each non-separable variable and the formed non-separable groups. Furthermore, to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of CSG, we introduce two innovative methods: a multiplicatively separable variable detection method and a non-separable variable grouping method. These two methods are designed to effectively detect multiplicatively separable variables and efficiently group non-separable variables, respectively. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that CSG achieves more accurate variable grouping with lower computational complexity compared to GSG and state-of-the-art DG series designs.</description>

      <title>Discrete Consensus-Based Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03430v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose Discrete Consensus-Based Optimization (DCBO), a fully discrete version of the Consensus-Based Optimization (CBO) framework. DCBO is a multi-agent method for the global optimization of possibly non-convex and non-differentiable functions. It aligns with the CBO paradigm, which promotes a consensus among agents towards a global optimum through simple stochastic dynamics amenable to rigorous mathematical analysis. Despite the promises, there has been a gap between the analysis of CBO and the actual behavior of the agents from its time-discrete implementation, as the former has focused on the system of continuous stochastic differential equations defining the model or its mean-field approximation. In particular, direct analysis of CBO-type algorithms with heterogeneous stochasticity is very challenging. DCBO distinguishes itself from these approaches in the sense that it has no continuous counterpart, thanks to the replacement of the "softmin" operator with the "hardmin" one, which is inherently discrete. Yet, it maintains the operational principles of CBO and allows for rich mathematical analysis. We present conditions, independent of the number of agents, for achieving a consensus or convergence and study the circumstances under which global optimization occurs. We test DCBO on a large number of benchmark functions to show its merits. We also demonstrate that DCBO is applicable to a diverse range of real-world problems, including neural network training, compressed sensing, and portfolio optimization, with competitive performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04657v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computing the edge expansion of a graph is a famously hard combinatorial problem for which there have been many approximation studies. We present two versions of an exact algorithm using semidefinite programming (SDP) to compute this constant for any graph. The SDP relaxation is used to first reduce the search space considerably. One version applies then an SDP-based branch-and-bound algorithm, along with heuristic search. The other version transforms the problem into an instance of a max-cut problem and solves this using a state-of-the-art solver. Numerical results demonstrate that we clearly outperform mixed-integer quadratic solvers as well as another SDP-based algorithm from the literature.</description>

Abstract: This paper studies the equilibrium consumption under external habit formation in a large population of agents. We first formulate problems under two types of conventional habit formation preferences, namely linear and multiplicative external habit formation, in a mean field game framework. In a log-normal market model with the asset specialization, we characterize one mean field equilibrium in analytical form in each problem, allowing us to understand some quantitative properties of the equilibrium strategy and conclude some financial implications caused by consumption habits from a mean-field perspective. In each problem with n agents, we construct an approximate Nash equilibrium for the n-player game using the obtained mean field equilibrium when n is sufficiently large. The explicit convergence order in each problem can also be obtained.</description>

      <title>On Disturbance Propagation in Vehicular Platoons with Different Communication Ranges</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.07927v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the control of vehicular platoons, the disturbances acting on one vehicle can propagate and affect other vehicles. If the disturbances do not amplify along the vehicular string, then it is called string stable. However, it is usually difficult to achieve string stability with a distributed control setting, especially when a constant spacing policy is considered. This note considers the string unstable cases and studies disturbance propagation in a nonlinear vehicular platoon consisting of $n+1$ vehicles where the (virtual) leading vehicle provides the reference for a constant spacing policy. Apart from the communications between consecutive vehicles, we also assume that each vehicle can receive information from $r$ neighbors ahead, that is, the vehicular platoon has communication range $r$. For the maximal overshoot of the inter-vehicular spacing errors, we explicitly show that the effect of disturbances, including the external disturbances acting on each vehicle and the acceleration of the leading vehicle, is scaled by $O(\sqrt{ \left \lceil \frac{n}{r} \right \rceil})$ for a fixed $n$. This implies that disturbance propagation can be reduced by increasing communication range. Numerical simulation is provided to illustrate the main results.</description>

      <title>Equitable Data-Driven Facility Location and Resource Allocation to Fight the Opioid Epidemic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.06179v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The opioid epidemic is a crisis that has plagued the United States (US) for decades. One central issue is inequitable access to treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD), which puts certain populations at a higher risk of opioid overdose. We integrate a predictive dynamical model and a prescriptive optimization problem to compute high-quality opioid treatment facility and treatment budget allocations for each US state. Our predictive model is a differential equation-based epidemiological model that captures opioid epidemic dynamics. We use a process inspired by neural ODEs to fit this model to opioid epidemic data for each state and obtain estimates for unknown parameters in the model. We then incorporate this epidemiological model into a mixed-integer optimization problem (MIP) that aims to minimize opioid overdose deaths and the number of people with OUD. We develop strong relaxations based on McCormick envelopes to efficiently compute approximate solutions to our MIPs with a mean optimality gap of 3.99%. Our method provides socioeconomically equitable solutions, as it incentivizes investments in areas with higher social vulnerability (from the US Centers for Disease Control's Social Vulnerability Index) and opioid prescribing rates. On average, our approach decreases the number of people with OUD by 9.03 $\pm$ 1.772%, increases the number of people in treatment by 88.75 $\pm$ 26.223%, and decreases opioid-related deaths by 0.58 $\pm$ 0.111% after 2 years compared to baseline epidemiological model predictions. Our solutions show that policy-makers should target adding treatment facilities to counties that have less facilities than their population share and are more socially vulnerable. We demonstrate that our optimization approach should help inform these decisions, as it yields population health benefits in comparison to benchmarks based solely on population and social vulnerability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.16208v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the q-learning, recently coined as the continuous time counterpart of Q-learning by Jia and Zhou (2023), for continuous time Mckean-Vlasov control problems in the setting of entropy-regularized reinforcement learning. In contrast to the single agent's control problem in Jia and Zhou (2023), the mean-field interaction of agents renders the definition of the q-function more subtle, for which we reveal that two distinct q-functions naturally arise: (i) the integrated q-function (denoted by $q$) as the first-order approximation of the integrated Q-function introduced in Gu, Guo, Wei and Xu (2023), which can be learnt by a weak martingale condition involving test policies; and (ii) the essential q-function (denoted by $q_e$) that is employed in the policy improvement iterations. We show that two q-functions are related via an integral representation under all test policies. Based on the weak martingale condition and our proposed searching method of test policies, some model-free learning algorithms are devised. In two examples, one in LQ control framework and one beyond LQ control framework, we can obtain the exact parameterization of the optimal value function and q-functions and illustrate our algorithms with simulation experiments.</description>

      <title>Improved Convergence Rates of Windowed Anderson Acceleration for Symmetric Fixed-Point Iterations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02490v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the commonly utilized windowed Anderson acceleration (AA) algorithm for fixed-point methods, $x^{(k+1)}=q(x^{(k)})$. It provides the first proof that when the operator $q$ is linear and symmetric the windowed AA, which uses a sliding window of prior iterates, improves the root-linear convergence factor over the fixed-point iterations. When $q$ is nonlinear, yet has a symmetric Jacobian at a fixed point, a slightly modified AA algorithm is proved to have an analogous root-linear convergence factor improvement over fixed-point iterations. Simulations verify our observations. Furthermore, experiments with different data models demonstrate AA is significantly superior to the standard fixed-point methods for Tyler's M-estimation.</description>

      <title>The ultimate upper bound on the injectivity radius of the Stiefel manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02079v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We exhibit conjugate points on the Stiefel manifold endowed with any member of the family of Riemannian metrics introduced by H\"uper et al. (2021). This family contains the well-known canonical and Euclidean metrics. An upper bound on the injectivity radius of the Stiefel manifold in the considered metric is then obtained as the minimum between the length of the geodesic along which the points are conjugate and the length of certain geodesic loops. Numerical experiments support the conjecture that the obtained upper bound is in fact equal to the injectivity radius.</description>
