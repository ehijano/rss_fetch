      <title>Asymptotic properties of PDEs in compact spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we combine the study of solutions of PDEs with the study of asymptotic properties of the solutions via compactification of the domain. We define new spaces of functions on which study the equations, prove a version of Ascoli-Arzel\`a Theorem, develop the fixed point index results necessary to prove existence and multiplicity of solutions in these spaces and also illustrate the applicability of the theory with an example.</description>

      <title>The large time asymptotics of nonlinear multichannel Schroedinger equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Schroedinger equation with a general interaction term, which is localized in space. The interaction may be x, t dependent and non-linear. Purely non-linear parts of the interaction are localized via the radial Sobolev embedding. Under the assumption of radial symmetry and boundedness in H1(R3) of the solution, uniformly in time. we prove it is asymptotic in L2 (and H1) in the strong sense, to a free wave and a weakly localized solution. The general properties of the localized solutions are derived. The proof is based on the introduction of phase-space analysis of the nonlinear dispersive dynamics and relies on a new class of (exterior) a priory propagation estimates. This approach allows a unified analysis of general linear time-dependent potentials and non-linear interactions.</description>

      <title>Waiting Time Solutions in gas dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we construct a continuum family of self-similar waiting time solutions for the one-dimensional compressible Euler equations for the adiabatic exponent $\ga\in(1,3)$ in the half-line with the vacuum boundary. The solutions are confined by a stationary vacuum interface for a finite time with at least $C^1$ regularity of the velocity and the sound speed up to the boundary. Subsequently, the solutions undergo the change of the behavior, becoming only H\"{o}lder continuous near the singular point, and simultaneously transition to the solutions to the vacuum moving boundary Euler equations satisfying the physical vacuum condition. When the boundary starts moving, a weak discontinuity emanating from the singular point along the sonic curve emerges. The solutions are locally smooth in the interior region away from the vacuum boundary and the sonic curve.</description>

      <title>Existence of weak solutions for nonlinear drift-diffusion equations with measure data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider nonlinear drift-diffusion equations (both porous medium equations and fast diffusion equations) with a measure-valued external force. We establish existence of nonnegative weak solutions satisfying gradient estimates, provided that the drift term belongs to a sub-scaling class relevant to $L^1$-space. If the drift is divergence-free, such a class is, however, relaxed so that drift suffices to be included in a certain supercritical scaling class, and the nonlinear diffusion can be less restrictive as well. By handling both the measure data and the drift, we obtain a new type of energy estimates. As an application, we construct weak solutions for a specific type of nonlinear diffusion equation with measure data coupled to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations.</description>

      <title>Blow-up of the one-dimensional wave equation with quadratic spatial derivative nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the blow-up dynamics of smooth solutions to the one-dimensional wave equation with a quadratic spatial derivative nonlinearity, motivated by its applications in Effective Field Theory (EFT) in cosmology. Despite its relevance, explicit blow-up solutions for this equation have not been documented in the literature. In this work, we establish the non-existence of smooth, exact self-similar blow-up solutions and construct a five-parameter family of generalized self-similar solutions exhibiting logarithmic growth. Moreover, we prove the asymptotic stability of these blow-up solutions.
  Our proof tackles several significant challenges, including the non-self-adjoint nature of the linearized operator, the presence of unstable eigenvalues, and, most notably, the treatment of non-compact perturbations. By substantially advancing Donninger's spectral-theoretic framework, we develop a robust methodology that effectively handles non-compact perturbations. Key innovations include the incorporation of the Lorentz transformation in self-similar variables, an adaptation of the functional framework in [Merle-Raphael-Rodnianski-Szeftel, Invent.Math., 2022], and a novel resolvent estimate. This approach is general and robust, allowing for straightforward extensions to higher dimensions and applications to a wide range of nonlinear equations.</description>

      <title>Notes on number of one-troughed travelling waves in asymmetrically supported bending beam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the boundary value problem for nonlinear fourth-order partial differential equation with jumping nonlinearity which can serve, e.g., as a model of an asymmetrically supported bending beam. We focus on a special type of solutions, the so-called one-troughed travelling waves. The main goal of this paper is to show the existence of at least two different one-troughed travelling waves for particular wave speeds and input parameters of the studied problem. We present the upper bounds for the maximal number of one-troughed solutions together with a visualisation of obtained results and corresponding solutions. Finally, we list several open questions regarding this topic.</description>

      <title>Regularity and structure of non-planar $p$-elasticae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove regularity and structure results for $p$-elasticae in $\mathbb{R}^n$, with arbitrary $p\in (1,\infty)$ and $n\geq2$. Planar $p$-elasticae are already classified and known to lose regularity. In this paper, we show that every non-planar $p$-elastica is analytic and three-dimensional, with the only exception of flat-core solutions of arbitrary dimensions.Subsequently, we classify pinned $p$-elasticae in $\mathbb{R}^n$ and, as an application, establish a Li--Yau type inequality for the $p$-bending energy of closed curves in $\mathbb{R}^n$. This extends previous works for $p=2$ and $n\geq2$ as well as for $p\in (1,\infty)$ and $n=2$.</description>

      <title>Integral representations of lower semicontinuous envelopes and Lavrentiev Phenomenon for non continuous Lagrangians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the functional $$F_\infty(u)=\int_{\Omega}f(x,u(x),\nabla u(x)) dx \quad\quad u\in \varphi+ W_0^{1,\infty}(\Omega,\mathbb{R})$$ where $\Omega$ is an open bounded Lipschitz subset of $\mathbb{R}^N$ and $\varphi\in W^{1,\infty}(\Omega)$. We do not assume neither convexity or continuity of the Lagrangian w.r.t. the last variable. We prove that, under suitable assumptions, the lower semicontinuous envelope of $F_\infty$ both in $\varphi+W^{1,\infty}(\Omega)$ and in the larger space $\varphi+W^{1,p}(\Omega)$ can be represented by means of the bipolar $f^{**}$ of $f$. In particular we can also exclude Lavrentiev Phenomenon between $W^{1,\infty}(\Omega)$ and $W^{1,1}(\Omega)$ for autonomous Lagrangians.</description>

      <title>Time-fractional gradient flows for nonconvex energies in Hilbert spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article is devoted to presenting an abstract theory on time-fractional gradient flows for nonconvex energy functionals in Hilbert spaces. Main results consist of local and global in time existence of (continuous) strong solutions to time-fractional evolution equations governed by the difference of two subdifferential operators in Hilbert spaces. To prove these results, fractional chain-rule formulae, a Lipschitz perturbation theory for convex gradient flows and Gronwall-type lemmas for nonlinear Volterra integral inequalities are developed. They also play a crucial role to cope with the lack of continuity (in time) of energies due to the subdiffusive nature of the issue. Moreover, the abstract theory is applied to the Cauchy-Dirichlet problem for some $p$-Laplace subdiffusion equations with blow-up terms complying with the so-called Sobolev (sub)critical growth condition.</description>

      <title>On the Resolution of Partial Differential Equations for Lattice Structures on Smooth Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the embedding of lattice structures $L \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ into smooth manifolds $M \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ through a rigorous mathematical framework. Building upon the foundational results established in "Embedding of a Discrete Lattice Structure in a Smooth Manifold," this work investigates the existence and solvability of partial differential equations (PDEs) governing the embedding process. The primary aim is to derive and analyze solutions to these PDEs while preserving the geometric and topological properties of $L$ and $M$.
  The solutions are shown to exist under initial boundary conditions, with the geometric structure of $M$ and the discrete topology of $L$ playing crucial roles in ensuring well-posedness and regularity.
  This paper provides a detailed exposition of the mathematical interplay between discrete and continuous spaces, offering novel insights into embedding theory and the geometry of manifolds interacting with discrete substructures.</description>

      <title>Low Mach number limit for the compressible Navier-Stokes equation with a stationary force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we are concerned with the low Mach number limit for the compressible Navier-Stokes equation with a stationary force and ill-prepared initial data in the three-dimensional whole space. The convergence result of the stationary solutions toward corresponding incompressible flow is obtained when a stationary force is small enough. Under the assumption that the initial perturbation around the stationary solution is small enough, the convergence result of the perturbation toward the corresponding perturbation around the stationary incompressible flow is obtained globally in time. The Strichartz type estimate for the linearized semigroup around the motionless state plays a crucial role in the proofs.</description>

      <title>Maximal estimates and pointwise convergence for solutions of certain dispersive equations with radial initial data on Damek-Ricci spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most celebrated problems in Euclidean Harmonic analysis is the Carleson's problem: determining the optimal regularity of the initial condition $f$ of the Schr\"odinger equation given by \begin{equation*} \begin{cases}
  i\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} -\Delta_{\mathbb{R}^n} u=0\:,\:\:\: (x,t) \in \mathbb{R}^n \times \mathbb{R}\:, \newline
  u(0,\cdot)=f\:, \text{ on } \mathbb{R}^n \:,
  \end{cases} \end{equation*} in terms of the index $\beta$ such that $f$ belongs to the inhomogeneous Sobolev space $H^\beta(\mathbb{R}^n)$ , so that the solution of the Schr\"odinger operator $u$ converges pointwise to $f$, $\displaystyle\lim_{t \to 0+} u(x,t)=f(x)$, almost everywhere. In this article, we address the Carleson's problem for the fractional Schr\"odinger equation, the Boussinesq equation and the Beam equation corresponding to both the Laplace-Beltrami operator $\Delta$ and the shifted Laplace-Beltrami operator $\tilde{\Delta}$, with radial initial data on Damek-Ricci spaces, by obtaining a complete description of the local (in space) mapping properties for the corresponding local (in time) maximal functions. Consequently, we obtain the sharp bound up to the endpoint $\beta \ge 1/4$, for (almost everywhere) pointwise convergence. We also establish an abstract transference principle for dispersive equations whose corresponding multipliers have comparable oscillation and also apply it in the proof of our main result.</description>

      <title>Derivation of effective gradient flow equations and dynamical truncation of training data in Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive explicit equations governing the cumulative biases and weights in Deep Learning with ReLU activation function, based on gradient descent for the Euclidean cost in the input layer, and under the assumption that the weights are, in a precise sense, adapted to the coordinate system distinguished by the activations. We show that gradient descent corresponds to a dynamical process in the input layer, whereby clusters of data are progressively reduced in complexity ("truncated") at an exponential rate that increases with the number of data points that have already been truncated. We provide a detailed discussion of several types of solutions to the gradient flow equations. A main motivation for this work is to shed light on the interpretability question in supervised learning.</description>

      <title>Conformal mapping Coordinates Physics-Informed Neural Networks (CoCo-PINNs): learning neural networks for designing neutral inclusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We focus on designing and solving the neutral inclusion problem via neural networks. The neutral inclusion problem has a long history in the theory of composite materials, and it is exceedingly challenging to identify the precise condition that precipitates a general-shaped inclusion into a neutral inclusion. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have recently become a highly successful approach to addressing both forward and inverse problems associated with partial differential equations. We found that traditional PINNs perform inadequately when applied to the inverse problem of designing neutral inclusions with arbitrary shapes. In this study, we introduce a novel approach, Conformal mapping Coordinates Physics-Informed Neural Networks (CoCo-PINNs), which integrates complex analysis techniques into PINNs. This method exhibits strong performance in solving forward-inverse problems to construct neutral inclusions of arbitrary shapes in two dimensions, where the imperfect interface condition on the inclusion's boundary is modeled by training neural networks. Notably, we mathematically prove that training with a single linear field is sufficient to achieve neutrality for untrained linear fields in arbitrary directions, given a minor assumption. We demonstrate that CoCo-PINNs offer enhanced performances in terms of credibility, consistency, and stability.</description>

      <title>Alexandrov-Fenchel type inequalities for hypersurfaces in the sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Alexandrov Fenchel inequality, a far-reaching generalization of the classical isoperimetric inequality to arbitrary mixed volumes, is fundamental in convex geometry. In $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$, it states: $\int_M\sigma_k d\mu_g \ge C(n,k)\big(\int_M\sigma_{k-1} d\mu_g\big)^{\frac{n-k}{n-k+1}}$. In \cite{Brendle-Guan-Li} (see also \cite{Guan-Li-2}), Brendle, Guan, and Li proposed a Conjecture on the corresponding inequalities in $\mathbb{S}^{n+1}$, which implies a sharp relation between two adjacent quermassintegrals: $\mathcal{A}_k(\Omega)\ge \xi_{k,k-1}\big(\mathcal{A}_{k-1}(\Omega)\big)$, for any $ 1\le k\le n-1$. This is a long-standing open problem. In this paper, we prove a type of corresponding inequalities in $\mathbb{S}^{n+1}:$ $\int_{M}\sigma_kd\mu_g\ge \eta_k\big(\mathcal{A}_{k-1}(\Omega)\big)$ for any $0\le k\le n-1$. This is equivalent to the sharp relation among three adjacent quermassintegrals for hypersurfaces in $\mathbb{S}^{n+1}$(see (\ref{ineq three})), which also implies a non-sharp relation between two adjacent quermassintegrals $\mathcal{A}_{k}(\Omega)\ge \eta_k\big(\mathcal{A}_{k-1}(\Omega)\big)$, for any $ 1\le k\le n-1$.</description>

Abstract: Inequalities for Riesz potentials are well-known to be equivalent to Sobolev inequalities of the same order for domain norms "far" from $L^1$, but to be weaker otherwise. Recent contributions by Van Schaftingen, by Hernandez, Rai\c{t}\u{a} and Spector, and by Stolyarov proved that this gap can be filled in Riesz potential inequalities for vector-valued functions in $L^1$ fulfilling a co-canceling differential condition. This work demonstrates that such a property is not just peculiar to the space $L^1$. Indeed, under the same differential constraint, a Riesz potential inequality is shown to hold for any domain and target rearrangement-invariant norms that render a Sobolev inequality of the same order true. This is based on a new interpolation inequality, which, via a kind of duality argument, yields a parallel property of Sobolev inequalities for any linear homogeneous elliptic canceling differential operator. Specifically, Sobolev inequalities involving the full gradient of a certain order share the same rearrangement-invariant domain and target spaces as their analogs for any other homogeneous elliptic canceling differential operator of equal order. As a consequence, Riesz potential inequalities under the co-canceling constraint and Sobolev inequalities for homogeneous elliptic canceling differential operators are offered for general families of rearrangement-invariant spaces, such as the Orlicz spaces and the Lorentz-Zygmund spaces. Especially relevant instances of inequalities for domain spaces neighboring $L^1$ are singled out.</description>

Abstract: Optimizing the free energy under a mass constraint may generate a convex crystal subject to assumptions on the potential $g(0)=0$, $g \ge 0$. The general problem classically attributed to Almgren is to infer if this is the case assuming the sub-level sets of g are convex. The theorem proven in the paper is that in one dimension the answer is positive.</description>

Abstract: We prove global existence of solutions of a loglog energy-supercritical Klein-Gordon equation for n=3,4,5. Assuming that blow-up occurs at a time of maximal existence, we perform an analysis close to this time in order to find a finite bound of a Strichartz-type norm, which eventually leads to a contraction with the blow-up assumption.</description>

      <title>Sufficient conditions yielding the Rayleigh Conjecture for the clamped plate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.06313v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Rayleigh Conjecture for the bilaplacian consists in showing that the clamped plate with least principal eigenvalue is the ball. The conjecture has been shown to hold in 1995 by Nadirashvili in dimension $2$ and by Ashbaugh and Benguria in dimension $3$. Since then, the conjecture remains open in dimension $d\geq 4$. In this paper, we contribute to answer this question, and show that the conjecture is true in any dimension as long as some special condition holds on the principal eigenfunction of an optimal shape. This condition regards the mean value of the eigenfunction, asking it to be in some sense minimal. This main result is based on an order reduction principle allowing to convert the initial fourth order linear problem into a second order affine problem, for which the classical machinery of shape optimization and elliptic theory is available. The order reduction principle turns out to be a general tool. In particular, it is used to derive another sufficient condition for the conjecture to hold, which is a second main result. This condition requires the Laplacian of the optimal eigenfunction to have constant normal derivative on the boundary. Besides our main two results, we detail shape derivation tools allowing to prove simplicity for the principal eigenvalue of an optimal shape and to derive optimality conditions. Eventually, because our first result involves the principal eigenfunction of a ball, we are led to compute it explicitly.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05369v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the effects of a domain deformation to the nodal set of Laplacian eigenfunctions when the eigenvalue is degenerate. In particular, we study deformations of a rectangle that perturb one side and how they change the nodal sets corresponding to an eigenvalue of multiplicity 2. We establish geometric properties, such as number of nodal domains, presence of crossings, and boundary intersections, of nodal sets for a large class of boundary deformations and study how these properties change along each eigenvalue branch for small perturbations. We show that internal crossings of the nodal set break under generic deformations and obtain estimates on the location and regularity of the nodal sets on the perturbed rectangle.</description>

Abstract: We prove the existence of an open set minimizing the first eigenvalue of the Dirichlet polylaplacian of order $m\geq1$ under volume constraint. Moreover, the corresponding eigenfunction is shown to enjoy $C^{m-1,\alpha}$ H\"older regularity. This is performed for dimension $2\leq d\leq 4m$. In particular, our analysis answers the question of the existence of an optimal shape for the clamped plate up to dimension $8$.</description>

      <title>Convergence Rate of Particle System for Second-order PDEs On Wasserstein Space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06013v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide a convergence rate for particle approximations of a class of second-order PDEs on Wasserstein space. We show that, up to some error term, the infinite-dimensional inf(sup)-convolution of the finite-dimensional value function yields a super (sub)-viscosity solution to the PDEs on Wasserstein space. Hence, we obtain a convergence rate using a comparison principle of such PDEs on Wasserstein space. Our argument is purely analytic and relies on the regularity of value functions established in \cite{DaJaSe23}.</description>

      <title>The Least Action Admissibility Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07191v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper provides a new admissibility criterion for choosing physically relevant weak solutions of the equations of Lagrangian and continuum mechanics when non-uniqueness of solutions to the initial value problem occurs. The criterion is motivated by the classical least action principle but is now applied to initial value problems which exhibit non-unique solutions. Examples are provided to Lagrangian mechanics and the Euler equations of barotropic fluid mechanics. In particular, we show the least action admissibility principle prefers the classical two shock solution to the Riemann initial value problem to certain solutions generated by convex integration. On the other hand, Dafermos's entropy criterion prefers convex integration solutions to the two shock solutions. Furthermore, when the pressure is given by $p(\rho)=\rho^2$, we show that the two shock solution is always preferred whenever the convex integration solutions are defined for the same initial data.</description>

      <title>A gentle invitation to the fractional world</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18238v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This book is intended as a self-contained introduction to selected topics in the fractional world, focusing particularly on aspects that arise in the study of equations driven by the fractional Laplacian.
  The scope of this work is not intended to be exhaustive or all-encompassing. We have chosen topics that we believe will appeal to readers embarking on their journey into fractional analysis. It requires only fundamental calculus and a basic understanding of measure theory.
  In Chapter 1, we introduce the primary object of study, the fractional Laplacian. This operator appears in diverse contexts, prompting multiple definitions and viewpoints, many of which we explore, along with some key identities.
  A notable distinction between local and nonlocal analysis is that in the latter, explicit calculations are often impractical or impossible. There are anyway some fortunate exceptions which are gathered in Chapter 2, providing useful and instructive examples.
  Chapter 3 presents an introduction to the important aspect of Liouville-type results.
  A large portion of this book is devoted to the regularity theory of solutions in Lebesgue spaces. Chapter 4 examines global solutions using Riesz and Bessel potential analysis, capturing the impact of both low and high frequencies on smoothness, decay, and oscillations. These spaces are also flexible enough to provide, as a byproduct, a solid regularity theory in the more commonly used fractional Sobolev spaces.
  In Chapter 5 we derive the corresponding interior regularity theory for solutions within a bounded domain using appropriate cutoffs and localization techniques.
  Additionally, technical appendices include auxiliary results used in key proofs.</description>

      <title>Existence of the planar stationary flow in the presence of interior sources and sinks in an exterior domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18474v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the paper, we consider the solvability of the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations in an exterior unit disk. On the boundary of the disk, the tangential velocity is subject to the perturbation of a rotation, and the normal velocity is subject to the perturbation of an interior sources or sinks. At infinity, the flow stays at rest. We will construct a solution to such problem, whose principal part admits a critical decay $O(|x|^{-1})$. The result is related to an open problem raised by V. I. Yudovich in [{\it Eleven great problems of mathematical hydrodynamics}, Mosc. Math. J. 3 (2003), no. 2, 711--737], where Problem 2b states that: {\em Prove or disprove the global existence of stationary and periodic flows of a viscous incompressible fluid in the presence of interior sources and sinks.} Our result partially gives a positive answer to this open in the exterior disk for the case when the interior source or sink is a perturbation of the constant state.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we investigate some isoperimetric-type inequalities related to the first eigenvalue of the fractional composite membrane problem. First, we establish an analogue of the renowned Faber-Krahn inequality for the fractional composite membrane problem. Next, we investigate an isoperimetric inequality for the first eigenvalue of the fractional composite membrane problem on the intersection of two domains-a problem that was first studied by Lieb [23] for the Laplacian. Similar results in the local case were previously obtained by Cupini-Vecchi [9] for the composite membrane problem. Our findings provide further insights into the fractional setting, offering a new perspective on these classical inequalities.</description>

Abstract: We obtain two-sided heat kernel estimates for Riemannian manifolds with ends with mixed boundary condition, provided that the heat kernels for the ends are well understood. These results extend previous results of Grigor'yan and Saloff-Coste by allowing for Dirichlet boundary condition. The proof requires the construction of a global harmonic function which is then used in the $h$-transform technique.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16742v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider nonparametric statistical inference on a periodic interaction potential $W$ from noisy discrete space-time measurements of solutions $\rho=\rho_W$ of the nonlinear McKean-Vlasov equation, describing the probability density of the mean field limit of an interacting particle system. We show how Gaussian process priors assigned to $W$ give rise to posterior mean estimators that exhibit fast convergence rates for the implied estimated densities $\bar \rho$ towards $\rho_W$. We further show that if the initial condition $\phi$ is not too smooth and satisfies a standard deconvolvability condition, then one can consistently infer Sobolev-regular potentials $W$ at convergence rates $N^{-\theta}$ for appropriate $\theta&gt;0$, where $N$ is the number of measurements. The exponent $\theta$ can be taken to approach $1/2$ as the regularity of $W$ increases corresponding to `near-parametric' models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10448v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce and study a family of self-adjoint realizations of the Laplacian in $L^2(\mathbb{R}^2)$ with a new type of transmission conditions along a closed bi-Lipschitz curve $\Sigma$. These conditions incorporate jumps in the Dirichlet traces both of the functions in the operator domains and of their Wirtinger derivatives and are non-local. Constructing a convenient generalized boundary triple, they may be parametrized by all compact hermitian operators in $L^2(\Sigma;\mathbb{C}^2)$. Whereas for all choices of parameters the essential spectrum is stable and equal to $[0, +\infty)$, the discrete spectrum exhibits diverse behaviour. While in many cases it is finite, we will describe also a class of parameters for which the discrete spectrum is infinite and accumulates at $-\infty$. The latter class contains a non-local version of the oblique transmission conditions. Finally, we will connect the current model to its relativistic counterpart studied recently in [L. Heriban, M. Tu\v{s}ek: Non-local relativistic $\delta$-shell interactions].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00947v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by a paper by T. Chakradhar, K. Gittins, G. Habib and N. Peyerimhoff, we analyze their conjecture that the ground state energy of the magnetic Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator tends to infinity as the magnetic field tends to infinity. More precisely, we prove refined conjectures for general two dimensional domains, based on the analysis in the case of the half-plane and the disk by two of us (B.H. and F.N.). We also extend our analysis to the three dimensional case, and explore a connection with the eigenvalue asymptotics of the magnetic Robin Laplacian.</description>
