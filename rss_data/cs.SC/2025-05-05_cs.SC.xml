      <title>Primality Testing via Circulant Matrix Eigenvalue Structure: A Novel Approach Using Cyclotomic Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel primality test based on the eigenvalue structure of circulant matrices constructed from roots of unity. We prove that an integer $n &gt; 2$ is prime if and only if the minimal polynomial of the circulant matrix $C_n = W_n + W_n^2$ has exactly two irreducible factors over $\mathbb{Q}$. This characterization connects cyclotomic field theory with matrix algebra, providing both theoretical insights and practical applications. We demonstrate that the eigenvalue patterns of these matrices reveal fundamental distinctions between prime and composite numbers, leading to a deterministic primality test. Our approach leverages the relationship between primitive roots of unity, Galois theory, and the factorization of cyclotomic polynomials. We provide comprehensive experimental validation across various ranges of integers, discuss practical implementation considerations, and analyze the computational complexity of our method in comparison with established primality tests. The visual interpretation of our mathematical framework provides intuitive understanding of the algebraic structures that distinguish prime numbers. Our experimental validation demonstrates that our approach offers a deterministic alternative to existing methods, with performance characteristics reflecting its algebraic foundations.</description>

      <title>SynPAT: A System for Generating Synthetic Physical Theories with Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated means for discovering new physical laws of nature, starting from a given background theory and data, have recently emerged and are proving to have great potential to someday advance our understanding of the physical world. However, the fact there there are relatively few known theories in the physical sciences has made the training, testing and benchmarking of these systems difficult. To address these needs we have developed SynPAT, a system for generating synthetic physical theories, comprising a set of consistent axioms, together with noisy data that are either good fits to the axioms, or good fits to a subset of the axioms. We give a detailed description of the inner workings of SynPAT and its various capabilities. We also report on our benchmarking of three recent open-source symbolic regression systems using our generated theories and data.</description>

      <title>Semi-Centennial REDUCE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a version of the REDUCE computer algebra system as it was in the early 1970s. We show how this historical version of REDUCE may be built and run in very modest present-day environments and outline some of its capabilities.</description>

      <title>Redundancy analysis using lcm-filtrations: networks, system signature and sensitivity evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the lcm-filtration and stepwise filtration, comparing their performance across various scenarios in terms of computational complexity, efficiency, and redundancy. The lcm-filtration often involves identical steps or ideals, leading to unnecessary computations. To address this, we analyse how stepwise filtration can effectively compute only the non-identical steps, offering a more efficient approach. We compare these filtrations in applications to networks, system signatures, and sensitivity analysis.</description>

      <title>A unified approach for degree bound estimates of linear differential operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03337v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We identify a common scheme in several existing algorithms addressing computational problems on linear differential equations with polynomial coefficients. These algorithms reduce to computing a linear relation between vectors obtained as iterates of a simple differential operator known as pseudo-linear map.
  We focus on establishing precise degree bounds on the output of this class of algorithms. It turns out that in all known instances (least common left multiple, symmetric product,. . . ), the bounds that are derived from the linear algebra step using Cramer's rule are pessimistic. The gap with the behaviour observed in practice is often of one order of magnitude, and better bounds are sometimes known and derived from ad hoc methods and independent arguments. We propose a unified approach for proving output degree bounds for all instances of the class at once. The main technical tools come from the theory of realisations of matrices of rational functions and their determinantal denominators.</description>
