      <title>Adaptive coupling of peridynamic and classical continuum mechanical models driven by broken bond/strength criteria for structural dynamic failure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Peridynamics (PD) is widely used to simulate structural failure. However, PD models are time-consuming. To improve the computational efficiency, we developed an adaptive coupling model between PD and classical continuum mechanics (PD-CCM) based on the Morphing method [1], driven by the broken bond or strength criteria. We derived the dynamic equation of the coupled models from the Lagrangian equation and then the discretized finite element formulation. An adaptive coupling strategy was introduced by determining the key position using the broken bond or strength criteria. The PD subdomain was expanded by altering the value of the Morphing function around the key position. Additionally, the PD subdomain was meshed by discrete elements (DEs) (i.e., nodes were not shared between elements), allowing the crack to propagate freely along the boundary of the DE. The remaining subdomains were meshed by continuous elements (CEs). Following the PD subdomain expansion, the CEs were converted into DEs, and new nodes were inserted. The displacement vector and mass matrix were reconfigured to ensure calculation consistency throughout the solving process. Furthermore, the relationship between the expansion radius of the PD subdomain and the speed of crack propagation was also discussed. Finally, the effectiveness, efficiency, and accuracy of the proposed model were verified via three two-dimensional numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Predicting Company Growth by Econophysics informed Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting company growth is crucial for strategic adjustment, operational decision-making, risk assessment, and loan eligibility reviews. Traditional models for company growth often focus too much on theory, overlooking practical forecasting, or they rely solely on time series forecasting techniques, ignoring interpretability and the inherent mechanisms of company growth. In this paper, we propose a machine learning-based prediction framework that incorporates an econophysics model for company growth. Our model captures both the intrinsic growth mechanisms of companies led by scaling laws and the fluctuations influenced by random factors and individual decisions, demonstrating superior predictive performance compared with methods that use time series techniques alone. Its advantages are more pronounced in long-range prediction tasks. By explicitly modeling the baseline growth and volatility components, our model is more interpretable.</description>

      <title>Scaling Analysis in a Multi-Energy System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a scaling study on the planning phase of a multi-energy system (MES), which is becoming increasingly prominent in the energy sector. The research aims to investigate the interactions and challenges associated with integrating heat and electrical systems and scaling their components. In this context, interaction between these two domains are investigated and the size of the distributed energy resources in the MES is scaled to examine the impact of sizing on the integrating networks and their controlling system. To achieve this, the paper uses sensitivity analysis and a meta-modeling technique, both incorporated in a toolbox for scaling analysis. These methodologies are validated through simulations, and the results obtained from the simulations can contribute to the advancement of MESs and their implementation in laboratory and field testing.</description>

      <title>From PDFs to Structured Data: Utilizing LLM Analysis in Sports Database Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) in processing semi-structured data from PDF documents into structured formats, specifically examining their application in updating the Finnish Sports Clubs Database. Through action research methodology, we developed and evaluated an AI-assisted approach utilizing OpenAI's GPT-4 and Anthropic's Claude 3 Opus models to process data from 72 sports federation membership reports. The system achieved a 90% success rate in automated processing, successfully handling 65 of 72 files without errors and converting over 7,900 rows of data. While the initial development time was comparable to traditional manual processing (three months), the implemented system shows potential for reducing future processing time by approximately 90%. Key challenges included handling multilingual content, processing multi-page datasets, and managing extraneous information. The findings suggest that while LLMs demonstrate significant potential for automating semi-structured data processing tasks, optimal results are achieved through a hybrid approach combining AI automation with selective human oversight. This research contributes to the growing body of literature on practical LLM applications in organizational data management and provides insights into the transformation of traditional data processing workflows.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Modeling and Vibration Analysis of Large Deployable Mesh Reflectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large deployable mesh reflectors are essential for space applications, providing precise reflecting surfaces for high-gain antennas used in satellite communications, Earth observation, and deep-space missions. During on-orbit missions, active shape adjustment and attitude control are crucial for maintaining surface accuracy and proper orientation for these reflectors, ensuring optimal performance. Preventing resonance through thorough dynamic modeling and vibration analysis is vital to avoid structural damage and ensure stability and reliability. Existing dynamic modeling approaches, such as wave and finite element methods, often fail to accurately predict dynamic responses due to the limited capability of handling three-dimensional reflectors or the oversimplification of cable members of a reflector. This paper proposes the Cartesian spatial discretization method for dynamic modeling and vibration analysis of cable-network structures in large deployable mesh reflectors. This method defines cable member positions as a summation of internal and boundary-induced terms within a global Cartesian coordinate system. Numerical simulation on a two-dimensional cable-network structure and a center-feed mesh reflector demonstrates the superiority of the proposed method over traditional approaches, highlighting its accuracy and versatility, and establishing it as a robust tool for analyzing three-dimensional complex reflector configurations.</description>

      <title>Toward path-invariant embeddings for local distance source characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work builds on recent advances in foundation models in the language and image domains to explore similar approaches for seismic source characterization. We rely on an architecture called Barlow Twins, borrowed from an understanding of the human visual cortical system and originally envisioned for the image domain and adapt it for learning path invariance in seismic event time series. Our model improves the performance on event characterization tasks such as source discrimination across catalogs by 10-12% and provides more reliable predictive uncertainty estimates. We suggest that dataset scale and diversity more than architecture may determine aspects of the current ceiling on performance. We leverage decision trees, linear models, and visualization to understanding the dependencies in learned representations.</description>

      <title>Towards Foundation Model for Chemical Reactor Modeling: Meta-Learning with Physics-Informed Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11752v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we present a novel application of foundation models for chemical reactor modeling. Accurate modeling of real-world chemical reactors through first-principles is often challenging, and the process of rebuilding and retraining models for each new chemical process is inefficient. This raises a critical question: can we develop a single, universal neural network (i.e., a foundation model) that can rapidly adapt to any new chemical process in a reactor? To address this, we propose a foundation model for chemical reactor modeling that employs a meta-learning approach, followed by physics-informed fine-tuning on new tasks with only a few data samples. Our model is designed to generalize across three classic reactor types: continuous stirred tank reactors, batch reactors, and plug flow reactors. Compared to conventional methods such as data-driven learning, physics-informed learning, transfer learning, and meta-learning, our approach demonstrates superior performance in few-shot scenarios. Specifically, it shows rapid adaptation to unseen reactions with varying integer orders across different reactor set-ups, requiring minimal data for fine-tuning.

      <title>Audio-visual cross-modality knowledge transfer for machine learning-based in-situ monitoring in laser additive manufacturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05307v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Various machine learning (ML)-based in-situ monitoring systems have been developed to detect anomalies and defects in laser additive manufacturing (LAM) processes. While multimodal fusion, which integrates data from visual, audio, and other modalities, can improve monitoring performance, it also increases hardware, computational, and operational costs due to the use of multiple sensor types. This paper introduces a cross-modality knowledge transfer (CMKT) methodology for LAM in-situ monitoring, which transfers knowledge from a source modality to a target modality. CMKT enhances the representativeness of the features extracted from the target modality, allowing the removal of source modality sensors during prediction. This paper proposes three CMKT methods: semantic alignment, fully supervised mapping, and semi-supervised mapping. The semantic alignment method establishes a shared encoded space between modalities to facilitate knowledge transfer. It employs a semantic alignment loss to align the distributions of identical groups (e.g., visual and audio defective groups) and a separation loss to distinguish different groups (e.g., visual defective and audio defect-free groups). The two mapping methods transfer knowledge by deriving features from one modality to another using fully supervised and semi-supervised learning approaches. In a case study for LAM in-situ defect detection, the proposed CMKT methods were compared with multimodal audio-visual fusion. The semantic alignment method achieved an accuracy of 98.7% while removing the audio modality during the prediction phase, which is comparable to the 98.2% accuracy obtained through multimodal fusion. Using explainable artificial intelligence, we discovered that semantic alignment CMKT can extract more representative features while reducing noise by leveraging the inherent correlations between modalities.</description>

      <title>FLAG: Financial Long Document Classification via AMR-based GNN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02024v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs) has initiated much research into their various financial applications. However, in applying LLMs on long documents, semantic relations are not explicitly incorporated, and a full or arbitrarily sparse attention operation is employed. In recent years, progress has been made in Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR), which is a graph-based representation of text to preserve its semantic relations. Since AMR can represent semantic relationships at a deeper level, it can be beneficially utilized by graph neural networks (GNNs) for constructing effective document-level graph representations built upon LLM embeddings to predict target metrics in the financial domain. We propose FLAG: Financial Long document classification via AMR-based GNN, an AMR graph based framework to generate document-level embeddings for long financial document classification. We construct document-level graphs from sentence-level AMR graphs, endow them with specialized LLM word embeddings in the financial domain, apply a deep learning mechanism that utilizes a GNN, and examine the efficacy of our AMR-based approach in predicting labeled target data from long financial documents. Extensive experiments are conducted on a dataset of quarterly earnings calls transcripts of companies in various sectors of the economy, as well as on a corpus of more recent earnings calls of companies in the S&amp;P 1500 Composite Index. We find that our AMR-based approach outperforms fine-tuning LLMs directly on text in predicting stock price movement trends at different time horizons in both datasets. Our work also outperforms previous work utilizing document graphs and GNNs for text classification.</description>

      <title>Quantformer: from attention to profit with a quantitative transformer trading strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00424v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In traditional quantitative trading practice, navigating the complicated and dynamic financial market presents a persistent challenge. Fully capturing various market variables, including long-term information, as well as essential signals that may lead to profit remains a difficult task for learning algorithms. In order to tackle this challenge, this paper introduces quantformer, an enhanced neural network architecture based on transformers, to build investment factors. By transfer learning from sentiment analysis, quantformer not only exploits its original inherent advantages in capturing long-range dependencies and modeling complex data relationships, but is also able to solve tasks with numerical inputs and accurately forecast future returns over a given period. This work collects more than 5,000,000 rolling data of 4,601 stocks in the Chinese capital market from 2010 to 2019. The results of this study demonstrated the model's superior performance in predicting stock trends compared with other 100 factor-based quantitative strategies. Notably, the model's innovative use of transformer-liked model to establish factors, in conjunction with market sentiment information, has been shown to enhance the accuracy of trading signals significantly, thereby offering promising implications for the future of quantitative trading strategies.</description>

      <title>A Simple Baseline for Predicting Events with Auto-Regressive Tabular Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10648v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many real-world applications of tabular data involve using historic events to predict properties of new ones, for example whether a credit card transaction is fraudulent or what rating a customer will assign a product on a retail platform. Existing approaches to event prediction include costly, brittle, and application-dependent techniques such as time-aware positional embeddings, learned row and field encodings, and oversampling methods for addressing class imbalance. Moreover, these approaches often assume specific use-cases, for example that we know the labels of all historic events or that we only predict a pre-specified label and not the data's features themselves. In this work, we propose a simple but flexible baseline using standard autoregressive LLM-style transformers with elementary positional embeddings and a causal language modeling objective. Our baseline outperforms existing approaches across popular datasets and can be employed for various use-cases. We demonstrate that the same model can predict labels, impute missing values, or model event sequences.</description>

      <title>On the potential of Optimal Transport in Geospatial Data Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11709v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Prediction problems in geographic information science and transportation are often motivated by the possibility to enhance operational efficiency and thereby reduce emissions. Examples range from predicting car sharing demand for relocation planning to forecasting traffic congestion for navigation purposes. However, conventional accuracy metrics ignore the spatial distribution of the errors, despite its relevance for operations. Here, we put forward a spatially aware evaluation metric and loss function based on Optimal Transport (OT). Our framework leverages partial OT and can minimize relocation costs in any spatial prediction problem. We showcase the advantages of OT-based evaluation over conventional metrics and further demonstrate the application of an OT loss function for improving forecasts of bike sharing demand and charging station occupancy. Thus, our framework not only aligns with operational considerations, but also signifies a step forward in refining predictions within geospatial applications.
