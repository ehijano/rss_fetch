      <title>Temporal and topological partitioning in real-world growing networks for scale-free properties study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a method to study evolution rules and scale-free hypothesis of real-world growing networks using natural partitions of nodes and edges based on temporal and topological attributes, and analyzing degree distributions.
  We apply this method to the Software Heritage dataset, which collects software releases and revisions from open-source communities.Nodes with native temporal information does not fully capture the overall network dynamics, and degree distributions show greater regularity with fewer outliers, suggesting a more likely scale-free regime when examining networks derived from temporal and topological partitions.
  However, underlying aging, fitness, and inheritance mechanisms, along with chosen partitioning, hinder definitive conclusions and suggest that the very common ``pure parametric power-law'' hypothesis for the tail of degree distributions is too strong. Node's type derived from partions and changes in evolution rules, shown by variations in the average number of new edges per node over time, highlight the need for tools better suited for studying transient regimes and ease comparison of real-world networks with minimal models.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal projections of hypercubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Projections of hypercubes have been applied for visualizing high-dimensional binary state spaces in various fields of sciences. Conventional methods for projecting hypercubes, however, face practical difficulties. Manual methods require nontrivial adjustments of the projection basis, while optimization methods impose limitations on the interpretation and reproducibility of the resulting plots. Here, we propose using principal component analysis (PCA) for projecting hypercubes, which offers an automated, interpretable, and reproducible solution. We reveal analytically and numerically that PCA effectively captures polarized distributions in the state space. The resulting distribution of projected vertices is shown to be asymptotically the standard Gaussian, a characteristic of high-dimensional orthogonal projections. This method is applied to visualize the hypercubic energy landscapes of Ising spin systems, where the biplots reveal the pathways involving correlated spin flips. Our work demonstrates the potential of PCA for discovering hidden patterns in high-dimensional binary data.</description>

      <title>Principled model selection for stochastic dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex dynamical systems, from macromolecules to ecosystems, are often modeled by stochastic differential equations (SDEs). To learn such models from data, a common approach involves decomposing the SDE into a linear combination of basis functions. However, this can induce overfitting due to the proliferation of parameters. To address this, we introduce Parsimonious Stochastic Inference (PASTIS), a principled method that removes superfluous parameters from SDE models by combining likelihood-estimation statistics with extreme value theory. We benchmark it against existing methods and show that it reliably selects the exact minimal models from large libraries of functions, even with a low sampling rate or measurement error. We show that it extends to stochastic partial differential equations and demonstrate applications to the inference of ecological networks and reaction-diffusion dynamics.</description>

      <title>Information Theory for Complex Systems Scientists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.12482v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the 21st century, many of the crucial scientific and technical issues facing humanity can be understood as problems associated with understanding, modelling, and ultimately controlling complex systems: systems comprised of a large number of non-trivially interacting components whose collective behaviour can be difficult to predict. Information theory, a branch of mathematics historically associated with questions about encoding and decoding messages, has emerged as something of a lingua franca for those studying complex systems, far exceeding its original narrow domain of communication systems engineering. In the context of complexity science, information theory provides a set of tools which allow researchers to uncover the statistical and effective dependencies between interacting components; relationships between systems and their environment; mereological whole-part relationships; and is sensitive to non-linearities missed by commonly parametric statistical models.
  In this review, we aim to provide an accessible introduction to the core of modern information theory, aimed specifically at aspiring (and established) complex systems scientists. This includes standard measures, such as Shannon entropy, relative entropy, and mutual information, before building to more advanced topics, including: information dynamics, measures of statistical complexity, information decomposition, and effective network inference. In addition to detailing the formal definitions, in this review we make an effort to discuss how information theory can be interpreted and develop the intuition behind abstract concepts like "entropy," in the hope that this will enable interested readers to understand what information is, and how it is used, at a more fundamental level.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Diffusion of Superparamagnetic Walkers with Tailored Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13960v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: From life sciences and ecology to quantum physics and finance, anomalous diffusion appears in countless complex systems as a signature of emergent transport properties beyond Brownian motion. Despite substantial theoretical progress, the experimental study of real-world systems exhibiting anomalous diffusion remains challenging due to an intrinsically elusive ground truth and the limited information contained in typical single trajectories. Here, unlike previous experimental systems, we demonstrate the controlled generation of two-dimensional trajectories with fully tailored statistics spanning the entire spectrum of anomalous diffusion, from subdiffusion to superdiffusion, and over statistically significant temporal and spatial scales (covering at least two decades). We achieve this feat by simultaneously tuning the step-length distribution and, critically, the velocity autocorrelation function of microscopic superparamagnetic colloidal walkers with magnetic fields during extended acquisitions. Supported by theoretical reasoning, fine control of these two quantities combined allows us to generate trajectories compatible with L\'evy walks and fractional Brownian motion with tailored anomalous diffusion exponents. We envisage our approach will offer a robust, controllable experimental framework for validating and advancing theoretical models, analysis techniques, and predictive tools to study anomalous diffusion in real-life phenomena. These include transport in physical and biological systems, animal movement, human ecology, and financial markets.</description>
