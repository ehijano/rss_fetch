      <title>UrgenGo: Urgency-Aware Transparent GPU Kernel Launching for Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancements in autonomous driving have introduced increasingly complex, real-time GPU-bound tasks critical for reliable vehicle operation. However, the proprietary nature of these autonomous systems and closed-source GPU drivers hinder fine-grained control over GPU executions, often resulting in missed deadlines that compromise vehicle performance. To address this, we present UrgenGo, a non-intrusive, urgency-aware GPU scheduling system that operates without access to application source code. UrgenGo implicitly prioritizes GPU executions through transparent kernel launch manipulation, employing task-level stream binding, delayed kernel launching, and batched kernel launch synchronization. We conducted extensive real-world evaluations in collaboration with a self-driving startup, developing 11 GPU-bound task chains for a realistic autonomous navigation application and implementing our system on a self-driving bus. Our results show a significant 61% reduction in the overall deadline miss ratio, compared to the state-of-the-art GPU scheduler that requires source code modifications.</description>

      <title>Ratio1 -- AI meta-OS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose the Ratio1 AI meta-operating system (meta-OS), a decentralized MLOps protocol that unifies AI model development, deployment, and inference across heterogeneous edge devices. Its key innovation is an integrated blockchain-based framework that transforms idle computing resources (laptops, smartphones, cloud VMs) into a trustless global supercomputer. The architecture includes novel components: a decentralized authentication layer (dAuth), an in-memory state database (CSTORE), a distributed storage system (R1FS), homomorphic encrypted federated learning (EDIL), decentralized container orchestration (Deeploy) and an oracle network (OracleSync), which collectively ensure secure, resilient execution of AI pipelines and other container based apps at scale. The protocol enforces a formal circular token-economic model combining Proof-of-Availability (PoA) and Proof-of-AI (PoAI) consensus. Compared to centralized heterogeneous cloud MLOps and existing decentralized compute platforms, which often lack integrated AI toolchains or trusted Ratio1 node operators (R1OP) mechanics, Ratio1's holistic design lowers barriers for AI deployment and improves cost-efficiency. We provide mathematical formulations of its secure licensing and reward protocols, and include descriptive information for the system architecture and protocol flow. We argue that our proposed fully functional ecosystem proposes and demonstrates significant improvements in accessibility, scalability, and security over existing alternatives.</description>
