      <title>Modeling Multiday Extreme Precipitation Across Eastern Australia: A Dynamical Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to illustrate new techniques for computing multiday extreme precipitation taken from recent theoretical advancements in extreme value theory in the framework of dynamical systems, using historical precipitation data along the eastern coast of Australia as a case study. We explore the numerical pitfalls of applying standard extreme value techniques to model multiday extremes. Then, we illustrate that our data conforms to the appropriate setting for the application of recently derived extreme value distributions for runs of extremes in the dynamical framework and adapt these to the non-stationary setting. Finally, we use these distributions to make more informed predictions on the return times and magnitudes of consecutive daily extreme precipitation and find changes in the dependence of increasing consecutive daily rainfall extremes on the Southern Oscillation Index. Although our case study is focused on extreme precipitation across eastern Australia, we emphasize that these techniques can be used to model expected returns and magnitudes of consecutive extreme precipitation events across many locations.</description>

      <title>Transferring climate change knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14780v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate and precise climate projections are required for climate adaptation and mitigation, but Earth system models still exhibit great uncertainties. Several approaches have been developed to reduce the spread of climate projections and feedbacks, yet those methods cannot capture the non-linear complexity inherent in the climate system. Using a Transfer Learning approach, we show that Machine Learning can be used to optimally leverage and merge the knowledge gained from Earth system models simulations and historical observations to more accurately project global surface air temperature fields in the 21st century. We reach an uncertainty reduction of more than 50% with respect to state-of-the-art approaches. We give evidence that our novel method provides narrower projection uncertainty together with more accurate mean climate projections, urgently required for climate adaptation.</description>
