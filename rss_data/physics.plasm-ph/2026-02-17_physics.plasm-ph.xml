      <title>Measurement of the laser pulse phase velocity in plasma channel for DLA optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a novel, direct method for measuring the phase velocity $v_{\phi}$ of an intense laser pulse within a plasma channel - the crucial parameter that controls the resonance condition in direct laser acceleration (DLA). The technique exploits the second harmonic (SH) radiation generated at the channel sheath - a phenomenon previously observed in laser-wakefield acceleration experiments. The SH emission angle is governed by a phase-matching condition that directly depends on $v_{\phi}$. Experimental measurements performed using a 1 TW, 10 Hz Ti:Sa laser system yield phase velocities in the range $v_{\phi}=(1.010-1.030)c$ for plasma electron densities in the range $n_e=(0.01-0.06)n_{cr}$. The diagnostic is validated through quasi-3D particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations that reproduce the experimental conditions. This work provides a way to optimize DLA schemes by enabling in-situ measurement of the laser pulse phase velocity in plasma channels.</description>

      <title>Asymmetry in laser wakefields driven by intense pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laser wakefield theories rely on the laser envelope function, which is radially symmetric, and predict zero transverse momentum for the electrons along the propagation axis. Exact description of laser wakefields, beyond the envelope approximation, requires a more general formula for the Lorentz force acting on the electrons. Here we present a fundamental approach to express the transverse momentum of an electron crossing the laser pulse, and we show that an exact analytical formula can be derived for the non-zero transverse momentum of electrons initially lying along the axis of symmetry. The results outlined here shed light on the details of the electron motion inside an intense laser pulse and explain the strong wakefield asymmetry observed in simulations.</description>

      <title>Data-driven modeling of shock physics by physics-informed MeshGraphNets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-resolution fluid simulations for plasma physics and astrophysics rely on Particle in cell (PIC) and hydrodynamic solvers (e.g., FLASH) to resolve shock dominated, multiscale phenomena, but their high computational cost severely limits scalability. This motivates the development of learning based surrogate models, which offer a promising route to accelerate these simulations while preserving physical fidelity. In this work, we study the Sedov Taylor shock propagation problem using a physics informed graph based surrogate model, Physics Informed MeshGraphNet (PhyMGN), designed for grid-based hydrodynamics. By incorporating weak physics constraints derived from the Euler equations using finite difference method, the model captures the self similar shock evolution and associated flow structures without explicitly solving the full hydrodynamic equations at each timestep. Comparing to the baseline MeshGraphNet model, PhyMGN is able to generalize beyond the training regime with a higher accuracy and preserves differentiability in parameter space while achieving a substantial reduction in computational cost relative to conventional numerical solvers.</description>

      <title>Leveling of MHD turbulence imbalance in shear flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence in plane shear flows with a streamwise background magnetic field in the super-Alfv\'enic regime. We show that the large-scale velocity shear suppresses turbulence imbalance, driving the system toward a balanced state -- the energies of counter-propagating Alfv\'en waves become essentially equal, even at initially perfectly imbalanced Alfv\'enic turbulence. This balancing is due to the shear-induced linear non-modal dynamics of Alfv\'en waves, including their transient growth and over-reflection. This linear route to balancing turbulence is new -- fundamentally different from nonlinear ones operative in shearless MHD turbulence -- and have direct implications for understanding balanced/imbalanced MHD turbulence in the solar wind, which is modeled as a shear flow in a thermodynamically complex plasma.</description>

      <title>Unprecedented Multipoint Observation of Spatially Varying ICME Turbulence of Different Ages during October 2024 Extreme Solar Storm at 1 AU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding turbulence in interplanetary coronal mass ejections is fundamental to space plasma research and critical for assessing the impact of space weather on geospace. Turbulence governs energy cascade, plasma heating, magnetic reconnection, and solar wind magnetosphere coupling, thereby influencing both ICME evolution and geoeffectiveness. While previous event-based and statistical studies have examined ICME turbulence and its radial evolution in great detail, no significant measurements of ICME magnetic turbulence at a specific vantage point have been made using multiple observatories separated azimuthally. Here, we present the first multipoint analysis of MHD turbulence across ICME plasma regions, using four spacecraft at the Sun-Earth L1 point, separated by 80 RE along the dawn-dusk direction. Previous studies reveal that ICME shocks, sheaths, and magnetic clouds are highly non-uniform, with strong azimuthal variability. Using high-resolution magnetic field observations from ISRO's Aditya-L1, NASA's Wind and ACE, and NOAA's DSCOVR, we analyze turbulence associated with the 10th October 2024 solar storm, which triggered the second-strongest geomagnetic storm of solar cycle 25. Our results reveal significant variability and differing turbulence maturity across small separations, supported by analysis of field-aligned and perpendicular magnetic field cascades, indicating strong anisotropies. Sheath turbulence is substantially modified by shock induced energy injection. Evidence of compressible turbulence and plasma energization at the flux rope interaction region indicates that internal processes, such as magnetic reconnection, strongly influence ICME plasma evolution, highlighting pronounced spatial variability in turbulence and plasma states observed by multiple L1 monitors near Earth and underscoring their potential role in space weather impacts.</description>

      <title>Hollow Beam Optical Ponderomotive Trap for Ultracold Neutral Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21065v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rapidly oscillating, inhomogeneous electromagnetic field from laser exert a force that repels charged particles from regions of high light intensity. We propose and analyze a flat-bottomed hollow-beam ponderomotive optical trap for an ultracold neutral plasma (UNP), driven by a high-power CO$_2$ laser. Molecular dynamics simulations show that the plasma and Rydberg atoms are effectively trapped within a nearly uniform dark region bounded by repulsive light walls. In contrast to RF traps, flat-bottomed traps yield a small density-weighted mean ponderomotive energy per electron, while the UNP collision frequency is far below the laser frequency, thereby making collisional absorption negligible and does not limit the lifetime of the trap. This approach could enhance antimatter production and storage.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Field Line Chaos, Cantori, and Turnstiles in Toroidal Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25047v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mathematical concepts of chaos, cartori, and turnstiles underlie a number of areas of tokamak and stellarator physics. Nevertheless, few authors have explicitly used these concepts in publications on fusion plasmas. The small number of plasma physicists who have an intuitive understanding of these concepts retards or blocks development in a number of areas: magnetic reconnection, the most important electromagnetic correction to what are called electrostatic micro-instabilities, non-resonant divertors in stellarators, disruptions and damage from runaway electrons in tokamaks. Physicists become interested in new mathematical concepts when they give insights into and solutions to practical problems. The importance of this review is not only in explaining chaos, cartori, and turnstiles as mathematical concepts but also in illustrating their significance through applications.</description>

      <title>An Adjoint Formulation of Energetic Particle Confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11968v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An adjoint formulation of energetic particle confinement in axisymmetric tokamak geometry is derived and evaluated using a physics-informed neural network (PINN). The PINN estimates the mean escape time of energetic ions by solving an inhomogeneous adjoint of the drift kinetic equation with a Lorentz collision operator, yielding predictions of fast ion loss in tokamak geometry due to direct ion orbit loss and collisional transport. To our knowledge, this is the first time a PINN has been used to solve the drift kinetic equation in tokamak geometry, a challenging problem due to the large time scale separation between the rapid transit time of energetic ions and their slow collisional time scale. It is shown that a careful and intentional design of a PINN is able to learn the mean escape time across the majority of the plasma volume, suggesting a path toward constructing a rapid surrogate for use within a broader optimization framework.</description>

      <title>Role of the radial electric field in the confinement of energetic ions in the Wendelstein 7-X stellarator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12969v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Good fast-ion confinement is an essential requirement for a fusion reactor. The magnetic configuration of the Wendelstein 7-X (W7-X) stellarator is partially optimized in this regard in a reactor-relevant scenario: it is expected to show improved fast-ion confinement when $\beta$ is high and the effect of the radial electric field is negligible. The experimental validation of this optimization is difficult since, with the available power, achieving high $\beta$ under appropriate conditions for the validation is challenging and the effect of the radial electric field is inevitable. In this work, the confinement of fast ions in W7-X has been studied numerically for a variety of scenarios via the ASCOT5 code. The effect of the radial electric field on fast-ion losses is confirmed to be equivalent to the one produced by $\beta$, and this is characterized by means of scans on both parameters. Through a preliminary study with experimentally-based profiles, a viable scenario is identified that takes advantage of this effect for the experimental validation of the optimization strategy of W7-X.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04596v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work shows that the interiors of perturbed zero-helicity vortices display simply connected topology with a crescent-shaped boundary. Flux surfaces in fluid and magnetic vortices were explored analytically, while particle trajectories in the context of plasma confinement were examined numerically, demonstrating the existence of both toroidal and simply connected topologies. This new topology appears for perturbations in a broad class, with amplitudes and spatial variance allowed to be arbitrarily small. A corollary of this work proves the closedness of field lines under odd-parity perturbations of zero-helicity vortices in full three dimensional context.</description>

      <title>Hypothesis of a bi-isotropic-like plasma permeating the interstellar space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15879v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the propagation of electromagnetic waves in a magnetized chiral plasma that pervades the interstellar space. The Maxwell equations, supplemented by bi-isotropic-like constitutive relations, are rewritten to describe a cold, uniform, and collisionless plasma model that yields new collective electromagnetic modes for distinct pairs of refractive indices associated with right- and left-handed circularly polarized waves. We have investigated the optical behavior through the rotatory power (RP) and dichroism coefficient, reporting that the finite chiral parameter induces double RP sign reversal, an exotic optical signature that takes place in chiral dielectrics and rotating plasmas. In the low-frequency regime, a modified propagating helicon with right-handed circular polarization is obtained. Next, supposing that the interstellar medium behaves as a chiral bi-isotropic-like cold plasma, we employ Astrophysical data of radio pulsars to achieve upper limits on the magnetoelectric parameters magnitude. In particular, by using dispersion measure and rotation measure data from five pulsars, we constrain the magnitude of the chiral parameter to the order of $10^{-16}$ and $10^{-22}$, respectively.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the Efficiency of Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory Calculations of Dynamic Response Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01875v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: X-ray Thomson scattering (XRTS) constitutes an essential technique for diagnosing material properties under extreme conditions, such as high pressures and intense laser heating. Time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) is one of the most accurate available ab initio methods for modeling XRTS spectra, as well as a host of other dynamic material properties. However, strong thermal excitations, along with the need to account for variations in temperature and density as well as the finite size of the detector significantly increase the computational cost of TDDFT simulations compared to ambient conditions. In this work, we present a broadly applicable method for optimizing and enhancing the efficiency of TDDFT calculations. Our approach is based on a one-to-one mapping between the dynamic structure factor and the imaginary time density--density correlation function, which naturally emerges in Feynman's path integral formulation of quantum many-body theory. Specifically, we combine rigorous convergence tests in the imaginary time domain with a constraints-based attenuation of narrow-band fluctuations to improve the efficiency of TDDFT modeling without the introduction of any significant bias. As a result, we can report a speed-up by up to an order of magnitude, thus substantially reducing the burden of computational cost required for XRTS analysis.</description>
