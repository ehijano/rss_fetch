      <title>Detecting dark matter sub-halos in the Galactic plane with the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerous observations confirm the existence of dark matter (DM) at astrophysical and cosmological scales. Theory and simulations of galaxy formation predict that DM should cluster on small scales in bound structures called sub-halos or DM clumps. While the most massive DM sub-halos host baryonic matter, less massive, unpopulated sub-halos could be abundant in the Milky Way (MW), as well and yield high-energy gamma rays as final products of DM annihilation. Recently, it has been highlighted that the brightest halos should also have a sizeable extension in the sky. In this study, we examine the prospects offered by the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO), a next-generation gamma-ray instrument, for detecting and characterizing such objects. Previous studies have primarily focused on high-latitude observations; here, we assess the potential impact of the CTAO's Galactic Plane Survey, which will provide unprecedentedly deep survey data for the inner five degrees of the Galactic plane. Our modeling accounts for tidal effects on the sub-halo population, examining the conditions under which DM sub-halos can be detected and distinguished from conventional astrophysical sources. We find that regions a few degrees above or below the Galactic plane offer the highest likelihood for DM sub-halo detection. For an individual sub-halo -- the brightest from among various realizations of the MW subhalo population -- we find that detection at the 5$\sigma$ level is achievable for an annihilation cross section of $\langle \sigma v \rangle \sim 3\times10^{-25}$ cm$^3$/s for TeV-scale DM annihilating into $b\bar{b}$. For a full population study, depending on the distribution and luminosity model of Galactic sub-halos, yet unconstrained cross sections in the range $\langle \sigma v \rangle \sim 10^{-23}-10^{-22}$ cm$^3$/s for TeV DM candidates are necessary for the brightest sub-halos to be detected.</description>

      <title>The cosmic evolution of FRBs inferred from CHIME/FRB Catalog 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Redshift and luminosity distributions are essential for understanding the cosmic evolution of extragalactic objects and phenomena, such as galaxies, gamma-ray bursts, and fast radio bursts (FRBs). For FRBs, these distributions are primarily estimated using the fluence and the Dispersion Measure (DM). Calibrating their joint distribution has been challenging due to a lack of accurate fluences in the intensity data of the CHIME/FRB survey. Using the baseband update of CHIME/FRB Catalog 1, we calibrate the 2D fluence-DM distribution for the first time. We find the energy distribution is described well by a Schechter function with power-law slope of $-1.94^{+0.14}_{-0.12}$. Testing two types of redshift evolution models suggests a likely combination of young and old formation channels. $31^{+31}_{-21}$\% of FRB sources may track star formation, or correspondingly, FRB sources may have delay times of $1.94^{+1.54}_{-1.31}$ Gyr. A pure star formation tracking population is excluded by only one model at $&gt; 2\sigma$ confidence. An updated cosmic star formation rate density evolution up to redshift 14 is constrained by compiling results from several JWST studies. Using this information, we expect next-generation radio telescopes to detect a few dozen bursts per year at $z \gtrsim 6$. A radio telescope with a system-equivalent flux density of $\leq 1$ Jy (equivalent to a detection threshold of 14 mJy ms) and instantaneous sky coverage of $\gtrsim 200$ square degrees should be able to detect $1.4^{+1.6}_{-1.0}\times 10^3$ FRBs year$^{-1}$ at $z \gtrsim 6$ and $234^{+250}_{-162}$ FRBs year$^{-1}$ at $z\gtrsim 8$, which is sufficient to differentiate between reionization histories.</description>

      <title>Observation of discontinuities in the periodic modulation of PSR B1828-11</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: PSR B1828-11 is a radio pulsar that undergoes periodic modulations (~500 days) of its spin-down rate and beam width, providing a valuable opportunity to understand the rotational dynamics of neutron stars. The periodic modulations have previously been attributed to planetary companion(s), precession, or magnetospheric effects and have several interesting features: they persist over 10 cycles, there are at least two harmonically related components, and the period is decreasing at a rate of about 5 days per cycle. PSR B1828-11 also experienced a glitch, a sudden increase in its rotation frequency, at 55 040.9 Modified Julian Day(MJD). By studying the interaction of the periodic modulations with the glitch, we seek to find evidence to distinguish explanations of the periodic modulation. Using a phenomenological model, we analyse a recently published open data set from Jodrell Bank Observatory, providing the longest and highest resolution measurements of the pulsar's spin-down rate data. Our phenomenological model consists of step changes in the amplitude, modulation frequency, and phase of the long-term periodic modulation and the usual spin-down glitch behaviour. We find clear evidence with a (natural-log) Bayes factor of 1486 to support that not only is there a change to these three separate parameters but that the shifts occur before the glitch. Finally, we also present model-independent evidence which demonstrates visually how and when the modulation period and amplitude change. Discontinuities in the modulation period are difficult to explain if a planetary companion sources the periodic modulations, but we conclude with a discussion on the insights into precession and magnetospheric switching.</description>

      <title>Chasing the Light: Shadowing, Collimation, and the Super-Eddington Growth of Infant Black Holes in JWST-Discovered AGNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have uncovered a substantial population of high-redshift broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGNs) characterized by moderate luminosities, weak X-ray emissions, and faint high-ionization lines, challenging conventional models of black hole growth and AGN activity. In this study, we propose that these sources are accreting at super-Eddington rates and use geometrically thick, non-advective disk models to investigate the critical roles of photon scattering, reflections, and shadowing within funnel-like structures along the disk's rotation axis. Our models predict highly collimated radiation fields, with isotropic-equivalent luminosities vastly exceeding the Eddington limit in polar directions, and significant suppression of emission at higher inclination angles due to shadowing. These effects result in altered spectral energy distributions and pronounced anisotropies in observable properties. Key features include ultra-blue UV continuum slopes (alpha=+0.5 to +0.8), bolometric correction factors varying by over an order of magnitude with orientation, and suppressed coronal X-ray emissions. The anisotropy and shadowing effects may also explain the observed faintness of broad high-ionization emission lines, as the viewing angle strongly modulates both continuum brightness and the illumination of the broad-line region. These findings indicate that super-Eddington accretion flows, shaped by thick disk geometries and anisotropic radiation fields, can naturally account for many puzzling features of JWST-discovered AGNs and provide new insights into black hole growth in the early universe.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the nature of donor stars of ULXs in NGC 1559</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray data provide insights into accretion processes and the compact objects of ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs), while optical and infrared (IR) observations help identify the donor star and surrounding environment. Together, these approaches shed light on the origins of the high X-ray luminosities observed in ULXs. This study examines the optical and infrared properties of eight ULXs in NGC 1559 using archival data from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). To constrain the nature of the donor stars of the ULXs, photometric results were obtained from the temporal, spectral energy distributions (SEDs), and color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs). Furthermore, the long-term and spectral characteristics of only a ULX X-1 were investigated. ULX counterparts were determined from astrometric calculations. The long-term light curves and SEDs were constructed to interpret the origin of the optical and IR emissions. The masses and ages of donor star candidates were determined using CMDs. To constrain the mechanism of X-ray emission, the time-averaged spectrum and long-term light curve of the X-1 were obtained. Unique optical and IR counterparts for ULXs X-14 and X-24 were determined, while only optical counterparts were detected for X-1 and X-18. Our findings indicate that the optical emission originates from the donor stars of X-14 and X-24, whereas for X-1 and X-18, it is dominated by the accretion disk. In addition, the X-1 exhibits long-term X-ray variability spanning orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>An in-depth study of Gamma rays from the Starburst Galaxy M 82 with VERITAS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assuming Galactic cosmic rays originate in supernovae and the winds of massive stars, starburst galaxies should produce very-high-energy (VHE; E$&gt;$100 GeV) gamma-ray emission via the interaction of their copious quantities of cosmic rays with the large reservoirs of dense gas within the galaxies. Such VHE emission was detected by VERITAS from the starburst galaxy M 82 in 2008-09. An extensive, multi-year campaign followed these initial observations, yielding a total of 254 h of good quality VERITAS data on M 82. Leveraging modern analysis techniques and the larger exposure, these VERITAS data show a more statistically significant VHE signal ($\sim$6.5 standard deviations ($\sigma$)). The corresponding photon spectrum is well fit by a power law ($\Gamma = 2.3 \pm 0.3_{stat} \pm0.2_{sys}$) and the observed integral flux is F($&gt;$450 GeV) = $(3.2 \pm0.6_{stat} \pm 0.6_{sys}) \times 10^{-13}~\mathrm{cm^{-2}~s}^{-1}$, or $\sim$0.4\% of the Crab Nebula flux above the same energy threshold. The improved VERITAS measurements, when combined with various multi-wavelength data, enable modeling of the underlying emission and transport processes. A purely leptonic scenario is found to be a poor representation of the gamma-ray spectral energy distribution (SED). A lepto-hadronic scenario with cosmic rays following a power-law spectrum in momentum (index $s\simeq 2.25$), and with significant bremsstrahlung below $1$~GeV, provides a good match to the observed SED. The synchrotron emission from the secondary electrons indicates that efficient non-radiative losses of cosmic-ray electrons may be related to advective escape from the starburst core.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Nuclear Equation of State of neutron star via high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillation in short gamma-ray bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The determination of the equation of state (EOS) of a neutron star (NS) and its maximum mass is very important for understanding the formation and properties of NSs under extreme conditions, but they remain open questions. Short-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are believed to originate from the merger of binary NSs or giant flares (GFs) of soft gamma-ray repeaters (SGRs). Recently, the high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) have been claimed to be identified from two short GRBs (931101B and 910711). In this paper, we propose that the observed high-frequency QPOs in these two short GRBs result from torsional oscillations in the GFs of SGRs associated with cold NSs, or from radial oscillations of hypermassive NSs (HMNSs) as the hot remnants of binary NS mergers, and then to constrain the EOS of NSs. For torsional oscillations, the six selected EOSs (TM1, NL3, APR, SLy4, DDME2, and GM1) of NSs suitable for the zero-temperature condition exhibit significant overlap in mass ranges, suggesting that we cannot constrain the EOS of NSs. For radial oscillations, the six selected EOSs (IUF, TM1, TMA, FSG, BHBLp, and NL3) of NSs suitable for the high-temperature condition cannot be ruled out when redshift is considered. However, it is found that the EOS can only be constrained if the redshift and temperature of the remnant can be measured.</description>

      <title>Variabilities driven by satellite black hole migration in AGN discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The physical origin of active galactic nucleus (AGN) variability remains unclear. Here we propose that the magnetic reconnection driven by the migration of satellite black holes (sBHs) in the AGN disc can be a new plausible mechanism for AGN short-term variability. During the sBH migration, the co-moving plasmas surrounding the sBH could influence the large-scale magnetic field of the AGN disk and trigger the magnetic reconnections to contribute to AGN UV/optical variability. Meanwhile, the plasma, which is accelerated by the magnetic reconnection, will successfully escape from the disc at Alfven velocity and cause a secondary magnetic reconnection in the corona. For a $\sim 10^{2}-10^{3}~{M_\mathrm{\odot}}$ sBH (including its binding gas) in the inner regions of the disc surrounding a supermassive black hole with $\sim 10^{7}~{M_\mathrm{\odot}}$, the reconnection process occurred in the space out of the disc can produce X-ray emission, which can last $\sim 10^4-10^6~\rm s$ with the luminosity $\sim 10^{39}- 10^{43}~\rm{erg ~s^{-1}}$.</description>

      <title>Thermal Conduction and Thermal-Driven Winds in Magnetized Viscous Accretion Disk Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the effects of saturated thermal conduction (TC) and thermal-driven winds (TDWs) on magnetized advection-dominated accretion onto a rotating black hole (BH). We incorporate dissipative processes in the magnetized accretion flow and expect the accretion disk to be threaded by predominantly toroidal and turbulent magnetic fields. We solve the magnetohydrodynamics equations and construct a self-consistent steady model of the magnetized accretion flow surrounding a rotating BH, which includes TC and TDWs. We seek global accretion solutions spanning from the BH horizon to a large distance and analyze the solution's characteristics as a function of dissipation parameters. Accretion solutions with multiple critical points may exhibit shock waves if they meet the standing shock criteria. We found steady, global transonic, and shocked accretion solutions around the rotating BH. In particular, the wind parameter ($m$) and the saturated conduction parameter ($\Phi_{\rm s}$) significantly influence the dynamical behavior of shocks. The shock location moves away from the BH horizon as $\Phi_{\rm s}$ and $m$ increase, assuming fixed conditions at the disk's outer edge. Our formalism explains the declining phase of BH outbursts, characterized by a monotonic decrease in QPO frequency as the burst decays. Based on our findings, we conclude that the combined effect of $\Phi_{\rm s}$ and $m$ parameters substantially alters the steady shock specific energy vs angular momentum parameter space and also modifies the corresponding post-shock luminosity vs QPO frequency parameter space. We propose, based on our theoretical model, that the $\Phi_{\rm s}$ and $m$ parameters may significantly influence the evolution of the BH outbursts.</description>

      <title>The promise of deep-stacking for neutrino astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos by IceCube has opened new windows for neutrino astronomy, but their sources remains largely unresolved. We study a methodology to address this - deep-stacking - that exploits correlations between observed neutrinos and comprehensive catalogs of potential source populations, including faint, high-redshift sources. By stacking signals from numerous weak sources and optimizing source weighting, significant gains in sensitivity can be achieved, particularly in the low-background regime where individual high-energy neutrinos dominate. We provide a semi-analytic framework to estimate sensitivity improvements for populations of sources under various background scenarios and redshift evolutions. Our analysis demonstrates that deep-stacking can increase detection sensitivity by a factor of 3 to 5, enabling detailed population studies. Furthermore, we discuss the potential to resolve the diffuse neutrino flux and investigate the redshift evolution of source populations. This approach offers a direct path toward identifying the primary sites of cosmic-ray acceleration and the mechanisms responsible for high-energy neutrino production.</description>

      <title>No evidence that the binary black hole mass distribution evolves with redshift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mass distribution of merging binary black holes is generically predicted to evolve with redshift, reflecting systematic changes in their astrophysical environment, stellar progenitors, and/or dominant formation channels over cosmic time. Whether or not such an effect is observed in gravitational-wave data, however, remains an open question, with some contradictory results present in the literature. In this paper, we study the ensemble of binary black holes within the latest GWTC-3 catalog released by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration, systematically surveying for possible evolution of their mass distribution with redshift. We specifically focus on two key features present in the binary black hole primary mass distribution -- (1) an excess of $35\,M_\odot$ black holes and (2) a broad power-law continuum ranging from 10 to $\gtrsim 80 M_\odot$ -- and ask if one or both of these features are observed to vary with redshift. We find no evidence that either the Gaussian peak or power-law continuum components of the mass distribution change with redshift. In some cases, we place somewhat stringent bounds on the degree of allowed redshift evolution. Most notably, we find that the mean location of the $35\,M_\odot$ peak and the slope of the power-law continuum are constrained to remain approximately constant below redshift $z\approx 1$. The data remain more agnostic about other forms of redshift dependence, such as evolution in the height of the $35\,M_\odot$ excess or the minimum and maximum black hole masses. In all cases, we conclude that a redshift-dependent mass spectrum remains possible, but that it is not required by current data.</description>

      <title>The flux of electron antineutrinos from supernova SN1987A data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By adopting a state-of-the-art parameterized model of electron antineutrino emission, we have made some steps forward in the analysis of the thermodynamical properties and temporal structure of neutrino emission from core collapse SN1987A. Our analysis, unlike similar previous ones, takes into account the times, energies and angles of arrival of the detected events in a reliable framework which includes a finite ramp in the initial stage of the neutrino emission. The existence of the accretion phase is confirmed with a confidence level of about 99%, and the neutrons involved in the emission during accretion, for the first time, do not show significant tensions with expectations, being about 0.02 $M_\odot$. We determine the parameters of the cooling emission and discuss its duration, that compares well with theoretical expectations. We estimate the delay times between the first neutrino and the first event in the detectors. The goodness of fit checks, performed on the temporal, energy and angular distributions, show that the flux resulting from the best-fit analysis is compatible with the observed data.</description>

      <title>Evolution of SMBHs in light of PTA measurements: implications for growth by mergers and accretion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the growth of supermassive black holes accounting for both accretion and mergers. The former is informed by observations of the quasar luminosity function (QLF) and the latter by the gravitational wave-background (GWB) recently detected by PTAs, while estimates of the present-day black hole mass function provide a boundary condition. The GWB is dominated by the most massive black holes ($\gtrsim10^{9}M_{\odot}$). We show that their evolution can be simplified into a two-step process: mergers dominate at $z\leq1$, while accretion peaks at $1.4\leq z\leq2$. The large amplitude of the observed GWB suggests a significant number of mergers. We show that this generically implies a higher average Eddington ratio for quasars relative to a scenario in which mergers are negligible. In the absence of mergers, matching local estimates of BH abundance to the QLF implies a radiative efficiency $\epsilon_r=0.12$ and Eddington ratio $\lambda=0.2$. With mergers, a progenitor of mass $M_i$ is boosted to a final total mass $M_f$ and there is a direct relation between the mass gained in mergers and the average Eddington ratio of the quasar population, given by $M_f/M_i\sim\lambda/0.2$. There is thus a tension between the observed GWB, quasar properties, and the BH mass function: estimates of the mass function consistent with Eddington ratios inferred in quasars and $\epsilon_r\sim0.1$ underpredict the GWB; multiple/equal mass mergers can boost the GWB, but lead to a high Eddington ratio. If the local mass function is on the high end of current estimates, the GWB is more readily explained, but requires low efficiencies $\epsilon_r\sim10^{-2}$ not expected in standard luminous accretion models. The significant merger rate implied by the GWB also strongly suggests that the most massive BHs in the local universe have significant spin due to the orbital angular momentum from mergers, perhaps $a\sim0.5$.</description>

      <title>Environmental effects in extreme mass ratio inspirals: perturbations to the environment in Kerr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Future gravitational wave observatories open a unique avenue to study the environments surrounding black holes. Intermediate or extreme mass ratio inspirals will spend thousands to millions of cycles in the sensitivity range of detectors, allowing subtle environmental effects to accumulate in the gravitational waveform. Working in Lorenz gauge and considering equatorial circular orbits, we present the first self-consistent, fully relativistic calculation of a perturbation to a black hole environment due to an inspiraling secondary in the Kerr geometry. As an example case, we consider the environment to be that of a superradiantly grown scalar cloud, though our framework is generalizable to other scenarios. We demonstrate that the scalar field develops a rich wake structure induced by the secondary and compute scalar fluxes emitted to infinity and through the horizon. Relative differences in the fluxes compared to Schwarzschild are tens of percent on large intervals of parameter space, underscoring the importance of modeling in Kerr.</description>

      <title>So long Kolmogorov: the forward and backward turbulence cascades in a supernovae-driven, multiphase interstellar medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interstellar medium (ISM) of disk galaxies is turbulent, and yet the fundamental nature of ISM turbulence, the energy cascade, is not understood in detail. In this study, we use high-resolution simulations of a hydrodynamical, gravitationally stratified, supernova (SNe)-driven, multiphase ISM to probe the nature of a galactic turbulence cascade. Through the use of kinetic energy flux transfer functions split into interactions between compressible $\mathbf{u}_c$ and incompressible $\mathbf{u}_s$ modes, we show that there exists a large-to-small-scale cascade in both $\mathbf{u}_c$ and $\mathbf{u}_s$ when mediated by an additional $\mathbf{u}_s$ mode. But the $\mathbf{u}_s$ cascade is highly non-local. Moreover, there is a $\mathbf{u}_c$ mediated component of the $\mathbf{u}_s$ cascade that proceeds in the opposite direction -- an inverse cascade from small-to-large scales. The cascade feeds flux into scales well beyond the scale height, energizing the winds and fueling the direct cascades. Both the strongly non-local and the inverse $\mathbf{u}_s$ cascades happen on scales that have a power law $\mathbf{u}_s$ energy spectrum, highlighting how degenerate the spectrum is to the true underlying physical processes. We directly show that the inverse cascade comes from $\mathbf{u}_s$ modes interacting with expanding SNe remnants (SNRs) and that $\mathbf{u}_s$ modes are generated to leading order via baroclinic, highly corrugated cooling layers between warm $(T\lesssim 10^4\,\rm{K})$ and hot $(T\gg10^4\,\rm{K})$ gas in these SNRs. Finally, we outline a complete phenomenology for SNe-driven turbulence in a galactic disk, estimate a $10^{-16}\,\rm{G}$ Biermann field generated from SNR cooling layers, and highlight the strong deviations that SNe-driven turbulence has from the conventional Kolmogorov model.</description>

      <title>Black hole with global monopole charge in self-interacting Kalb-Ramond field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we explore a static, spherically symmetric black hole solution in the context of a self-interacting Kalb-Ramond field coupled with a global monopole. By incorporating the effects of Lorentz-violating term $\ell$ and the monopole charge $\eta$ in the KR field, we derive the modified gravitational field equations and analyze the resulting black hole spacetime. The obtained solution exhibits deviations from the Schwarzschild metric with topological defect, as it is influenced by the monopole charge and self-interaction potential. We investigate the thermodynamic properties of the black hole, including its Hawking temperature, entropy, and specific heat, revealing novel stability conditions. Additionally, we perform solar system tests such as perihelion precession, gravitational redshift, light deflection, and time delay of signals to impose constraints on the Lorentz-violating parameter and monopole charge. Our findings suggest that these parameters have to be significantly small, although there are different constraints imposed by individual tests, ranging from $10^{-9}\leq|\ell|\leq 10^{-4}$ and $10^{-9}\leq\eta\leq 10^{-6}\, \mathrm{m}^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes Formed during Magneto-Hydrodynamic Turbulence in Early Universe as Dominant Part of Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBH) offer a compelling candidate for dark matter. Within the framework of the Standard Model, the production of PBHs through well-tested physical processes is highly worthy of investigations. This work highlights the role of turbulences in the very early universe in sustaining intense and persistent fluctuations of energy or mass density, which could provide a natural mechanism for PBH formations in the primordial universe. We analyze the abundance and mass range of PBHs produced by the magnetohydrodynamic turbulence induced by the first-order electroweak phase transition, and, remarkably, without invoking any new physics beyond the Standard Model, we find that the mass range of the produced PBHs falls within the only allowed ``asteroid mass'' window from current joint observations, and their abundance constitutes approximately 20\% of the total mass and energy of the universe. These findings strongly suggest that PBHs produced by the magnetohydrodynamic turbulence in the early universe could comprise the dominant part of dark matter.</description>

      <title>A data-driven approach for extracting tidal information from neutron star binary mergers observed with the Einstein Telescope</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent breakthroughs regarding the detection of compact binary mergers via gravitational waves opened up a new window to the Universe. Gravitational-wave models have been essential to this success since they are necessary to infer the properties of the compact binary system from the observational data. Next-generation detectors, such as the Einstein Telescope, will allow for more observations of binary neutron star mergers with higher precision, making accurate waveform models crucial in describing these systems. In this article, we propose a novel approach for constructing phenomenological waveform models informed by observational data. Using mock data representing a one-year operation of the Einstein Telescope as our baseline, we demonstrate how the results improve as more events are included in the calibration. This method offers a new and complementary approach for developing sophisticated gravitational-wave models compared to classical techniques that employ analytical computations and numerical-relativity simulations. Improved waveform models will then yield more accurate parameter estimation.</description>

      <title>Prospects for the detection of Dark Matter with Long-lived Mediators in the Sun using the Southern Wide-field Gamma-ray Observatory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07489v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The operation of the next generation of gamma-ray observatories will lead to a great advance in dark matter searches. In this paper, we use the hidden sectors hypothesis within the so-called secluded models to calculate the capabilities of the Southern Wide-field Gamma-ray Observatory (SWGO) to detect gamma-ray signatures produced by dark matter particles concentrated in the Sun. We assume the dark matter particle annihilates into metastable mediators which decay into $\gamma\gamma$, $e^+e^-$, $\tau^+\tau^-$, and $\bar{b}b$ outside the Sun. We found that the SWGO will be able to probe a spin-dependent cross-section of about $10^{-46}$ cm$^2$ for dark matter masses smaller than 5 TeV. This result shows an unprecedented sensitivity surpassing the current instruments by more than one order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Cyclical accretion regime change in the slow X-ray pulsar 4U 0114+65 observed with Chandra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08702v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 4U 0114+65 is a high-mass X-ray binary system formed by the luminous supergiant B1Ia, known as V{*} V662 Cas, and one of the slowest rotating neutron stars (NS) with a spin period of about 2.6 hours. This fact provides a rare opportunity to study interesting details of the accretion within each individual pulse of the compact object. In this paper, we analyze 200 ks of Chandra grating data, divided into 9 uninterrupted observations around the orbit. The changes in the circumstellar absorption column through the orbit suggest an orbital inclination of $\sim$ $40^{\circ}$ with respect to the observer and a companion mass-loss rate of $\sim$ 8.6 10$^{-7}$ solar masses yr$^{-1}$. The peaks of the NS pulse show a large pulse-to-pulse variability. Three of them show an evolution from a brighter regime to a weaker one. We propose that the efficiency of Compton cooling in this source fluctuates throughout an accumulation cycle. After significant depletion of matter within the magnetosphere, since the settling velocity is $\sim \times$ 2 times lower than the free-fall velocity, the source gradually accumulates matter until the density exceeds a critical threshold. This increase in density triggers a transition to a more efficient Compton cooling regime, leading to a higher mass accretion rate and consequently to an increased brightness.</description>

      <title>Fundamental MHD scales -- II: the kinematic phase of the supersonic small-scale dynamo</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.17036v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many astrophysical small-scale dynamos (SSDs) amplify weak magnetic fields via highly compressible, supersonic turbulence, but established SSD theories have overlooked these compressible effects. To address this, we perform visco-resistive SSD simulations across a range of sonic Mach numbers ($\mathcal{M}$), hydrodynamic Reynolds numbers ($\mathrm{Re}$), and magnetic Prandtl numbers ($\mathrm{Pm}$). We develop robust methods to measure kinetic and magnetic energy dissipation scales ($\ell_\nu$ and $\ell_\eta$) and the scale of strongest magnetic fields ($\ell_\mathrm{p}$) during the kinematic phase. We demonstrate that $\ell_\nu/\ell_\eta \sim \mathrm{Pm}^{1/2}$ is a universal feature for $\mathrm{Pm} \geq 1$ SSDs, regardless of $\mathcal{M}$ or $\mathrm{Re}$. Incompressible SSDs (either $\mathcal{M} \leq 1$ or $\mathrm{Re} &lt; \mathrm{Re}\mathrm{crit} \approx 100$) concentrate magnetic energy at $\ell_\mathrm{p} \sim \ell_\eta$ with inversely correlated field strength and curvature. However, for compressible SSDs ($\mathcal{M} &gt; 1$ and $\mathrm{Re} &gt; \mathrm{Re}\mathrm{crit}$), shocks concentrate magnetic energy in large structures with $\ell_\mathrm{p} \sim (\ell_\mathrm{turb} / \ell_\mathrm{shock})^{1/3} \ell_\eta \gg \ell_\eta$, where $\ell_\mathrm{shock}$ is the characteristic shock width, and $\ell_\mathrm{turb}$ is the outer scale of the turbulent field. In this regime, magnetic field-line curvature becomes nearly independent of field strength. These results have implications for galaxy mergers and cosmic ray transport models in the interstellar medium.</description>

      <title>The conceptual design of the 50-meter Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18645v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The submillimeter and millimeter ((sub-)mm) sky contains a vast wealth of information that is both complementary and inaccessible to other wavelengths. Over half the light we receive is observable at (sub-)mm wavelengths, yet we have mapped only a small portion of the sky at sufficient spatial resolution and sensitivity to detect and resolve distant galaxies or star forming cores within their large-scale environments. For decades the astronomical community has highlighted the need for a large, high-throughput (sub-)mm ($\lambda\sim 0.35-10$ mm) single dish. The Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST), with its 50-m aperture and $2^\circ$ maximal field of view, aims to be such a facility. We present here the preliminary design concept for AtLAST, developed through an EU Horizon 2020-funded design study. Our design approach begins with a long lineage of (sub-)mm telescopes, relies on calculations and simulations to realize the optics, and uses finite element analysis to optimize the designs for the mechanical structure and subsystems. The demanding technical requirements for AtLAST, set by transformative science goals, have motivated the design effort to combine novel concepts with lessons learned from the past experience of previous efforts. The result is an innovative rocking chair design with six instrument bays, two of which are mounted on Nasmyth platforms, inside a large receiver cabin. Ultimately, AtLAST aims to achieve a surface accuracy of $\leq 20~\mu$m root mean square half wavefront error, corresponding a Ruze efficiency $&gt;50\%$ at 950~GHz. We conclude that closed-loop metrology of the active primary surface will likely be required to achieve our surface accuracy goal. In the next phase of the project, we will prototype and test such metrology on existing platforms, with a goal of delivering a mature, construction-ready design by the end of this decade.</description>

      <title>The anti-aligned spin of GW191109: glitch mitigation and its implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03912v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With a high total mass and an inferred effective spin anti-aligned with the orbital axis at the 99.9% level, GW191109 is one of the most promising candidates for a dynamical formation origin among gravitational wave events observed so far. However, the data containing GW191109 are afflicted with terrestrial noise transients, i.e., detector glitches, generated by the scattering of laser light in both LIGO detectors. We study the implications of the glitch(es) on the inferred properties and astrophysical interpretation of GW191109. Using time- and frequency-domain analysis methods, we isolate the critical data for spin inference to 35 - 40 Hz and 0.1 - 0.04 s before the merger in LIGO Livingston, directly coincident with the glitch. Using two models of glitch behavior, one tailored to slow scattered light and one more generic, we perform joint inference of the glitch and binary parameters. When the glitch is modeled as slow scattered light, the binary parameters favor anti-aligned spins, in agreement with existing interpretations. When more flexible glitch modeling based on sine-Gaussian wavelets is used instead, a bimodal aligned/anti-aligned solution emerges. The anti-aligned spin mode is correlated with a weaker inferred glitch and preferred by ~ 70 : 30 compared to the aligned spin mode and a stronger inferred glitch. We conclude that if we assume that the data are only impacted by slow scattering noise, then the anti-aligned spin inference is robust. However, the data alone cannot validate this assumption and resolve the anti-aligned spin and potentially dynamical formation history of GW191109.</description>

      <title>Black-Hole Cartography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13935v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quasinormal modes (QNMs) are usually characterized by their time dependence; oscillations at specific frequencies predicted by black hole (BH) perturbation theory. QNMs are routinely identified in the ringdown of numerical relativity waveforms, are widely used in waveform modeling, and underpin key tests of general relativity and of the nature of compact objects; a program sometimes called BH spectroscopy. Perturbation theory also predicts a specific spatial shape for each QNM perturbation. For the Kerr metric, these are the ($s=-2$) spheroidal harmonics. Spatial information can be extracted from numerical relativity by fitting a feature with known time dependence to all of the spherical harmonic modes, allowing the shape of the feature to be reconstructed; a program initiated here and that we call BH cartography. Accurate spatial reconstruction requires fitting to many spherical harmonics and is demonstrated using highly accurate Cauchy-characteristic numerical relativity waveforms. The loudest QNMs are mapped, and their reconstructed shapes are found to match the spheroidal harmonic predictions. The cartographic procedure is also applied to the quadratic QNMs -- nonlinear features in the ringdown -- and their reconstructed shapes are compared with expectations based on second-order perturbation theory. BH cartography allows us to determine the viewing angles that maximize the amplitude of the quadratic QNMs, an important guide for future searches, and is expected to lead to an improved understanding of nonlinearities in BH ringdown.</description>

Abstract: Compact binaries on eccentric orbits are another class of gravitational-wave (GW) sources that can provide a wealth of information on binary formation pathways and astrophysical environments. However, historically, eccentricity is often neglected in modelled GW searches for compact binaries. We show that currently used modelled searches that employ quasi-circular template banks are highly ineffectual in detecting binary neutron star (BNS) and neutron star--black hole (NSBH) systems with orbital eccentricities in the range of $[10^{-5},0.15]$ at a GW frequency of $15$Hz. For populations of moderately eccentric BNS and NSBH binaries with (anti-)aligned component spins, we demonstrate that quasi-circular template banks fail to detect up to $\sim 40\%$ of such systems. To alleviate these inefficiencies, we develop the first \emph{geometric} template bank for the search of BNSs and NSBH binaries that includes masses, (anti-)aligned spins and moderate eccentricity. Utilising the post-Newtonian inspiral waveform {\tt TaylorF2Ecc} and a global coordinate transformation, we construct a globally flat metric to efficiently place eccentric templates. Our geometric template bank is highly effectual, and significantly improves the recovery of eccentric signals with less than $6\%$ of signals missed due to the finite template spacing in the bank.</description>

      <title>Geometric distances between closed universes</title>

Abstract: The large-scale structure of the Universe is well approximated by the Friedmann equations, parametrized by several energy densities which can be observationally inferred. A natural question to ask is: How different would the Universe be if these densities took on other values? While there are many ways this can be approached depending on interpretation and mathematical rigor, we attempt an answer by building a "history space" of different cosmologies. A metric is introduced after overcoming technical hurdles related to Lorentzian signature and infinite volume, at least for topologically closed cases. Geodesics connecting two points on the superspace are computed to express how distant--in a purely geometric sense--two universes are. Age can be treated as a free parameter in such an approach, leading to a more general mathematical construct relative to geometrodynamical configuration space. Connections to bubble inflation and phase transitions are explored.</description>

      <title>New insights into the proton precipitation sites in solar flares</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11490v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectrocopy Imager (RHESSI) $\gamma$-ray observations of the extraordinary GOES X25 flare SOL2003-10-28T11:10 are revisited to investigate previously reported conclusions that flare-accelerated electrons and protons precipitate along spatially separated flare loops. In contrast to previous works which reconstructed 2.223 MeV images over extended time periods ($\sim$20 minutes), we selected shorter integration times of the order of 2 to 3 minutes. Using simulations of the 2.223 MeV profile in combination with observations of the prompt $\gamma$-ray lines from the INTEGRAL mission, we obtain two separated integration time ranges representing the peak of the flare and the start of the decay, respectively. The resulting $\gamma$-ray images are then compared to GONG white-light (WL) observations to identify where along the flaring ribbons electrons and protons precipitation occurs. We point out that previously reported results comparing RHESSI hard X-ray (HXR) and $\gamma$-ray images only hold if the relative time evolution in the two energy ranges is the same. As the decay times for the 28 October 2003 is different at the considered two energy ranges (200-300 keV and around 2.223 MeV), the previously published conclusion that electrons and protons precipitate at different locations is an overstatement. Using shorter integration times reveals that the $\gamma$-ray and HXR sources spatially coincide with the WL flare ribbons. Our key conclusion is that electron and proton precipitation sites coincide with the flare ribbons, suggesting that the electron and proton precipitation sites are the same, at least within RHESSI's imaging capabilities. This result solves the twenty-years-long mystery around the previously reported different electron and proton precipitation sites.</description>

      <title>Mining the time axis with TRON. I. Millisecond pulsars in Omega Centauri, Terzan 5 and 47 Tucanae detected through MeerKAT interferometric imaging</title>

Abstract: Medium-timescale (minutes to hours) radio transients are a relatively unexplored population. The wide field-of-view and high instantaneous sensitivity of instruments such as MeerKAT provides an opportunity to probe this class of sources, using image-plane detection techniques. We aim to systematically mine archival synthesis imaging data in order to search for medium-timescale transients and variables that are not detected by conventional long-track image synthesis techniques. We deploy a prototype blind transient and variable search pipeline named TRON. This processes calibrated visibility data, constructs high-time cadence images, performs a search for variability on multiple timescales, and extracts lightcurves for detected sources. As proof of concept, we apply it to three MeerKAT observations of globular clusters, known to host transient or variable sources. We detect a previously known eclipsing MSP suspected to be a `black widow' system, in the globular cluster Omega Centauri, with a light curve confirming the eclipsing nature of the emission. We detect a previously known `red back' eclipsing MSP in the globular cluster Terzan 5. Using observations of the globular cluster 47 Tucanae, we detect two known millisecond pulsars (MSPs), and one previously reported MSP candidate, with hints of eclipsing behaviour.</description>

Abstract: Medium-timescale (minutes to hours) radio transients are a relatively unexplored population. The wide field-of-view and high instantaneous sensitivity of instruments such as MeerKAT provides an opportunity to probe this class of sources, using image-plane detection techniques. The previous letter in this series describes our project and associated TRON pipeline designed to mine archival MeerKAT data for transient and variable sources. In this letter, we report on a new transient, a radio flare, associated with Gaia DR3 6865945581361480448, a G type star, whose parallax places it at a distance of 1334 pc. Its duration and high degree of circular polarization suggests electron cyclotron maser instability as the mechanism, consistent with an RS CVn variable.</description>
