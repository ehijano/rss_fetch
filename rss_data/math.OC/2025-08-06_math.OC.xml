      <title>A Game-Theoretic Framework for Network Formation in Large Populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a model of network formation in large populations. Each agent can choose the strength of interaction (i.e. connection) with other agents to find a Nash equilibrium. Different from the recently-developed theory of graphon games, here each agent's control depends not only on her own index but also on the index of other agents. After defining the general model of the game, we focus on a special case with piecewise constant graphs and we provide optimality conditions through a system of forward-backward stochastic differential equations. Furthermore, we show the uniqueness and existence results. Finally, we provide numerical experiments to discuss the effects of different model settings.</description>

      <title>Multi-Fidelity Stochastic Trust Region Method with Adaptive Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulation optimization is often hindered by the high cost of running simulations. Multi-fidelity methods offer a promising solution by incorporating cheaper, lower-fidelity simulations to reduce computational time. However, the bias in low-fidelity models can mislead the search, potentially steering solutions away from the high-fidelity optimum. To overcome this, we propose ASTRO-MFDF, an adaptive sampling trust-region method for multi-fidelity simulation optimization. ASTRO-MFDF features two key strategies: (i) it adaptively determines the sample size and selects appropriate sampling strategies to reduce computational cost; and (ii) it selectively uses low-fidelity information only when a high correlation with the high-fidelity is anticipated, reducing the risk of bias. We validate the performance and computational efficiency of ASTRO-MFDF through numerical experiments using the SimOpt library.</description>

      <title>Non-negative polynomials without hyperbolic certificates of non-negativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the relationship between the set of all non-negative multivariate homogeneous polynomials and those, which we call hyperwrons, whose non-negativity can be deduced from an identity involving the Wronskians of hyperbolic polynomials. We give a sufficient condition on positive integers $m$ and $2y$ such that there are non-negative polynomials of degree $2y$ in $m$ variables that are not hyperwrons. Furthermore, we give an explicit example of a non-negative quartic form that is not a sum of hyperwrons. We partially extend our results to hyperzouts, which are polynomials whose non-negativity can be deduced from an identity involving the B\'ezoutians of hyperbolic polynomials.</description>

      <title>A factorisation-based regularised interior point method using the augmented system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper describes the implementation of a new interior point solver for linear programming for the open-source optimization library HiGHS. The solver uses a direct factorisation to solve the Newton systems, choosing the best approach between the normal equations and augmented system. Details of the multifrontal factorisation routine are given, with attention to the features that allow to achieve high performance, like storage formats, use of efficient dense linear algebra subroutines and parallelism. The paper also describes the use of pivoting and regularisation strategies to ensure that a stable factorisation is obtained, despite the ill-conditioning of the matrices. Results on three different collections of problems are presented which highlight the improved performance of the solver compared to the existing HiGHS interior point method.</description>

      <title>Non-Stationary Bandit Convex Optimization: An Optimal Algorithm with Two-Point Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies bandit convex optimization in non-stationary environments with two-point feedback, using dynamic regret as the performance measure. We propose an algorithm based on bandit mirror descent that extends naturally to non-Euclidean settings. Let $T$ be the total number of iterations and $\mathcal{P}_{T,p}$ the path variation with respect to the $\ell_p$-norm. In Euclidean space, our algorithm matches the optimal regret bound $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{dT(1+\mathcal{P}_{T,2})})$, improving upon Zhao et al. (2021) by a factor of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{d})$. Beyond Euclidean settings, our algorithm achieves an upper bound of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{d\log(d) T(1 + \mathcal{P}_{T,1})})$ on the simplex, which is optimal up to a $\log(d)$ factor. For the cross-polytope, the bound reduces to $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{d\log(d)T(1+\mathcal{P}_{T,p})})$ for some $p = 1 + 1/\log(d)$.</description>

      <title>Bernoulli-LoRA: A Theoretical Framework for Randomized Low-Rank Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a crucial approach for adapting large foundational models to specific tasks, particularly as model sizes continue to grow exponentially. Among PEFT methods, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) (arXiv:2106.09685) stands out for its effectiveness and simplicity, expressing adaptations as a product of two low-rank matrices. While extensive empirical studies demonstrate LoRA's practical utility, theoretical understanding of such methods remains limited. Recent work on RAC-LoRA (arXiv:2410.08305) took initial steps toward rigorous analysis. In this work, we introduce Bernoulli-LoRA, a novel theoretical framework that unifies and extends existing LoRA approaches. Our method introduces a probabilistic Bernoulli mechanism for selecting which matrix to update. This approach encompasses and generalizes various existing update strategies while maintaining theoretical tractability. Under standard assumptions from non-convex optimization literature, we analyze several variants of our framework: Bernoulli-LoRA-GD, Bernoulli-LoRA-SGD, Bernoulli-LoRA-PAGE, Bernoulli-LoRA-MVR, Bernoulli-LoRA-QGD, Bernoulli-LoRA-MARINA, and Bernoulli-LoRA-EF21, establishing convergence guarantees for each variant. Additionally, we extend our analysis to convex non-smooth functions, providing convergence rates for both constant and adaptive (Polyak-type) stepsizes. Through extensive experiments on various tasks, we validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the practical efficacy of our approach. This work is a step toward developing theoretically grounded yet practically effective PEFT methods.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning in MDPs with Information-Ordered Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an epoch-based reinforcement learning algorithm for infinite-horizon average-cost Markov decision processes (MDPs) that leverages a partial order over a policy class. In this structure, $\pi' \leq \pi$ if data collected under $\pi$ can be used to estimate the performance of $\pi'$, enabling counterfactual inference without additional environment interaction. Leveraging this partial order, we show that our algorithm achieves a regret bound of $O(\sqrt{w \log(|\Theta|) T})$, where $w$ is the width of the partial order. Notably, the bound is independent of the state and action space sizes. We illustrate the applicability of these partial orders in many domains in operations research, including inventory control and queuing systems. For each, we apply our framework to that problem, yielding new theoretical guarantees and strong empirical results without imposing extra assumptions such as convexity in the inventory model or specialized arrival-rate structure in the queuing model.</description>

      <title>Micro-macro and macro-macro limits for controlled leader-follower systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a leader-follower system of interacting particles subject to feedback control and derive its mean-field limits through a two-step passage: first to a micro-macro system coupling leader particles with a follower fluid, and then to a fully continuum macro-macro system. For each limiting procedure, we establish quantitative stability and convergence estimates based on modulated energy methods and Wasserstein distances. These results provide a rigorous foundation for the hierarchical reduction of controlled multi-agent systems. Numerical simulations are presented, including examples with interaction potentials beyond the analytical class considered, to demonstrate the dynamics and support the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Towards Globally Predictable k-Space Interpolation: A White-box Transformer Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interpolating missing data in k-space is essential for accelerating imaging. However, existing methods, including convolutional neural network-based deep learning, primarily exploit local predictability while overlooking the inherent global dependencies in k-space. Recently, Transformers have demonstrated remarkable success in natural language processing and image analysis due to their ability to capture long-range dependencies. This inspires the use of Transformers for k-space interpolation to better exploit its global structure. However, their lack of interpretability raises concerns regarding the reliability of interpolated data. To address this limitation, we propose GPI-WT, a white-box Transformer framework based on Globally Predictable Interpolation (GPI) for k-space. Specifically, we formulate GPI from the perspective of annihilation as a novel k-space structured low-rank (SLR) model. The global annihilation filters in the SLR model are treated as learnable parameters, and the subgradients of the SLR model naturally induce a learnable attention mechanism. By unfolding the subgradient-based optimization algorithm of SLR into a cascaded network, we construct the first white-box Transformer specifically designed for accelerated MRI. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in k-space interpolation accuracy while providing superior interpretability.</description>

      <title>Optimal Design of Broadband Absorbers with Multiple Plasmonic Nanoparticles via Reduced Basis Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a computational framework for the optimal design of broadband absorbing materials composed of plasmonic nanoparticle arrays. This design problem poses several key challenges: (1) the complex multi-particle interactions and high-curvature geometries; (2) the requirement to achieve broadband frequency responses, including resonant regimes; (3) the complexity of shape derivative calculations; and (4) the non-convexity of the optimization landscape. To systematically address these challenges, we employ three sequential strategies. First, we introduce a parameterized integral equation formulation that circumvents traditional shape derivative computations. Second, we develop a shape-adaptive reduced basis method (RBM) that utilizes the eigenfunctions of the Neumann-Poincar\'{e} operator for forward problems and their adjoint counterparts for adjoint problems, thereby addressing singularities and accelerating computations. Third, we propose a physics-informed initialization strategy that estimates nanoparticle configurations under weak coupling assumptions, thereby improving the performance of gradient-based optimization algorithms. The method's computational advantages are demonstrated through numerical experiments, which show accurate and efficient designs across various geometric configurations. Furthermore, the framework is flexible and extensible to other material systems and boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Sparse Narrow-Band Topology Optimization for Large-Scale Thermal-Fluid Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a fluid-based topology-optimization methodology for convective heat-transfer problems that can manage an extensive number of design variables, enabling the fine geometric features required for the next generation of heat-exchanger designs. Building on the classical Borrvall--Petersson formulation for Stokes flow, we develop a narrow-band optimization algorithm that concentrates computational effort on the fluid--solid interface, where it is most needed. To address the high cost of repeated forward and adjoint analyses, we utilize a flow solver specifically optimized for high-resolution voxel grids. The solver reduces memory usage and computational time by removing solid voxels from the analyses and directly imposing the no-slip boundary condition at the fluid--solid interface. It also employs an efficient preconditioner built on the Algebraic Multigrid method that ensures fast and reliable convergence for intricate flow configurations. The discretization uses a staggered-grid finite-difference scheme (marker-and-cell) for the Stokes--Brinkman model and an upwind finite-difference scheme for the heat convection--diffusion equation, ensuring stability at high Peclet numbers. We demonstrate the method on several examples, including the optimization of a two-fluid heat exchanger at $Pe = 10^{4}$ on a $370^{3}$ grid comprising $5 \times 10^{7}$ design variables using only a single desktop workstation. The framework shows considerable promise for advancing large-scale thermal-fluid applications and constitutes an important step toward a full conjugate-heat-transfer design methodology for high-Reynolds-number Navier--Stokes flows.</description>

      <title>Robustly Learning Monotone Single-Index Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the basic problem of learning Single-Index Models with respect to the square loss under the Gaussian distribution in the presence of adversarial label noise. Our main contribution is the first computationally efficient algorithm for this learning task, achieving a constant factor approximation, that succeeds for the class of {\em all} monotone activations with bounded moment of order $2 + \zeta,$ for $\zeta &gt; 0.$ This class in particular includes all monotone Lipschitz functions and even discontinuous functions like (possibly biased) halfspaces. Prior work for the case of unknown activation either does not attain constant factor approximation or succeeds for a substantially smaller family of activations. The main conceptual novelty of our approach lies in developing an optimization framework that steps outside the boundaries of usual gradient methods and instead identifies a useful vector field to guide the algorithm updates by directly leveraging the problem structure, properties of Gaussian spaces, and regularity of monotone functions.</description>

      <title>Matching Drivers to Riders: A Two-stage Robust Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.03624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2011.03624v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Matching demand (riders) to supply (drivers) efficiently is a fundamental problem for ride-sharing platforms who need to match the riders (almost) as soon as the request arrives with only partial knowledge about future ride requests. A myopic approach that computes an optimal matching for current requests ignoring future uncertainty can be highly sub-optimal. In this paper, we consider a two-stage robust optimization framework for this matching problem where future demand uncertainty is modeled using a set of demand scenarios (specified explicitly or implicitly). The goal is to match the current request to drivers (in the first stage) so that the cost of first-stage matching and the worst-case cost over all scenarios for the second-stage matching is minimized. We show that the two-stage robust matching is NP-hard under various cost functions and present constant approximation algorithms for different settings of our two-stage problem. Furthermore, we test our algorithms on real-life taxi data from the city of Shenzhen and show that they substantially improve upon myopic solutions and reduce the maximum wait time of the second-stage riders.</description>

      <title>The Operational Impact of Registry size, Cycle length, and Blood Type Distribution in Multi-Registry Kidney Exchange Programs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2012.06647v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kidney exchange programs have been developed to overcome the compatibility challenges for patients with incompatible donors in kidney transplantation. A registry of such incompatible donor-recipient pairs is created, and compatibility is achieved through the exchange of donors. Single-center kidney exchange registries do not have a significant pool size for achieving the full benefits of the kidney exchange program. Thus, multi-registry exchange transplants seem to be a natural way forward. There are various challenges in multi-registry exchange programs, such as different constraints for each registry, varying bounds on cycle lengths, and data sharing among registries. Researchers have proposed different merging mechanisms, including a sequential merger, a full merger with fair allocations, and a full merger without any restrictions. To form a stable multi-registry sharing mechanism, registries should be individually rational both in the long run as well as in the short run. In this paper, an Integer Programming model for a multi-registry exchange program has been proposed with individual rationality constraints for each registry. A simulation study is conducted to compare the benefits of multi-registry programs with individual registry allocations on Indian data, and multiple analyses have been done. It was concluded that registries with lower arrival rates could benefit 7-9\% in terms of the number of transplants and 4-6\% in terms of quality of matches in a typical kidney exchange registry. Registries with harder-to-match patients will benefit significantly more than registries with easier-to-match patients.</description>

      <title>Extended Dynamic Programming Principle and Applications to Time-Inconsistent Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.14274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.14274v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since Peng (1993) established a local maximum principle for a general stochastic control problem governed by forward-backward stochastic differential equations (FBSDEs), the corresponding partial differential equation (PDE) characterization has not been developed yet. The main difficulty stems from the potential time inconsistency inherent in this class of control problems. In a dimension-augmented space, we first establish an extended dynamic programming principle (DPP). Consequently, an extended Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation is derived. The existence and uniqueness of a new type of viscosity solution is also investigated for this extended HJB equation. Compared to extant research on the stochastic maximum principle, the present paper is the first normal work on the PDE method for a control system with states evolving in both forward and backward manners. Interestingly, our extended DPP provides an equilibrium solution for general time-inconsistent control problems associated with the traditional mean-variance model, risk-sensitive control and utility optimization for narrow framing investors, among others.</description>

      <title>Symmetry &amp; Critical Points for Symmetric Tensor Decomposition Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.07886v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the nonconvex optimization problem associated with the decomposition of a real symmetric tensor into a sum of rank-one terms. Use is made of the rich symmetry structure to construct infinite families of critical points represented by Puiseux series in the problem dimension, and so obtain precise analytic estimates on the objective function value and the Hessian spectrum. The results enable an analytic characterization of various obstructions to local optimization methods, revealing, in particular, a complex array of saddles and minima that differ in their symmetry, structure, and analytic properties. A notable phenomenon, observed for all critical points considered, concerns the index of the Hessian increasing with the objective function value.</description>

      <title>The Value of Ancillary Services for Electrolyzers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04321v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although primarily designed for hydrogen production, electrolyzers can support power systems by providing various ancillary services, opening new revenue streams that enhance their economic viability. This paper investigates the participation of an electrolyzer in frequency-supporting reserve markets, analyzing how bid structures and activation intensities affect its value. We develop a mixed-integer linear program to co-optimize electricity procurement and reserve provision, and analytically derive the opportunity cost of reserve provision, which determines the optimal bid price. Using historical price and frequency data from western Denmark, we show that asymmetric, hourly reserve products often entail no opportunity cost and can increase profits by up to 47%. However, energy-intensive reserves may disrupt hydrogen production and risk unmet demand. Our findings reveal that flexible bidding can mitigate these risks while maintaining profitability. We also highlight the benefits of diversifying across reserve products and offer two recommendations: System operators should reconsider reserve bid structures to better accommodate electrolyzers, and electrolyzer owners should not overlook energy-intensive reserve services when hydrogen demand is flexible.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10673v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose stochastic splitting algorithms for solving large-scale composite inclusion problems involving monotone and linear operators. They activate at each iteration blocks of randomly selected resolvents of monotone operators and, unlike existing methods, achieve almost sure convergence of the iterates to a solution without any regularity assumptions or knowledge of the norms of the linear operators. Applications to image recovery and machine learning are provided.</description>

      <title>Interior-Point-based H2 Controller Synthesis for Compartmental Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09753v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of the optimal $H_2$ controller design for compartmental systems. In other words, we aim to enhance system robustness while maintaining the law of mass conservation. We perform a novel problem transformation and establish that the original problem is equivalent to an new optimization problem with a closed polyhedron constraint. Existing works have developed various first-order methods to tackle inequality constraints. However, the performance of the first-order method is limited in terms of convergence speed and precision, restricting its potential in practical applications. Therefore, developing a novel algorithm with fast speed and high precision is critical. In this paper, we reformulate the problem using log-barrier functions and introduce two separate approaches to address the problem: the first-order interior point method (FIPM) and the second-order interior point method (SIPM). We show they converge to a stationary point of the new problem. In addition, we propose an initialization method to guarantee the interior property of initial values. Finally, we compare FIPM and SIPM through a room temperature control example and show their pros and cons.</description>

      <title>Domain decomposition for integer optimal control with total variation regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15672v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Total variation integer optimal control problems admit solutions and necessary optimality conditions via geometric variational analysis. In spite of the existence of said solutions, algorithms which solve the discretized objective suffer from high numerical cost associated with the combinatorial nature of integer programming. Hence, such methods are often limited to small- and medium-sized problems.
  We propose a globally convergent, coordinate descent-inspired algorithm that allows tractable subproblem solutions restricted to a partition of the domain. Our decomposition method solves relatively small trust-region subproblems that modify the control variable on a subdomain only. Given nontrivial subdomain overlap, we prove that a global first-order necessary optimality condition is equivalent to a first-order necessary optimality condition per subdomain. We additionally show that sufficient decrease is achieved on a single subdomain by way of a trust-region subproblem solver using geometric measure theoretic arguments, which we integrate with a greedy patch selection to prove convergence of our algorithm. We demonstrate the practicality of our algorithm on a benchmark large-scale, PDE-constrained integer optimal control problem, and find that our method is faster than the state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>Robust Accelerated Dynamics for Subnetwork Bilinear Zero-Sum Games with Distributed Restarting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16835v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate distributed Nash equilibrium seeking for a class of two-subnetwork zero-sum games characterized by bilinear coupling. We present a distributed primal-dual accelerated mirror-descent algorithm with convergence guarantees. However, we demonstrate that this time-varying algorithm is not robust, as it fails to converge under arbitrarily small disturbances. To address this limitation, we introduce a distributed accelerated algorithm that incorporates a coordinated restarting mechanism. We model this new algorithm as a hybrid dynamical system and establish its structural robustness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05200v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semidefinite programming provides a relaxation of the maximum cut problem on a graph. We investigate and present a few classes of graphs for which the semidefinite relaxation of the maximum cut problem is exact. For each class, we determine the optimal objective value by explicitly constructing a maximum cut and prove the uniqueness of the exact solution for two of these classes. We also address two open problems posed by Mirka and Williamson (2024) concerning the optimal solutions of the exact semidefinite relaxation, providing corresponding counterexamples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13493v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a class of linear programs on graphs with total variation regularization and a budgetary constraint. For these programs, we give a characterization of basic solutions in terms of rooted spanning forests with orientation on the underlying graph. This leads to an interpretation of the simplex method in terms of simple graph operations on these underlying forests. We exploit this structure to produce an accelerated simplex method and empirically show that such improvements can lead to an order of magnitude improvement in time when compared to state-of-the-art solvers.</description>

      <title>Optimal Learning via Moderate Deviations Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.14496v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a statistically optimal approach for learning a function value using a confidence interval in a wide range of models, including general non-parametric estimation of an expected loss described as a stochastic programming problem or various SDE models. More precisely, we develop a systematic construction of highly accurate confidence intervals by using a moderate deviation principle-based approach. It is shown that the proposed confidence intervals are statistically optimal in the sense that they satisfy criteria regarding exponential accuracy, minimality, consistency, mischaracterization probability, and eventual uniformly most accurate (UMA) property. The confidence intervals suggested by this approach are expressed as solutions to robust optimization problems, where the uncertainty is expressed via the underlying moderate deviation rate function induced by the data-generating process. We demonstrate that for many models these optimization problems admit tractable reformulations as finite convex programs even when they are infinite-dimensional.</description>

      <title>Efficient Training of Physics-enhanced Neural ODEs via Direct Collocation and Nonlinear Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03552v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel approach for training Physics-enhanced Neural ODEs (PeN-ODEs) by expressing the training process as a dynamic optimization problem. The full model, including neural components, is discretized using a high-order implicit Runge-Kutta method with flipped Legendre-Gauss-Radau points, resulting in a large-scale nonlinear program (NLP) efficiently solved by state-of-the-art NLP solvers such as Ipopt. This formulation enables simultaneous optimization of network parameters and state trajectories, addressing key limitations of ODE solver-based training in terms of stability, runtime, and accuracy. Extending on a recent direct collocation-based method for Neural ODEs, we generalize to PeN-ODEs, incorporate physical constraints, and present a custom, parallelized, open-source implementation. Benchmarks on a Quarter Vehicle Model and a Van-der-Pol oscillator demonstrate superior accuracy, speed, generalization with smaller networks compared to other training techniques. We also outline a planned integration into OpenModelica to enable accessible training of Neural DAEs.</description>

      <title>Vertex addition to a ball graph with application to reliability and area coverage in autonomous swarms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19197v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A unit ball graph consists of a set of vertices, labeled by points in Euclidean space, and edges joining all pairs of points within distance 1. These geometric graphs are used to model a variety of spatial networks, including communication networks between agents in an autonomous swarm. In such an application, vertices and/or edges of the graph may not be perfectly reliable; an agent may experience failure or a communication link rendered inoperable. With the goal of designing robust swarm formations, or unit ball graphs with high reliability (probability of connectedness), in a preliminary conference paper we provided an algorithm with cubic time complexity to determine all possible changes to a unit ball graph by repositioning a single vertex. Using this algorithm and Monte Carlo simulations, one obtains an efficient method to modify a unit ball graph by moving a single vertex to a location which maximizes the reliability. Another important consideration in many swarm missions is area coverage, yet highly reliable ball graphs often contain clusters of vertices. Here, we generalize our previous algorithm to improve area coverage as well as reliability. Our algorithm determines a location to add or move a vertex within a unit ball graph which maximizes the reliability, under the constraint that no other vertices of the graph be within some fixed distance. We compare this method of obtaining graphs with high reliability and evenly distributed area coverage to another method which uses a modified Fruchterman-Reingold algorithm for ball graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20488v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a mathematical framework for studying the newly discovered solar inertial oscillations, offering promising new avenues for exploring the Sun's dynamics. Under the assumption of purely toroidal motions, the stream function of the flow satisfies a fourth-order scalar equation governing inertial waves on the rotating Sun. We prove well-posedness of wave solutions under explicit conditions on differential rotation. Moreover, we study the inverse problem of simultaneously reconstructing viscosity and differential rotation parameters from either complete or partial surface observations. To this end, we verify the tangential cone condition, ensuring the convergence of iterative regularization methods, furthermore the local unique identifiability of the unknown parameters. Numerical experiments employing the Nesterov-Landweber iteration confirm robustness of the reconstruction across different observation schemes and noise levels.</description>
