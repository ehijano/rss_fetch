      <title>Some NP Complete Problems Based on Algebra and Algebraic Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper describes several new problems and ideas concerning algebraic geometry and complexity theory. It first uses the idea of coloring graphs with elements of finite fields. This procedure then shows that graph coloring problems can be converted into membership problems for a new family of algebraic varieties, coloring varieties, which are closely related to determinantal varieties. This in turn shows that the problem of NP vs P can be converted into questions of if certain polynomials of large degree over finite fields have low multiplicative complexity.</description>

      <title>Birational Geometry of Special Quotient Foliations and Chazy's Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The works of Brunella and Santos have singled out three special singular holomorphic foliations on projective surfaces having invariant rational nodal curves of positive self-intersection. These foliations can be described as quotients of foliations on some rational surfaces under cyclic groups of transformations of orders three, four, and six, respectively. Through an unexpected connection with the reduced Chazy IV, V and VI equations, we give explicit models for these foliations as degree-two foliations on the projective plane (in particular, we recover Pereira's model of Brunella's foliation). We describe the full groups of birational automorphisms of these quotient foliations, and, through this, produce symmetries for the reduced Chazy IV and V equations. We give another model for Brunella's very special foliation, one with only non-degenerate singularities, for which its characterizing involution is a quartic de Jonqui\`eres one, and for which its order-three symmetries are linear. Lastly, our analysis of the action of monomial transformations on linear foliations poses naturally the question of determining planar models for their quotients under the action of the standard quadratic Cremona involution; we give explicit formulas for these as well.</description>

      <title>Perverse-Hodge complexes for Lagrangian fibrations and symplectic resolutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study perverse-Hodge complexes for Lagrangian fibrations on holomorphic symplectic varieties. We prove the symplectic Hard Lefschetz type theorem and the symmetry of perverse-Hodge complexes when the symplectic variety admits symplectic resolutions, therefore generalize the previous result by Schnell in the smooth case verifying a conjecture by Shen-Yin. Along the way, we study the perverse coherent properties of the intersection complex Hodge modules on symplectic varieties. As an application, we obtain an alternative proof of the numerical "perverse=Hodge" result by Felisetti-Shen-Yin, without using the Beauville-Bogomolov-Fujiki form. We also apply our results to study singular Higgs moduli spaces over reduced curves using results by Mauri-Migliorini on the local structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constructions and exploration of plane algebraic curves has received a new push with the development of automated methods, whose algorithms are continuously improved and implemented in various software packages. We use them to explore the pedal curves of conics. This provides a construction of interesting geometric loci, given at first by parametric representations. After implicitization, they appear as sextics, octics and other curves of higher degree. We explore their irreducibility and their singular points (crunodes, cusps, etc.).</description>

      <title>Gluing invariants of Donaldson--Thomas type -- Part II: Matrix factorizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is a follow-up to arXiv:2407.08471. Let $X$ be a a $(-1)$-shifted symplectic derived Deligne--Mumford stack. Thanks to the Darboux lemma of Brav--Bussi--Joyce, $X$ is locally modeled by derived critical loci of a function $f$ on a smooth scheme $U$. In this paper we study the gluing of the locally defined $2$-periodic (big) dg-categories of matrix factorizations $MF^\infty(U,f)$. We show that these come canonically equipped with a structure of a $2$-periodic crystal of categories (\ie an action of the dg-category of $2$-periodic $D$-modules on $X$) compatible with a relative Thom--Sebastiani theorem expressing the equivariance under the action of quadratic bundles.
  As our main theorem we show that the locally defined categories $MF^\infty(U,f)$ can be glued along $X$ as a sheaf of crystals of 2-periodic dg-categories ``up to isotopy'', under the prescription of orientation data controlled by three obstruction classes. This result generalizes the gluing of the Joyce's perverse sheaf of vanishing cycles and partially answers conjectures by Kontsevich--Soibelman and Toda in motivic Donaldson--Thomas theory.</description>

      <title>Constructed tableaux and a new shifted Littlewood-Richardson rule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a new Littlewood-Richardson rule for the Schubert structure coefficients of isotropic Grassmannians, equivalently for the multiplication of $P$-Schur functions. Serrano (2010) previously gave a formula in terms of classes in his shifted plactic monoid. However, this formula is challenging to use because of the difficulty of characterizing shifted plactic classes. We give the first algebraic proof of this formula. We then use it to obtain a new rule that is easy to implement. Our rule is based on identifying a subtle analogue of Yamanouchi tableaux, which we characterize. We show that for some families of structure coefficients, our rule leads to an algorithm with exponentially better time complexity than the original rule of Stembridge (1989).</description>

      <title>Hodge theory, intertwining functors, and the Orbit Method for real reductive groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Hodge filtrations of Schmid and Vilonen on unipotent representations of real reductive groups. We show that for various well-defined classes of unipotent representations (including, for example, the oscillator representations of metaplectic groups, the minimal representations of all simple groups, and all unipotent representations of complex groups) the Hodge filtration coincides with the quantization filtration predicted by the Orbit Method. We deduce a number of longstanding conjectures about such representations, including a proof that they are unitary and a description of their $K$-types in terms of co-adjoint orbits. The proofs rely heavily on certain good homological properties of the Hodge filtrations on weakly unipotent representations, which are established using a Hodge-theoretic upgrade of the Beilinson-Bernstein theory of intertwining functors for $\mathcal{D}$-modules on the flag variety. The latter consists of an action of the affine Hecke algebra on a category of filtered monodromic $\mathcal{D}$-modules, which we use to compare Hodge filtrations coming from different localizations of the same representation. As an application of the same methods, we also prove a new cohomology vanishing theorem for mixed Hodge modules on partial flag varieties.</description>

      <title>Simplicial complexes, stellar moves, and projective amalgamation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore connections between stellar moves on simplicial complexes (these are fundamental operations of combinatorial topology) and projective Fra{\"i}ss{\'e} limits (this is a model theoretic construction with topological applications).
  We identify a class of simplicial maps that arise from the stellar moves of welding and subdividing. We call these maps weld-division maps. The core of the paper is the proof that the category of weld-division maps fulfills the projective amalgamation property. This gives an example of an amalgamation class that substantially differs from known classes.
  The weld-division amalgamation class naturally gives rise to a projective Fra{\"i}ss{\'e} class. We compute the canonical limit of this projective Fra{\"i}ss{\'e} class and its canonical quotient space. This computation gives a combinatorial description of the geometric realization of a simplicial complex and an example of a combinatorially defined projective Fra{\"i}ss{\'e} class whose canonical quotient space has topological dimension strictly bigger than $1$.
  The method of proof of the amalgamation theorem is new. It is not geometric or topological, but rather it consists of combinatorial calculations performed on finite sequences of finite sets and functions among such sequences. Set theoretic nature of the entries of the sequences is crucial to the arguments.</description>

      <title>Sken and cluster algebras of punctured surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the full Fock-Goncharov conjecture for $\mathcal{A}_{SL_2,\Sigma_{g,p}}$--the $\mathcal{A}$-cluster variety associated to representation of $SL_2$ local systems on most punctured surfaces with at least 2 punctures in the classical $q\to 1$ setting, that is, the tagged skein algebra coincides with the upper cluster algebra (namely $Sk^{ta}=U(\Sigma)$ or $mid(\mathcal{A})=up(\mathcal{A})$), with methods being potentially useful to tackle the quantum case. We deduce similar results for the Roger Yang skein algebra via a birational geometric description, obtaining $Sk^{RY}=U(\Sigma)[v_i^{\pm1}]$ as conjectured by Shen, Sun and Weng, proving important algebraic properties of $Sk^{RY}$ including normality and Cohen-Macaulayness. Our result is complementary to what and Mandel and Qin have shown in arXiv:2301.11101 for surface with marked points, based on arXiv:1411.1394 . The once-punctured case where cluster structures are significantly different is also discussed in the paper, and relevant conjectures are proposed (and proved in the once-punctured torus case).
  By contrast, we define the ordinary cluster algebra with potentials added $A(\Sigma)[v_i^{\pm1}]$, introduced by Shen, Sun and Weng, which is shown to be usually smaller than $Sk^{RY}$ and $U(\Sigma)[v_i^{\pm1}]$. This strengthen the result of arXiv:2201.08833 that the classical $A=U$ fails for $\Sigma_{g,p}$ with $g\geq 1, p\geq 1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $k$ be a global field and $p$ be an odd prime number. We give a necessary and sufficient condition for the Hasse norm principle for separable field extensions $K/k$, i.e. the determination of the Shafarevich-Tate group $Sha(T)$ of the norm one tori $T=R^{(1)}_{K/k}(G_m)$ of $K/k$, with $[K:k]=p^3$ or $p^2$ when the Galois group of the Galois closure of $K/k$ is the Heisenberg group $E_p(p^3)\simeq (C_p)^2\rtimes C_p$ of order $p^3$, i.e. the extraspecial group of order $p^3$ with exponent $p$. As a consequence, we get the Tamagawa number $\tau(T)=p^2$, $p$ or $1$ via Ono's formula $\tau(T)=|H^1(k,\widehat{T})|/|Sha(T)|$.</description>

In analogy to the classical case of division polynomials for multiplication-by-n, we demonstrate recurrence relations, identities relating to classical elliptic functions, the chain rule describing relationships between division polynomials on source and target curve, and generalizations to higher dimension (i.e., elliptic nets).</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study BPS loop operators in a 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ $Sp(N)$ gauge theory with four hypermultiplets in the fundamental representation and one hypermultiplet in the anti-symmetric representation. The algebra of BPS loop operators in the $\Omega$-background provides a deformation quantization of the Coulomb branch, which is expected to coincide with the quantized K-theoretic Coulomb branch in the mathematical literature. For the rank-one case, i.e., $Sp(1) \simeq SU(2)$, we show that the quantization of the Coulomb branch, evaluated using the supersymmetric localization formula, agrees with the polynomial representation of the spherical part of the double affine Hecke algebra (spherical DAHA) of $(C_1^{\vee}, C_1)$-type. For higher-rank cases, where $N \geq 2$, we conjecture that the quantized Coulomb branch of the 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ $Sp(N)$ gauge theory is isomorphic to the spherical DAHA of $(C_N^{\vee}, C_N)$-type . As evidence for this conjecture, we demonstrate that the quantization of an 't Hooft loop agrees with the Koornwinder operator in the polynomial representation of the spherical DAHA.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2111.11417v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a theory of quasimaps to a moduli space of sheaves $M$ on a surface $S$. Under some assumptions, we prove that moduli spaces of quasimaps are proper and carry a perfect obstruction theory. Moreover, they are naturally isomorphic to moduli spaces of sheaves on threefolds $S\times C$, where $C$ is a nodal curve. Using Zhou's theory of entangled tails, we establish a wall-crossing formula which therefore relates the Gromov-Witten theory of $M$ and the Donaldson-Thomas theory of $S\times C$ with relative insertions. We evaluate the wall-crossing formula for Hilbert schemes of points $S^{[n]}$, if $S$ is a del Pezzo surface.</description>

      <title>Quasimaps to moduli spaces of sheaves on a $K3$ surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.11425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.11425v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we study quasimaps to moduli spaces of sheaves on a $K3$ surface $S$. We construct a surjective cosection of the obstruction theory of moduli spaces of quasimaps. We then establish reduced wall-crossing formulas which relate the reduced Gromov-Witten theory of moduli spaces of sheaves on $S$ and the reduced Donaldson-Thomas theory of $S\times C$, where $C$ is a nodal curve. As applications, we prove the Hilbert-schemes part of the Igusa cusp form conjecture; higher-rank/rank-one Donaldson-Thomas correspondence with relative insertions on $S\times C$, if $g(C)\leq1$; Donaldson-Thomas/Pandharipande-Thomas correspondence with relative insertions on $S\times \mathbb{P}^1$.</description>

      <title>Geometric interpretation of valuated term (pre)orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.05538v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Valuated term orders are studied for the purposes of Gr\"{o}bner theory over fields with valuation. The points of a usual tropical variety correspond to certain valuated terms preorders. Generalizing both of these, the set of all ``well-behaved'' valuated term preorders is canonically in bijection with the points of a space introduced in our previous work on tropical adic geometry. In this paper we interpret these points geometrically by explicitly characterizing them in terms of classical polyhedral geometry. This characterization gives a bijection with equivalence classes of flags of polyhedra as well as a bijection with a class of prime filters on a lattice of polyhedral sets. The first of these also classifies valuated term orders. The second bijection is of the same flavor as the bijections from [van der Put and Schneider, 1995] in non-archimedean analytic geometry and indicates that the results of that paper may have analogues in tropical adic geometry.</description>

      <title>Some applications of canonical metrics to Landau-Ginzburg models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08613v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is known that a given smooth del Pezzo surface or Fano threefold $X$ admits a choice of log Calabi-Yau compactified mirror toric Landau-Ginzburg model (with respect to certain fixed K\"ahler classes and Gorenstein toric degenerations). Here we consider the problem of constructing a corresponding map $\Theta$ from a domain in the complexified K\"ahler cone of $X$ to a well-defined, separated moduli space $\mathfrak{M}$ of polarised manifolds endowed with a canonical metric. We prove a complete result for del Pezzos and a partial result for some special Fano threefolds. The construction uses some fundamental results in the theory of constant scalar curvature K\"ahler metrics. As a consequence $\mathfrak{M}$ parametrises $K$-stable manifolds and the domain of $\Theta$ is endowed with the pullback of a Weil-Petersson form.</description>

      <title>Explicit desingularisation of Kummer surfaces in characteristic two via specialisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04532v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the birational geometry of the Kummer surfaces associated to the Jacobian varieties of genus two curves, with a particular focus on fields of characteristic two. In order to do so, we explicitly compute a projective embedding of the Jacobian of a general genus two curve and, from this, we construct its associated Kummer surface. This explicit construction produces a model for desingularised Kummer surfaces over any field of characteristic not two, and specialising these equations to characteristic two provides a model of a partial desingularisation. Adapting the classic description of the Picard lattice in terms of tropes, we also describe how to explicitly find completely desingularised models of Kummer surfaces whenever the $p$-rank is not zero. In the final section of this paper, we compute an example of a Kummer surface with everywhere good reduction over a quadratic number field, and draw connections between the models we computed and a criterion that determines when a Kummer surface has good reduction at two.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Calabi-Yau manifolds in high-precision black hole scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11846v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the worldline quantum field theory formalism, we compute the radiation-reacted impulse, scattering angle, radiated energy and recoil of a classical black hole (or neutron star) scattering event at fifth post-Minkowskian and sub-leading self-force orders (5PM-1SF). This state-of-the-art four-loop computation employs advanced integration-by-parts and differential equation technology, and is considerably more challenging than the conservative 5PM-1SF counterpart. As compared with the conservative 5PM-1SF, in the radiation sector Calabi-Yau three-fold periods appear and contribute to the radiated energy and recoil observables. We give an extensive exposition of the canonicalization of the differential equations and provide details on boundary integrations, Feynman rules, and integration-by-parts strategies. Comparisons to numerical relativity are also performed.</description>

      <title>Borel singularities and Stokes constants of the topological string free energy on one-parameter Calabi-Yau threefolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16140v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Borel plane of the topological string free energy on all hypergeometric one-parameter Calabi-Yau models close to singular points in moduli space, focusing on the location of Borel singularities and the value of the associated Stokes constants. We find in particular that in models which exhibit massless D-branes at a singular point, the central charge of the D-brane close to the singular point coincides with the location of the leading Borel singularity, and the generalized Donaldson-Thomas invariant associated to the charge of the D-brane, in as far as its value is known, coincides with the Stokes constant associated to the Borel singularity.</description>

Abstract: Schmidt's subspace theorem in terms of Seshadri constants for closed subschemes in subgeneral position has been already developed sharply. We derive our theorem for numerically equivalent ample divisors by dint of the above theory step by step, providing a joint generalization of Schmidt's theorem for algebraic points of bounded degree.</description>

      <title>Cohen--Macaulay ideals of codimension two and the geometry of plane points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03728v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider classes of codimension two Cohen--Macaulay ideals over a standard graded polynomial ring over a field. We revisit Vasconcelos' problem on $3\times 2$ matrices with homogeneous entries and describe the homological details of Geramita's work on plane points. An additional topic is the homological discussion of minors fixing a submatrix in the context of a perfect codimension two ideal. A combinatorial outcome of the results is a proof of the conjecture on the Jacobian ideal of a hyperplane arrangement stated by Burity, Simis and Toh\v{a}neanu. The basic drive behind the present landscapes is a thorough analysis of the related Hilbert--Burch matrix, often without assuming equigeneration, linear presentation or even the popular $G_d$ condition of Artin--Nagata.</description>

      <title>Hasse norm principle for metacyclic extensions with trivial Schur multiplier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14365v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $k$ be a global field, $K/k$ be a finite separable field extension and $L/k$ be the Galois closure of $K/k$ with Galois groups $G={\rm Gal}(L/k)$ and $H={\rm Gal}(L/K)\lneq G$. In 1931, Hasse proved that if $G$ is cyclic, then the Hasse norm principle holds for $K/k$. We show that if $G$ is metacyclic with trivial Schur multiplier $M(G)=0$, then the Hasse norm principle holds for $K/k$. Some examples of metacyclic, dihedral, quasidihedral, modular, generalized quoternion, extraspecial groups and $Z$-groups $G$ with trivial Schur multiplier $M(G)=0$ are given. As a consequence, we get the Tamagawa number $\tau(T)=|G^{ab}|/|H^{ab}|$ of the norm one tori $T=R^{(1)}_{k/k}(G_m)$ of $K/k$ via Ono's formula $\tau(T)=|H^1(k,\widehat{T})|/|Sha(T)|$ where $G^{ab}$ and $H^{ab}$ are the abelianizations of $G$ and $H$ respectively, $\widehat{T}={\rm Hom}(T,G_m)$ is the character module of $T$ and $Sha(T)$ is the Shafarevich-Tate group of $T$.</description>
