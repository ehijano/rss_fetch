      <title>DNNs, Dataset Statistics, and Correlation Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper argues that dataset structure is important in image recognition tasks (among other tasks). Specifically, we focus on the nature and genesis of correlational structure in the actual datasets upon which DNNs are trained. We argue that DNNs are implementing a widespread methodology in condensed matter physics and materials science that focuses on mesoscale correlation structures that live between fundamental atomic/molecular scales and continuum scales. Specifically, we argue that DNNs that are successful in image classification must be discovering high order correlation functions. It is well-known that DNNs successfully generalize in apparent contravention of standard statistical learning theory. We consider the implications of our discussion for this puzzle.</description>

      <title>Einstein's 1935 Letters to Schr\"odinger and Popper and the Boundaries of the PBR $\psi$-Epistemic Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Einstein's 1935 critique of quantum mechanics is often associated with the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) argument, yet his private correspondence from that year reveals a more exact conceptual structure guiding his claim that the $\psi$-function is incomplete. This paper reconstructs Einstein's reasoning in his letters to Schr\"odinger and Popper and examines how it engages, and fails to engage with contemporary $\psi$-ontic/$\psi$-epistemic distinctions. Recent scholarship, most notably by Ben-Menahem, has interpreted Einstein as an early representative of the modern $\psi$-epistemic tradition within the Harrigan-Spekkens ontological models framework and the Pusey-Barrett-Rudolph (PBR) theorem. I argue, however, that this retrospective classification is undermined by Ben-Menahem's own distinction between realist and radical epistemic interpretations: Einstein's 1935 view lacks the structural assumptions - defined ontic state space, preparation distributions, and overlap structure - required for membership in the HS/PBR class of $\psi$-epistemic models. Any such identification, therefore, requires importing formal machinery foreign to Einstein's original argument.</description>

      <title>The Geometric View of Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07015v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent critiques of the semantic conception of scientific theories suggest that a theory is not best formulated as a collection of models satisfying some set of kinematical or dynamical conditions. Thus it has been argued that additional structure on the set of models is required. Furthermore, there are calls for developing a 'theory of theories', where what was formerly a 'theory' is seen as a 'model' within a larger theoretical structure. This paper makes a two-pronged proposal for the ''shape'' that physical theories should take, based on recent insights on dualities and quasi-dualities in physics. First, I develop a geometric view of theories, according to which a physical theory is a set of models with topological and geometric structure on it. This general view is briefly illustrated in an example from quantum cosmology. Second, I make a more specific proposal for a natural structure that can encompass various 'theories' as its models, with topological and algebraic-geometric structure on them. I call the latter more specific structure a 'model bundle', where the models are in the fibres and there is a moduli space in the base. I illustrate my second proposal in an example from quantum field theory. This view highlights the important role of quasi-dualities as local transition functions between fibres; dualities are recovered as global transition functions when the bundle is trivial. I discuss some philosophical issues that this geometric view of physical theories opens up, such as its realist interpretation.</description>
