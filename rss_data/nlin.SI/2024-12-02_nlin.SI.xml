      <title>Exact solutions and reductions of nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations with delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the first time, Schr\"odinger equations with cubic and more complex nonlinearities containing the unknown function with constant delay are analyzed. The physical considerations that can lead to the appearance of a delay in such nonlinear equations and mathematical models are expressed. One-dimensional non-symmetry reductions are described, which lead the studied partial differential equations with delay to simpler ordinary differential equations and ordinary differential equations with delay. New exact solutions of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation of the general form with delay, which are expressed in quadratures, are found. To construct exact solutions, a combination of methods of generalized separation of variables and the method of functional constraints are used. Special attention is paid to three equations with cubic nonlinearity, which allow simple solutions in elementary functions, as well as more complex exact solutions with generalized separation of variables. Solutions representing a nonlinear superposition of two traveling waves, the amplitude of which varies periodically in time and space, are constructed. Some more complex nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations of a general form with variable delay are also studied. The results of this work can be useful for the development and improvement of mathematical models described by nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations with delay and related functional PDEs, and the obtained exact solutions can be used as test problems intended to assess the accuracy of numerical methods for integrating nonlinear equations of mathematical physics with delay.</description>

      <title>Stationary systems of the AKNS hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we investigate stationary systems of the AKNS hierarchy. We prove that all these systems are classical separable St\"ackel systems. The explicit transformation from jet variables to separation coordinates is obtained by comparing Lax representations in jet and separable coordinates.</description>

      <title>All 4 x 4 solutions of the quantum Yang-Baxter equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we complete the classification of 4 x 4 solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation. Regular solutions were recently classified and in this paper we find the remaining non-regular solutions. We present several new solutions, then consider regular and non-regular Lax operators and study their relation to the quantum Yang-Baxter equation. We show that for regular solutions there is a correspondence, which is lost in the non-regular case. In particular, we find non-regular Lax operators whose R-matrix from the fundamental commutation relations is regular but does not satisfy the Yang-Baxter equation. These R-matrices satisfy a modified Yang-Baxter equation instead.</description>

      <title>Generalization of the Painlev\'e Property and Existence and Uniqueness in Fractional Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, the Painlev\'e property to fractional differential equations (FDEs) are extended and the existence and uniqueness theorems for both linear and nonlinear FDEs are established. The results contribute to the research of integrability and solvability in the context of fractional calculus, which has significant implications in various fields such as physics, engineering, and applied sciences. By bridging the gap between pure mathematical theory and practical applications, this work provides a foundational understanding that can be utilized in modeling phenomena exhibiting memory and hereditary properties.</description>

      <title>Ruijsenaars spectral transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spectral decomposition with respect to the wave functions of Ruijsenaars hyperbolic system defines an integral transform, which generalizes classical Fourier integral. For a certain class of analytical symmetric functions we prove inversion formula and orthogonality relations, valid for complex valued parameters of the system. Besides, we study four regimes of unitarity, when this transform defines isomorphisms of the corresponding $L_2$ spaces.</description>

      <title>Hypergraphs and homogeneous Lotka-Volterra systems with linear Darboux polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18264v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We associate homogeneous $n$-component Lotka-Volterra systems which admit $k$ additional linear Darboux polynomials, with admissible hypergraphs of order $n$ and size $k$. We study the equivalence relation on admissible hypergraphs induced by linear transformations of the associated LV-systems, for $n\leq 5$. We present a new 13-parameter 5-component superintegrable Lotka-Volterra system, i.e. one that is not equivalent to a so-called tree-system. We conjecture that tree-systems associated with nonisomorphic trees are not equivalent, which we verified for $n&lt;9$.</description>

      <title>Determination of the Hamiltonian from the Equations of Motion with Illustration from Examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10925v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the determination of Hamiltonian from a given equations of motion. It can be cast into a problem of matrix factorization after reinterpretation of the system as first-order evolutionary equations in the phase space coordinates. We state the criterion on the evolution matrix for a Hamiltonian to exist. In addition, the proof is constructive and an explicit Hamiltonian with accompanied symplectic structure can be obtained. As an application, we will study a few classes of dynamical systems for illustration.</description>

      <title>Exact overlaps for "all" integrable matrix product states of rational spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23282v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The overlaps between integrable matrix product states (MPS) and Bethe states are important in both the non-equilibrium statistical physics and the AdS/CFT duality. We present the general MPS overlap formula. The result is a product of a ratio of Gaudin determinants and a prefactor. The Gaudin determinants depend on the spin chain but not on the MPS. The MPS dependent prefactor is given for all integrable MPS of the $\mathfrak{gl}_{N}$, $\mathfrak{o}_{N}$ and $\mathfrak{sp}_{N}$ symmetric spin chains with arbitrary representations.</description>
