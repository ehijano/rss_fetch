      <title>Duality between Lines and Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are several notions of duality between lines and points. In this note, it is shown that all these can be studied in a unified way. Most interesting properties are independent of specific choices.
  It is also shown that either dual mapping can be its own inverse or it can preserve relative order (but not both).
  Generalisation to higher dimensions is also discussed. An elementary and very intuitive treatment of relationship between arrangements in $d+1$ dimensions and searching for $k$-nearest neighbour in $d$-dimensions is also given.</description>

      <title>The Power of Recursive Embeddings for $\ell_p$ Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metric embedding is a powerful mathematical tool that is extensively used in mathematics and computer science. We devise a new method of using metric embeddings recursively that turned out to be particularly effective for $\ell_p$ spaces, $p&gt;2$. Our method yields state-of-the-art results for Lipschitz decomposition, nearest neighbor search and embedding into $\ell_2$. In a nutshell, we compose metric embeddings by way of reductions, leading to new reductions that are substantially more effective than the straightforward reduction that employs a single embedding. In fact, we compose reductions recursively, oftentimes using double recursion, which exemplifies this gap.</description>

      <title>Persistent Stiefel-Whitney Classes of Tangent Bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stiefel-Whitney classes are invariants of the tangent bundle of a smooth manifold, represented as cohomology classes of the base manifold. Given a point cloud, we construct a \v{C}ech or alpha filtration. By applying the Wu formula in a persistent setting, we derive a sequence of persistent cohomology classes from the filtration. We show that if the filtration is homotopy equivalent to a smooth manifold, then one of these persistent cohomology classes corresponds to the $k$-th Stiefel-Whitney class of the tangent bundle of that manifold. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we present experiments on real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>A Tail Estimate with Exponential Decay for the Randomized Incremental Construction of Search Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.04914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2101.04914v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Randomized Incremental Construction (RIC) of search DAGs for point location in planar subdivisions, nearest-neighbor search in 2D points, and extreme point search in 3D convex hulls, are well known to take ${\cal O}(n \log n)$ expected time for structures of ${\cal O}(n)$ expected size. Moreover, searching takes w.h.p. ${\cal O}(\log n)$ comparisons in the first and w.h.p. ${\cal O}(\log^2 n)$ comparisons in the latter two DAGs. However, the expected depth of the DAGs and high probability bounds for their size are unknown.
  Using a novel analysis technique, we show that the three DAGs have w.h.p. i) a size of ${\cal O}(n)$, ii) a depth of ${\cal O}(\log n)$, and iii) a construction time of ${\cal O}(n \log n)$. One application of these new and improved results are \emph{remarkably simple} Las Vegas verifiers to obtain search DAGs with optimal worst-case bounds. This positively answers the conjectured logarithmic search cost in the DAG of Delaunay triangulations [Guibas et al.; ICALP 1990] and a conjecture on the depth of the DAG of Trapezoidal subdivisions [Hemmer et al.; ESA 2012].</description>

      <title>When alpha-complexes collapse onto codimension-1 submanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10388v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a finite set of points $P$ sampling an unknown smooth surface $\mathcal{M} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^3$, our goal is to triangulate $\mathcal{M}$ based solely on $P$. Assuming $\mathcal{M}$ is a smooth orientable submanifold of codimension 1 in $\mathbb{R}^d$, we introduce a simple algorithm, Naive Squash, which simplifies the $\alpha$-complex of $P$ by repeatedly applying a new type of collapse called vertical relative to $\mathcal{M}$. Naive Squash also has a practical version that does not require knowledge of $\mathcal{M}$. We establish conditions under which both the naive and practical Squash algorithms output a triangulation of $\mathcal{M}$. We provide a bound on the angle formed by triangles in the $\alpha$-complex with $\mathcal{M}$, yielding sampling conditions on $P$ that are competitive with existing literature for smooth surfaces embedded in $\mathbb{R}^3$, while offering a more compartmentalized proof. As a by-product, we obtain that the restricted Delaunay complex of $P$ triangulates $\mathcal{M}$ when $\mathcal{M}$ is a smooth surface in $\mathbb{R}^3$ under weaker conditions than existing ones.</description>
