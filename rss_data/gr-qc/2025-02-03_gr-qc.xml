      <title>The Resolution of the Gauge Problem of Cosmology provides Insight into the Formation of the First Structures in the Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to four fundamental problems in the field of cosmological perturbation theory. Firstly, the issue of gauge dependence has been addressed by demonstrating the existence of unique and gauge-invariant quantities corresponding to the actual perturbations. Secondly, the formation of primordial structures after decoupling of matter and radiation is dependent on the existence of local fluid flows resulting from local pressure gradients. To take pressure gradients into account, it is necessary to consider both the energy density and the particle number density. Thirdly, the novel relativistic perturbation theory applies to an open, flat, and closed Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker universe. The derivation of the novel perturbation theory definitively reveals the inherent limitations of Newtonian gravitation as a framework for investigating cosmological density perturbations. Finally, the application of the perturbation theory to a flat universe demonstrates that, prior to decoupling, perturbations in both Cold Dark Matter and ordinary matter are coupled to perturbations in radiation. Therefore, the universe's earliest structures formed only after decoupling, at which point local nonadiabatic random pressure fluctuations became a significant factor. Negative nonadiabatic pressure fluctuations resulted in a brief, rapid growth of density fluctuations until the total pressure fluctuations became positive. In contrast, positive nonadiabatic pressure fluctuations led to the formation of voids. Perturbations with masses about $2.2\times10^{4}\text{M}_\odot$ became nonlinear already $60$ million years after the Big Bang, and perturbations with masses between $6.7\times10^2\text{M}_\odot$ and $1.2\times10^6\text{M}_\odot$ became nonlinear within about $600$ million years.</description>

      <title>Electroweak clouds supported by magnetically charged black holes: Analytic treatment along the existence-line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has recently been revealed [R. Gervalle and M. S. Volkov, Phys. Rev. Lett. (2024)] that magnetically charged black holes of the composed Einstein-Weinberg-Salam field theory can support bound-state hairy configurations of electroweak fields. In the present paper we study, using {\it analytical} techniques, the physical and mathematical properties of the supported linearized electroweak fields (spatially regular electroweak 'clouds') in the dimensionless large-mass $\mu\equiv m_{\text{w}} r_+\gg1$ regime of the composed black-hole-field system (here $m_{\text{w}}$ is the mass of the supported W-boson field and $r_+$ is the outer horizon radius of the central supporting black hole). In particular, we derive a remarkably compact formula for the discrete resonance spectrum $\{\mu_k(n)\}_{k=0}^{k=\infty}$ that characterizes the composed black-hole-linearized-field configurations, where the integer $n\equiv 2Pe\in\mathbb{Z}$ characterizes the discrete charge parameter $P$ of the central magnetic Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole and $e$ is the electron charge. The physical significance of the analytically derived resonant spectrum stems from the fact that, in the dimensionless large-charge $n\gg1$ regime, the fundamental (largest) eigenvalue $\mu_0(n)$ determines the critical existence-line of the composed Einstein-Weinberg-Salam theory, a boundary line that separates hairy magnetic-black-hole-electroweak-field bound-state configurations from bald magnetic Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes.</description>

      <title>On the unexpected geometrical origin of the algebra of symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fundamental symmetries in gravity and gauge theories, formulated using differential forms, are gauge transformations and diffeomorphisms. These symmetries act in distinct ways on different dynamical fields. Yet, the commutator of these symmetries forms a closed, field-independent algebra. This work uncovers a natural correspondence between this algebra and the Lie bracket of some vector fields on the principal fiber bundle associated with the physical theory, providing a geometric interpretation of the symmetry algebra. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the symmetry algebra is independent of the connection. Finally, we analyze an example illustrating how a specific connection, associated with Lorentz-Lie transformations, simplifies the symmetry algebra in the presence of spacetime Killing vector fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.19044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We systematically investigate the effects of quantum gravity on the ground-state properties of dilute homogeneous dipolar Bose gases using the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov theory based on the generalized uncertainty principle. We calculate quantum gravity corrections to the condensed fraction, the equation of state, the critical temperature and the superfluid fraction. Improved upper bounds on the generalized uncertainty principle parameters are found. We compare our predictions with previous experimental and theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter and Energy-Momentum Squared Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we examine the energy-momentum squared modified theory of gravity, where the squared term $T_{\mu\nu}T^{\mu\nu}$ is incorporated into the conventional gravitational Lagrangian. This modification aims to account for dark matter effects on galactic scales. Specifically, we analyze the model near general relativity solutions for spherically symmetric and static metrics. By fixing the components using the rotational velocities of galaxies, the model demonstrates the emergence of a flat rotation curve in the galactic halo. Additionally, we investigate the proposed model's predictions for the light deflection angle and radar echo delay.</description>

      <title>Resumming Post-Minkowskian and Post-Newtonian gravitational waveform expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gravitational waveform emitted by a particle moving in a Schwarzschild geometry can be computed, in perturbation theory, as a double series expansion in the limit where distances are large with respect to the size of the horizon, $z=2M/r\ll 1$ (Post-Minkowskian approximation), but small with respect to the gravitational wavelength, $y=2{\rm i} \omega r\ll 1$ (Post-Newtonian approximation). While in the case of bounded systems the two expansions are linked, for scattering processes they describe complementary regions of spacetime. In this paper, we derive all order formulae for those two expansions of the waveform, where the entire dependence on the $y$ or $z$ variables is resummed under the assumption $\omega M\ll 1$. The results are based on a novel hypergeometric representation of the confluent Heun functions and provide a new derivation of the recently discovered Heun connection formulae. Similar results are found for the non-confluent Heun case. Finally, in the case of circular orbits we compute our formulae at order 30PN and show excellent agreement against solutions obtained via numerical integrations and the MST method.</description>

      <title>Information Metrics and Possible Limitations of Local Information Objectivity in Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Local information objectivity, that local observers can infer the same information about a model upon exchange of experimental data, is fundamental to science. It is mathematically encoded via Cencov's theorem: the Fisher information metric is the unique metric invariant under sufficient statistics. However, quantum gravity typically violates some of the Cencov assumptions, allowing the Fisher metric and Born rule to vary between observers. We explain these violations, some possible experimental tests, and a new quantum gravity approach based on generally covariant information geometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove Hawking's singularity theorem for spacetime metrics of local Lipschitz regularity. The proof rests on (1) new estimates for the Ricci curvature of regularising smooth metrics that are based upon a quite general Friedrichs-type lemma and (2) the replacement of the usual focusing techniques for timelike geodesics -- which in the absence of a classical ODE-theory for the initial value problem are no longer available -- by a worldvolume estimate based on a segment-type inequality that allows one to control the volume of the set of points in a spacelike surface that possess long maximisers.</description>

      <title>Novel Scalings of Neutron Star Properties from Analyzing Dimensionless Tolman--Oppenheimer--Volkoff Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The TOV equations govern the radial evolution of pressure and energy density in static neutron stars (NSs) in hydrodynamical equilibrium. Using the reduced pressure and energy density with respect to the NS central energy density, the original TOV equations can be recast into dimensionless forms. While the traditionally used integral approach for solving the original TOV equations require an input nuclear Equation of State (EOS), the dimensionless TOV equations can be anatomized by using the reduced pressure and energy density as polynomials of the reduced radial coordinate without using any input nuclear EOS. Interesting and novel perspectives about NS core EOS can be extracted directly from NS observables using this new approach based on Intrinsic and Perturbative Analyses of the Dimensionless (IPAD) TOV equations (IPAD-TOV). In this review, we first discuss the length and energy density scales of NSs as well as the dimensionless TOV equations for scaled variables and their perturbative solutions near NS cores. We then review several new insights into NS physics gained from using the IPAD-TOV. We also demonstrate that the strong-field gravity plays a fundamental role in extruding a peak in the density/radius profile of the speed of sound squared (SSS) in massive NS cores independent of the nuclear EOS. Finally, some future perspectives of NS research using the IPAD-TOV are outlined.</description>

      <title>Localizing Dynamically-Formed Black Hole Binaries in Milky Way Globular Clusters with LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamical formation of binary black holes (BBHs) in globular clusters (GCs) may contribute significantly to the observed gravitational wave (GW) merger rate. Furthermore, LISA may detect many BBH sources from GCs at mHz frequencies, enabling the characterization of such systems within the Milky Way and nearby Universe. In this work, we use Monte Carlo N-body simulations to construct a realistic sample of Galactic clusters, thus estimating the population, detectability, and parameter measurement accuracy of BBHs hosted within them. In particular, we show that the GW signal from $0.7\pm 0.7$, $2.0\pm 1.7$, $3.6\pm 2.3$, $13.4\pm 4.7$ BBHs in Milky Way GCs can exceed the signal-to-noise ratio threshold of $\rm SNR =30$, 5, 3, and 1 for a 10-year LISA observation, with $\sim 50\%$ of detectable sources exhibiting high eccentricities ($e\gtrsim0.9$). Moreover, the Fisher matrix and Bayesian analyses of the GW signals indicate these systems typically feature highly-resolved orbital frequencies ($\delta f_{\rm orb}/ f_{\rm orb} \sim 10^{-7}-10^{-5}$) and eccentricities ($\delta e/ e \sim 10^{-3}-0.1$), as well as a measurable total mass when SNR exceeds $\sim20$. Notably, BBHs with $\rm SNR\gtrsim 20$ can be confidently localized to specific GCs within the Milky Way, with an angular resolution of $\sim 10-100$ arc minutes. The detection and localization of even a single BBH in a Galactic GC would allow accurate tracking of its long-term orbital evolution, enable a direct test of the role of GCs in BBH formation, and provide a unique probe into the evolutionary history of Galactic clusters.</description>

      <title>Extracting the Temperature Analytically In Hydrodynamics Simulations with Gas and Radiation Pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerical hydrodynamics simulations of gases dominated by ideal, nondegenerate matter pressure and thermal radiation pressure in equilibrium entail finding the temperature as part of the evolution. Since the temperature is not typically a variable that is evolved independently, it must be extracted from the the evolved variables (e.g. the rest-mass density and specific internal energy). This extraction requires solving a quartic equation, which, in many applications, is done numerically using an iterative root-finding method. Here we show instead how the equation can be solved analytically and provide explicit expressions for the solution. We also derive Taylor expansions in limiting regimes and discuss the respective advantages and disadvantages of the iterative versus analytic approaches to solving the quartic.</description>

      <title>A confirmed recoiling supermassive black hole in a powerful quasar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supermassive black holes (SMBH) are thought to grow through accretion of matter and mergers. Models of SMBH mergers have long suffered the final parsec problem, where SMBH binaries may stall before energy loss from gravitational waves (GW) becomes significant, leaving the pair unmerged. Direct evidence of coalesced SMBH remains elusive. Theory predicts that GW recoiling black holes can occur following a black hole merger. Here we present decisive spectroscopic evidence that the gas bound to the SMBH in the spatially offset quasar 3C 186 is blue-shifted relative to the host galaxy. This is exclusively explained by the GW recoil super-kick scenario. This confirmation of the ejection process implies that the final parsec problem is resolved in nature, providing evidence that even the most massive black holes can merge.</description>

      <title>Convective stability analysis of massive neutron stars formed in binary mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform fully general-relativistic hydrodynamics simulations of binary neutron star mergers over $100\,\rm ms$ post-merger to investigate the dynamics of remnant massive neutron stars (NSs). Our focus is mainly on the analysis of convective stability and mode characteristics of the massive NSs. We derive stability criteria for hot, differentially rotating relativistic stars that account for both buoyant and rotational restoring forces, and apply them for the first time to the post-merger massive NSs. Our results show no evidence of large-scale convective instability, as both angle-averaged specific entropy and specific angular momentum increase outward within the massive NSs. Rotational effects significantly enhance stability for local regions that would be otherwise unstable by the Schwarzschild criterion. Additionally, our mode analysis of matter fields and gravitational waves reveals no excitation of inertial modes after the damping of quadrupolar $f$-modes in the massive NSs, contrasting with previous studies. As in many previous works, we observe the excitation of an $m=1$ one-armed mode. However, we also find that the growth of the $m=1$ mode amplitude after the merger may correlate strongly with the violation of linear momentum conservation, indicating that we cannot reject the possibility that the excitation of the one-armed mode has a numerical origin.</description>

      <title>Temperature-redshift relation in energy-momentum-powered gravity models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There has been recent interest in the cosmological consequences of energy-momentum-powered gravity models, in which the matter side of Einstein's equations includes a term proportional to some power, $n$, of the energy-momentum tensor, in addition to the canonical linear term. Previous works have suggested that these models can lead to a recent accelerating universe without a cosmological constant, but they can also be seen as phenomenological extensions of the standard $\Lambda$CDM, which are observationally constrained to be close to the $\Lambda$CDM limit. Here we show that these models violate the temperature-redshift relation, and are therefore further constrained by astrophysical measurements of the cosmic microwave background temperature. We provide joint constraints on these models from the combination of astrophysical and background cosmological data, showing that this power is constrained to be about $|n|&lt;0.01$ and $|n|&lt;0.1$, respectively in models without and with a cosmological constant, and improving previous constraints on this parameter by more than a factor of three. By breaking degeneracies between this parameter and the matter density, constraints on the latter are also improved by a factor of about two.</description>

Abstract: We give a dual CFT representation of MHV leaf amplitudes in the large $N$ and semiclassical limit in terms of non-compact parafermions and a single affine Kac-Moody current for $SO(N)$. This representation is consistent with the other 2D CFT realization of 4D leaf amplitudes proposed in the literature, which is based on a dressed Liouville theory. The equivalence between the two CFT descriptions arises from the $H_3^+$ WZW-Liouville correspondence, applied to the $SL(2,\mathbb{R})/U(1)$ coset theory in the spectrally flowed sector.</description>

      <title>Spin oscillations of neutrinos scattered by the supermassive black hole in the galactic center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the propagation and spin oscillations of neutrinos in their scattering by a supermassive black hole (SMBH) surrounded by a realistic accretion disk. We use a semi-analytical model of a thick accretion disk which can co-rotate and counter-rotate with respect to BH. Moreover, we assume that a disk contains only a toroidal magnetic magnetic field of moderate strength. Spin precession of neutrinos, which are supposed to be Dirac particles, is caused by the interaction of the neutrino magnetic moment with the magnetic field in the disk. We consider the incoming flux of neutrinos having an arbitrary angle with respect to the BH spin since the recent results of the Event Horizon Telescope indicate that the BH spin in the galactic center is not always perpendicular to the galactic plane. For our study, we consider a large number of incoming test neutrinos. We briefly discuss our results and their applications in the observations of astrophysical neutrinos.</description>

      <title>Remarks on overestimating the effects of inhomogeneities on the Hubble constant</title>

Abstract: The Hubble constant is one of the most important parameters in cosmology. Discrepancies in values of the Hubble constant estimated from various measurements, the so-called Hubble tension, are a serious problem. In this paper, we study the effects of small-scale inhomogeneities of structure formation on the measurement of the Hubble constant using the luminosity distance-redshift relation. By adopting the adhesion model in Newtonian cosmology as the model of structure formation, we investigate whether or not the effects of inhomogeneities can be sufficiently large to affect the current observations of the Hubble constant. We show that inappropriate treatment of the effects of inhomogeneities can cause a large deviation of the measured value of the Hubble constant from the background value, whose magnitude is comparable with the Hubble tension. Our main message is the importance of adopting an appropriate model of structure formation to investigate the effects of inhomogeneities. We also add discussion on the spatial averaging approach used to estimate the measured Hubble constant in the inhomogeneous universe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19012v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phase transitions can play an important role in the cosmological constant problem, allowing the underlying vacuum energy, and therefore the value of the cosmological constant, to change. Deep within the core of neutron stars, the local pressure may be sufficiently high to trigger the QCD phase transition, thus generating a shift in the value of the cosmological constant. The gravitational effects of such a transition should then be imprinted on the properties of the star. Working in the framework of General Relativity, we provide a new model of the stellar interior, allowing for a QCD and a vacuum energy phase transition. We determine the impact of a vacuum energy jump on mass-radius relations, tidal deformability-radius relations, I-Love-Q relations and on the combined tidal deformability measured in neutron star binaries.</description>

      <title>On the overlap reduction function of pulsar timing array searches for gravitational waves in modified gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04464v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) searches for gravitational waves (GWs) aim to detect a characteristic correlation pattern in the timing residuals of galactic millisecond pulsars. This pattern is described by the PTA overlap reduction function (ORF) \Gamma_ab(\xi_ab), which is known as the Hellings--Downs (HD) curve in general relativity (GR). In theories of modified gravity, the HD curve often receives corrections. Assuming, e.g., a subluminal GW phase velocity, one finds a drastically enhanced ORF in the limit of small angular separations between pulsar a and pulsar b in the sky, \xi_ab --&gt; 0. In particular, working in harmonic space and performing an approximate resummation of all multipole contributions, the auto correlation coefficient \Gamma_aa seems to diverge. In this paper, we confirm that this divergence is unphysical and provide an exact and analytical expression for \Gamma_aa in dependence of the pulsar distance L_a and the GW phase velocity v_ph. In the GR limit and assuming a large pulsar distance, our expression reduces to \Gamma_aa = 1. In the case of subluminal phase velocity, we show that the regularization of the naive divergent result is a finite-distance effect, meaning that \Gamma_aa scales linearly with fL_a, where f is the GW frequency. For superluminal phase velocity (subluminal group velocity), which is relevant in the case of massive gravity, we correct an earlier analytical result for \Gamma_ab. Our results pave the way for fitting modified-gravity theories with nonstandard phase velocity to PTA data, which requires a proper understanding of the auto correlation coefficient \Gamma_aa.</description>

      <title>Periodic orbits and gravitational wave radiation in short hair black hole spacetimes for an extreme mass ratio system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01979v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a short hair black hole(BH) which circumvents the "no-short-hair" theorem, it manifests intense hair behavior in the vicinity of the event horizon, accompanied by remarkable quantum effects. These effects may carry important information about the internal structure and dynamical evolution of BHs, thereby providing a new perspective on the problem of black hole information loss. Therefore, in this paper, we analyze the influence of the hair parameter $Q_m$ and the structural parameter $k$ of the short hair BH in an extreme mass ratio(EMR) system on the periodic orbits of particles and gravitational wave radiation. The results show that as $Q_m$ increases, the radius and angular momentum of the bound orbit decrease, and the $E-L$ space shifts to the left. An increase in $k$ weakens this trend. When $k$ takes a larger value, the short hair BH and the Schwarzschild BH tend to be degenerate. Compared with the Schwarzschild BH, the bound orbit energy and angular momentum of the short hair black hole are reduced. Under the conditions of higher $Q_m$ and lower $k$, the gravitational wave period is suppressed and the signal amplitude is significantly increased. These results provide new observational means for distinguishing short hair BH from classical BH and offer new insights for verifying the no-hair theorem and understanding the physical behavior near the event horizon.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave propagation beyond General Relativity: geometric optic expansion and lens-induced dispersion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07164v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nature of gravity can be tested by how gravitational waves (GWs) are emitted, detected, and propagate through the universe. Propagation tests are powerful, as small deviations compound over cosmological distances. However, GW propagation tests of theories beyond Einstein's general relativity (GR) are limited by the high degree of symmetry of the average cosmological spacetime. Deviations from homogeneity, i.e. gravitational lenses, allow for new interactions, e.g., between standard GW polarization and new scalar or vector fields, with different spin. Therefore, GW lensing beyond GR offers novel tests of cosmological gravity. Here we present the theory of GW propagation beyond GR in the short-wave expansion, including corrections to the leading-order amplitude and phase for the first time. As an example, we compute the dispersive (frequency-dependent) corrections to all metric and scalar field perturbations in Brans-Dicke, the simplest modified theory exhibiting GW dispersion. GW lensing effects are too small to observe in Brans-Dicke theories compatible with solar system and binary pulsar limits. Nevertheless, our formalism opens the possibility of novel tests of gravity, including dark-energy theories and screening mechanisms.</description>

Abstract: We present the canonical analysis of different versions of unimodular gravity defined in the Pleba\'nski formalism, based on a (generally complex) SO(3) spin connection and set of (self-dual) two-forms. As in the metric formulation of unimodular gravity, one can study either a theory with fixed volume form or work in a parametrised formalism in which the cosmological constant becomes a dynamical field, constrained to be constant by the field equations. In the first case, the Hamiltonian density contains a part which is not constrained to vanish, but rather constrained to be constant, again as in the metric formulation. We also discuss reality conditions and challenges in extracting Lorentzian solutions.</description>

      <title>Clusternets: A deep learning approach to probe clustering dark energy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.03517v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are becoming popular in cosmology for extracting valuable information from cosmological data. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on matter density snapshots to distinguish clustering Dark Energy (DE) from the cosmological constant scenario and to detect the speed of sound ($c_s$) associated with clustering DE. We compare the CNN results with those from a Random Forest (RF) algorithm trained on power spectra. Varying the dark energy equation of state parameter $w_{\rm{DE}}$ within the range of -0.7 to -0.99, while keeping $c_s^2 = 1$, we find that the CNN approach results in a significant improvement in accuracy over the RF algorithm. The improvement in classification accuracy can be as high as $40\%$ depending on the physical scales involved. We also investigate the ML algorithms' ability to detect the impact of the speed of sound by choosing $c_s^2$ from the set $\{1, 10^{-2}, 10^{-4}, 10^{-7}\}$ while maintaining a constant $w_{\rm DE}$ for three different cases: $w_{\rm DE} \in \{-0.7, -0.8, -0.9\}$. Our results suggest that distinguishing between various values of $c_s^2$ and the case where $c_s^2=1$ is challenging, particularly at small scales and when $w_{\rm{DE}}\approx -1$. However, as we consider larger scales, the accuracy of $c_s^2$ detection improves. Notably, the CNN algorithm consistently outperforms the RF algorithm, leading to an approximate $20\%$ enhancement in $c_s^2$ detection accuracy in some cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02409v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For most of cosmic history, the evolution of our Universe has been governed by the physics of a 'dark sector', consisting of dark matter and dark energy, whose properties are only understood in a schematic way. The influence of these constituents is mediated exclusively by the force of gravity, meaning that insight into their nature must be gleaned from gravitational phenomena. The advent of gravitational-wave astronomy has revolutionised the field of black hole astrophysics, and opens a new window of discovery for cosmological sources. Relevant examples include topological defects, such as domain walls or cosmic strings, which are remnants of a phase transition. Here we present the first simulations of cosmic structure formation in which the dynamics of the dark sector introduces domain walls as a source of stochastic gravitational waves in the late Universe. We study in detail how the spectrum of gravitational waves is affected by the properties of the model, and extrapolate the results to scales relevant to the recent evidence for a stochastic gravitational wave background. Our relativistic implementation of the field dynamics paves the way for optimal use of the next generation of gravitational experiments to unravel the dark sector.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06548v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is often noted that many of the basic concepts of differential geometry, such as the definition of connection, are purely algebraic in nature. Here, we review and extend existing work on fully algebraic formulations of differential geometry which eliminate the need for an underlying manifold. While the literature contains various independent approaches to this, we focus on one particular approach that we argue to be the most natural one based on the definition of "algebraifold", by which we mean a commutative algebra $\mathcal{A}$ for which the module of derivations of $\mathcal{A}$ is finitely generated projective. Over $\mathbb{R}$ as the base ring, this class of algebras includes the algebra $C^\infty(M)$ of smooth functions on a manifold $M$, and similarly for analytic functions. An importantly different example is the Colombeau algebra of generalized functions on $M$, which makes distributional differential geometry an instance of our formalism. Another instance is a fibred version of smooth differential geometry, since any smooth submersion $M \to N$ makes $C^\infty(M)$ into an algebraifold with $C^\infty(N)$ as the base ring. Over any field $k$ of characteristic zero, examples include the algebra of regular functions on a smooth affine variety as well as any function field.
  Our development of differential geometry in terms of algebraifolds comprises tensors, connections, curvature, geodesics and we briefly consider general relativity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17908v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a pipeline to infer the equation of state of neutron stars from observations based on deep neural networks. In particular, using the standard (deterministic), as well as Bayesian (probabilistic) deep networks, we explore how one can infer the interior speed of sound of the star given a set of mock observations of total stellar mass, stellar radius and tidal deformability. We discuss in detail the construction of our simulated dataset of stellar observables starting from the solution of the gravitational equations, as well as the relevant architectures for the deep networks, along with their performance and accuracy. We further explain how our pipeline is capable to detect a possible QCD phase transition in the stellar core. Our results show that deep networks offer a promising tool towards solving the inverse problem of neutron stars, and the accurate inference of their interior from future stellar observations.</description>

Abstract: We propose a novel approach using neural networks (NNs) to differentiate between cosmological models, and implemented LIME as an interpretability approach to identify the key features influencing our model's decisions. We show the potential of NNs to enhance the extraction of meaningful information from cosmological large-scale structure data, based on current galaxy-clustering survey specifications, for the cosmological constant and cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model and the Hu-Sawicki $f(R)$ model. We find that the NN can successfully distinguish between $\Lambda$CDM and the $f(R)$ models, by predicting the correct model with approximately $97\%$ overall accuracy, thus demonstrating that NNs can maximize the potential of current and next generation surveys to probe for deviations from general relativity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15425v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the conditions for finding an island in an anisotropic universe - Bianchi Type-I filled with radiation. We verify that the existence of islands does not depend on their shape. We then find that islands may form at certain times, near the turnaround point - where the universe turns from contraction to expansion in one of the directions. This is in line with previous analyses regarding cosmological space-times where islands form if one has two energy scales in the problem, such as the typical temperature of the universe and, on top of that, cosmological constant, curvature, anisotropy, or some mass scale.</description>

Abstract: The reheating temperature plays a crucial role in the early universe's evolution, marking the transition from inflation to the radiation-dominated era. It directly impacts the number of $e$-folds and, consequently, the observable parameters of inflation, such as the spectral index of scalar perturbations. By establishing a relationship between the gravitational reheating temperature and the spectral index, we can derive constraints on inflationary models. Specifically, the range of viable reheating temperatures imposes bounds on the spectral index, which can then be compared with observational data, such as those from the Planck satellite, to test the consistency of various models with cosmological observations. Additionally, in the context of dark matter production, we demonstrate that gravitational reheating provides a viable mechanism when there is a relationship between the mass of the dark matter particles and the mass of the particles responsible for reheating. This connection offers a pathway to link dark matter genesis with inflationary and reheating parameters, allowing for a unified perspective on early universe dynamics.</description>

      <title>Boundaries, frames and the issue of physical covariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00993v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We focus on three distinct lines of recent developments: edge modes and boundary charges in gravitational physics, relational dynamics in classical and quantum gravity, and quantum reference frames. We argue that these research directions are in fact linked in multiple ways, and can be seen as different aspects of the same research programme. This research programme has two main physical goals and one general focus, as well as broader conceptual implications. The physical goals are to move beyond the two idealizations/approximations of asymptotic or closed boundary conditions in gravitational physics and of ideal reference frames (coded in coordinate frames or gauge fixings), thus achieving a more realistic modelling of (quantum) gravitational physical phenomena. These two goals combine to identify a key open issue: a proper characterization of physical covariance, i.e. covariance across fully physical (as opposed to idealized) reference frames. The broader conceptual implications concern the influence of observers in physics and possible physical limits to objectivity.</description>

      <title>State-space algorithm for detecting the nanohertz gravitational wave background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06990v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) can be observed in the nanohertz band using a pulsar timing array (PTA). Here a computationally efficient state-space framework is developed for analysing SGWB data, in which the stochastic gravitational wave strain at Earth is tracked with a non-linear Kalman filter and separated simultaneously from intrinsic, achromatic pulsar spin wandering. The filter is combined with a nested sampler to estimate the parameters of the model, and to calculate a Bayes factor for selecting between models with and without a SGWB. The procedure extends previous state-space formulations of PTA data analysis applied to individually resolvable binary black hole sources. The performance of the new algorithm is tested on synthetic data from the first International PTA Mock Data Challenge. It is shown that the algorithm distinguishes a SGWB from pure noise for $A_{\rm gw} \geq 3 \times 10^{-14}$, where $A_{\rm gw}$ denotes the standard normalization factor for a power spectral density with power-law exponent $-13/3$. Additional, systematic validation tests are also performed with synthetic data generated independently by adjusting the injected parameters to cover astrophysically plausible ranges. Full posterior distributions are recovered and tested for accuracy. The state-space procedure is memory-light and evaluates the likelihood for a standard-sized PTA dataset in $\lesssim 10^{-1}$ s without optimization on a standard central processing unit.</description>

      <title>Critical String Theory in a $D=4$ Robertson-Walker Background and the Large Scale Structure of Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17204v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that $4$-dimensional Robertson-Walker spacetimes can be constructed for which all of the beta functions vanish to leading order, yielding consistent string theory without extra dimensions. We find that there is a unique static solution, which we refer to as an anti-Einstein static universe. The associated stress energy tensor can be interpreted as a perfect fluid with a negative energy density. Interestingly, a fluid with a negative energy density was proposed in [2] as an ad hoc hypothesis to serve as a possible explanation for dark energy and dark matter. Here, such a fluid spontaneously appears by trying to fit string theory into only $4$ dimensions. We can look at perturbations away from the anti-Einstein static universe. This has to be done numerically and we only do it for a few choices of initial conditions. We find that these solutions are very sensitive to the initial conditions and yield a variety of behaviors. We hope that this behavior is rich enough to match cosmological observations by appropriately choosing the initial conditions. One of these solutions that we found is particularly interesting. It has a hubble parameter which is negative in the past (meaning a contracting universe), then a point at which the hubble parameter changes sign, so the universe starts expanding which could be identified with a big bang, after which the hubble parameter continues growing. Throughout all of this time, the acceleration is positive since the Hubble parameter is increasing. Finally, we comment that our result does not contradict [1] as it seems that the authors overlooked the possibility of a purely complex axion field which allows for the Robertson-Walker metrics to make a contribution $c_{RW}\geq 4$ to the central charge. Thus, we can interpret dark matter and dark energy as being parts of a mechanism needed to keep $4$-dimensional string theory consistent.</description>
