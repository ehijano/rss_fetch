      <title>Operator-Consistent Physics-Informed Learning for Wafer Thermal Reconstruction in Lithography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal field reconstruction in post-exposure bake (PEB) is critical for advanced lithography, but current methods lack consistent accuracy and physical alignment. To bridge this gap, we introduce a physics-informed neural model that unifies coordinates, fields, and differential operators on a single computation graph using gated liquid layers. Applied to a 2D PEB scenario with internal heat generation and convective boundaries, the model formulates residuals via differential forms and a loss functional integrating closure, balance, and trace misfits. The results demonstrate rapid convergence, uniformly low errors, and strong agreement with FEM benchmarks, achieving stable training without oscillation. Our framework outperforms existing baselines in accuracy and robustness, establishing a reliable foundation for high-fidelity thermal modeling and offering a transferable strategy for operator-consistent neural surrogates in other physical domains.</description>

      <title>A Morphology-Adaptive Random Feature Method for Inverse Source Problem of the Helmholtz Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inverse source problem for the Helmholtz equation poses significant challenges, particularly when sources exhibit complex or discontinuous geometries. Traditional numerical methods suffer from prohibitive computational costs, while machine learning-based approaches such as Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and the Random Feature Method (RFM) -- though computationally efficient for inverse problems -- lack the intrinsic machinery to handle the sharp morphological features in such singular problems, leading to inaccurate solutions. To address this issue, we propose the Morphology-Adaptive Random Feature Method (MA-RFM), a novel two-phase framework that adaptively locates critical regions and adds morphology activation functions for tackling the multi-frequency inverse source problem with complex geometry. Our framework recasts the ill-posed inverse problem into a well-posed, strictly convex optimization problem by reformulating the governing Helmholtz equation as a Tikhonov-regularized integral equation via its fundamental solution. In the first stage, the Integral Adaptive RFM (IA-RFM), employs an adaptive algorithm to rapidly localize the source support, thereby reducing computational overhead and accelerating convergence.
  In the second stage, posterior geometric information is progressively integrated into the solver via hybrid basis functions, enabling a precise reconstruction of complex morphologies. The MA-RFM extends the capabilities of RFM to handle PDEs with singular solutions while preserving its mesh-free efficiency. We demonstrate the superior performance of our approach through ample challenging 2D and 3D benchmark problems, even under limited and noisy measurement conditions, highlighting its robustness and accuracy in reconstructing complex and disjoint sources.</description>

      <title>Modeling Protein Diffusion Across ER-Nuclear Envelope Junctions Reveals Efficient Transport via Simple Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the largest continuous membrane-bound organelle in the cell and plays a central role in the synthesis and turnover of many lipids and proteins. It connects directly to the nucleus through specialized contact points known as ER-nuclear envelope (NE) junctions. In our recent study, we found that these ER-NE junctions are both narrow and infrequent, measuring less than 20 nanometers in diameter and occurring at a frequency of approximately 0.1 per square micrometer. However, it remains unclear whether such limited and narrow connections are sufficient to support efficient transport between the ER and NE. Here, we built a mathematical model of ER-to-NE protein diffusion, incorporating ultrastructural parameters, the frequency of ER-NE junctions, and the diffusion coefficient of proteins within the ER lumen. To validate the model, we experimentally quantified the transport rate of ER luminal proteins to the NE using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). Our model and experimental data demonstrate that simple diffusion is sufficient to account for the rapid transport of proteins from the ER to the NE, despite the limited and narrow nature of the connecting junctions. Together, these findings offer mechanistic insight into how ER-NE connectivity enables rapid protein transport and lay the groundwork for future studies on ER-nucleus communication.</description>

      <title>On elastic and non-elastic wave superpositions for the Euler system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper contains an analysis of the conditions for the existence of elastic versus non-elastic wave superpositions governed by the Euler system in (1+1)-dimensions. This system admits entropic solutions and two types of sound wave solutions. It is shown that the smallest real Lie algebra containing vector fields (associated with these waves) is isomorphic to a semidirect sum of the infinite-dimensional Abelian real Lie algebra and the non-Abelian finite-dimensional real Lie algebra. Based on this fact, we are able to find a parametrization of the region of non-elastic wave superpositions which allows for the construction of the reduced form of the Euler system. It is proven that, in this case, the manifold spanned by the vector fields associated with waves possesses the structure of a local Lie group. It is also shown that this manifold has a torsion-free affine connection and the one-parameter subgroups of the Lie group are geodesics. Based on this fact, a description of the non-elastic wave superposition is given in terms of motion of the quasi-rectifiable surfaces spanned by the pair of vector fields associated with sound waves.</description>

      <title>Generalised fractional Rabi problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fractional quantum dynamics provides a natural framework to capture nonlocal temporal behavior and memory effects in quantum systems. In this work, we analyze the physical consequences of fractional-order quantum evolution using a Green's function formulation based on the Caputo fractional derivative. Explicit iterative expressions for the evolved state are derived and applied to an extended two-level Rabi model, a paradigmatic setting for coherent quantum control. We find that even in the absence of external driving, the static Hamiltonian term induces non-trivial spin dynamics with damping features directly linked to the fractional temporal nonlocality. When a periodically varying driving field is introduced, the competition between energy injection and memory effects gives rise to a richer dynamical behavior, manifest in the evolution of spin polarization, autocorrelation function, and fidelity. Unlike the standard Rabi oscillations characterized by a fixed frequency, the fractional regime introduces controllable damping and dephasing governed by the degree of fractionality. These distinctive signatures could be observable through the Loschmidt echo and autocorrelation function, and would offer potential routes to probe fractional quantum dynamics experimentally. Our findings open pathways toward exploring memory-induced dynamical phenomena in other systems effectively described by a two-level approximation, such as graphene-like materials and topological SSH chains, where non-integer order evolution may reveal novel topological or relaxation effects.</description>

      <title>An investigation into the combined effect of steady and pulsatile flow within a wavy channel filled with an anisotropic porous medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide an analytical solution to examine the impact of steady and pulsatile flow in a symmetric wavy channel filled with an anisotropic porous medium. The flow inside the wavy channel with a porous substrate is governed by the Darcy-Brinkman equation. We used the perturbation approach to ascertain the solution to the problem, assuming that the ratio between the channel width and the wavelength is very small (i.e., $\delta^2 \ll 1$). We solved the problem up to $O(\delta^2)$ by assuming $\lambda^2 \delta^2 \ll 1$, where $\lambda$ is the ratio of anisotropic permeability. Our primary objective is to investigate how the anisotropic permeability ratio influences flow reversal near the crest and trough of a wavy wall under both steady flow conditions and when a pulsatile component is superimposed on the steady flow. In the case of steady flow, flow separation occurs near the crest region of the wavy wall, leading to the formation of recirculating zones where fluid becomes trapped. In contrast, for pulsatile flow as well as combined effects of steady and pulsatile flow, vortices form transiently at certain phases of the pulsation cycle. Subsequently, these vortices bulge into the mainstream, resulting in a complete backflow. We explored the approximate flow reversal zone using Darcy's approximation theory far from the wavy wall. The flow recirculation associated with steady flow is critical for mass transport and enhances convective mixing. On the other hand, flow reversal at different time instances can optimize oxygen transfer in devices such as membrane oxygenators.</description>

      <title>Intelligent backpropagated neural networks application on Couette-Poiseuille flow of variable viscosity in a composite porous channel filled with an anisotropic porous layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study examines Couette-Poiseuille flow of variable viscosity within a channel that is partially filled with a porous medium. To enhance its practical relevance, we assume that the porous medium is anisotropic with permeability varying in all directions, making it a positive semidefinite matrix in the momentum equation. We assume the Navier-Stokes equations govern the flow in the free flow region, while the Brinkman-Forchheimer-extended Darcy's equation governs the flow inside the porous medium. The coupled system contains a nonlinear term from the Brinkman-Forchheimer equation. We propose an approximate solution using an iterative method valid for a wide range of porous media parameter values. For both high and low values of the Darcy number, the asymptotic solutions derived from the regular perturbation method and matched asymptotic expansion show good agreement with the numerical results. However, these methods are not effective in the intermediate range. To address this, we employ the artificial Levenberg-Marquardt method with a back-propagated neural network (ALMM-BNN) paradigm to predict the solution in the intermediate range. While it may not provide the exact solutions, it successfully captures the overall trend and demonstrates good qualitative agreement with the numerical results. This highlights the potential of the ALMM-BNN paradigm as a robust predictive tool in challenging parameter ranges where numerical solutions are either difficult to obtain or computationally expensive. The current model provides valuable insights into the shear stress distribution of arterial blood flow, taking into account the variable viscosity of the blood in the presence of inertial effects. It also offers a framework for creating glycocalyx scaffolding and other microfluidic systems that can mimic the biological glycocalyx.</description>

      <title>PO-CKAN:Physics Informed Deep Operator Kolmogorov Arnold Networks with Chunk Rational Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose PO-CKAN, a physics-informed deep operator framework based on Chunkwise Rational Kolmogorov--Arnold Networks (KANs), for approximating the solution operators of partial differential equations. This framework leverages a Deep Operator Network (DeepONet) architecture that incorporates Chunkwise Rational Kolmogorov--Arnold Network (CKAN) sub-networks for enhanced function approximation. The principles of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are integrated into the operator learning framework to enforce physical consistency. This design enables the efficient learning of physically consistent spatio-temporal solution operators and allows for rapid prediction for parametric time-dependent PDEs with varying inputs (e.g., parameters, initial/boundary conditions) after training. Validated on challenging benchmark problems, PO-CKAN demonstrates accurate operator learning with results closely matching high-fidelity solutions. PO-CKAN adopts a DeepONet-style branch--trunk architecture with its sub-networks instantiated as rational KAN modules, and enforces physical consistency via a PDE residual (PINN-style) loss. On Burgers' equation with $\nu=0.01$, PO-CKAN reduces the mean relative $L^2$ error by approximately 48\% compared to PI-DeepONet, and achieves competitive accuracy on the Eikonal and diffusion--reaction benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Instantons in Complex-Driven Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the dynamics of the quantum Rabi model driven parametrically by a periodic modulation of a complex coupling. We show both analytically and numerically that instead of Rabi oscillations, this nonunitary coherent driving leads to a unidirectional instanton solution which mediates the rapid and deterministic one-way tunneling of any initial coherent state to the ground state, making the ground state a strong attractor in the quantum dynamics of the qubit. The timescale of this tunneling is shown to be inversely proportional to the effective resonant coupling, allowing for exceptionally fast, deterministic, and high-fidelity qubit reset through a purely coherent, PT-symmetric drive--without coupling to external dissipative baths, lossy resonators, or employing measurement-based feedback. Finally, we show how the drive can be engineered to place the strong attractor at any arbitrary point on the Bloch sphere.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Carnot limit: work extraction via an entropy battery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the consequences of generalized thermodynamics, as interpreted from the perspective of information theory, on an ensemble's capacity to extract energetic work. We demonstrate that by utilizing unitary heat engines of different kinds, we can capitalize on the full entropy capacity of the ensemble across multiple conserved quantities. This leads to the extraction of energetic work with efficiencies surpassing the standard Carnot efficiency limit, all the while running at maximum power. This is achieved without requiring modified thermal sources, which is a method commonly used in the field of quantum heat engines. We pay particular attention to spin angular momentum, and show that when treated as a mutually independent conserved quantity, spin baths exhibit thermodynamic behaviour analogous to conventional heat baths, with corresponding quantities and models. This includes spin-analogous heat capacities, Einstein solid and Debye models, entropic responses, and Bose-Einstein and Fermi-Dirac statistics. Spin baths also follow the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. Further, we examine the role of particle statistics in determining the maximum entropy capacity of the battery. In doing so, we argue that indistinguishability is necessary for interactions to occur, motivating a perspective in which information itself is treated as the indistinguishable property of particles, with information (in the form of coherence) transferable between both physical degrees of freedom such as energy and spin, and particles when the system acts unitarily. This work will find application in fields that require near energy degenerate spin statistics, such as in spinor Bose-Einstein condensates and spintronics. Further, our method will have implications for the fields of quantum heat engines, quantum batteries, quantum error correction, and in information and resource theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The algebraic structures of integrable hierarchies play an important role in the study of soliton equations. In this paper, we use splitting theory to give a matrix representation of a constrained CKP hierarchy, which can be considered as a generalization of the $\hat{A}_{2n}^{(2)}$-KdV hierarchy and the constrained KP hierarchy. An equivalent construction in terms of the pseudo-differential operator is discussed. Darboux transformations, scaling transformation and tau functions $\ln \tau_f$ for this constrained hierarchy are studied. Moreover, we present formulas for the Virasoro vector fields on $\ln \tau_f$ for the $\hat{A}_{2 n}^{(2)}$-KdV hierarchy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a generalization of the asymmetric simple inclusion process (ASIP) on a periodic one-dimensional lattice, where the integers in the particles rates are deformed to their $t$-analogues. We call this the $(q, t, \theta)$~ASIP, where $q$ is the asymmetric hopping parameter and $\theta$ is the diffusion parameter. We show that this process is a misanthrope process, and consequently the steady state is independent of $q$. We compute the steady state, the one-point correlation and the current in the steady state. In particular, we show that the single-site occupation probabilities follow a \emph{beta-binomial} distribution at $t=1$. We compute the two-dimensional phase diagram in various regimes of the parameters $(t, \theta)$ and perform simulations to justify the results. We also show that a modified form of the steady state weights at $t \neq 1$ satisfy curious palindromic and antipalindromic symmetries. Lastly, we define an enriched process at $t=1$ and $\theta$ an integer which projects onto the $(q, 1, \theta)$~ASIP and whose steady state is uniform, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>A class of Truncated Freud polynomials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider the following truncated Freud linear functional $\mathbf{u}_z$ depending on a parameter $z$, $$\langle\mathbf{u}_z,p\rangle=\int_0^\infty p(x)e^{-zx^4}dx,\quad z&gt;0.$$ The aim of this work is to analyze the properties of the sequence of orthogonal polynomials $(P_n)_{n\geq 0}$ with respect to $\mathbf{u}_z$. Such a linear functional is semiclassical and, as a consequence, we get the system of nonlinear difference equations (Laguerre-Freud equations) that the coefficients of the three-term recurrence satisfy. The asymptotic behavior of such coefficients is given. On the other hand, the raising and lowering operators associated with such a linear functional are obtained, and thus a second-order linear differential equation of holonomic type that $(P_n)_{n\geq 0}$ satisfies is deduced. From this fact, an electrostatic interpretation of their zeros is given. Finally, some illustrative numerical tests concerning the behavior of the least and greatest zeros of these polynomials are presented.</description>

The proof is analogous to the classification of toric Hermitian ALF instantons by Biquard and Gauduchon, although we avoid the use of toric K\"ahler geometry and instead perform a direct global analysis of the Tod form of the metric in Weyl-Papapetrou coordinates. This supports a conjecture by Gibbons and Bando-Kasue-Nakajima which states that any Ricci flat ALE instanton is self-dual.</description>

      <title>Lecture notes on the symplectic geometry of graded manifolds and higher Lie groupoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study symplectic structures on graded manifolds and their global counterparts, higher Lie groupoids. We begin by introducing the concept of graded manifold, starting with the degree 1 case, and translating key geometric structures into classical differential geometry terms. We then extend our discussion to the degree 2 case, presenting several illustrative examples with a particular emphasis on equivariant cohomology and Lie bialgebroids. Next, we define symplectic Q-manifolds and their Lagrangian Q-submanifolds, introducing a graded analogue of Weinstein's tubular neighborhood theorem and applying it to the study of deformations of these submanifolds.
  Shifting focus, we turn to higher Lie groupoids and the shifted symplectic structures introduced by Getzler. We examine their Morita invariance and provide several examples drawn from the literature. Finally, we introduce shifted Lagrangian structures and explore their connections to moment maps and symplectic reduction procedures.
  Throughout these notes, we illustrate the key constructions and results with concrete examples, highlighting their applications in mathematics and physics. These lecture notes are based on two mini-courses delivered by the first author at Geometry in Algebra and Algebra in Geometry VII (2023) in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, and at the INdAM Intensive Period: Poisson Geometry and Mathematical Physics (2024) in Napoli, Italy.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal Games Through Communication Complexity and Quantum Cryptography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This thesis explores foundational aspects of quantum information theory and quantum cryptography.
  First, we investigate quantum correlations in interactive settings, including the CHSH and graph isomorphism games. We aim to distinguish quantum correlations from non-signaling correlations by leveraging the principle of communication complexity. To this end, we employ techniques such as distributed computation, majority-function-based distillation protocols, the algebraic and geometric properties of nonlocal box wirings, and variations of some graph properties such as isomorphism, transitivity, and equitable partitions. This inquiry advances our understanding of non-physical correlations.
  Second, we address a key open problem in cryptography: the feasibility of unclonable encryption. We aim to construct an encryption scheme that prevents two distant parties from simultaneously obtaining information about a shared encrypted message. We introduce a candidate for unclonable encryption in the plain model, i.e. without assumptions, in working towards an unconditional proof. Our protocol is based on Clifford algebra, utilizing complex Hermitian unitary matrices that anti-commute. For small key sizes, we rigorously prove security using sum-of-squares methods, while for larger key sizes, we provide strong numerical evidence via the NPA hierarchy.</description>

      <title>Particle creation in a cosmological background in analogy to the Schwinger effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a gravitational analogue of the Schwinger effect in a cosmological context. While the Schwinger effect is usually attributed to a static electric background, its derivation is actually based on a switching on/off of the electric field in the infinite past/future. Motivated by this, and our previous work on particle production in a gravitational background, we consider a long pulse of the gravitational field in an FLRW-spacetime, thus simulating a static background. We rigorously derive particle production by a novel application of the Heun equation. In fact, the recently obtained connecting formulas between its local solutions can be used to determine the Bogolyubov coefficients, and subsequently the particle production probabilities, in the limit of an infinitely long pulse.
  The particle production in the FLRW-model is found to have a lower threshold on the outgoing frequencies, which can be related to the duration of the time interval of the switching on/off the background field. For large frequencies and in the spatially flat case, we find black-body radiation whose temperature is inversely proportional to the radius of the apparent horizon that appears in the FLRW-model during the phase of scale change.
  We compare our findings to Schwinger's result on particle production for a long pulse of an electromagnetic background field, for which we also include a detailed derivation.</description>

      <title>Lie symmetry analysis of the two-Higgs-doublet model field equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply Lie symmetry analysis of partial differential equations (PDEs) to the Euler-Lagrange equations of the two-Higgs-doublet model (2HDM), to determine its scalar Lie point symmetries. A Lie point symmetry is a structure-preserving transformation of the spacetime variables and the fields of the model, which is also continuous and connected to the identity. Symmetries of PDEs may in general be divided into strict variational symmetries, divergence symmetries and non-variational symmetries, where the first two are collectively referred to as variational symmetries. Variational symmetries are usually preserved under quantization, and variational Lie symmetries yield conservation laws. We demonstrate that there are no scalar Lie point divergence symmetries or non-variational Lie point symmetries in the 2HDM, and re-derive its well-known strict variational Lie point symmetries, thus confirming the consistency of our implementation of Lie's method. Moreover, we prove three general results which may simplify Lie symmetry calculations for a wide class of particle physics models. Lie symmetry analysis of PDEs is a broadly applicable method for determining Lie symmetries. As demonstrated here by example, it can be applied to models with many variables, parameters and reparametrization freedom, while any missing discrete symmetries may be identified through the automorphism groups of the resulting Lie symmetry algebras.</description>

      <title>Unveiling dynamical quantum error correcting codes via non-invertible symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamical stabilizer codes (DSCs) have recently emerged as a powerful generalization of static stabilizer codes for quantum error correction, replacing a fixed stabilizer group with a sequence of non-commuting measurements. This dynamical structure unlocks new possibilities for fault tolerance but also introduces new challenges, as errors must now be tracked across both space and time. In this work, we provide a physical and topological understanding of DSCs by establishing a correspondence between qudit Pauli measurements and non-invertible symmetries in 4+1-dimensional 2-form gauge theories. Sequences of measurements in a DSC are mapped to a fusion of the operators implementing these non-invertible symmetries. We show that the error detectors of a DSC correspond to endable surface operators in the gauge theory, whose endpoints define line operators, and that detectable errors are precisely those surface operators that braid non-trivially with these lines. Finally, we demonstrate how this framework naturally recovers the spacetime stabilizer code associated with a DSC.</description>

Abstract: We consider the Euclidean vacuum for linearized gravity on the global de Sitter space, obtained from the Euclidean Green's function on the 4-sphere. We use the notion of Calder\'on projectors to recover a quantum state for the Lorentzian theory on de Sitter space. We show that while the state is gauge invariant and Hadamard, it is not positive on the whole of the phase space. We show however that a suitable modification at low energies yields a well-defined Hadamard state on global de Sitter space.</description>

      <title>An operator algebraic approach to fusion category symmetry on the lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05185v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a framework for fusion category symmetry on the (1+1)D lattice in the thermodynamic limit by giving a formal interpretation of SymTFT decompositions. Our approach is based on axiomatizing physical boundary subalgebra of quasi-local observables, and applying ideas from algebraic quantum field theory to derive the expected categorical structures. We show that given a physical boundary subalgebra $B$ of a quasi-local algebra $A$, there is a canonical fusion category $\mathcal{C}$ that acts on $A$ by bimodules and whose fusion ring acts by locality preserving quantum channels on the quasi-local algebra such that $B$ is recovered as the fixed point operators. We show that a fusion category can be realized as symmetries on a tensor product quasi-local algebra if and only if all of its objects have integer dimensions, and that it admits an ``on-site" action on a tensor product spin chain if and only if it admits a fiber functor. We give a formal definition of a topological symmetric state, and prove two anomaly enforced gaplessness theorems, one for internal categorical symmetries and one for anomalous duality channels. Using the first, we show that for any fusion category $\mathcal{C}$ with no fiber functor there always exist gapless pure symmetric states on an anyon chain.</description>

      <title>Moments and the Basic Equilibrium Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13865v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop the classical theory of moments of configurations of weighted points with a focus on systems with an identically vanishing first moment. The latter condition produces equations for equilibrium configurations of systems of interacting particles under the sole condition that interactions are pairwise and along the line determined by each pair of particles. Complying external forces are admitted, so the description of some dynamical equilibrium configurations, such as relative equilibria in Celestial Mechanics, is included in our approach. Moments provide a unified framework for equilibrium problems in arbitrary dimensions. The equilibrium equations are homogeneous, of relatively low degree, invariant by oriented isometries (for interactions depending only on mutual distances), and are obtained through simple algebraic procedures requiring neither reduction by isometries nor a variational principle for their determination. Our equations include the renowned sets of $n$-body central configuration equations by O. Dziobek, and by A. Albouy and A. Chenciner. These equations are extended to a rather broad class of equilibrium problems, and several new sets of equilibrium equations are introduced. We also apply moments to establish a theory of constraints for mutual distances of configurations of fixed dimension and of co-spherical configurations, thus re-obtaining and adding to classical results by A. Cayley, among others.</description>

Abstract: We consider the asymptotic local behavior of the second correlation functions of the characteristic polynomials of a certain class of Gaussian $N\times N$ non-Hermitian random band matrices with a bandwidth $W$. Given $W,N\to\infty$, we show that this behavior near the point in the bulk of the spectrum exhibits the crossover at $W\sim \sqrt{N}$: it coincides with those for Ginibre ensemble for $W\gg \sqrt{N}$, and factorized as $1\ll W\ll \sqrt{N}$. The result is the first step toward the proof of Anderson's type transition for non-Hermitian random band matrices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04422v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the smallest eigenvalue statistics of the $\beta$-Laguerre and $\beta$-Jacobi ensembles. Using Kaneko's integral formula, we show that the smallest eigenvalue marginal density and distribution functions of the two ensembles for any $\beta&gt;0$ can be represented in terms of multivariate Laguerre and Jacobi polynomials evaluated at a multiple of the identity, provided that the exponent of $x$ in the Laguerre and Jacobi weights is an integer. These representations are readily computable in explicit form using existing symbolic algorithms for multivariate orthogonal polynomials.
  From these expressions, we derive new differentiation formulas for the multivariate Laguerre and Jacobi polynomials. Furthermore, we derive explicit solutions to the Painleve V and VI differential equations associated with the smallest eigenvalue of the LUE and JUE. We provide numerical experiments and examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.11908v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we show that a Brownian Gibbsian line ensemble whose top curve approximates a parabola must be given by the parabolic Airy line ensemble. More specifically, we prove that if $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{L}} = (\mathcal{L}_1, \mathcal{L}_2, \ldots )$ is a line ensemble satisfying the Brownian Gibbs property, such that for any $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ there exists a constant $\mathfrak{K} (\varepsilon) &gt; 0$ with $$\mathbb{P} \Big[ \big| \mathcal{L}_1 (t) + 2^{-1/2} t^2 \big| \le \varepsilon t^2 + \mathfrak{K} (\varepsilon) \Big] \ge 1 - \varepsilon, \qquad \text{for all $t \in \mathbb{R}$},$$ then $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{L}}$ is the parabolic Airy line ensemble, up to an independent affine shift. Specializing this result to the case when $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{L}} (t) + 2^{-1/2} t^2$ is translation-invariant confirms a prediction of Okounkov and Sheffield from 2006 and Corwin-Hammond from 2014.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.13412v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop the theory of $\hbar$-vertex algebras, algebraic structures closely related to vertex algebras but with a deformed translation covariance axiom. We establish their structure theory, including analogues of Goddard's Uniqueness Theorem, the Reconstruction Theorem, Borcherds Identity, and the OPE Expansion Formula, and introduce the associated notions of $\hbar$-Lie conformal and $\hbar$-Poisson vertex algebras. The formalism provides a natural and simplified construction of the Zhu algebra. The main application is to the chiralization of classical star-products: we show that every star-product on the symmetric algebra of a Lie algebra (or its central extensions) admits a chiralization, and we derive explicit formulae for these chiral star-products, including the Moyal-Weyl and Gutt star-products. Setting $\hbar=0$ recovers explicit deformation quantizations of a broad class of Poisson vertex algebras, including the classical limits of free-boson, $\beta \gamma$-system, affine, and Virasoro vertex algebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08814v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new unified theory of critical finite-size scaling for lattice statistical mechanical models with periodic boundary conditions above the upper critical dimension. Our theory is based on recent mathematically rigorous results for linear and branched polymers, multi-component spin systems, and percolation. Both short-range and long-range interactions are included. The universal finite-size scaling is inherited from the scaling of the system unwrapped to the infinite lattice. We also present conjectures for universal scaling profiles for the susceptibility and two-point function plateau in a critical window. For free boundary conditions, the universal scaling has been proven to apply at a pseudocritical point for hierarchical spins, and we conjecture that this holds generally.</description>

Abstract: In the wake of major breakthroughs in General Relativity during the 1960s, Roger Penrose introduced Strong Cosmic Censorship, a profound conjecture regarding the deterministic nature of the theory. Penrose's proposal has since opened far-reaching new mathematical avenues, revealing connections to fundamental questions about black holes and the nature of gravitational singularities. We review recent advances arising from modern techniques in the theory of partial differential equations as applied to Strong Cosmic Censorship, maintaining a focus on the context of gravitational collapse that gave birth to the conjecture.</description>

Abstract: The Haldane model is a standard tight-binding model describing electrons hopping on a hexagonal lattice subject to a transverse, dipolar magnetic field. We consider its interacting version for values of the interaction strength that are small compared to the bandwidth. We study the critical case at the transition between the trivial and the `topological' insulating phases, and we rigorously establish that the transverse conductivity on the dressed critical line is quantized at a half-integer multiple of $e^2/h$: this is the average of the integer values of the Hall conductivity in the insulating phases on either side of the dressed critical line. Together with previous results, this fully characterizes the nature of the phase transition between different Hall plateaus and proves its universality with respect to many-body interactions. The proof is based on a combination of constructive renormalization group methods and exact lattice Ward identities.</description>

      <title>The coexistence of null and spacelike singularities inside spherically symmetric black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12370v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In our previous work [Van de Moortel, The breakdown of weak null singularities, Duke Mathematical Journal 172 (15), 2957-3012, 2023], we showed that dynamical black holes formed in charged spherical collapse generically feature both a null weakly singular Cauchy horizon and a stronger (presumably spacelike) singularity, confirming a longstanding conjecture in the physics literature. However, this previous result, based on a contradiction argument, did not provide quantitative estimates on the stronger singularity.
  In this study, we adopt a new approach by analyzing local initial data inside the black hole that are consistent with a breakdown of the Cauchy horizon. We prove that the remaining portion is spacelike and obtain sharp spacetime estimates near the null-spacelike transition. Notably, we show that the Kasner exponents of the spacelike portion are positive, in contrast to the well-known Oppenheimer-Snyder model of gravitational collapse. Moreover, these exponents degenerate to (1,0,0) towards the null-spacelike transition.
  Our result provides the first quantitative instances of a null-spacelike singularity transition inside a black hole. In our companion paper, we moreover apply our analysis to carry out the construction of a large class of asymptotically flat one or two-ended black holes featuring coexisting null and spacelike singularities.</description>

      <title>Scalar field stochastic dynamics in de Sitter spacetime from exact solutions of quantum deficient oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21429v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The stochastic dynamics of a scalar field in de Sitter spacetime can be regarded as a non-perturbative diffusion process, to which exact distribution and correlation functions are constructed by utilising the correspondence between diffusion and Schr\"{o}dinger equations. The Krein--Adler transformation of the quantum harmonic oscillator deletes several pairs of the energy levels to define anharmonic oscillators that we dub quantum deficient oscillators, based on which this article constructs a new class of exact solutions in stochastic inflation. In addition to the simplest single-well model, an exactly solvable double-well model is also presented. The results are further extended to exactly solvable models with multiple wells, allowing analytical studies on various cosmological phenomenologies.</description>

      <title>The Yang-Baxter integrability of the critical Ising chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03668v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the one dimensional, critical transverse field Ising model is Yang-Baxter integrable. This is done by constructing commuting transfer matrices built out of a $R$-matrix satisfying the Yang-Baxter equation with additive spectral parameters. The $R$-matrix is non-local, as it is expressed in terms of Majorana fermions. It is also non-regular. Nevertheless, we show that the quantum inverse scattering method can still be suitably adapted. We then recursively obtain the conserved quantities [in the infinite volume] by the boost operator method. Remarkably, among the conserved charges we also find the Kramers-Wannier duality and other non-invertible symmetries for the periodic transverse field Ising model.</description>

      <title>Every conformal net has an associated unitary VOA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20735v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unitary vertex operator algebras (VOAs) and conformal nets are the two most prominent mathematical axiomatizations of two-dimensional unitary chiral conformal field theories. They are conjectured to be equivalent, but a rigorous comparison has proven challenging. We resolve one direction of the conjecture by showing that every conformal net has an associated unitary VOA. We also show that every representation of a conformal net in which the generator of rotation acts with discrete spectrum and finite-dimensional eigenspaces yields a unitary module of the corresponding VOA.

      <description>arXiv:2508.20598v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive the asymptotic expansion of the partition function of a Coulomb gas system in the determinantal case on compact Riemann surfaces of any genus g. Our main tool is the bosonization formula relating the analytic torsion and geometric quantities including the Green functions appearing in the definition of this partition function. As a result, we prove the geometric version of the Zabrodin-Wiegmann conjecture in the determinantal case.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear realisation approach to extended supergravity theories in three dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03088v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We elaborate on the nonlinear realisation approach to spontaneously broken supergravity in three dimensions presented in arXiv:2304.09506. Using this approach we provide a novel derivation of $\mathcal{N}$-extended supergravity, with and without a cosmological term. It corresponds to a St\"uckelberg-type extension of the following theories: (i) the $(p,q)$ anti-de Sitter (AdS) supergravity theories with $p+q=\mathcal{N}$, $p\geq q\geq 0$ proposed by Ach\'ucarro and Townsend; and (ii) the $\mathcal{N}$-extended Poincar\'e supergravity of Marcus and Schwarz. We also apply the approach to obtain a St\"uckelberg reformulation of the supersymmetric Lorentz Chern-Simons action for arbitrary $\mathcal{N}$. In our construction, the pure supergravity actions (Poincar\'e and AdS) share the invariance under two different local $\mathcal{N}$-extended supersymmetries. One of them acts on the Goldstini, while the other supersymmetry leaves the Goldstini inert. The $\mathcal{N}$-extended supersymmetric Lorentz Chern-Simons action proposed in our setting shares the former supersymmetry, but differs in the one that leaves the Goldstini inert. The supersymmetry that acts on the Goldstini can be used to gauge them away, and then the resulting actions coincide with that given in the literature.</description>

      <title>Information Loss and Cost in Symmetry Breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24625v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop an algebraic and information-theoretic framework to characterize symmetry breaking of generalized, non-invertible symmetries in two spatial dimensions. The reduction of symmetry is modeled within subfactor theory, where condensable Frobenius algebras play the role of subgroups in the categorical setting. This perspective naturally connects to the description of anyon condensation in topological phases of matter. Central to our approach are coarse-graining maps, or conditional expectations, which act as quantum channels projecting observables from a phase with higher symmetry onto one where the symmetry is partially or completely broken by condensation. By employing relative entropy as an entropic order parameter, we quantify the information loss induced by condensation and establish a universal bound governed by the Jones index, which is equal to the quantum dimension of the condensate. We illustrate the framework through explicit examples, including the toric code, abelian groups $\mathbb{Z}_N$, and the representation category Rep($S_3$), and show how dualities give rise to equivalence classes of condensation patterns. Our results forge new connections between operator algebras, tensor category theory, and quantum information in the study of generalized symmetries.</description>

      <title>Turning Down the Noise: Power-Law Decay and Temporal Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04267v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We determine the late-time dynamics of a generic spin ensemble with inhomogeneous broadening - equivalently, qubits with arbitrary Zeeman splittings - coupled to a dissipative environment with strength decreasing as $1/t$. The approach to the steady state follows a power law, reflecting the interplay between Hamiltonian dynamics and vanishing dissipation. The decay exponents vary non-analytically with the ramp rate, exhibiting a cusp singularity, and $n$-point correlation functions factorize into one- and two-point contributions. Our exact solution anchors a universality class of open quantum systems with explicitly time-dependent dissipation.</description>

      <title>Potent categorical representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07482v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce and motivate -- based on ongoing joint work with Germ\'an Stefanich -- the notion of potent categorical representations of a complex reductive group $G$, specifically a conjectural Langlands correspondence identifying potent categorical representations of $G$ and its Langlands dual $\check G$. We emphasize the symplectic nature of potent categorical representations in their simultaneous dependence on parameters in maximal tori for $G$ and $\check G$, specifically how their conjectural Langlands correspondence fits within a 2-categorical Fourier transform. Our key tool to make various ideas precise is higher sheaf theory and its microlocalization, specifically a theory of ind-coherent sheaves of categories on stacks. The constructions are inspired by the physics of 3d mirror symmetry and S-duality on the one hand, and the theory of double affine Hecke algebras on the other. We also highlight further conjectures related to ongoing programs in and around geometric representation theory.</description>
