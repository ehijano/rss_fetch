      <title>First Multi-Constellation Observations of Navigation Satellite Signals in the Lunar Domain by Post-Processing L1/L5 IQ Snapshots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) to increase spacecraft autonomy for orbit determination has gained renewed momentum following the Lunar GNSS Receiver Experiment (LuGRE), which demonstrated feasible onboard GPS and Galileo signal reception and tracking at lunar distances. This work processes in-phase and quadrature (IQ) snapshots collected by the LuGRE receiver in cis-lunar space and on the lunar surface to assess multi-frequency, multi-constellation signal availability. Signals from additional systems beyond GPS and Galileo, including RNSS and SBAS constellations, are observable and successfully acquired exclusively in the recorded IQ snapshots. These observations provide the first experimental evidence that signals from multiple constellations, including systems not supported by LuGRE realtime operations, are detectable at unprecedented distances from Earth. Useful observables can be extracted from the IQ snapshots, despite minimal sampling rates, 4-bit quantization, and short durations (200 ms-2 s), through a hybrid coherent/non-coherent acquisition stage compensating for code Doppler. These observations are exploited to tune simulation tools and to perform extended simulation campaigns, showing that the inclusion of additional constellations significantly improves availability; for a 26 dB-Hz acquisition threshold, the fraction of epochs with at least four visible satellites increases from 11% to 46% of the total epoch count. These findings indicate that BeiDou, RNSS, and SBAS signals can substantially enhance GNSS-based autonomy for lunar and cislunar missions.</description>

      <title>Coordinate Systems and Transforms in Space Physics: Terms, Definitions, Implementations, and Recommendations for Reproducibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In space physics, acronyms for coordinate systems (e.g., \texttt{GEI}, \texttt{GSM}) are commonly used; however, differences in their definitions and implementations can prevent reproducibility. In this work, we compare definitions in online resources, software packages, and frequently cited journal articles and show that implementation differences can lead to transformations between same-named coordinate systems and ephemerides values from different data providers to differ significantly. Based on these comparisons and results, and to enable reproducibility, we recommend that (a) a standard for acronyms and definitions for coordinate systems is developed; (b) a standards body develops a citable database of reference data needed for these transforms; (c) a central authority maintains the SPICE (Spacecraft, Planet, Instrument, C-matrix, Events) kernels used by space physics spacecraft missions to generate data products in different coordinate systems; and (d) software developers provide explicit comparisons of their implementations with the results of (b) and documentation on implementation choices. Additionally, we provide recommendations for scientists and metadata developers to ensure that sufficient information is provided to enable reproducibility if these recommendations are not implemented.</description>

      <title>Explaining the discrepancy in the Chandler period and the prediction of the changes in the Earths rotation dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, in the first instance the attitude dynamics of the Earth is modelled based on physical principles so as to correctly predict the Chandler wobble and its features such as its period. To this end not only the steady state and dynamic gravity gradient torques were included, but also the effects of centrifugal acceleration on the deformable viscoelastic model of the planet. After validating the Chandler wobble response, the paper seeks to go beyond and predict the attitude response of the Earth not just over a few years but over much longer term. This requires modelling of the energy balance effects of the entire planet as a whole and not just the redistribution of mass and inertia but also the changes in the inertial properties. To this end simpler physical model of the energy balance process was included to demonstrate the sustained changes in the length of day response of the Earth over a long term. The over aim of the paper is to bring into focus the key physical processes responsible for the changes to the attitude dynamics of the Earth over a reasonable longer time frame. The overall responses of the attitude dynamics over, the short and medium terms are presented.</description>

      <title>A Unified Charge-Dependent Modulation Model for AMS-02 Proton and Antiproton Fluxes during Solar Minimum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a unified charge-dependent solar modulation model by solving the three-dimensional Parker transport equation, incorporating a realistic wavy heliospheric current sheet to treat drift effects self-consistently. Using a local interstellar spectrum from GALPROP constrained by Voyager data, we fit the model to time-resolved proton and antiproton fluxes measured by the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer - 02 (AMS-02) during the solar-quiet period (May 2011 to June 2022). To enable rapid parameter scans, we employ neural-network-based surrogate models to compute propagation and modulation matrices efficiently. The results demonstrate that the model simultaneously describes the observed proton and antiproton fluxes with physically reasonable parameters, providing a unified account of charge-dependent modulation.</description>
