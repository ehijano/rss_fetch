      <title>CIMNAS: A Joint Framework for Compute-In-Memory-Aware Neural Architecture Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To maximize hardware efficiency and performance accuracy in Compute-In-Memory (CIM)-based neural network accelerators for Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications, co-optimizing both software and hardware design parameters is essential. Manual tuning is impractical due to the vast number of parameters and their complex interdependencies. To effectively automate the design and optimization of CIM-based neural network accelerators, hardware-aware neural architecture search (HW-NAS) techniques can be applied. This work introduces CIMNAS, a joint model-quantization-hardware optimization framework for CIM architectures. CIMNAS simultaneously searches across software parameters, quantization policies, and a broad range of hardware parameters, incorporating device-, circuit-, and architecture-level co-optimizations. CIMNAS experiments were conducted over a search space of 9.9x10^85 potential parameter combinations with the MobileNet model as a baseline and RRAM-based CIM architecture. Evaluated on the ImageNet dataset, CIMNAS achieved a reduction in energy-delay-area product (EDAP) ranging from 90.1x to 104.5x, an improvement in TOPS/W between 4.68x and 4.82x, and an enhancement in TOPS/mm^2 from 11.3x to 12.78x relative to various baselines, all while maintaining an accuracy of 73.81%. The adaptability and robustness of CIMNAS are demonstrated by extending the framework to support the SRAM-based ResNet50 architecture, achieving up to an 819.5x reduction in EDAP. Unlike other state-of-the-art methods, CIMNAS achieves EDAP-focused optimization without any accuracy loss, generating diverse software-hardware parameter combinations for high-performance CIM-based neural network designs. The source code of CIMNAS is available at https://github.com/OlgaKrestinskaya/CIMNAS.</description>

      <title>Robust NbN on Si-SiGe hybrid superconducting-semiconducting microwave quantum circuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advancing large-scale quantum computing requires superconducting circuits that combine long coherence times with compatibility with semiconductor technology. We investigate niobium nitride (NbN) coplanar waveguide resonators integrated with Si/SiGe quantum wells, creating a hybrid platform designed for CMOS-compatible quantum hardware. Using temperature-dependent microwave spectroscopy in the single-photon regime, we examine resonance frequency and quality factor variations to probe the underlying loss mechanisms. Our analysis identifies the roles of two-level systems, quasiparticles, and scattering processes, and connects these losses to wafer properties and fabrication methods. The devices demonstrate reproducible performance and stable operation maintained for over two years, highlighting their robustness. These results provide design guidelines for developing low-loss, CMOS-compatible superconducting circuits and support progress toward resilient, scalable architectures for quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>SOT-MRAM Bitcell Scaling with BEOL Read Selectors: A DTCO Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18250v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work explores the cross-node scaling potential of SOT-MRAM for last-level caches (LLCs) under heterogeneous system scaling paradigm. We perform extensive Design-Technology Co-Optimization (DTCO) exercises to evaluate the bitcell footprint for different cell configurations at a representative 7 nm technology and to assess their implications on read and write power-performance. We crucially identify the MTJ routing struggle in conventional two-transistor one-resistor (2T1R) SOT-MRAMs as the primary bitcell area scaling challenge and propose to use BEOL read selectors (BEOL RSs) that enable (10 -- 40) % bitcell area reduction and eventually match sub-N3 SRAM. On writability, we affirm that BEOL RS-based bitcells could meet the required SOT switching current, provided the magnetic free layer properties be engineered in line with LLC-specific, (0.1 -- 100) s retention targets. This is particularly to attribute to their (i) more available Si fins for write transistor and (ii) lower bitline resistance at reduced cell width. We nevertheless underscore the read tradeoff associated with BEOL RSs, with the low-drive IGZO-FET selector sacrificing the latency up to (3 -- 5) ns and the imperfectly rectifying diode selectors suffering (2.5 -- 5)$\times$ energy cost relative to 2T1R. This article thus highlights the realistic prospects and hurdles of BEOL RSs towards holistic power-performance-area scaling of SOT-MRAM.</description>

      <title>TensorRL-QAS: Reinforcement learning with tensor networks for improved quantum architecture search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09371v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms hold the promise to address meaningful quantum problems already on noisy intermediate-scale quantum hardware. In spite of the promise, they face the challenge of designing quantum circuits that both solve the target problem and comply with device limitations. Quantum architecture search (QAS) automates the design process of quantum circuits, with reinforcement learning (RL) emerging as a promising approach. Yet, RL-based QAS methods encounter significant scalability issues, as computational and training costs grow rapidly with the number of qubits, circuit depth, and hardware noise. To address these challenges, we introduce $\textit{TensorRL-QAS}$, an improved framework that combines tensor network methods with RL for QAS. By warm-starting the QAS with a matrix product state approximation of the target solution, TensorRL-QAS effectively narrows the search space to physically meaningful circuits and accelerates the convergence to the desired solution. Tested on several quantum chemistry problems of up to 12-qubit, TensorRL-QAS achieves up to a 10-fold reduction in CNOT count and circuit depth compared to baseline methods, while maintaining or surpassing chemical accuracy. It reduces classical optimizer function evaluation by up to 100-fold, accelerates training episodes by up to 98$\%$, and can achieve 50$\%$ success probability for 10-qubit systems, far exceeding the $&lt;$1$\%$ rates of baseline. Robustness and versatility are demonstrated both in the noiseless and noisy scenarios, where we report a simulation of an 8-qubit system. Furthermore, TensorRL-QAS demonstrates effectiveness on systems on 20-qubit quantum systems, positioning it as a state-of-the-art quantum circuit discovery framework for near-term hardware and beyond.</description>

      <title>Model Discovery and Graph Simulation: A Lightweight Gateway to Chaos Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11176v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chaos engineering reveals resilience risks but is expensive and operationally risky to run broadly and often. Model-based analyses can estimate dependability, yet in practice they are tricky to build and keep current because models are typically handcrafted. We claim that a simple connectivity-only topological model - just the service-dependency graph plus replica counts - can provide fast, low-risk availability estimates under fail-stop faults. To make this claim practical without hand-built models, we introduce model discovery: an automated step that can run in CI/CD or as an observability-platform capability, synthesizing an explicit, analyzable model from artifacts teams already have (e.g., distributed traces, service-mesh telemetry, configs/manifests) - providing an accessible gateway for teams to begin resilience testing. As a proof by instance on the DeathStarBench Social Network, we extract the dependency graph from Jaeger and estimate availability across two deployment modes and five failure rates. The discovered model closely tracks live fault-injection results; with replication, median error at mid-range failure rates is near zero, while no-replication shows signed biases consistent with excluded mechanisms. These results create two opportunities: first, to triage and reduce the scope of expensive chaos experiments in advance, and second, to generate real-time signals on the system's resilience posture as its topology evolves, preserving live validation for the most critical or ambiguous scenarios.</description>
