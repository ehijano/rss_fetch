      <title>A novel method of half-life determination for highly charged ions based on isochronous mass spectrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The lifetime of the isomeric state in fully stripped 94Ru44+ ions has been measured using isochronous mass spectrometry (IMS) at the experimental Cooler Storage Ring (CSRe) of the Heavy Ion Research Facility in Lanzhou (HIRFL). Previously, the isomeric lifetime was determined by analyzing the decay time points of individual decay events. In this paper, we present a novel approach to determine the isomeric lifetime based on the survival time of ions obtained from IMS. The survival lifetimes of the ground and isomeric states of 94Ru44+ were measured to be s and s in the laboratory, respectively. Given that the ground state of 94Ru44+ has a natural lifetime of approximately 75 min, its survival lifetime in the experimental setup was predominantly determined by the beam-loss lifetime, including interactions with residual gas in the storage ring and carbon foil of the detector. In contrast, the survival lifetime of 94mRu44+ was governed by its intrinsic nuclear lifetime and additional beam-loss effects. The nuclear decay lifetime of 94mRu44+ was extracted through differential survival lifetime analysis between ground and isomeric states, under the assumption that the beam-loss lifetimes for both quantum systems are identical. Using this novel methodology, the lifetime measured in the laboratory frame was s. After relativistic time-dilation corrections, the corresponding rest-frame half-life was calculated to be s. This result demonstrates excellent consistency with previous experimental results, validating the reliability of the new method. This method is suitable for determining half-lives of highly charged ions in the range of several tens of microseconds to milliseconds using IMS.</description>

      <title>Accessing nucleon transversity with one-point energy correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel probe of the nucleon's transversity distribution, $h_1^q$, using the one-point energy correlator (OPEC), an infrared-and-collinear safe jet substructure observable. We demonstrate that in transversely polarized $p^{\uparrow}p$ collisions, the OPEC exhibits a single-spin asymmetry (SSA) with a clean $\sin(\phi_s - \phi_n)$ angular dependence. This method probes SSA over a much wider kinematic range in the angular scale $\theta_n$ compared to traditional measurements of hadron transverse momentum~$j_\perp$, establishing a complementary and systematically distinct channel to study the nucleon's three-dimensional structure at RHIC and the future Electron-Ion Collider.</description>

      <title>Deep-Inelastic Scattering at TeV Energies with LHC Muons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13889v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The LHC far-forward experiments FASER and SND@LHC have pioneered the detection of TeV-energy neutrinos produced in hard-scattering proton-proton collisions at the LHC. In addition to neutrinos, an intense flux of TeV-energy muons reaches these detectors, representing a dominant background for both neutrino studies and beyond the Standard Model searches. Here we demonstrate that this forward muon flux enables a comprehensive neutral-current deep-inelastic scattering (DIS) program at FASER with a strong kinematical overlap with the Electron Ion Collider. For the Run 3 luminosity of $\mathcal{L}_{\rm pp}=250$~fb$^{-1}$, more than $10^5$ inclusive muon DIS events, of which up to $10^4$ from charm production, are expected at FASER$\nu$. As a representative application, we demonstrate the sensitivity of muon DIS at FASER$\nu$ to probe the (intrinsic) charm content of the proton at large-$x$. We also provide predictions for event yields of muon DIS for future FASER runs and for the proposed Forward Physics Facility.</description>

      <title>Microscopic determination of the interacting boson-fermion model Hamiltonian from the nuclear energy density functional</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04119v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A microscopic formulation of the interacting boson-fermion model for odd-$A$ nuclei is made using the nuclear energy density functional framework. Strength parameters for the bosonic Hamiltonian and boson-fermion interactions are shown to be determined completely so that energy surfaces and deformed single-particle energies of the Bose-Fermi systems should match the corresponding self-consistent mean-field solutions for fermionic systems. In an illustrative application to axially symmetric odd-$A$ Eu, this procedure is shown to be valid in describing spherical-to-deformed shape phase transitions in odd-$A$ and even-even systems.</description>
