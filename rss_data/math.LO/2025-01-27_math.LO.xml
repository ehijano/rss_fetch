      <title>The uniqueness of the core model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Jensen-Steel core model is a canonical inner model which plays a fundamental role in the meta-mathematics of set theory. Its definition depends on exactly which hierarchy of fine-structural models of set theory, premice, one uses. Each such hierarchy involves somewhat arbitrary decisions and working with different hierarchies ostensibly leads to different versions of the core model. We show that in some contexts, abstract properties of the core model uniquely determine it; that is, there is at most one inner model with these properties.</description>

      <title>A countable Boolean algebra that is Reichenbach's common cause complete</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The common cause completeness (CCC) is a philosophical principle that asserts that if we consider two positively correlated events then it evokes a common cause. The principle is due to H. Reichenbach and has been largely studied in Boolean algebras and elsewhere.The results published so far bring about a question whether there is a small (countable) Boolean algebra with CCC. In this note we construct such an example.</description>

      <title>Fra\"iss\'e limit and Ramsey Theorem: the case of MV-algebras and a categorical generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we describe the Fra\"iss\'e limit of finite MV-algebras and then prove that finite MV-algebras verify the Ramsey property. Then we show that MV-algebras are just a special case of a more general situation. In fact, under minumum conditions for the application of the Kechris-Pestov-Todorcevic correspondence, Ramsey property holds for a certain category of finite structures if and only if it holds for a completion subcategory of it.</description>

      <title>Totally Bounded Elements in W*-probability Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of a totally ($K$-) bounded element of a W*-probability space $(M, \varphi)$ and, borrowing ideas of Kadison, give an intrinsic characterization of the $^*$-subalgebra $M_{tb}$ of totally bounded elements. Namely, we show that $M_{tb}$ is the unique strongly dense $^*$-subalgebra $M_0$ of totally bounded elements of $M$ for which the collection of totally $1$-bounded elements of $M_0$ is complete with respect to the $\|\cdot\|_\varphi^\#$-norm and for which $M_0$ is closed under all operators $h_a(\log(\Delta))$ for $a \in \mathbb{N}$, where $\Delta$ is the modular operator and $h_a(t):=1/\cosh(t-a)$ (see Theorem 4.3). As an application, we combine this characterization with Rieffel and Van Daele's bounded approach to modular theory to arrive at a new language and axiomatization of W*-probability spaces as metric structures. Previous work of Dabrowski had axiomatized W*-probability spaces using a smeared version of multiplication, but the subalgebra $M_{tb}$ allows us to give an axiomatization in terms of the original algebra operations. Finally, we prove the (non-)axiomatizability of several classes of W*-probability spaces.</description>

      <title>Ordinal Exponentiation in Homotopy Type Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While ordinals have traditionally been studied mostly in classical frameworks, constructive ordinal theory has seen significant progress in recent years. However, a general constructive treatment of ordinal exponentiation has thus far been missing. We present two seemingly different definitions of constructive ordinal exponentiation in the setting of homotopy type theory. The first is abstract, uses suprema of ordinals, and is solely motivated by the expected equations. The second is more concrete, based on decreasing lists, and can be seen as a constructive version of a classical construction by Sierpi\'{n}ski based on functions with finite support. We show that our two approaches are equivalent (whenever it makes sense to ask the question), and use this equivalence to prove algebraic laws and decidability properties of the exponential. All our results are formalized in the proof assistant Agda.</description>

      <title>Full Generalized Effective Reducibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19386v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the concept of effective reducibility between statements of set theory with ordinal Turing machines (OTMs) explored in earlier work for $\Pi_{2}$-statements to statements of arbitrary quantifier complexity in prenex normal form and use this to compare various fundamental set-theoretical principles, including the power set axiom, the separation scheme, the collection scheme and the replacement scheme, with respect to effective reducibility. This notion of reducibility is both different from (i.e., strictly weaker than) classical truth and from the OTM-realizability of the corresponding implications. Along the way, we obtain a computational characterization of HOD as the class of sets that are OTM-computable relative to every effectivizer of $\Sigma_{2}$-separation.</description>

      <title>A Note on Power-OTMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03440v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the computational strength of Power-OTMs, i.e., ordinal Turing machines equipped with a power set operator, and study a notion of realizability based on these machines. When parameters are allowed, these machines are, modulo access to a global well-ordering, equivalent to the Set Register Machines defined by Robert Passmann in \cite{Passmann}, and while most of the results on the realizability of Power-OTMs are analogous to results obtained by Passmann, the settings lead to different results concerning the axiom of choice. As we will see, the computational strength of power-OTMs can, depending on the set-theoretical background, also differ from that of Set Register Machines.</description>

      <title>Local reflections of choice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13785v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Under the assumption of small violations of choice with seed $S$ ($\mathsf{SVC}(S)$), the failure of many choice principles reflect to to local properties of $S$, which can be a helpful characterisation for preservation proofs. We demonstrate the reflections of $\mathsf{DC}$, $\mathsf{AC}_\lambda$, $\mathsf{PP}$, and other important forms of choice. As a consequence, we show that if $S$ is infinite then $S$ can be partitioned into $\omega$ many non-empty subsets.</description>

      <title>Matroid intersection and packing/covering conjectures are true in the class of finitary matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04321v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given two finite matroids on the same ground set, a celebrated result of Edmonds says that the ground set can be partitioned into two disjoint subsets in a manner that there is a common independent set in both matroids whose intersection with the first subset spans that subset in the first matroid, and whose intersection with the second subset spans that subset in the second matroid.
  There is a longstanding conjecture regarding the situation of two matroids defined on the same infinite ground set. Infinite matroids were only recently axiomatized in the early 2010s in the work of Bruhn et al., while the conjecture had been proposed during the 1990s for the class of structures that are now called finitary matroids, which are matroids all of whose circuits are finite sets.
  The packing/covering conjecture, due to Bowler and Carmesin, is a related conjecture in the sense that it is true in the class of all matroids if and only if the matroid intersection conjecture is true in the class of all matroids. Given any family of matroids on the same ground set, the conjecture asks if it is possible to partition the ground set into two disjoint subsets in a way such that the corresponding family of matroids restricted to the first subset admits a packing while the family of matroids contracted to the second subset admits a covering.
  We prove both of these conjectures in the class of finitary matroids. Our main tool is nonstandard analysis, specifically the technique of iterated nonstandard extensions. Roughly, we first embed any infinite matroid inside a hyperfinite matroid defined on a subset of the nonstandard extension of the original ground set, and we iteratively nonstandardly extend the hyperfinite structure again in order to prove results in the internal universe that can be directly transferred to obtain results about the matroid(s) we started with.</description>
