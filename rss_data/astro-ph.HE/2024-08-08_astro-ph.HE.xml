      <title>Intrinsic line profiles for X-ray fluorescent lines in SKIRT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We included the intrinsic line profiles of the strongest fluorescent lines in the X-ray radiative transfer code SKIRT to model the cold-gas structure and kinematics based on high-resolution line observations from XRISM/Resolve and Athena/X-IFU. The intrinsic line profiles of the Ka and Kb lines of Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu were implemented based on a multi-Lorentzian parameterisation and line energies are sampled from these Lorentzian components during the radiative transfer routine. In the optically thin regime, the SKIRT results match the intrinsic line profiles as measured in the laboratory. With a more complex 3D model that also includes kinematics, we find that the intrinsic line profiles are broadened and shifted to an extent that will be detectable with XRISM/Resolve; this model also demonstrates the importance of the intrinsic line shapes for constraining kinematics. We find that observed line profiles directly trace the cold-gas kinematics, without any additional radiative transfer effects. With the advent of the first XRISM/Resolve data, this update to the X-ray radiative transfer framework of SKIRT is timely and provides a unique tool for constraining the velocity structure of cold gas from X-ray microcalorimeter spectra.</description>

      <title>Superdiffusion of energetic particles at shocks: A L\'evy Flight model for acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the Heliosphere, power-law particle distributions are observed e.g. upstream of interplanetary shocks, which can result from superdiffusive transport. This non-Gaussian transport regime may result from intermittent magnetic field structures. Recently, we showed that a L\'evy flight model reproduces the observed features at shocks: power-law distributions upstream and enhanced intensities at the shock. We extend the L\'evy flight model to study the impact of superdiffusive transport on particle acceleration at shocks. The acceleration time scale and spectral slope are compared to Gaussian diffusion and a L\'evy walk model. The fractional transport equation is solved by sampling the number density with the corresponding stochastic differential equation that is driven by an alpha-stable L\'evy distribution. For both Gaussian and superdiffusive transport we use a modified version of CRPropa 3.2. We obtain the number density and energy spectra for constant and energy-dependent anomalous diffusion and find, compared to the case of Gaussian diffusion, harder energy spectra at the shock as well as faster acceleration. The spectral slope is even harder than predicted for L\'evy walks. L\'evy flight models of superdiffusive transport lead to observed features in the Heliosphere. We further show that superdiffusive transport impacts the acceleration process by changing the probability to escape the shock. The flexibility of the L\'evy flight model allows for further studies in the future, taking the shock geometry and magnetic field structure into account.</description>

      <title>V407 Lup, an intermediate polar nova</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present X-ray and optical observations of nova V407 Lup (Nova Lup 2016), previously well monitored in outburst, as it returned to quiescent accretion. The X-ray light curve in 2020 February revealed a clear flux modulation with a stable period of 564.64$\pm$0.64 s, corresponding to the period measured in outburst and attributed to the spin of a magnetized white dwarf in an intermediate polar (IP) system. This detection in quiescence is consistent with the IP classification proposed after the nova eruption. The XMM-Newton EPIC X-ray flux is about 1.3 $\times 10^{-12}$ erg/cm$^2$/s at a distance, most likely, larger than 5 kpc, emitted in the whole 0.2-12 keV range without a significant cut-off energy. The X-ray spectra are complex; they can be fitted including a power law component with a relatively flat slope (a power law index of about 1), although, alternatively, a hard thermal component at kT$\geq$19 keV also yields a good fit. The SALT optical spectra obtained in 2019 March and 2022 May are quite typical of IPs, with strong emission lines, including some due to a high ionization potential, like He II at 4685.7 Angstrom. Nebular lines of O [III] were prominent in 2019 March, but their intensity and equivalent width appeared to be decreasing during that month, and they were no longer detectable in 2022, indicating that the nova ejecta dispersed. Complex profiles of the He II lines of V407 Lup are also characteristic of IPs, giving further evidence for this classification.</description>

      <title>Building spectral templates and reconstructing parameters for core collapse supernovae with CASTOR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The future of time-domain optical astronomy relies on the development of techniques and software capable of handling a rising amount of data and gradually complementing, or replacing if necessary, real observations. Next generation surveys, like the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), will open the door to the new era of optical astrophysics, creating, at the same time, a deficiency in spectroscopic data necessary to confirm the nature of each event and to fully recover the parametric space. In this framework, we developed Core collApse Supernovae parameTers estimatOR (CASTOR), a novel software for data analysis. CASTOR combines Gaussian Process and other Machine Learning techniques to build time-series templates of synthetic spectra and to estimate parameters of core collapse supernovae for which only multi-band photometry is available. Techniques to build templates are fully data driven and non-parametric through empirical and robust models, and rely on the direct comparison with a training set of 111 core collapse supernovae from the literature. Furthermore, CASTOR employees the real photometric data and the reconstructed synthetic spectra of an event to estimate parameters that belong to the supernova ejecta, to the stellar progenitor and to the event itself, in a rapid and user-friendly framework. In this work we provide a demonstration of how CASTOR works, studying available data from SN2015ap and comparing our results with those available in literature.</description>

      <title>Evolving massive stars to core collapse with GENEC: Extension of equation of state, opacities and effective nuclear network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stars with initial mass above roughly 8 solar masses will evolve to form a core made of iron group elements at which point no further exothermic nuclear reactions between charged nuclei may prevent the core collapse. Electron captures, neutrino losses, and the photo-disintegration of heavy nuclei trigger the collapse of these stars. Models at the brink of core collapse are produced using stellar evolution codes and these pre-collapse models may be used in the study of the subsequent dynamical evolution (including their explosion as supernovae and the formation of compact remnants such as neutron stars or black holes). We upgrade the physical ingredients employed by the GENeva stellar Evolution Code, GENEC, so that it may cover the regime of high temperatures and high densities required to produce progenitors of core-collapse. We have improved GENEC in three directions, equation of state, the nuclear reaction network and the radiative and conductive opacities adapted for the computation of the advanced phases of evolution. We produce a small grid of pre-supernova models of stars with zero-age main sequence masses of 15, 20 and 25 solar masses at solar and less than half solar metallicities. The results are compared with analogous models produced with the MESA code. The global properties of our new models, particularly of their inner cores, are comparable to models computed with MESA and pre-existing progenitors in the literature. Between codes the exact shell structure varies impacting explosion predictions. Using GENEC with state-of-the-art physics, we have produced massive stellar progenitors prior to collapse. These progenitors are suitable for follow-up studies, including the dynamical collapse and supernova phases. Larger grids of supernova progenitors are now feasible, with potential for further dynamical evolution.</description>

      <title>Precession and higher order multipoles in binary black holes (and lack thereof)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The latest binary black hole population estimates argue for a subpopulation of unequal component mass binaries with spins that are likely small but isotropically distributed. This implies a non-zero probability of detecting spin-induced orbital precession and higher order multipoles moments in the observed gravitational-wave signals. In this work we directly calculate the probability for precession and higher order multipoles in each significant gravitational-wave candidate observed by the LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA collaborations (LVK). We find that only one event shows substantial evidence for precession: GW200129_065458, and two events show substantial evidence for higher order multipoles: GW190412 and GW190814; any evidence for precession and higher order multipoles in other gravitational-wave signals is consistent with random fluctuations caused by noise. We then compare our observations with expectations from population models, and confirm that current population estimates from the LVK accurately predict the number of observed events with significant evidence for precession and higher order multipole moments. In particular, we find that this population model predicts that a binary with significant evidence for precession will occur once in every $\sim 50$ detections, and a binary with significant evidence for higher order multipole moments will occur once in every $\sim 70$ observations. However, we emphasise that since substantial evidence for precession and higher order multipole moments have only been observed in three events, any population model that includes a subpopulation of binaries yielding $\sim 2\%$ of events with detectable precession and higher order multipole moments will likely be consistent with the data.</description>

      <title>Feasibility of dark matter admixed neutron star based on recent observational constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The equation of state (EOS) for neutron stars is modeled using the Relativistic Mean Field (RMF) approach with a mesonic nonlinear (NL) interaction, a modified sigma cut potential (NL-$\sigma$ cut), and the influences of dark matter in the NL (NL DM). Using a Bayesian analysis framework, we evaluate the plausibility and impact of each scenario. Experimental constraints on the general properties of finite nuclei and heavy ion collisions, along with astrophysical observational data on neutron star radii and tidal deformation, have been taken into account. It was shown that all models, including the PREX-II data, were less favored, indicating that this experimental data seemed to be in tension with the other constraints included in the inference procedure, and were incompatible with chiral effective field theoretical calculations of pure neutron matter. Considering the models with no PREX-II constraints, we find the model NL-$\sigma$ cut with the largest Bayes evidence, indicating that the constraints considered favor the stiffening of the EOS at large densities. Conversely, the neutron star with a dark matter component is the least favorable case in light of recent observational constraints, among different scenarios considered here. The $f$ and $p$ modes were calculated within the Cowling approximation, and it can be seen that $f$ modes are sensitive to the EOS. An analysis of the slopes of the mass-radius curves and $f$-mode mass curves has indicated that these quantities may help distinguish the different scenarios.We also analyzed the impact of new PSR J0437-4715 measurements on neutron star mass-radius estimates, noting a $\sim$ 0.2 km reduction in the 90\% CI upper boundary across all models and a significant Bayes evidence decrease, indicating potential conflicts with previous data or the necessity for more adaptable models.</description>

      <title>Superfluid quantum criticality and the thermal evolution of neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The neutron star starts to cool down shortly after its birth by emitting neutrinos. When it is cold enough, the Cooper pairs of neutrons are formed, which triggers a superfluid transition. Previous works on neutron superfluidity are focused on the finite-temperature transition. Little attention is paid to the potentially important quantum critical phenomena associated with superfluidity. Here, we provide the first theoretical analysis of superfluid quantum criticality, concentrating on its impact on neutron star cooling. Extensive calculations found that superfluidity occurs within a finite range of nuclear density $\rho$. The density serves as a non-thermal parameter for superfluid quantum phase transition. In a broad quantum critical region, there is a strong coupling between the gapless neutrons and the quantum critical fluctuations of superfluid order parameter. We handle this coupling by using perturbation theory and renormalization group method, and show that it leads to non-Fermi liquid behavior, which yields a logarithmic $T\ln(1/T)$ correction to the Fermi-liquid specific heat $c_{n}\propto T$ and also markedly alters the neutrino emissivity. Quantum critical phenomena emerge at a time much earlier than the onset of superfluidity and persist throughout almost the entire life of a neutron star. At a low $T$, such phenomena coexist with superfluidity in the neutron star interior, yet occupying different layers. We include superfluid quantum criticality into the theoretical description of neutron star cooling and find that it obviously prolongs the thermal relaxation time. By varying the strength of superfluid fluctuations and other quantities, we obtain an excellent fit to the observed cooling data of a variety of neutron stars. Our results indicate the existence of an intriguing correlation between superfluid quantum criticality and the thermal evolution of neutron stars.</description>

      <title>The Landscape of Thermal Transients from Supernova Interacting with a Circumstellar Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.03360v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interaction of supernova ejecta with a surrounding circumstellar medium (CSM) generates a strong shock which can convert the ejecta kinetic energy into observable radiation. Given the diversity of potential CSM structures (arising from diverse mass loss processes such as late-stage stellar outbursts, binary interaction, and winds), the resulting transients can display a wide range of light curve morphologies. We provide a framework for classifying the transients arising from interaction with a spherical CSM shell. The light curves are decomposed into five consecutive phases, starting from the onset of interaction and extending through shock breakout and subsequent shock cooling. The relative prominence of each phase in the light curve is determined by two dimensionless quantities representing the CSM-to-ejecta mass ratio $\eta$, and a breakout parameter $\xi$. These two parameters define four light curve morphology classes, where each class is characterized by the location of shock breakout and the degree of deceleration as the shock sweeps up the CSM. We compile analytic scaling relations connecting the luminosity and duration of each light curve phase to the physical parameters. We then run a grid of radiation hydrodynamics simulations for a wide range of ejecta and CSM parameters to numerically explore the landscape of interaction light curves, and to calibrate and confirm the analytic scalings. We connect our theoretical framework to several case studies of observed transients, highlighting the relevance in explaining slow-rising and superluminous supernovae, fast blue optical transients, and double-peaked light curves.</description>

      <title>Multiple Emission Regions in Jets of Low Luminosity Active Galactic Nucleus in NGC 4278</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15657v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) has detected very high energy gamma rays from the LINER galaxy NGC 4278, which has a low luminosity active galactic nucleus, and symmetric mildly relativistic S-shaped twin jets detected by radio observations. Few low-luminosity active galactic nuclei are detected in gamma rays due to their faintness. Earlier, several radio-emitting components were detected in the jets of NGC 4278. We model their radio emission with synchrotron emission of ultra-relativistic electrons to estimate the strength of the magnetic field inside these components within a time-dependent framework after including the ages of the different components. We show that the synchrotron and synchrotron self-Compton emission by these components cannot explain the Swift X-ray data and the LHAASO gamma-ray data from NGC 4278. We suggest that a separate component in one of the jets is responsible for the high energy emission whose age, size, magnetic field and the spectrum of the ultra-relativistic electrons inside it have been estimated after fitting the multi-wavelength data of NGC 4278 with the sum of the spectral energy distributions from the radio components and the high energy component. We note that the radio components of NGC 4278 are larger than the high-energy component which has also been observed in several high-luminosity active galactic nuclei.</description>

      <title>GRB 211211A: The Case for an Engine Powered over r-Process Powered Blue Kilonova</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14366v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) GRB 211211A provides the earliest ($\sim 5$ h) data of a kilonova (KN) event, displaying bright ($\sim10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$) and blue early emission. Previously, this KN has been explained using simplistic multi-component fitting methods. Here, in order to understand the physical origin of the KN emission in GRB 211211A, we employ an analytic multi-zone model for r-process powered KN. We find that r-process powered KN models alone cannot explain the fast temporal evolution and the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the observed emission. Specifically, i) r-process models require high ejecta mass to match early luminosity, which overpredicts late-time emission, while ii) red KN models that reproduce late emission underpredict early luminosity. We propose an alternative scenario involving early contributions from the GRB central engine via a late low-power jet, consistent with plateau emission in short GRBs and GeV emission detected by Fermi-LAT at $\sim10^4$ s after GRB 211211A. Such late central engine activity, with an energy budget of $\sim \text{a few }\%$ of that of the prompt jet, combined with a single red-KN ejecta component, can naturally explain the light curve and SED of the observed emission; with the late-jet -- ejecta interaction reproducing the early blue emission and r-process heating reproducing the late red emission. This supports claims that late low-power engine activity after prompt emission may be common. We encourage very early follow-up observations of future nearby GRBs, and compact binary merger events, to reveal more about the central engine of GRBs and r-process events.</description>

      <title>The Dusty Aftermath of a Rapid Nova: V5579 Sgr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01924v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: V5579 Sgr was a fast nova discovered in 2008 April 18.784 UT. We present the optical spectroscopic observations of the nova observed from the Castanet Tolosan, SMARTS and CTIO observatories spanning over 2008 April 23 to 2015 May 11. The spectra are dominated by hydrogen Balmer, Fe II and O I lines with P-Cygni profiles in the early phase, typical of an Fe II class nova. The spectra show He I and He II lines along with forbidden lines from N, Ar, S, and O in the nebular phase. The nova showed a pronounced dust formation episode that began about 20 days after the outburst. The dust temperature and mass were estimated using the WISE data from spectral energy distribution (SED) fits. The PAH-like features are also seen in the nova ejecta in the mid-IR Gemini spectra taken 522 d after the discovery. Analysis of the light curve indicates values of t$_2$ and t$_3$ about 9 and 13 days, respectively, placing the nova in the category of fast nova. The best fit cloudy model of the early decline phase JHK spectra obtained on 2008 May 3 and the nebular optical spectrum obtained on 2011 June 2 shows a hot white dwarf source with T$_{BB}$ $\sim$ 2.6 $\times$ 10$^5$ K having a luminosity of 9.8 $\times$ 10$^{36}$ ergs s$^{-1}$. Our abundance analysis shows that the ejecta is significantly enhanced relative to solar, O/H = 32.2, C/H = 15.5 and N/H = 40.0 in the early decline phase and O/H = 5.8, He/H = 1.5 and N/H = 22.0 in the nebular phase.</description>
