      <title>Influence of strangeness on the anisotropic flow of prompt D$^\pm_\mathrm{s}$ mesons in PbPb collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The azimuthal anisotropy of prompt D$^\pm_\mathrm{s}$ mesons produced in lead-lead (PbPb) collisions at a nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy of 5.02 TeV is measured using data obtained with the CMS detector. The dataset corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 0.58 nb$^{-1}$. The azimuthal anisotropy of heavy charmed mesons provides a key constraint on the interactions of charm quarks with the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) medium. These interactions include coalescence mechanisms and parton energy loss in the QGP. The anisotropy is quantified by the second- ($v_2$) and third-order ($v_3$) Fourier coefficients of the azimuthal distribution of the D$^\pm_\mathrm{s}$ mesons. The $v_2$ coefficient is determined in the transverse momentum range 4 $\lt$ $p_\mathrm{T}$ $\lt$ 40 GeV for three event centrality classes, while the $v_3$ coefficient is measured in the range 4 $\lt$ $p_\mathrm{T}$ $\lt$ 20 GeV for a single event centrality class. The results for the D$^\pm_\mathrm{s}$ mesons are compared to those previously measured for D$^0$ mesons. The azimuthal anisotropy coefficients for D$^\pm_\mathrm{s}$ and D$^0$ mesons are found to be consistent within the precision of this measurement, suggesting that the strangeness content of the D$^\pm_\mathrm{s}$ meson does not significantly alter its azimuthal distribution within the measured $p_\mathrm{T}$ range.</description>

      <title>Near-Threshold J/$\psi \to \mu^+\mu^-$ Photoproduction and the Gluonic Gravitational Form Factors of the Proton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the measurement of the two-dimensional differential cross section for near-threshold J/$\psi \to \mu^+\mu^-$ photoproduction from the J/$\psi$-007 experiment in Hall C at Jefferson Lab. Our results agree with the previously published J/$\psi \to e^+e^-$ results. We extract the integrated photoproduction cross section and find no evidence for open-charm contributions. A combined analysis of both decay channels following a Holographic QCD approach yields improved experimental constraints on the gluonic gravitational form factor $\mathcal{C}_g(t)$. Our results agree with recent lattice QCD calculations and we obtain $\mathcal{C}_g(t)$ with a comparable statistical precision to lattice QCD. Our results support a spatial picture where gluons dominate at larger radii with a confining inward pressure. This work provides new input for exploring the mechanical properties of gluons inside the proton.</description>

      <title>High-precision measurement of $^{215}$Po half-life via delayed-coincidence analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We performed a high-precision study of the $^{215}$ Po $\alpha$-decay using a LaBr$_3$ scintillating detector in a low-background environment. The $^{227}$Ac intrinsic contamination in the LaBr$_3$ crystal undergoes a decay chain, producing the intermediate pair of $^{219}$Rn$\rightarrow^{215}$Po$\rightarrow^{211}$Pb decays. The fast time response and good energy resolution of the detector allow for extracting the short half-life of $^{215}$Po from the time correlation of the two subsequent $\alpha$-decays by using the delayed coincidence method. Thanks to high statistics and a comprehensive uncertainty assessment, we obtain the most precise half-life value to date of $^{215}$Po, corresponding to $1.77804\pm0.00091$(stat.)$\pm0.00067$(syst.) ms.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Secondary Neutrons at BLIP for Isotope Production Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fast secondary neutrons created at the Brookhaven Linac Isotope Producer (BLIP) facility following proton irradiation were characterized by the foil activation technique and compared with FLUKA Monte Carlo simulations. The FLUKA-simulated neutron flux was spectrally adjusted following the maximum entropy formalism using the International Reactor Dosimetry and Fusion File (IRDFF-II), with predictions agreeing with experimental measurements to within 9% following the adjustment procedure. A multitude of degrader configurations were simulated to assess the feasibility of improving the fast (En &gt; 20 MeV) secondary neutron yield at the proposed neutron target position (N-slot). A configuration where the N-slot is closest to the proton degrader produced the highest fast neutron yield, with tungsten degraders achieving the best performance. Assuming the optimized target-degrader configuration proposed in this work, we discuss potential isotope production opportunities with secondary neutrons. In most cases the yields are in the order of several mCi.</description>

      <title>Nuclear Fragmentation at Intermediate Energies in the DCM-QGSM-SMM Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of nucleus-nucleus interaction models is a rapidly developing area of heavy-ion physics. Recently, a new model DCM-QGSM-SMM, developed at JINR and oriented toward use within the NICA project at energies of several GeV/nucleon, became available. However, the mechanisms of nuclear interactions used in this model can potentially operate effectively at lower energies. In this paper, the model predictions are compared with the FRAGM and FIRST/GSI experimental data in the energy range of nucleus-nucleus interactions starting from 300 MeV/nucleon, as well as with the predictions of other models used in this energy range.</description>

      <title>Probing Rotational Dynamics of Quark Gluon Plasma via Global Vorticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The findings on the spin polarization of $\Lambda$, $\Xi$, and $\Omega$ hyperons and spin alignment of $K^{*0}$, $\phi$, and $D^{*+}$ mesons in relativistic heavy-ion collision experiments at the RHIC and LHC facilities propose the emergence of a strong vorticity field produced in these collisions. Contemplating the potential impact of vorticity on the space-time evolution of deconfined QCD matter and its freeze-out properties, we aim to investigate its characteristics within the medium. We introduce a complementary and data-driven approach to quantify the global vorticity field by extracting it directly from the transverse momentum spectra of produced hadrons. Employing the experimental data for $\Lambda$, $\Xi$, $\Omega$, $K^{*0}$, $K^{*\pm}$, $\phi$, $\rho$, and $D^{*+}$ at mid-rapidity in Au+Au and Pb+Pb collisions over a wide range of beam energies, $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=7.7$ GeV-5.02 TeV, and centrality classes, we systematically examine spin-vorticity coupling in the medium. Our finding on the magnitude of the extracted vorticity is consistent with values deduced from $\Lambda$ and $\bar{\Lambda}$ polarization measurements using statistical thermal models under the non-relativistic limit. Notably, we observe a prominent particle-species dependence of the vorticity, as well as a non-trivial variation with collision centrality and beam energy. These results indicate that vorticity-driven spin phenomena are sensitive to hadron structure and freeze-out dynamics, providing new constraints on the rotational properties of the QCD matter.</description>

      <title>Measurements of Beam Spin Asymmetries of $\pi^\pm\pi^0$ dihadrons at CLAS12</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A first measurement of beam spin asymmetries for $\pi^+\pi^0$ and $\pi^-\pi^0$ pairs in semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering is reported. The asymmetries in the dihadron angular distributions were measured from the scattering of a 10.6 GeV longitudinally polarized electron beam off a proton target, using the CLAS12 detector at Jefferson Lab. A photon classifier using a Gradient Boosted Trees (GBTs) architecture was trained with Monte Carlo simulations to reduce the amount of false combinatorial background $\pi^0$s, increasing statistics by up to five-fold compared to previous CLAS12 $\pi^0$ analyses. A nonzero $\sin\phi_{R_\perp}$ asymmetry is observed. This measurement is sensitive to the underexplored collinear twist-3 PDF $e(x)$, which encodes quark-gluon correlations in the proton, and presents a new avenue for its point-by-point extraction. The asymmetries also provide the first experimental evidence for the isospin-dependence of the helicity-dependent dihadron fragmentation function $G_1^\perp$, revealed by a sign-difference between the $\pi^+\pi^0$ and $\pi^-\pi^0$ channels in the $\sin(\phi_h-\phi_{R_\perp})$ modulation. In contrast, a large, same-sign enhancement near the $\rho$ mass for the $\sin(2\phi_h-2\phi_{R_\perp})$ modulation is observed, matching spectator model predictions in $\pi^+\pi^-$ pairs.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of photon emission rate near QCD critical point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07169v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute photon emission rate enhancement near the QCD critical point using an effective theory of dynamic critical phenomena and derive a universal photon spectrum. The emission rate scales similarly to conductivity, increasing with the correlation length ($\xi$), diverging at the critical point. The spectrum exhibits $\omega dN_{\gamma}/d^3k \propto \omega^{-1/2}$ in the scaling regime, with the transition occurring at a frequency comparable to shear damping rate $\omega \sim \gamma_{\eta}/\xi^2$, reflecting the nonequilibrium properties of the near-critical liquid.</description>

      <title>Reaction processes of muon-catalyzed fusion in the muonic molecule $dd\mu$ studied with the tractable $T$-matrix model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12783v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Muon-catalyzed fusion has recently regained significant attention due to experimental and theoretical developments being performed. The present authors [Phys. Rev. C {\bf 109} 054625 (2024)] proposed the tractable $T$-matrix model based on the Lippmann-Schwinger equation to approximate the elaborate two- and three-body coupled-channel (CC) calculations [Kamimura, Kino, and Yamashita, Phys. Rev. C {\bf 107}, 034607 (2023)] for the nuclear reaction processes in the muonic molecule $dt\mu$, $(dt\mu)_{J=0} \to\!^4{\rm He} + n + \mu + 17.6 \, {\rm MeV}$. % or $(^4{\rm He}\mu)_{nl} + n + 17.6 \,{\rm MeV}$. The $T$-matrix model well reproduced almost all of the results generated by the CC work. In the present paper, we apply this model to the nuclear reaction processes in the $dd\mu$ molecule, $(dd\mu)_{J=1} \to\!^3{\rm He} + n + \mu +3.27 \,$ MeV or $t + p + \mu + 4.03 \,$ MeV, in which the fusion takes place via the $p$-wave $d$-$d$ relative motion. Recently, significantly different $p$-wave astrophysical $S(E)$ factors of the reaction $d + d \to\!^3{\rm He} + n$ or $t + p$ at $E \! \simeq \! 1$ keV to 1 MeV have been reported experimentally and theoretically by five groups. Employing many sets of nuclear interactions that can reproduce those five cases of $p$-wave $S(E)$ factors, we calculate the fusion rate of the $(dd\mu)_{J=1}$ molecule using three kinds of methods where results are consistent with each other. We also derive the $^3{\rm He}$-$\mu$ sticking probability and the absolute values of the energy and momentum spectra of the emitted muon. The violation of charge symmetry in the $p$-wave $d$-$d$ reaction and the $dd\mu$ fusion reaction is discussed. Information on the emitted 2.45-MeV neutrons and \mbox{1 keV-dominant} muons should be useful for the application of $dd\mu$ fusion.</description>

      <title>Computing nuclear response functions with time-dependent coupled-cluster theory</title>

Abstract: We compute nuclear response functions by solving the time-dependent A-body Schr\"odinger equation, recording the time-dependent transition moment and extracting spectral information via Fourier transforms. The solution of the time-dependent many-body problem accounts for correlations on top of the mean field by taking advantage of a time-dependent formulation of coupled-cluster theory. As a validation, we focus on electric dipole transitions in $^4$He and $^{16}$O and compare moments of the response function distribution to the results of an equivalent static framework, finding negligible discrepancies. We investigate how proton and neutron densities evolve in time, and we see the traditional picture of soft and giant dipole resonances as collective oscillations of protons and neutrons emerging from our calculations in $^{16}$O and $^{24}$O. This method also allows us to investigate the behavior of the nucleus in the presence of a strong electric field. In that regime, the behavior of the system becomes chaotic. Qualitatively, the spectral information obtained in this limit is in line with previous time-dependent mean-field results.</description>

      <title>Emergent Bell-Triplet State in Proton-Proton Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24325v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entanglement is a key resource in quantum information science, yet its properties and applications in nuclear systems remain largely unexplored. Here, using proton-proton scattering as a quantum laboratory, we report the emergence of a near-pure Bell-triplet state at a laboratory energy of 151 MeV and a center-of-mass scattering angle of 90 degrees. In this unique kinematic regime, the scattering amplitude functions as a transition operator connecting distinct Bell states. Building upon this emergent resource, we propose a quantum teleportation protocol for proton spins, exploiting the intrinsic Hamiltonian of the strong interaction to perform the requisite Bell measurement. These findings effectively bridge few-body nuclear physics and quantum technology, establishing proton-proton scattering as both a source of high-fidelity entanglement and a natural processor for quantum information.</description>
