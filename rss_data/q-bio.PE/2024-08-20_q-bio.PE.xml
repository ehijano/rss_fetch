      <title>Constructing the Molecular Tree of Life using Assembly Theory and Mass Spectrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we demonstrate the first biochemistry-agnostic approach to map evolutionary relationships at the molecular scale, allowing the construction of phylogenetic models using mass spectrometry (MS) and Assembly Theory (AT) without elucidating molecular identities. AT allows us to estimate the complexity of molecules by deducing the amount of shared information stored within them when . By examining 74 samples from a diverse range of biotic and abiotic sources, we used tandem MS data to detect 24102 analytes (9262 unique) and 59518 molecular fragments (6755 unique). Using this MS dataset, together with AT, we were able to infer the joint assembly spaces (JAS) of samples from molecular analytes. We show how JAS allows agnostic annotation of samples without fingerprinting exact analyte identities, facilitating accurate determination of their biogenicity and taxonomical grouping. Furthermore, we developed an AT-based framework to construct a biochemistry-agnostic phylogenetic tree which is consistent with genome-based models and outperforms other similarity-based algorithms. Finally, we were able to use AT to track colony lineages of a single bacterial species based on phenotypic variation in their molecular composition with high accuracy, which would be challenging to track with genomic data. Our results demonstrate how AT can expand causal molecular inference to non-sequence information without requiring exact molecular identities, thereby opening the possibility to study previously inaccessible biological domains.</description>

      <title>Predicting potential SARS-CoV-2 spillover and spillback in animals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic is spreading rapidly around the world, causing countries to impose lockdowns and efforts to develop vaccines on a global scale. However, human-to-animal and animal-to-human transmission cannot be ignored, as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can spread rapidly in farmed and wild animals. This could create a worrying cycle of SARS-CoV-2 spillover from humans to animals and spillback of new strains back into humans, rendering vaccines ineffective. This study provides a key indicator of animals that may be potential susceptible hosts for SARS-CoV-2 and coronavirus infections by analysing the phylogenetic distance between host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and the coronavirus spike protein. Crucially, our analysis identifies animals that are at elevated risk from a spillover and spillback incident. One group of animals has been identified as potentially susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 by harbouring a parasitic coronavirus spike protein similar to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. These animals may serve as amplification hosts in spillover events from zoonotic reservoirs. Tracing interspecies transmission in multi-host environments based solely on in vitro and in vivo examinations of animal susceptibility or serology is a time-consuming task. This approach allows rapid identification of high-risk animals to prioritize research and assessment of the risk of zoonotic disease transmission in the environment. It is a tool to rapidly identify zoonotic species that may cause outbreaks or participate in expansion cycles of coexistence with their hosts. This prevents the spread of coronavirus infections between species, preventing spillover and spillback incidents from occurring.</description>

      <title>Circuit design in biology and machine learning. I. Random networks and dimensional reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A biological circuit is a neural or biochemical cascade, taking inputs and producing outputs. How have biological circuits learned to solve environmental challenges over the history of life? The answer certainly follows Dobzhansky's famous quote that ``nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution.'' But that quote leaves out the mechanistic basis by which natural selection's trial-and-error learning happens, which is exactly what we have to understand. How does the learning process that designs biological circuits actually work? How much insight can we gain about the form and function of biological circuits by studying the processes that have made those circuits? Because life's circuits must often solve the same problems as those faced by machine learning, such as environmental tracking, homeostatic control, dimensional reduction, or classification, we can begin by considering how machine learning designs computational circuits to solve problems. We can then ask: How much insight do those computational circuits provide about the design of biological circuits? How much does biology differ from computers in the particular circuit designs that it uses to solve problems? This article steps through two classic machine learning models to set the foundation for analyzing broad questions about the design of biological circuits. One insight is the surprising power of randomly connected networks. Another is the central role of internal models of the environment embedded within biological circuits, illustrated by a model of dimensional reduction and trend prediction. Overall, many challenges in biology have machine learning analogs, suggesting hypotheses about how biology's circuits are designed.</description>

      <title>Why Honor Heroes? Praise as a Social Signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heroes are people who perform costly altruistic acts. Few people turn out to be heroes, but most people spontaneously honor heroes overtly by commenting, applauding, or enthusiastically celebrating their deeds. This behavior seems odd from an individual fitness optimization perspective. The best strategy should be to rely on others to invest time and effort in celebrations. To explain the universal propensity to pay tribute, we propose that public admiration is a way for admirers to signal that they are committed to the same values as the hero. We show that the emergence of heroic acts is an expected side-effect of this propensity.</description>

      <title>Perfect taxon sampling and fixing taxon traceability: Introducing a class of phylogenetically decisive taxon sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1206.3472</link>
      <description>arXiv:1206.3472v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phylogenetically decisive sets of taxon sets have the property that if trees are chosen for each of their elements, as long as these trees are compatible, the resulting supertree is unique. This means that as long as the trees describing the phylogenetic relationships of the (input) species sets are compatible, they can only be combined into a common supertree in precisely one way. This setting is sometimes also referred to as \enquote{perfect taxon sampling}. While for rooted trees, the decision if a given set of input taxon sets is phylogenetically decisive can be made in polynomial time, the decision problem to determine whether a set of taxon sets is phylogenetically decisive concerning \emph{unrooted} trees is unfortunately coNP-complete and therefore in practice hard to solve for large instances. This shows that recognizing such sets is often difficult. In this paper, we explain phylogenetic decisiveness and introduce a class of input taxon sets, namely so-called \emph{fixing taxon traceable} sets, which are guaranteed to be phylogenetically decisive and which can be recognized in polynomial time. Using both combinatorial approaches as well as simulations, we compare properties of fixing taxon traceability and phylogenetic decisiveness, e.g., by deriving lower and upper bounds for the number of quadruple sets (i.e., sets of 4-tuples) needed in the input set for each of these properties. In particular, we correct an erroneous lower bound concerning phylogenetic decisiveness from the literature.
  We have implemented the algorithm to determine if a given set of taxon sets is fixing taxon traceable in \textsf{R} and made our software package \verb+FixingTaxonTraceR+ publicly available.</description>

      <title>Selection originating from protein stability/foldability: Relationships between protein folding free energy, sequence ensemble, and fitness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.09379</link>
      <description>arXiv:1612.09379v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Assuming that mutation and fixation processes are reversible Markov processes, we prove that the equilibrium ensemble of sequences obeys a Boltzmann distribution with $\exp(4N_e m(1 - 1/(2N)))$, where $m$ is Malthusian fitness and $N_e$ and $N$ are effective and actual population sizes. On the other hand, the probability distribution of sequences with maximum entropy that satisfies a given amino acid composition at each site and a given pairwise amino acid frequency at each site pair is a Boltzmann distribution with $\exp(-\psi_N)$, where $\psi_N$ is represented as the sum of one body and pairwise potentials. A protein folding theory indicates that homologous sequences obey a canonical ensemble characterized by $\exp(-\Delta G_{ND}/k_B T_s)$ or by $\exp(- G_{N}/k_B T_s)$ if an amino acid composition is kept constant, where $\Delta G_{ND} \equiv G_N - G_D$, $G_N$ and $G_D$ are the native and denatured free energies, and $T_s$ is selective temperature. Thus, $4N_e m (1 - 1/(2N))$, $-\Delta \psi_{ND}$, and $-\Delta G_{ND}/k_B T_s$ must be equivalent to each other. Based on the analysis of the changes ($\Delta \psi_N$) of $\psi_N$ due to single nucleotide nonsynonymous substitutions, $T_s$, and then glass transition temperature $T_g$, and $\Delta G_{ND}$ are estimated with reasonable values for 14 protein domains. In addition, approximating the probability density function (PDF) of $\Delta \psi_N$ by a log-normal distribution, PDFs of $\Delta \psi_N$ and $K_a/K_s$, which is the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitution rate per site, in all and in fixed mutants are estimated. It is confirmed that $T_s$ negatively correlates with the mean of $K_a/K_s$. Stabilizing mutations are significantly fixed by positive selection, and balance with destabilizing mutations fixed by random drift. Supporting the nearly neutral theory, neutral selection is not significant.</description>

      <title>On the importance of assessing topological convergence in Bayesian phylogenetic inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11657v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern phylogenetics research is often performed within a Bayesian framework, using sampling algorithms such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to approximate the posterior distribution. These algorithms require careful evaluation of the quality of the generated samples. Within the field of phylogenetics, one frequently adopted diagnostic approach is to evaluate the effective sample size (ESS) and to investigate trace graphs of the sampled parameters. A major limitation of these approaches is that they are developed for continuous parameters and therefore incompatible with a crucial parameter in these inferences: the tree topology. Several recent advancements have aimed at extending these diagnostics to topological space. In this reflection paper, we present two case studies - one on Ebola virus and one on HIV - illustrating how these topological diagnostics can contain information not found in standard diagnostics, and how decisions regarding which of these diagnostics to compute can impact inferences regarding MCMC convergence and mixing. Our results show the importance of running multiple replicate analyses and of carefully assessing topological convergence using the output of these replicate analyses. To this end, we illustrate different ways of assessing and visualizing the topological convergence of these replicates. Given the major importance of detecting convergence and mixing issues in Bayesian phylogenetic analyses, the lack of a unified approach to this problem warrants further action, especially now that additional tools are becoming available to researchers.</description>

      <title>Temporal Interaction and its Role in the Evolution of Cooperation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11782v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This research investigates the impact of dynamic, time-varying interactions on cooperative behaviour in social dilemmas. Traditional research has focused on deterministic rules governing pairwise interactions, yet the impact of interaction frequency and synchronization in groups on cooperation remains underexplored. Addressing this gap, our work introduces two temporal interaction mechanisms to model the stochastic or periodic participation of individuals in public goods games, acknowledging real-life variances due to exogenous temporal factors and geographical time differences. We consider that the interaction state significantly influences both game payoff calculations and the strategy updating process, offering new insights into the emergence and sustainability of cooperation. Our results indicate that maximum game participation frequency is suboptimal under a stochastic interaction mechanism. Instead, an intermediate activation probability maximizes cooperation, suggesting a vital balance between interaction frequency and inactivity security. Furthermore, local synchronization of interactions within specific areas is shown to be beneficial, as time differences hinder the spread of cross-structures but promote the formation of dense cooperative clusters with smoother boundaries. We also note that stronger clustering in networks, larger group sizes and lower noise increase cooperation. This research contributes to understanding the role of node-based temporality and probabilistic interactions in social dilemmas, offering insights into fostering cooperation.</description>

      <title>Stability of a Delayed Predator-Prey Model for Puma Concolor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07904v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study presents a mathematical model that describes the relationship between the Puma concolor and its prey using delay differential equations, a Holling type III functional response, logistic growth for the prey, and a Ricker-type function to model intraspecific competition of the pumas. For positive equilibrium, conditions guaranteeing absolute stability are established, based on the delay value and model parameters. The analysis demonstrates the existence of a unique maximal solution for the proposed model, which remains non-negative for nonnegative initial conditions and is well-defined for all $t$ greater than zero. Furthermore, numerical simulations with different parameter values were performed to investigate the effects of systematically removing a percentage of predators or prey. Numerical simulations attempt to exemplify and put into practice the theorems proved in this article.</description>
