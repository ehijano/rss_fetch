      <title>SoK: Scope and Mission of CS&amp;Law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We systematize the intellectual scope of the ACM Computer Science and Law Symposium (CS&amp;Law). In particular, we address the meaning and importance of the word ''and'' in the name of the symposium. We identify previously published papers (from CS&amp;Law and other forums) that exemplify different aspects of the CS&amp;Law scope and note that the scope is expected to evolve as the symposium and the community grow and change. To round out our systematization of the still nascent research area, we also discuss the mission of CS&amp;Law: What might the symposium seek to accomplish beyond providing a forum for intellectual exchange and community formation?</description>

      <title>Generating CodeMeta using declarative mapping rules: An open-ended approach using ShExML</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nowadays, software is one of the cornerstones when conducting research in several scientific fields which employ computer-based methodologies to answer new research questions. However, for these experiments to be completely reproducible, research software should comply with the FAIR principles, yet its metadata can be represented following different data models and spread across different locations. In order to bring some cohesion to the field, CodeMeta was proposed as a vocabulary to represent research software metadata in a unified and standardised manner. While existing tools can help users to generate CodeMeta files for some specific use cases, they fall short on flexibility and adaptability. Hence, in this work, I propose the use of declarative mapping rules to generate CodeMeta files, illustrated through the implementation of three crosswalks in ShExML which are then expanded and merged to cover the generation of CodeMeta files for two existing research software artefacts. Moreover, the outputs are validated using SHACL and ShEx and the whole generation workflow is automated requiring minimal user intervention upon a new version release. This work can, therefore, be used as an example upon which other developers can include a CodeMeta generation workflow in their repositories, facilitating the adoption of CodeMeta and, ultimately, increasing research software FAIRness.</description>
