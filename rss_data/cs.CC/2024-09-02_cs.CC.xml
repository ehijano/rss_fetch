      <title>Quantum state testing with restricted measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study quantum state testing where the goal is to test whether $\rho=\rho_0\in\mathbb{C}^{d\times d}$ or $\|\rho-\rho_0\|_1&gt;\varepsilon$, given $n$ copies of $\rho$ and a known state description $\rho_0$. In practice, not all measurements can be easily applied, even using unentangled measurements where each copy is measured separately. We develop an information-theoretic framework that yields unified copy complexity lower bounds for restricted families of non-adaptive measurements through a novel measurement information channel. Using this framework, we obtain the optimal bounds for a natural family of $k$-outcome measurements with fixed and randomized schemes. We demonstrate a separation between these two schemes, showing the power of randomized measurement schemes over fixed ones. Previously, little was known for fixed schemes, and tight bounds were only known for randomized schemes with $k\ge d$ and Pauli observables, a special class of 2-outcome measurements. Our work bridges this gap in the literature.</description>

      <title>Lower Bounds for Symmetric Circuits for the Determinant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.10986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.10986v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dawar and Wilsenach (ICALP 2020) introduce the model of symmetric arithmetic circuits and show an exponential separation between the sizes of symmetric circuits for computing the determinant and the permanent. The symmetry restriction is that the circuits which take a matrix input are unchanged by a permutation applied simultaneously to the rows and columns of the matrix. Under such restrictions we have polynomial-size circuits for computing the determinant but no subexponential size circuits for the permanent. Here, we consider a more stringent symmetry requirement, namely that the circuits are unchanged by arbitrary even permutations applied separately to rows and columns, and prove an exponential lower bound even for circuits computing the determinant. The result requires substantial new machinery. We develop a general framework for proving lower bounds for symmetric circuits with restricted symmetries, based on a new support theorem and new two-player restricted bijection games. These are applied to the determinant problem with a novel construction of matrices that are bi-adjacency matrices of graphs based on the CFI construction. Our general framework opens the way to exploring a variety of symmetry restrictions and studying trade-offs between symmetry and other resources used by arithmetic circuits.</description>

      <title>Lasserre Hierarchy for Graph Isomorphism and Homomorphism Indistinguishability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.10538v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that feasibility of the $t^\text{th}$ level of the Lasserre semidefinite programming hierarchy for graph isomorphism can be expressed as a homomorphism indistinguishability relation. In other words, we define a class $\mathcal{L}_t$ of graphs such that graphs $G$ and $H$ are not distinguished by the $t^\text{th}$ level of the Lasserre hierarchy if and only if they admit the same number of homomorphisms from any graph in $\mathcal{L}_t$. By analysing the treewidth of graphs in $\mathcal{L}_t$, we prove that the $3t^\text{th}$ level of Sherali--Adams linear programming hierarchy is as strong as the $t^\text{th}$ level of Lasserre. Moreover, we show that this is best possible in the sense that $3t$ cannot be lowered to $3t-1$ for any $t$. The same result holds for the Lasserre hierarchy with non-negativity constraints, which we similarly characterise in terms of homomorphism indistinguishability over a family $\mathcal{L}_t^+$ of graphs. Additionally, we give characterisations of level-$t$ Lasserre with non-negativity constraints in terms of logical equivalence and via a graph colouring algorithm akin to the Weisfeiler--Leman algorithm. This provides a polynomial time algorithm for determining if two given graphs are distinguished by the $t^\text{th}$ level of the Lasserre hierarchy with non-negativity constraints.</description>

      <title>Forbidden Tournaments and the Orientation Completion Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.08327v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a fixed finite set of finite tournaments ${\mathcal F}$, the ${\mathcal F}$-free orientation problem asks whether a given finite undirected graph $G$ has an $\mathcal F$-free orientation, i.e., whether the edges of $G$ can be oriented so that the resulting digraph does not embed any of the tournaments from ${\mathcal F}$. We prove that for every ${\mathcal F}$, this problem is in P or NP-complete. Our proof reduces the classification task to a complete complexity classification of the orientation completion problem for ${\mathcal F}$, which is the variant of the problem above where the input is a directed graph instead of an undirected graph, introduced by Bang-Jensen, Huang, and Zhu (2017). Our proof uses results from the theory of constraint satisfaction, and a result of Agarwal and Kompatscher (2018) about infinite permutation groups and transformation monoids.</description>

      <title>Quantum State Synthesis: Relation with Decision Complexity Classes and Impossibility of Synthesis Error Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02907v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work investigates the relationships between quantum state synthesis complexity classes (a recent concept in computational complexity that focuses on the complexity of preparing quantum states) and traditional decision complexity classes. We especially investigate the role of the synthesis error parameter, which characterizes the quality of the synthesis in quantum state synthesis complexity classes. We first show that in the high synthesis error regime, collapse of synthesis classes implies collapse of the equivalent decision classes. For more reasonable synthesis error, we then show a similar relationships for BQP and QCMA. Finally, we show that for quantum state synthesis classes it is in general impossible to improve the quality of the synthesis: unlike the completeness and soundness parameters (which can be improved via repetition), the synthesis error cannot be reduced, even with arbitrary computational power.</description>
