      <title>BattMo -- Battery Modelling Toolbox</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the Battery Modelling Toolbox (BattMo), a flexible finite volume continuum modelling framework in MATLAB\textsuperscript{\textregistered} (\citeproc{ref-MATLAB}{The MathWorks Inc., 2025}) for simulating the performance of electro-chemical cells. BattMo can quickly setup and solve models for a variety of battery chemistries, even considering 3D designs such as cylindrical and prismatic cells. The simulation input parameters, including the material parameters and geometric descriptions, are specified through JSON schemas. In this respect, we follow the guidelines of the Battery Interface Ontology (BattINFO) to support semantic interoperability in accordance with the FAIR principles (\citeproc{ref-fair}{Wilkinson et al., 2016}). The Doyle-Fuller-Newman (DFN) (\citeproc{ref-Doyle1993ModelingCell}{Doyle et al., 1993}) approach is used as a base model. We include fully coupled thermal simulations. It is possible to include degradation mechanisms such as SEI layer growth, and the use of composite material, such as a mixture of Silicon and graphite. The models are setup in a hierarchical way, for clarity and modularity. Each model corresponds to a computational graph, which introduces a set of variables (the nodes) and functional relationship (the edges). This design enables the flexibility for changing and designing new models. The solver in BattMo uses automatic differentiation and support adjoint computation. We can therefore compute the derivative of objective functions with respect to all parameters efficiently. Gradient-based optimization routines can be used to calibrate parameters from experimental data.</description>

      <title>Origins of phase-field crack widening in dynamic fragmentation explained</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate dynamic crack propagation and fragmentation with the phase-field fracture approach. The method was chosen for its ability to yield crack paths that are independent of the underlying mesh, thanks to the damage regularization zone. In dynamics, we observe a progressive widening of this regularization zone and attribute it to an unphysical trapping of elastic waves. We show that the damage zones do not represent free boundaries accurately and that wave interactions induce additional damage. We reveal how mass erosion, by conserving the elastic wave speed in the damaged regions, can be used to efficiently reduce the spurious diffusion of damage. Furthermore, we provide numerical evidence that dynamically propagating cracks in the phase-field formulation, both with and without mass erosion, converge to the predictions of linear elastic fracture mechanics. For vanishing regularization length, the crack speed and energy release rate become independent of the phase-field regularization length, provided that this length scale is small enough and the mesh fine enough to resolve the process zone.</description>

      <title>Long-range electrostatics for machine learning interatomic potentials is easier than we thought</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The lack of long-range electrostatics is a key limitation of modern machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs), hindering reliable applications to interfaces, charge-transfer reactions, polar and ionic materials, and biomolecules. In this Perspective, we distill two design principles behind the Latent Ewald Summation (LES) framework, which can capture long-range interactions, charges, and electrical response just by learning from standard energy and force training data: (i) use a Coulomb functional form with environment-dependent charges to capture electrostatic interactions, and (ii) avoid explicit training on ambiguous density functional theory (DFT) partial charges. When both principles are satisfied, substantial flexibility remains: essentially any short-range MLIP can be augmented; charge equilibration schemes can be added when desired; dipoles and Born effective charges can be inferred or finetuned; and charge/spin-state embeddings or tensorial targets can be further incorporated. We also discuss current limitations and open challenges. Together, these minimal, physics-guided design rules suggest that incorporating long-range electrostatics into MLIPs is simpler and perhaps more broadly applicable than is commonly assumed.</description>

      <title>Renormalization-Group Geometry of Homeostatically Regulated Reentry Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reentrant computation-recursive self-coupling in which a network continuously reinjects and reinterprets its own internal state-plays a central role in biological cognition but remains poorly characterized in neural network architectures. We introduce a minimal continuous-time formulation of a homeostatically regulated reentrant network (FHRN) and show that its population dynamics admit an exact reduction to a one-dimensional radial flow. This reduction reveals a dynamically fixed threshold for sustained reflective activity and enables a complete renormalization-group (RG) analysis of the reentry-homeostasis interaction. We derive a closed RG system for the parameters governing structural gain, homeostatic stiffness, and reentrant amplification, and show that all trajectories are attracted to a critical surface defined by $\gamma\rho=1$, where intrinsic leak and reentrant drive exactly balance. The resulting phase structure comprises quenched, reactive, and reflective regimes and exhibits a mean-field critical onset with universal scaling. Our results provide an RG-theoretic characterization of reflective computation and demonstrate how homeostatic fields stabilize deep reentrant transformations through scale-dependent self-regulation.</description>

      <title>Self-Consistent Probability Flow for High-Dimensional Fokker-Planck Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving high-dimensional Fokker-Planck (FP) equations is a challenge in computational physics and stochastic dynamics, due to the curse of dimensionality (CoD) and the bottleneck of evaluating second-order diffusion terms. Existing deep learning approaches, such as Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), face computational challenges as dimensionality increases, driven by the $O(D^2)$ complexity of automatic differentiation for second-order derivatives. While recent probability flow approaches bypass this by learning score functions or matching velocity fields, they often involve serial computational operations or depend on sampling efficiency in complex distributions. To address these issues, we propose the Self-Consistent Probability Flow (SCPF) method. We reformulate the second-order FP equation into an equivalent first-order deterministic Probability Flow ODE (PF-ODE) constraint. Unlike score matching or velocity matching, SCPF solves this problem by minimizing the residual of the PF-ODE continuity equation, which avoids explicit Hessian computation. We leverage Continuous Normalizing Flows (CNF) combined with the Hutchinson Trace Estimator (HTE) to reduce the training complexity to linear scale $O(D)$, achieving an effective $O(1)$ wall-clock time on GPUs. To address data sparsity in high dimensions, we apply a generative adaptive sampling strategy and theoretically prove that dynamically aligning collocation points with the evolving probability mass is a necessary condition to bound the approximation error. Experiments on diverse benchmarks -- ranging from anisotropic Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) processes and high-dimensional Brownian motions with time-varying diffusion terms, to Geometric OU processes featuring non-Gaussian solutions -- demonstrate that SCPF effectively mitigates the CoD, maintaining high accuracy and constant computational cost for problems up to 100 dimensions.</description>

      <title>Optimal Uncertainty Quantification under General Moment Constraints on Input Subdomains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an optimal uncertainty quantification (OUQ) framework for systems whose uncertain inputs are characterized by truncated moment constraints defined over subdomains. Based on this partial information, rigorous optimal upper and lower bounds on the probability of failure (PoF) are derived over the admissible set of probability measures, providing a principled basis for system safety certification. We formulate the OUQ problem under general subdomain moment constraints and develop a high-performance computational framework to compute the optimal bounds. This approach transforms the original infinite-dimensional optimization problems into finite-dimensional unconstrained ones parameterized solely by free canonical moments. To address the prohibitive cost of PoF evaluation in high-dimensional settings, we incorporate inverse transform sampling (ITS), enabling efficient and accurate PoF estimation within the OUQ optimization. We also demonstrate that constraining inputs only by zeroth-order moments over subdomains yields a formulation equivalent to evidence theory. Three groups of numerical examples demonstrate the framework's effectiveness and scalability. Results show that increasing the number of subdomains or the moment order systematically tightens the bound interval. For high-dimensional problems, the ITS strategy reduces computational costs by up to two orders of magnitude while maintaining relative error below 1%. Furthermore, we identify regimes where optimal bounds are sensitive to subdomain partitioning or higher-order moments, guiding uncertainty reduction efforts for safety certification.</description>

      <title>Investigating Hamiltonian Dynamics by the Method of Covariant Lyapunov Vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this thesis, we review the theory of Lyapunov exponents and covariant Lyapunov vectors (CLVs) and use these objects to numerically investigate the dynamics of several autonomous Hamiltonian systems. The algorithm which we use for computing CLVs is the one developed by Ginelli and collaborators (G&amp;C), which is quite efficient and has been used previously in many numerical investigations. Using two low-dimensional Hamiltonian systems as toy models, we develop a method for measuring the convergence rates of vectors and subspaces computed via the G&amp;C algorithm, and we use the time it takes for this convergence to occur to determine the appropriate transient time lengths needed when applying this algorithm to compute CLVs. The tangent dynamics of the centre subspace of the H\'enon-Heiles system is investigated numerically through the use of CLVs, and we propose a method that improves the accuracy of the centre subspace computed with the G&amp;C algorithm. As another application of the method of CLVs to the H\'enon-Heiles system, we find that the splitting subspaces (which form a splitting of the tangent space and define the CLVs) become almost tangent during sticky regimes of motion, an observation which is related to the hyperbolicity of the system. Additionally, we investigate the dynamics of bubbles (i.e. thermal openings between base pairs) in homogeneous DNA sequences using the Peyrard-Bishop-Dauxois lattice model of DNA. For the purpose of studying short-lived bubbles in DNA, the notions of instantaneous Lyapunov vectors (ILVs) are introduced in the context of Hamiltonian dynamics. While we find that the size of the opening between base pairs has no clear relationship with the spatial distribution of the first CLV at that site, we do observe a distinct relationship with various ILV distributions.</description>

      <title>Achieving angular-momentum conservation with physics-informed neural networks in computational relativistic spin hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) as a numerical solver for relativistic spin hydrodynamics and demonstrate that the total angular momentum, i.e., the sum of orbital and spin angular momentum, is accurately conserved throughout the fluid evolution by imposing the conservation law directly in the loss function as a training target. This enables controlled numerical studies of the mutual conversion between spin and orbital angular momentum, a central feature of relativistic spin hydrodynamics driven by the rotational viscous effect. We present two physical scenarios with a rotating fluid confined in a cylindrical container: one case in which initial orbital angular momentum is converted into spin angular momentum in analogy with the Barnett effect, and the opposite case in which initial spin angular momentum is converted into orbital angular momentum in analogy with the Einstein-de Haas effect. We investigate these conversion processes governed by the rotational viscous effect by analyzing the spacetime profiles of thermal vorticity and spin potential. Our PINNs-based framework provides the first numerical evidence for spin-orbit angular momentum conversion with fully nonlinear computational relativistic spin hydrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Estimating Solvation Free Energies with Boltzmann Generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate calculations of solvation free energies remain a central challenge in molecular simulations, often requiring extensive sampling and numerous alchemical intermediates to ensure sufficient overlap between phase-space distributions of a solute in the gas phase and in solution. Here, we introduce a computational framework based on normalizing flows that directly maps solvent configurations between solutes of different sizes, and compare the accuracy and efficiency to conventional free energy estimates. For a Lennard-Jones solvent, we demonstrate that this approach yields acceptable accuracy in estimating free energy differences for challenging transformations, such as solute growth or increased solute-solute separation, which typically demand multiple intermediate simulation steps along the transformation. Analysis of radial distribution functions indicates that the flow generates physically meaningful solvent rearrangements, substantially enhancing configurational overlap between states in configuration space. These results suggest flow-based models as a promising alternative to traditional free energy estimation methods.</description>

      <title>Symmetry breaking transforms strong to normal correlation and false metals to true insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Material scientists and condensed matter physicists have long been divided on the issue of choosing the conceptual framework for explaining why open-shell transition-metal oxides tend to be insulators, whereas otherwise successful theories such as DFT often predict them to be (false) metals. Strong correlation becomes the recommended medicine. We point out that strong correlation can be mitigated by allowing DFT to lower the energy by breaking structural, magnetic or dipolar symmetries. Such local motifs are observed experimentally by local probes beyond the 'average structure' determined by X-Ray diffraction. Observed broken symmetries can arise from slow fluctuations that persist over the observation time or longer. The surprising fact is that when symmetry breaking motifs are used as input to electronic structure calculations, false metals are converted into real insulators without the recommended medicine of strong correlation. Consistently, DFT calculations that show energy lowering symmetry breaking correct most cases where DFT, even with advanced exchange-correlation functionals, previously missed the correct metal vs insulator designation. Total energy calculations distinguish systems that support energy-lowering symmetry breaking from those that do not. This approach distinguishes between paramagnetic insulating and metallic phases and shows mass enhancement in Mott metals. The reason is that symmetry breaking removes many of the degeneracies that exist in a symmetry-unbroken system, reducing significantly the need for strong correlation. If one chooses to ignore symmetry breaking, the persistent degeneracies often call for strong correlation treatment. Thus, symmetry breaking transforms strong to normal correlation and false metals to true insulators. This view sheds light on the historic controversy between Mott and Slater that still reverberates today.</description>

      <title>Super-Poissonian Squeezed Light in the Ground State of Strongly Coupled Light-matter Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strong light-matter coupling enables hybrid states in which photonic and electronic degrees of freedom become correlated even in the ground state. While many-body effects in long-range dispersion interactions are known to reshape electronic properties under such conditions, their impact on quantum-optical observables remains largely unexplored. Here, we address this problem using quantum electrodynamical density-functional theory (QEDFT) combined with the recently developed photon-many-body dispersion (pMBD) functional, which can capture higher-order electron-photon correlations and multi-photon processes. We compute ground-state photonic observables including photon number fluctuations, second-order correlations, and quadrature variances, and find squeezing and super-Poissonian photon statistics emerging from light-matter interactions in the strong coupling regime. Our results demonstrate that capturing the full hierarchy of many-body, electron-photon and multi-photon correlations is essential for a consistent description of quantum-optical properties in strongly coupled molecular systems, establishing QEDFT as a first-principles framework for predicting nonclassical photonic features in the ground state of complex systems.</description>

Abstract: Crystal structure prediction is a fundamental problem in materials science. We present CrystalFormer-CSP, an efficient framework that unifies data-driven heuristic and physics-driven optimization approaches to predict stable crystal structures for given chemical compositions. The approach combines pretrained generative models for space-group-informed structure generation and a universal machine learning force field for energy minimization. Reinforcement fine-tuning can be employed to further boost the accuracy of the framework. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CrystalFormer-CSP on benchmark problems and showcase its usage via web interface and language model integration.</description>

      <title>Multi-Functional Properties of Manganese Pnictides: A First-Principles Study on Magneto-Optics and Magnetocaloric Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic refrigeration presents an energy-efficient and environmentally benign alternative to traditional vapour-compression cooling technologies. It relies on the magnetocaloric effect, in which the temperature of a magnetic material changes in response to variations in an applied magnetic field. Optimal magnetocaloric materials are characterized by a significant change in magnetic entropy under moderate magnetic field. In this study, we systematically investigated the inter-atomic exchange interactions, magnetic anisotropy energy and magnetocaloric properties of MnX (X = N, P, As, Sb, Bi) using a combination of density functional theory and Monte-Carlo simulations. Additionally, the magneto-optical Kerr and Faraday spectra were computed using the all-electron, fully relativistic, full-potential linearized muffin-tin orbital method. The largest Kerr effect observed in MnBi can be inferred as a combined effect of maximal exchange splitting of Mn 3d states and the large spin-orbit coupling of Bi. To extract site-projected spin and orbital moments, spin-orbit coupling and orbital polarization correction are accounted in the present calculation, which shows good agreement between the moment obtained from the X-ray magnetic circular dichroism sum rule analysis, spin-polarized calculation, and experimental studies. The magnetic transition temperatures predicted through Monte-Carlo simulations were in good agreement with the corresponding experimental values. Our results provide a unified microscopic understanding of magnetocaloric performance and magneto-optical activity in Mn-based pnictides and establish a reliable computational framework for designing next-generation magnetic refrigeration materials.</description>

Abstract: Flow equation methods, more generally known as Similarity Renormalization Group (SRG) techniques, were developed to address multiscale problems where multiple length or energy scales contribute simultaneously. In this Thesis, we formulate the flow equation method within a wavelet-based framework and apply it to study scale (resolution) separation in a two-dimensional scalar field theory. We demonstrate that the flow systematically block-diagonalizes the Hamiltonian with respect to wavelet resolution, achieving improved truncation compared to earlier studies. Using a model of two real scalar fields coupled through a quadratic interaction, we show that the flow equations effectively suppress couplings between low- and high-resolution degrees of freedom. This provides a clear mechanism for isolating low-resolution physics and offers insight into the construction of effective Hamiltonians using a wavelet-based flow equation approac</description>

      <title>Size-Consistent Quantum Chemistry on Quantum Computers</title>

Abstract: Hybrid quantum-classical algorithms have begun to leverage quantum devices to efficiently represent many-electron wavefunctions, enabling early demonstrations of molecular simulations on real hardware. A key prerequisite for scalable quantum chemistry, however, is size consistency: the energy of non-interacting subsystems must scale linearly with system size. While many algorithms are theoretically size-consistent, noise on quantum devices may couple nominally independent subsystems and degrade this fundamental property. Here, we systematically evaluate size consistency on quantum hardware by simulating systems composed of increasing numbers of non-interacting H$_{2}$ molecules using optimally shallow unitary circuits. We find that molecular energies remain size-consistent within chemical accuracy for an estimated 118 and 71 H$_{2}$ subsystems for one- and two-qubit unitary designs, respectively, demonstrating that current quantum devices preserve size consistency over chemically relevant system sizes and supporting the feasibility of scalable, noise-resilient simulation of strongly correlated molecules and materials.</description>

      <title>Momentum-resolved spectral functions of super-moir\'e systems using tensor networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computing spectral functions in large, non-periodic super-moir\'e systems remains an open problem due to the exceptionally large system size that must be considered. Here, we establish a tensor network methodology that allows computing momentum-resolved spectral functions of non-interacting and interacting super-moir\'e systems at an atomistic level. Our methodology relies on encoding an exponentially large tight-binding problem as an auxiliary quantum many-body problem, solved with a many-body kernel polynomial tensor network algorithm combined with a quantum Fourier transform tensor network. We demonstrate the method for one and two-dimensional super-moir\'e systems, including super-moir\'e with non-uniform strain, interactions treated at the mean-field level, and quasicrystalline super-moir\'e patterns. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our methodology allows us to compute momentum-resolved spectral functions restricted to selected regions of a super-moir\'e, enabling direct imaging of position-dependent electronic structure and minigaps in super-moir\'e systems with non-uniform strain. Our results establish a powerful methodology to compute momentum-resolved spectral functions in exceptionally large super-moir\'e systems, providing a tool to directly model scanning twisting microscope tunneling experiments in twisted van der Waals heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Is the active suspension in a complex viscoelastic fluid more chaotic or more ordered?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The habitat of microorganisms is typically complex and viscoelastic. A natural question arises: Do polymers in a suspension of active swimmers enhance chaotic motion or promote orientational order? We address this issue by performing lattice Boltzmann simulations of squirmer suspensions in polymer solutions. At intermediate swimmer volume fractions, comparing to the Newtonian counterpart, polymers enhance polarization by up to a factor of 26 for neutral squirmers and 5 for pullers, thereby notably increasing orientational order. This effect arises from hydrodynamic feedback mechanism: squirmers stretch and align polymers, which in turn reinforce swimmer orientation and enhance polarization via hydrodynamic and steric interactions. The mechanism is validated by a positive correlation between polarization and a defined polymer-swimmer alignment parameter. Our findings establish a framework for understanding collective motion in complex fluids and suggest strategies for controlling active systems via polymer-mediated interactions.</description>

      <title>Source quantification by mobile gamma-ray spectrometry systems: A Bayesian approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately quantifying gamma-ray sources from mobile gamma-ray spectrometry surveys has remained a fundamentally elusive, long-standing inverse problem at the interface of nuclear and computational physics. Here, we present a full-spectrum Bayesian inference framework that resolves this inverse problem by combining high-fidelity, platform-dynamic Monte Carlo template generation with Bayesian inversion. Applying this methodology to airborne measurements benchmarked against laboratory and in-situ ground truths, we demonstrate accurate and robust quantification of both natural and anthropogenic radionuclides under field conditions. By improving activity estimates by an order of magnitude, providing principled uncertainty quantification, and rigorously accounting for overdispersion, this framework opens the way to a more statistically rigorous and physics-informed era of mobile gamma-ray spectrometry, unlocking enhanced inference capabilities in emergency response, environmental monitoring, nuclear security, and planetary exploration.</description>

      <title>El Agente Cu\'antico: Automating quantum simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulation is central to understanding and designing quantum systems across physics and chemistry. Yet it has barriers to access from both computational complexity and computational perspectives, due to the exponential growth of Hilbert space and the complexity of modern software tools. Here we introduce{\cinzel El Agente Cu\'antico}, a multi-agent AI system that automates quantum-simulation workflows by translating natural-language scientific intent into executed and validated computations across heterogeneous quantum-software frameworks. By reasoning directly over library documentation and APIs, our agentic system dynamically assembles end-to-end simulations spanning state preparation, closed- and open-system dynamics, tensor-network methods, quantum control, quantum error correction, and quantum resource estimation. The developed system unifies traditionally distinct simulation paradigms behind a single natural-language interface. Beyond reducing technical barriers, this approach opens a path toward scalable, adaptive, and increasingly autonomous quantum simulation, enabling faster exploration of physical models, rapid hypothesis testing, and closer integration between theory, simulation, and emerging quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>A Fixed-Volume Variant of Gibbs-Ensemble Monte Carlo Yields Significant Speedup in Binodal Calculation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gibbs-ensemble Monte Carlo (GEMC) is a powerful method for calculating the gas-liquid binodals of simple models and small molecules, but is too demanding computationally for realistic models of proteins. Here we discover that the main reason for long simulations is that volume exchange is very slow to achieve, and develop a variant GEMC without volume exchange. The key is to determine an appropriate initial density. Test of this fixed-volume GEMC method on Lennard-Jones and patchy particles shows enormous speedup without any loss of accuracy in predicted binodals. The fast speed of fixed-volume GEMC promises many applications.</description>

      <title>A Cartesian Cut-Cell Two-Fluid Method for Two-Phase Diffusion Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a Cartesian cut-cell finite-volume method for sharp-interface two-phase diffusion problems in static geometries. The formulation follows a two-fluid approach: independent diffusion equations are discretized in each phase on a fixed staggered Cartesian grid, while the phases are coupled through embedded interface conditions enforcing continuity of normal flux and a general jump law. Cut cells are treated by integrating the governing equations over phase-restricted control volumes and faces, yielding discrete divergence and gradient operators that are locally conservative within each phase. Interface coupling is achieved by introducing a small set of interfacial unknowns per cut cell on the embedded boundary; the resulting algebraic system involves only bulk and interfacial averages. A key feature of the method is the use of a reduced set of geometric information based solely on low-order moments (trimmed volumes, apertures and interface measures/centroids), allowing robust implementation without constructing explicitly cut-cell polytopes. The method supports steady (Poisson) and unsteady (diffusion) regimes and incorporates Dirichlet, Neumann, Robin boundary conditions and general jumps. We validate the scheme on one-, two- and three-dimensional mono- and diphasic benchmarks, including curved embedded boundaries, Robin conditions and strong property/jump contrasts. The results demonstrate the expected convergence behavior, sharp enforcement of interfacial laws and excellent conservation properties. Extensions to moving interfaces and Stefan-type free-boundary problems are natural perspectives of this framework.</description>

      <title>Gap-free Information Transfer in 4D-STEM via Fusion of Complementary Scattering Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Linear phase-contrast scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) techniques compatible with high-throughput 4D-STEM acquisition are widely used to enhance phase contrast in weakly scattering and beam-sensitive materials. In these modalities, contrast transfer is often suppressed at low spatial frequencies, resulting in a characteristic contrast gap that limits quantitative imaging. Approaches that retain low-frequency phase contrast exist but typically require substantially increased experimental complexity, restricting routine use. Dark-field STEM imaging captures this missing low-frequency information through electrons scattered outside the bright-field disk, but discards a large fraction of the scattered signal and is therefore dose-inefficient. Fused Full-field STEM (FF-STEM) is introduced as a 4D-STEM imaging modality that overcomes this limitation by combining ptychographic phase reconstruction with tilt-corrected dark-field imaging within a single acquisition. Bright-field data are used to estimate probe aberrations and reconstruct a high-resolution phase image, while dark-field data provide complementary low-frequency contrast. The two channels are optimally fused in Fourier space using minimum-variance weighting based on the spectral signal-to-noise ratio, yielding transfer-gap-free images with high contrast and quantitative fidelity. FF-STEM preserves the upsampling and depth-sectioning capabilities of ptychography, adds robust low-frequency contrast characteristic of dark-field imaging, and enables dose-efficient, near-real-time reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Energy dissipation mechanisms in an acoustically-driven slit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We quantify how incident acoustic energy is converted into vortical motion and viscous dissipation for a two-dimensional plane-wave passing through a slit geometry. We perform direct numerical simulations over a broad parameter space in incident sound pressure level (ISPL), Strouhal number (St), and Reynolds number (Re). Spectral proper orthogonal decomposition (SPOD) yields energy-ranked coherent structures at each frequency, from which we construct mode-by-mode fields for spectral kinetic energy (KE) and viscous loss (VL) components to examine the mechanisms of acoustic absorption. At ISPL=150dB, the acoustic-hydrodynamic energy conversion is highest when the acoustic displacement amplitude is comparable to the slit thickness, corresponding to a Keulegan-Carpenter number of order unity. In this regime, the oscillatory boundary layer undergoes periodic separation, resulting in vortex shedding that dominates acoustic damping. VL accounts for 20-60% of the KE contribution. For higher acoustic frequencies, the confinement of the Stokes layer produces X-shaped near-slit modes, reducing the total energy input by approximately 50%. The influence of Re depends on amplitude. At ISPL=150dB, larger Re values correspond to suppressed broadband fluctuations and sharpened harmonic peaks. At ISPL = 120dB, the boundary layers remain attached, vortex shedding is weak, absorption monotonically scales with viscosity, and the Re- and St-dependencies become comparable. Across all conditions, more than 99% of the VL is confined to a compact region surrounding the slit mouth. The KE-VL spectra describe parameter regimes that enhance or suppress acoustic damping in slit geometries, providing a physically interpretable basis for acoustic-based design.</description>

Abstract: This study aims to evaluate the optoelectronic properties of metal free porphyrin-based D-$\pi$-A dyes via in-silico performance investigation notifying energy informatics and decision support. To develop novel organic dyes, three acceptor/anchoring groups and five donating groups were introduced to strategic positions of the base porphyrin structure, resulting in a total of fifteen dyes. The singlet ground state geometries of the dyes were optimized utilizing density functional theory (DFT) with B3LYP and the excited state optical properties were explored through time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) using the PCM model with tetrahydrofuran (THF) as solvent. Both DFT and TD-DFT calculations were carried out using the 6-311G(d,p) basis set. The HOMO energy levels of almost all the modified dyes are lower than the redox potential of I$^-$/I$3^-$ and LUMO energy levels are higher than the conduction band of TiO$2$. The absorption maxima values ranged from 690.64 to 975.55 nm. The dye N1 using triphenylamine group as donor and p-ethynylbenzoic acid group as acceptor, showed optimum optoelectronic properties ($\Delta G{reg}=-9.73$ eV, $\Delta G{inj}=7.18$ eV, $V_{OC}=1.47$ V and $J_{SC}=15.03$ mA/cm$^2$) with highest PCE 14.37%, making it the best studied dye. This newly modified organic dye with enhanced PCE is remarkably effective for the dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC) industry. Beyond materials discovery, this study highlights the role of high-performance computing in enabling predictive screening of dye candidates and generating performance indicators (HOMO-LUMO gaps, absorption spectra, charge transfer free energies, photovoltaic metrics). These outputs can serve as key parameters for energy informatics and system modelling.</description>

      <title>Influence of Magnetic Order on Proximity-Induced Superconductivity in Mn Layers on Nb(110) from First Principles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of magnetic order on the proximity-induced superconducting state in the Mn layers of a Mn-Nb(110) heterostructure by using a first-principles method. For this study, we use the recently developed Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) solver for superconducting heterostructures [Csire et al., Phys. Rev. B 97, 024514 (2018)] within the first-principles calculations based on multiple scattering theory and the screened Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker (SKKR) Green's function method. In our calculations, we first study the normal-state density of states (DOS) in the single- and double-Mn-layer heterostructures, and calculate the induced magnetic moments in the Nb layers. Next, we compute the momentum-resolved spectral functions in the superconducting state for the heterostructure with a single Mn layer, and find bands crossing the Fermi level within the superconducting (SC) gap. We also study the SC state DOS in the single- and double-Mn-layer heterostructures and compare some of our results with experimental findings, revealing secondary gaps, plateau-like regions, and central V-shaped in-gap states within the bulk SC Nb gap that are magnetic-order-dependent. Finally, we compute the singlet and internally antisymmetric triplet (IAT) order parameters for each layer for both heterostructures, and find an order of magnitude difference in the induced singlet part of the SC order parameter in the Mn layer/s between the FM and AFM cases in favor of the AFM pairing with the maximum still being only 4.44% of the bulk Nb singlet order parameter value. We also find a negligible induced triplet part, yet comparable to the induced singlet values, indicating some singlet-triplet mixing in the Mn layer/s.</description>

      <title>Partition Function Estimation Using Analog Quantum Processors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We evaluate using programmable superconducting flux qubit D-Wave quantum annealers to approximate the partition function of Ising models. We propose the use of two distinct quantum annealer sampling methods: chains of Monte Carlo-like reverse quantum anneals, and standard linear-ramp quantum annealing. The control parameters used to attenuate the quality of the simulations are the effective analog energy scale of the J coupling, the total annealing time, and for the case of reverse annealing the anneal-pause. The core estimation technique is to sample across the energy spectrum of the classical Hamiltonian of interest, and therefore obtain a density of states estimate for each energy level, which in turn can be used to compute an estimate of the partition function with some sampling error. This estimation technique is powerful because once the distribution is sampled it allows thermodynamic quantity computation at arbitrary temperatures. On a $25$ spin $\pm J$ hardware graph native Ising model we find parameter regimes of the D-Wave processors that provide comparable result quality to two standard classical Monte Carlo methods, Multiple Histogram Reweighting and Wang-Landau. Remarkably, we find that fast quench-like anneals can quickly generate ensemble distributions that are very good estimates of the true partition function of the classical Ising model; on a Pegasus graph-structured QPU we report a logarithmic relative error of $7.6 \times 10^{-6}$, from $171,000$ samples generated using $0.2$ seconds of QPU time with an anneal time of $8$ nanoseconds per sample which is interestingly within the closed system dynamics timescale of the superconducting qubits.</description>

      <title>2D coherent spectroscopy signatures of exciton condensation in Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the nonlinear optical response probed by two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy (2DCS) can discriminate between excitonic and lattice driven order. In the excitonic regime of a realistic model of Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$, the third order 2DCS signals are strongly enhanced by the condensate's amplitude and phase modes, with negligible contributions from single-particle excitations. In the linear optical response, in contrast, single-particle and collective-mode contributions overlap. With increasing electron-phonon coupling, the amplitude mode contribution to 2DCS initially remains robust, but then drops rapidly and remains small in the phonon-dominated regime -- even in systems with large order parameter. 2DCS also aids the detection of the massive relative phase mode, which is analogous to the Leggett mode in superconductors. Our analysis, based on the time-dependent Hartree-Fock approach, demonstrates that 2DCS can track the emergence of the symmetry-broken state and the crossover from Coulomb-driven to phonon-driven order.</description>

      <title>Monitoring of water volume in a porous reservoir using seismic data: Validation of a numerical model with a field experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14605v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As global groundwater levels continue to decline rapidly, there is a growing need for advanced techniques to monitor and manage aquifers effectively. This study focuses on validating a numerical model using seismic data from a small-scale experimental setup designed to estimate water volume in a porous reservoir. Expanding on previous work with synthetic data, we analyze seismic data acquired from a controlled experimental site in Laukaa, Finland. By employing neural networks, we directly estimate water volume from seismic responses, bypassing the traditional need for separate determinations, for example, of reservoir water-table level and porosity. The study models wave propagation through a coupled poroviscoelastic-viscoelastic medium using a three-dimensional discontinuous Galerkin method. The proposed methodology is validated against experimental data, aiming to improve precision in mapping current water volumes and contributing to the development of sustainable groundwater management practices.</description>

      <title>Power Laws for the Thermal Slip Length of a Liquid/Solid Interface From the Structure and Frequency Response of the Contact Zone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05443v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The newest and most powerful electronic chips for applications like artificial intelligence generate so much heat that liquid based cooling has become indispensable to prevent breakdown from thermal runaway effects. While cooling schemes like microfluidic networks or liquid immersion are proving effective for now, further progress requires tackling an age old problem, namely the intrinsic thermal impedance of the liquid/solid (L/S) interface, quantified either by the thermal boundary resistance or thermal slip length. While there exist well known models for estimating bounds on the thermal impedance of a superfluid/metal interface, no analytic models nor experimental data are available for normal liquid/solid interfaces. Researchers therefore rely on non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations to gain insight into phonon transfer at the L/S interface. Here we explore correlated order and motion within the L/S contact zone in an effort to extract general scaling relations for the thermal slip length in Lennard-Jones (LJ) systems. We focus on the in-plane structure factor and dominant vibrational frequency of the first solid and liquid layer for 180 systems. When scaled by the temperature of the liquid contact layer and characteristic LJ interaction distance, the data collapse onto two power law equations, one quantifying the reduction in thermal impedance from enhanced in-plane translational order and the other from enhanced frequency matching in the contact zone. More generally, these power law relations highlight the critical role of surface acoustic phonons, an area of focus which may prove more useful to development of analytic models and instrumentation for validating the relations proposed.</description>

      <title>FFTArray: A Python Library for the Implementation of Discretized Multi-Dimensional Fourier Transforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03697v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Partial differential equations describing the dynamics of physical systems rarely have closed-form solutions. Fourier spectral methods, which use Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs) to approximate solutions, are a common approach to solving these equations. However, mapping Fourier integrals to discrete FFTs is not straightforward, as the selection of the grid as well as the coordinate-dependent phase and scaling factors require special care. Moreover, most software packages that deal with this step integrate it tightly into their full-stack implementations. Such an integrated design sacrifices generality, making it difficult to adapt to new coordinate systems, boundary conditions, or problem-specific requirements. To address these challenges, we present FFTArray, a Python library that automates the general discretization of Fourier transforms. Its purpose is to reduce the barriers to developing high-performance, maintainable code for pseudo-spectral Fourier methods. Its interface enables the direct translation of textbook equations and complex research problems into code, and its modular design scales naturally to multiple dimensions. This makes the definition of valid coordinate grids straightforward, while coordinate grid specific corrections are applied with minimal impact on computational performance. Built on the Python Array API Standard, FFTArray integrates seamlessly with array backends like NumPy, JAX and PyTorch and supports Graphics Processing Unit acceleration. The code is openly available at https://github.com/QSTheory/fftarray under Apache-2.0 license.</description>

      <title>Density estimation via mixture discrepancy and moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01570v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the aim of generalizing histogram statistics to higher dimensional cases, density estimation via discrepancy based sequential partition (DSP) has been proposed to learn an adaptive piecewise constant approximation defined on a binary sequential partition of the underlying domain, where the star discrepancy is adopted to measure the uniformity of particle distribution. However, the calculation of the star discrepancy is NP-hard and it does not satisfy the reflection invariance and rotation invariance either. To this end, we use the mixture discrepancy and the comparison of moments as a replacement of the star discrepancy, leading to the density estimation via mixture discrepancy based sequential partition (DSP-mix) and density estimation via moment-based sequential partition (MSP), respectively. Both DSP-mix and MSP are computationally tractable and exhibit the reflection and rotation invariance. Numerical experiments in reconstructing Beta mixtures, Gaussian mixtures and heavy-tailed Cauchy mixtures up to 30 dimension are conducted, demonstrating that MSP can maintain the same accuracy compared with DSP, while gaining an increase in speed by a factor of two to twenty for large sample size, and DSP-mix can achieve satisfactory accuracy and boost the efficiency in low-dimensional tests ($d \le 6$), but might lose accuracy in high-dimensional problems due to a reduction in partition level.</description>

      <title>Chimera states on m-directed hypergraphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12511v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chimera states are synchronization patterns in which coherent and incoherent regions coexist in systems of identical oscillators. This elusive phenomenon has attracted significant interest and has been widely analyzed, revealing several types of dynamical states. Most studies involve reciprocal pairwise couplings, where each oscillator exerts and receives the same interaction from neighboring ones, thus being modeled via symmetric networks. However, real-world systems often exhibit non-reciprocal, non-pairwise (many-body) interactions. Previous studies have shown that chimera states are more elusive in the presence of non-reciprocal pairwise interactions, while they are easier to observe when the interactions are reciprocal and higher-order (many-body). In this work, we investigate the emergence of chimera states on non-reciprocal higher-order structures, called mdirected hypergraphs, which we compare with their corresponding networks, and we observe that chimera state and specifically amplitude-mediated chimeras can emerge due to directionality, which had not been previously observed in the absence of directionality. We also compare the effect of non-reciprocal interactions between higher-order and pairwise couplings, and we find numerically that chimera states appear over a broader parameter range when considering higher-order interactions than in the corresponding network case, demonstrating the impact of directionality and the effect of higher-order interactions. Finally, the nature of phase chimeras has been further validated through phase reduction theory.</description>

      <title>Fully Quantum Lattice Gas Automata Building Blocks for Computational Basis State Encodings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12662v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lattice Gas Automata (LGA) is a classical method for simulating physical phenomena, including Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Quantum LGA (QLGA) is the family of methods that implement LGA schemes on quantum computers. In recent years, QLGA has garnered attention from researchers thanks to its potential of efficiently modeling CFD processes by either reducing memory requirements or providing simultaneous representations of exponentially many LGA states. In this work, we introduce novel building blocks for QLGA algorithms that rely on computational basis state encodings. We address every step of the algorithm, from initial conditions to measurement, and provide detailed complexity analyses that account for all discretization choices of the system under simulation. We introduce multiple ways of instantiating initial conditions, efficient boundary condition implementations for novel geometrical patterns, a novel collision operator that models less restricted interactions than previous implementations, and quantum circuits that extract quantities of interest out of the quantum state. For each building block, we provide intuitive examples and open-source implementations of the underlying quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>Full-spectrum modeling of mobile gamma-ray spectrometry systems in scattering media</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17820v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mobile gamma-ray spectrometry (MGRS) systems are essential for localizing, identifying, and quantifying gamma-ray sources in complex environments. Full-spectrum template matching offers the highest accuracy and sensitivity for these tasks but is limited by the computational cost of generating the required spectral templates. Here, we present a generalized full-spectrum modeling framework for MGRS systems in scattering media, enabling near-real-time template generation through dynamic, anisotropic instrument response functions. Benchmarked against high-fidelity brute-force Monte Carlo simulations, our method yields a computational speedup by a factor of $\mathcal{O}(10^7)$, while achieving comparable accuracy with median spectral deviations below 6%. The methodology presented is platform-agnostic and applicable across marine, terrestrial, and airborne domains, unlocking new capabilities for MGRS in a variety of applications, such as environmental monitoring, geophysical exploration, nuclear safeguards, and radiological emergency response.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17827v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a finite-element software library, IRENE, which allows to solve numerically the dynamics of a viscous fluid layer embedded in three-dimensional space. Unlike finite-element libraries present in the literature, IRENE can handle two-dimensional open surfaces with a wide range of boundary conditions, and inter-surface obstacles with any shapes, and is built upon the user-friendly and versatile finite element computational software (FEniCS). Also, the library can describe a wide range of physical regimes--both low-Reynolds-number and inertia-dominated ones--capturing the complex coupling between in-plane flows, out-of-plane deformations, surface tension, and elastic response. We validate IRENE against known analytical and numerical results, and demonstrate its capabilities through physical examples. Overall, IRENE provides a versatile and efficient tool for understanding fluid-layer dynamics on multiple physical scales, from flows of lipidic membranes on a microscopic level, to fluid flows on a macroscopic scale, to atmospheric air flows on a planetary level.</description>

      <title>Deep Variational Free Energy Calculation of Hydrogen Hugoniot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18540v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a deep variational free energy framework to compute the equation of state of hydrogen in the warm dense matter region. This method parameterizes the variational density matrix of hydrogen nuclei and electrons at finite temperature using three deep generative models: a normalizing flow model for the Boltzmann distribution of the classical nuclei, an autoregressive transformer for the distribution of electrons in excited states, and a permutational equivariant flow model for the unitary backflow transformation of electron coordinates in Hartree-Fock states. By jointly optimizing the three neural networks to minimize the variational free energy, we obtain the equation of state and related thermodynamic properties of dense hydrogen for the temperature range where electrons occupy excited states. We compare our results with other theoretical and experimental results on the deuterium Hugoniot curve, aiming to resolve existing discrepancies. Our results bridge the gap between the results obtained by path-integral Monte Carlo calculations at high temperature and ground-state electronic methods at low temperature, thus providing a valuable benchmark for hydrogen in the warm dense matter region.</description>

      <title>Data-driven particle dynamics: Structure-preserving coarse-graining for emergent behavior in non-equilibrium systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12569v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multiscale systems are ubiquitous in science and technology, but are notoriously challenging to simulate as short spatiotemporal scales must be appropriately linked to emergent bulk physics. When expensive high-dimensional dynamical systems are coarse-grained into low-dimensional models, the entropic loss of information leads to emergent physics which are dissipative, history-dependent, and stochastic. To machine learn coarse-grained dynamics from time-series observations of particle trajectories, we propose a framework using the metriplectic bracket formalism that preserves these properties by construction; most notably, the framework guarantees discrete notions of the first and second laws of thermodynamics, conservation of momentum, and a discrete fluctuation-dissipation balance crucial for capturing non-equilibrium statistics. We introduce the mathematical framework abstractly before specializing to a particle discretization. As labels are generally unavailable for entropic state variables, we introduce a novel self-supervised learning strategy to identify emergent structural variables. We validate the method on benchmark systems and demonstrate its utility on two challenging examples: (1) coarse-graining star polymers at challenging levels of coarse-graining while preserving non-equilibrium statistics, and (2) learning models from high-speed video of colloidal suspensions that capture coupling between local rearrangement events and emergent stochastic dynamics. We provide open-source implementations in both PyTorch and LAMMPS, enabling large-scale inference and extensibility to diverse particle-based systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17170v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a data-informed quantum-classical dynamics (DIQCD) approach for predicting the evolution of an open quantum system. The equation of motion in DIQCD is a Lindblad equation with a flexible, time-dependent Hamiltonian that can be optimized to fit sparse and noisy data from local observations of an extensive open quantum system. We demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of DIQCD for both experimental and simulated quantum devices. We show that DIQCD can predict entanglement dynamics of ultracold molecules (Calcium Fluoride) in optical tweezer arrays. DIQCD also successfully predicts carrier mobility in organic semiconductors (Rubrene) with accuracy comparable to nearly exact numerical methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22332v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An array of initially excited emitters coupled to a one-dimensional waveguide exhibits superradiant decay under the Born-Markov approximation, manifested as a coherent burst of photons in the output field. In this work, we employ tensor-network methods to investigate its non-Markovian dynamics induced by finite time delays in photon exchange among the emitters. We find that the superradiant burst breaks into a structured train of correlated photons, each intensity peak corresponding to a specific photon number. We quantify the emitter-photon and emitter-emitter entanglement generated during this process and show that the latter emerges in the long-time limit, as part of the excitation becomes trapped within the emitters' singlet subspace. We finally consider the decay of the system's most radiant state, the symmetric Dicke state, and show that time delay can lead to decay rates exceeding those predicted by the Markovian approximation.</description>

      <title>Py-DiSMech: A Scalable and Efficient Framework for Discrete Differential Geometry-Based Modeling and Control of Soft Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09911v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-fidelity simulation has become essential to the design and control of soft robots, where large geometric deformations and complex contact interactions challenge conventional modeling tools. Recent advances in the field demand simulation frameworks that combine physical accuracy, computational scalability, and seamless integration with modern control and optimization pipelines. In this work, we present Py-DiSMech, a Python-based, open-source simulation framework for modeling and control of soft robotic structures grounded in the principles of Discrete Differential Geometry (DDG). By discretizing geometric quantities such as curvature and strain directly on meshes, Py-DiSMech captures the nonlinear deformation of rods, shells, and hybrid structures with high fidelity and reduced computational cost. The framework introduces (i) a fully vectorized NumPy implementation achieving order-of-magnitude speed-ups over existing geometry-based simulators; (ii) a penalty-energy-based fully implicit contact model that supports rod-rod, rod-shell, and shell-shell interactions; (iii) a natural-strain-based feedback-control module featuring a proportional-integral (PI) controller for shape regulation and trajectory tracking; and (iv) a modular, object-oriented software design enabling user-defined elastic energies, actuation schemes, and integration with machine-learning libraries. Benchmark comparisons demonstrate that Py-DiSMech substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art simulator Elastica in computational efficiency while maintaining physical accuracy. Together, these features establish Py-DiSMech as a scalable, extensible platform for simulation-driven design, control validation, and sim-to-real research in soft robotics.</description>

Abstract: Coherent Rayleigh-Brillouin scattering (CRBS) holds great promise for the characterization of gas properties and the investigation of gas kinetic processes. The CRBS spectrum exhibits a strong dependence on the Knudsen number (Kn), revealing its inherently multiscale nature. In the unified gas-kinetic scheme (UGKS), collisions are intrinsically coupled with free transport during flux construction, endowing the method with distinct multiscale capabilities. Specifically, the UGKS reduces to a Boltzmann solver when the relaxation time is greater than or equal to the time step, and to the gas-kinetic scheme (GKS)-a Navier-Stokes solver-when the relaxation time is much smaller than the time step, thereby accommodating flow regimes without constraints on the molecular mean free path or collision time. In this study, the UGKS is extended to simulate CRBS phenomena, with the governing equation formulated based on the BGK-Shakhov model. Detailed derivations are provided. To account for the additional perturbation source term, a second-order accurate numerical algorithm is developed using the Strang splitting method within the UGKS framework. The proposed model is validated against argon CRBS experiments, demonstrating excellent agreement. Building on this validated framework, the impact of incident signal intensity on CRBS spectra across a range of Knudsen numbers is systematically examined, accompanied by an in-depth analysis of the underlying physical mechanisms. This work broadens the applicability of CFD-based CRBS simulations and provides a reliable numerical foundation for exploring high-intensity, multiscale gas-kinetic phenomena in future research.</description>

Abstract: Light interacting with plant leaves undergoes reflection, transmission, scattering, and absorption, which together determine leaf optical properties. Changes in leaf architecture disrupt internal light scattering dynamics and consequently affect photosynthetic performance. Previous studies on internal leaf light scattering have primarily relied on ray-tracing approaches (e.g., Raytran) or radiative-transfer models (e.g., PROSPECT). However, these high-frequency approximations cannot capture diffraction and coherent multiple scattering in wavelength-scale leaf tissues, unlike full-wave electromagnetic simulations. Here, we employ GPU-accelerated Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) simulations to model internal light scattering dynamics using segmented cross-section image geometries of representative dicot and monocot leaves with wavelength-dependent complex refractive indices. The simulations accurately reproduce the reflectance and transmittance characteristics of healthy leaves, showing strong agreement with the PROSPECT model, with average Lin's concordance values of 0.8962 for dicot leaves and 0.7849 for monocot leaves. We further simulate early-stage necrotrophic fungal infection by modeling melanized hyphae penetrating the cuticle and upper epidermis. Diseased leaves exhibit a pronounced reduction in visible green reflectance and a marked suppression of the near-infrared reflectance plateau, consistent with experimental observations. Remaining discrepancies in the visible band are expected to be reduced through more advanced geometric and material modeling. This proof-of-concept study presents a full-wave FDTD optical modeling framework for plant-leaf light scattering, enabling physics-based analysis of internal scattering before and after early-stage fungal penetration and supporting the use of light scattering as an indicator for pre-symptomatic plant fungal disease detection.</description>

      <title>Estimating Spatially Resolved Radiation Fields Using Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17654v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an in-depth analysis on how to build and train neural networks to estimate the spatial distribution of scattered radiation fields for radiation protection dosimetry in medical radiation fields, such as those found in interventional radiology and cardiology. We present three different synthetically generated datasets with increasing complexity for training, using a Monte-Carlo Simulation application based on Geant4. On those datasets, we evaluate convolutional and fully connected architectures of neural networks to demonstrate which design decisions work well for reconstructing the fluence and spectra distributions over the spatial domain of such radiation fields. All our datasets, as well as our training pipeline, are published as open source in separate repositories.</description>
