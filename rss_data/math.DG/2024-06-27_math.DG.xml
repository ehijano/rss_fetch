      <title>Fattening in mean curvature flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For each $g\ge 3$, we prove existence of a compact, connected, smoothly embedded, genus-$g$ surface $M_g$ with the following property: under mean curvature flow, there is exactly one singular point at the first singular time, and the tangent flow at the singularity is given by a shrinker with genus $(g-1)$ and with two ends. Furthermore, we show that if $g$ is sufficiently large, then $M_g$ fattens at the first singular time. As $g\to\infty$, the shrinker converges to a multiplicity $2$ plane.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we are interested in solvable complete Lie algebras, over the field $\K=\R$ or $\mathbb{C}$, which admit a symplectic structure. Specifically, important classes are studied, and a description of complete Lie Algebra with the dimension of nilradical less or equal than six, which supported symplectic structure is given.</description>

      <title>On distance estimates for complete manifolds with lower scalar curvature bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on the distance estimate problem on complete manifolds with compact boundary and with lower scalar curvature bounds. On these manifolds, relative to a background manifold with nonnegative curvature operator, we introduce a definition of the relative index of relative Gromov-Lawson pairs via a deformed Dirac operator trick in \cite{Zh20}. We prove that the relative index coincides with the index of associated Callias operators of the relative Gromov-Lawson pairs. As applications, we prove a short neck inequality with uniformly positive scalar curvature and the corresponding quantitative shielding result with nonnegative scalar curvature. Moreover, we generalize the concept of relative $\widehat{A}$-area in \cite{CZ24} to complete manifolds with compact boundary and then investigate width estimates of geodesic collar neighborhoods.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note we discuss the construction of equivariant primitive harmonic maps into $k-$symmetric spaces and give many applications to the construction of Willmore surfaces. In particular, examples of $S^1-$equivariant Willmore Moebius strips in $S^3$ are obtained as generalizations of the Lawson minimal Klein Bottles in $S^3$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A finite dimensional real vector space carrying an action of a real reductive group possesses a moment map and a stratification as defined by Kirwan and Ness. In this article we investigate the properties of the moment map, the Kirwan-Ness stratification, and Lauret's application from a more functorial, algebraic point of view.</description>

      <title>Monotone Sequences of Metric Spaces with Compact Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a fixed metric space (possibly an oriented Riemannian manifold with boundary) with an increasing sequence of distance functions and a uniform upper bound on diameter. When the metric space endowed with the pointwise limit of these distances is compact, then there is uniform and Gromov-Hausdorff (GH) convergence to this limit. When the metric space also has an integral current structure of uniformly bounded total mass (as is true for an oriented Riemannian manifold with boundary that has a uniform bound on total volume), we prove volume preserving intrinsic flat convergence to a subset of the GH limit whose closure is the whole GH limit. We provide a review of all notions and have a list of open questions at the end. Dedicated to Xiaochun Rong.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study lightlikeness preserving mappings from the $4$-dimensional Minkowski spacetime $\mathcal{M}_4$ to itself under no additional regularity assumptions like continuity, surjectivity, or injectivity. We prove that such a mapping $\phi$ satisfies one of the following three conditions. (1) The mapping $\phi$ can be written as a composition of a Lorentz transformation, a multiplication by a positive scalar, and a translation. (2) There is an event $r\in \mathcal{M}_4$ such that $\phi(\mathcal{M}_4\setminus\{r\})$ is contained in one light cone. (3) There is a lightlike line $\ell$ such that $\phi(\mathcal{M}_4\setminus \ell)$ is contained in another lightlike line. Here, a line that is contained in some light cone in $\mathcal{M}_4$ is called a lightlike line. We also give several similar results on mappings defined on a certain subset of $\mathcal{M}_4$ or the compactification of $\mathcal{M}_4$.</description>

      <title>Explicit Hamiltonian representations of meromorphic connections and duality from different perspectives: a case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we propose the explicit studies of $\hbar$-deformed meromorphic connections in $\mathfrak{gl}_3(\mathbb{C})$ with an unramified irregular pole at infinity of order $r_\infty=3$ and its spectral dual corresponding to the $\mathfrak{gl}_2(\mathbb{C})$ Painlev\'{e} $4$ Lax pair with one vanishing monodromy at the finite pole. Using the apparent singularities and their dual partners on the spectral curves as Darboux coordinates, we obtain the Hamiltonian evolutions, their reductions to only one non-trivial direction, the Jimbo-Miwa-Ueno tau-functions, the fundamental symplectic two-forms and some associated Hermitian matrix models on both sides. We then prove that the spectral duality connecting both sides extends to all these aspects as an explicit illustration of generalized Harnad's duality. We finally propose a conjecture relating the Jimbo-Miwa-Ueno differential as the $\hbar=0$ evaluation of the Hamiltonian differential in these Darboux coordinates that could provide insights on the geometric interpretation of the $\hbar$ formal parameter.</description>

      <title>Properties and Transformations of Weingarten Surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.10035v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Weingarten relations satisfied by rotationally symmetric surfaces in Euclidean 3-space E3 are considered from three points of view: restrictions on the slope of the relation at umbilic points, the action of SL2(R) as fractional linear transformations on the space of curvatures, and variational formulations for the relations. With regard to the first, we obtain bounds on the slope of a Weingarten relation in terms of the fall off of the radii of curvature at an umbilic point. This generalizes recent work by a number of authors. For the second, we show that the action descends from curvature space to E3 and splits into three natural geometric actions. This is applied to a class of Weingarten surfaces, called semi-quadratic, on which the action is shown to be transitive. Finally, a natural Lagrangian formulation is given for certain types of Weingarten relations and stability established.</description>

      <title>On a Bers theorem for SL(3,C)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15287v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For $S$ a closed surface of genus at least $2$, let $\mathrm{Hit}_3(S)$ be the Hitchin component of representations to $\mathrm{SL}(3,\mathbb{R}),$ equipped with the Labourie-Loftin complex structure. We construct a mapping class group equivariant holomorphic map from a large open subset of $\mathrm{Hit}_3(S)\times \overline{\mathrm{Hit}_3(S)}$ to the $\mathrm{SL}(3,\mathbb{C})$-character variety that restricts to the identity on the diagonal and to Bers' simultaneous uniformization on $\mathcal{T}(S)\times \overline{\mathcal{T}(S)}$. The open subset contains $\mathrm{Hit}_3(S)\times \overline{\mathcal{T}(S)}$ and $\mathcal{T}(S)\times \overline{\mathrm{Hit}_3(S)}$, and the image includes the holonomies of $\mathrm{SL}(3,\mathbb{C})$-opers.
  The map is realized by associating pairs of Hitchin representations to immersions into $\mathbb{C}^3$ that we call complex affine spheres, which are equivalent to certain conformal harmonic maps into $\mathrm{SL}(3,\mathbb{C})/\mathrm{SO}(3,\mathbb{C})$ and to new objects called bi-Higgs bundles. Complex affine spheres are obtained by solving a second-order complex elliptic PDE that resembles both the Beltrami and Tzitz\'eica equations. To study this equation we establish analytic results that should be of independent interest.</description>

Abstract: In 2014, Gromov asked if nonnegative scalar curvature is preserved under intrinsic flat convergence. Here we construct a sequence of closed oriented Riemannian $n$-manifolds, $n\geq 3$, with positive scalar curvature such that their intrinsic flat limit is a Riemannian manifold with negative scalar curvature.</description>

Abstract: Triple periodic minimal surfaces (TPMS) have garnered significant interest due to their structural efficiency and controllable geometry, making them suitable for a wide range of applications. This paper investigates the relationships between porosity and persistence entropy with the shape factor of TPMS. We propose conjectures suggesting that these relationships are polynomial in nature, derived through the application of machine learning techniques. This study exemplifies the integration of machine learning methodologies in pure mathematical research. Besides the conjectures, we provide the mathematical models that might have the potential implications for the design and modeling of TPMS structures in various practical applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2004.14551v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to establish exponential mixing of frame flows for convex cocompact hyperbolic manifolds of arbitrary dimension with respect to the Bowen-Margulis-Sullivan measure. Some immediate applications include an asymptotic formula for matrix coefficients with an exponential error term as well as the exponential equidistribution of holonomy of closed geodesics. The main technical result is a spectral bound on transfer operators twisted by holonomy, which we obtain by building on Dolgopyat's method.</description>

Abstract: We combine Hilbert module and algebraic techniques to give necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of an Hermitian torsion-free connection on the bimodule of differential one-forms of a first order differential calculus. In the presence of the extra structure of a bimodule connection, we give sufficient conditions for uniqueness. We prove that any $\theta$-deformation of a compact Riemannian manifold admits a unique Hermitian torsion-free bimodule connection and provide an explicit construction of it. Specialising to classical Riemannian manifolds yields a novel construction of the Levi-Civita connection on the cotangent bundle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15889v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study fine structural properties related to the interior regularity of $m$-dimensional area minimizing currents mod$(q)$ in arbitrary codimension. We show: (i) the set of points where at least one tangent cone is translation invariant along $m-1$ directions is locally a connected $C^{1,\beta}$ submanifold, and moreover such points have unique tangent cones; (ii) the remaining part of the singular set is countably $(m-2)$-rectifiable, with a unique flat tangent cone (with multiplicity) at $\mathcal{H}^{m-2}$-a.e. flat singular point. These results are consequences of fine excess decay theorems as well as almost monotonicity of a universal frequency function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07957v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the Levi-Civita connection on the noncommutative differential one-forms of a spectral triple $(\B,\H,\D)$, we define the full Riemann curvature tensor, the Ricci curvature tensor and scalar curvature. We give a definition of Dirac spectral triples and derive a general Weitzenbock formula for them. We apply these tools to $\theta$-deformations of compact Riemannian manifolds. We show that the Riemann and Ricci tensors transform naturally under $\theta$-deformation, whereas the connection Laplacian, Clifford representation of the curvature and the scalar curvature are all invariant under deformation.</description>
