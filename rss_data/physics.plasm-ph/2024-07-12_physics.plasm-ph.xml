      <title>Comprehensive Gyrokinetic Study of Eigenstate Transitions in Fast Ion-Driven Electrostatic Drift Instabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study comprehensively investigates fast ion-driven drift instability, extending the theory in [B. J. Kang and T. S. Hahm, Phys. Plasmas 26, 042501 (2019)]. The eigenmode equation, including the resonant contribution of passing fast ions, is derived and solved using the shooting method. Passing fast ions significantly affect the instability in weak negative shear or moderate positive shear plasmas. Eigenstate transitions to non-ground states occur more readily in weak magnetic shear, high safety factor, and long wavelength perturbations. Linear gyrokinetic simulations using the GKV code verify the theory, showing good agreement with shooting method results. The estimated quasilinear transport indicates that the net energy flux can be inward, without contradicting the second law of thermodynamics. These findings have important implications for heating efficiency and plasma confinement in the heating process, such as Ion Cyclotron Resonance Heating (ICRH) in future fusion devices.</description>

      <title>Kinetic Solitary Electrostatic Structures in Collisionless Plasma: Phase-Space Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The physics of isolated plasma potential structures sustained by a deficit of phase-space density on trapped orbits, commonly known as electron or ion holes, is reviewed. The principles of their equilibria are explained and illustrated, and contrasted with solitons. A literature review mostly prior to 2016 highlights the key historical developments of the field. Progress since, especially in hole acceleration, stability, and multi-dimensional effects, is summarized in more detail.</description>

      <title>Unified Gas-Kinetic Wave-Particle Method for Multiscale Flow Simulation of Partially Ionized Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Unified Gas-Kinetic Wave-Particle (UGKWP) method is constructed for partially ionized plasma (PIP). This method possesses both multiscale and unified preserving (UP) properties. The multiscale property allows the method to capture a wide range of plasma physics, from the particle transport in the kinetic regime to the two-fluid and magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) in the near continuum regimes, with the variation of local cell Knudsen number and normalized Larmor radius.The unified preserving property ensures that the numerical time step is not limited by the particle collision time in the continuum regime for the capturing of dissipative macroscopic solutions of the resistivity, Hall-effect, and all the way to the ideal MHD equations.The UGKWP is clearly distinguishable from the classical single scale Particle-in-Cell/Monte Carlo Collision (PIC/MCC) methods.The UGKWP method combines the evolution of microscopic velocity distribution with the evolution of macroscopic mean field quantities, granting it UP properties. Moreover, the time step in UGKWP is not constrained by the plasma cyclotron period through the Crank-Nicolson scheme for fluid and electromagnetic field interactions. The momentum and energy exchange between different species is approximated by the Andries-Aoki-Perthame (AAP) model. Overall, the UGKWP method enables a smooth transition from the PIC method in the rarefied regime to the MHD solvers in the continuum regime. This method has been extensively tested on a variety of phenomena ranging from kinetic Landau damping to the macroscopic flow problems, such as the Brio-Wu shock tube, Orszag-Tang vortex, and Geospace Environmental Modeling (GEM) magnetic reconnection. These tests demonstrate that the proposed method can capture the fundamental features of PIP across different scales seamlessly.</description>

      <title>On the shifts of orbits and periodic orbits under perturbation and the change of Poincar\'e map Jacobian of periodic orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Periodic orbits and cycles resp. play a significant role in discrete- and continuous-time dynamical systems (i.e. maps and flows). To succinctly describe their shifts when the system is applied perturbation, the notions of functional and functional derivative are borrowed from functional analysis to consider the whole system as an argument of the geometric representation of the periodic orbit or cycle. The shifts of an orbit/trajectory and periodic orbit/cycle are analyzed and concluded as formulae for maps/flows, respectively. The theory shall be beneficial to the sensitivity to perturbation analysis, control and optimization of various systems.</description>

      <title>Role of FLR effects in magnetopause equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.14209v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Earth magnetopause, when sufficiently plane and stationary at a local scale, can be considered as a "quasi-tangential" discontinuity, since the normal component of the magnetic field Bn is typically very small but not zero. Contrary to observations, the "Classic Theory of Discontinuities" (CTD) predicts that rotational and compressional jumps should be mutually exclusive in the general case Bn n.e.t. 0, but allows only one exception: the tangential discontinuity provided that Bn is strictly zero. Here we show that Finite Larmor Radius (FLR) effects play an important role in the quasi-tangential case, whenever the ion Larmor radius is not fully negligible with respect to the magnetopause thickness. By including FLR effects, the results suggest that a rotational discontinuity undergoes a change comparable to the change of a Shear Alfven into a Kinetic Alfven wave when considering linear modes. For this new kind of discontinuity, the co-existence of rotational and compressional variations at the magnetopause does no more imply that this boundary is a strict tangential discontinuity, even in 1D-like regions far from X-lines if any. This result may lead to important consequences concerning the oldest and most basic questions of magnetospheric physics: how can the magnetopause be open, where and when? The role of FLR being established theoretically, the paper then shows that it can be proved experimentally. We make use of MMS data and process them with the most recent available 4 spacecraft tools. First, we present the different processing techniques that we use to estimate spatial derivatives, such as grad(B) and div(P), and the magnetopause normal direction. We point out why this normal direction must be determined with extremely high accuracy to make the conclusions unambiguous. The results obtained by these techniques are presented in a detailed case study and on a statistical basis.</description>
