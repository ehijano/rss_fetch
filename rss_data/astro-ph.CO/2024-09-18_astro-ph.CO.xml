      <title>Non-Gaussianity Beyond the Scalar Sector: A Search for Tensor and Mixed Tensor-Scalar Bispectra with Planck Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Primordial gravitational waves could be non-Gaussian, just like primordial scalar perturbations. Although the tensor two-point function has thus-far remained elusive, the three-point function could, in principle, be large enough to be detected in Cosmic Microwave Background temperature and polarization anisotropies. We perform a detailed analysis of tensor and mixed tensor-scalar non-Gaussianity through the Planck PR4 bispectrum, placing constraints on eleven primordial templates, spanning various phenomenological and physical regimes including modifications to gravity, additional fields in inflation, and primordial magnetic fields. All analysis is performed using modern quasi-optimal binned estimators, and yields no evidence for tensor non-Gaussianity, with a maximum detection significance of $1.8\sigma$. Our constraints are derived primarily from large-scales (except for tensor-scalar-scalar models), and benefit greatly from the inclusion of $B$-modes. Although we find some loss of information from binning, mask effects and residual foreground contamination, our $f_{\rm NL}$ bounds improve over those of previous analyses by $40-600\%$, with six of the eleven models being analyzed for the first time. Unlike for scalar non-Gaussianity, future low-noise experiments such as LiteBIRD, the Simons Observatory and CMB-S4, will yield considerable improvement in tensor non-Gaussianity constraints.</description>

      <title>Full-shape analysis with simulation-based priors: cosmological parameters and the structure growth anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore full-shape analysis with simulation-based priors, which is the simplest approach to galaxy clustering data analysis that combines effective field theory (EFT) on large scales and numerical simulations on small scales. The core ingredient of our approach is the prior density of EFT parameters which we extract from a suite of 10500 galaxy simulations based on the halo occupation distribution (HOD) model. We measure the EFT parameters with the field-level forward model, which enables us to cancel cosmic variance. On the theory side, we develop a new efficient approach to calculate field-level transfer functions using time-sliced perturbation theory and the logarithmic fast Fourier transform. We study cosmology dependence of EFT parameters of dark matter halos and HOD galaxies and find that it can be ignored for the purpose of prior generation. We use neural density estimation to model the measured distribution of EFT parameters. Our distribution model is then used as a prior in a reanalysis of the BOSS full-shape galaxy power spectrum data. Assuming the $\Lambda$CDM model, we find significant ($\approx 30\%$ and $\approx 60\%$) improvements for the matter density fraction and the mass fluctuation amplitude, which are constrained to $\Omega_m= 0.315 \pm 0.010$ and $\sigma_8 = 0.671 \pm 0.027$. The value of the Hubble constant does not change, $H_0= 68.7\pm 1.1$ km/s/Mpc. This reaffirms earlier reports of the structure growth tension from the BOSS data. Finally, we use the measured EFT parameters to constrain galaxy formation physics.</description>

      <title>Hunting Primordial Black Hole Dark Matter in Lyman-$\alpha$ Forest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A very pressing question in contemporary physics is the identity of Dark Matter (DM), and one that has not been answered affirmatively to any degree so far. Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) are one of the most well-motivated DM candidates. Light enough PBHs have been constrained by either the non-detection of their Hawking radiation itself, or by the non-observation of any measurable effects of this radiation on astrophysical and cosmological observables. We constrain the PBH density by their Hawking radiation effect on the intergalactic medium (IGM) temperature evolution. We use the latest deductions of IGM temperature from Lyman-$\alpha$ forest observations. We put constraints on the fraction of PBH DM with masses $5 \times 10^{15}$ g - $10^{17}$ g separately for spinning and non-spinning BHs. We derive constraints by dealing with the heating effects of the astrophysical reionization of the IGM in two ways. In one way, we completely neglect this heating due to astrophysical sources, thus giving us weaker constraints, but completely robust to the reionization history of the universe. In the second way, we utilise some modelling of the ionization and temperature history, and use it to derive more stringent constraints. We find that for non-spinning PBHs of mass $10^{16}$ g, the current measurements can constrain the PBH-density to be $\lesssim$ 0.1% of the total DM. We find that these constraints from the latest Lyman-$\alpha$ forest temperature measurements are competitive, and hence provide a new observable to probe the nature of PBH DM. The systematics affecting Lyman-$\alpha$ forest measurements are different from other constraining observations, and thus this is a complementary probe.</description>

      <title>Galactic Compton Wavelengths in $f(R)$ Screening Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $f(R)$ theories of modified gravity may be compatible with current observations if the deviations from general relativity are sufficiently well screened in dense environments. In recent work [arXiv:2310.19955] we have shown that approximations commonly used to assess whether galaxies are screened, or unscreened, fail to hold in observationally interesting parts of parameter space. One of the assumptions commonly made in these approximations, and more broadly in the study of $f(R)$ models, is that the mass of the scalar mode can be neglected inside a galaxy. In this work we demonstrate that this approximation may fail spectacularly and discuss the implications of this for tests of the theory.</description>

      <title>Spatially Resolved Kinematics of SLACS Lens Galaxies. I: Data and Kinematic Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain spatially resolved kinematics with the Keck Cosmic Web Imager (KCWI) integral-field spectrograph for a sample of 14 massive (11 &lt; log10 M* &lt; 12) lensing early-type galaxies (ETGs) at redshifts z=0.15-0.35 from the Sloan Lens ACS (SLACS) survey. We integrate within the galaxy effective radius and examine the rotational and dispersion velocities, showing that 11/14 are quantitatively classified as slow rotators in comparison with local galaxy surveys. Of key interest is the ability of this data to enable the precision required for cosmological inference with lensing time delays on scales of 1-2% uncertainty. The dataset is unprecedented for galaxy-scale lens galaxies, in terms of signal-to-noise ratio, sampling, and calibration. We test sources of systematic error and identify primary contributions from choice of stellar template library and wavelength range of the spectral fit. Systematics are quantified at the spatial bin level, resulting in systematic error at 3% and positive spatial covariance of 2%. We examine the effects of integration of the kinematic maps within circular apertures of different sizes and compare with SDSS single-aperture velocity dispersions. The most recent velocity dispersion estimates from SDSS spectra are found to be biased by a factor of 5.3% with respect to KCWI data, and to underestimate uncertainties. We examine correlations between scaling relations and show the correlations to agree with previous SLACS analysis with no statistically significant disagreement. A follow-up paper will present Jeans modeling and discuss the context of these observations within broader studies of galaxy evolution and cosmology.</description>

      <title>SpectrAx: Spectral Search of Axion-Like Particles Using Multi-Band Observations of Galaxy Clusters from SKA, SO, CMB-S4 and eROSITA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence of axions or Axion-Like Particles (ALPs) has been predicted by various Beyond Standard Model (BSM) theories, and the proposed photon-ALP interaction is one of the ways to probe them. Such an interaction will lead to photon-ALP resonant conversion in galaxy clusters, resulting in a polarized spectral distortion in the CMB along the cluster line of sight. The estimation of this signal from galaxy clusters requires an estimation of the electron density and magnetic field in galaxy clusters. We have developed a new Bayesian framework \texttt{SpectrAx} that can use observations from different electromagnetic bands such as radio, CMB, optical, and X-ray to infer the astrophysical properties of a galaxy cluster, such as cluster its redshift, electron density and magnetic field, along with the BSM physics such as ALPs. By using the simulated data for upcoming CMB surveys such as Simons Observatory (SO) and CMB-S4 in combination with Square Kilometer Array (SKA) and extended ROentgen Survey with an Imaging Telescope Array (eROSITA) we demonstrate the capability in accurately inferring the ALPs coupling strength along with the radial profile of electron density and magnetic field from galaxy clusters. The application of this framework to the data from future surveys by combining SKA+SO+eROSITA and SKA+CMB-S4+eROSITA will make it possible for the first time to explore both astrophysics and BSM physics from low-redshift galaxy clusters using a multi-band approach.</description>

      <title>Exploring cosmological evolution and constraints in $f(T)$ teleparallel gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the extension of teleparallel gravity within the framework of general relativity, introducing an algebraic function $f(T)$ dependent on the torsion scalar $T$. Motivated by the teleparallel formulation, we investigate cosmological implications, employing the simplest parametrization of the dark energy equation of state. Our chosen $f(T)$ function, $f(T)=\alpha(-T)^n$, undergoes stringent constraints using recent observational data ($H(z)$, SNeIa, BAO, and CMB). The model aligns well with cosmic dynamics, exhibiting quintessence behavior. The evolution of the deceleration parameter, the behavior of dark energy components, and the $Om(z)$ diagnostic further reveal intriguing cosmological phenomena, emphasizing the model's compatibility with quintessence scenarios.</description>

      <title>$\Lambda$CDM Model Extension with Dissipative Dynamics and Sign-Switching Bulk Viscous Pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we extend the standard $\Lambda$CDM model by incorporating causal viscous dark matter (vDM) modelled using Maxwell-Cattaneo theory and obtain a novel Hubble parameter solution for the model, which can even be extended to incorporate both radiation and baryonic matter components. A detailed and comprehensive analysis of the model is carried out by deriving theoretical constraints on model parameters, comparing the model with the latest observational data sets and validating the behaviour of the model under different thermodynamic laws. Such an in-depth analysis of the model yielded several intriguing results, like the presence of sign-switching bulk viscous pressure which aids both, the decelerated expansion in the early universe and the accelerated expansion in the late universe, possibility of having negative specific entropy rate in the early Universe while still satisfying the covariant second law of thermodynamics, and a correlation between relaxation time parameter and sign-switching redshift. Finally, we propose a unified dark matter (UDM) interpretation for the dark sector in this model and hence showed that, under the said UDM interpretation, this model can satisfy the much-required near equilibrium condition associated with the background dissipative theory both in the early and late phase of the Universe. Based on the NEC trend showcased by the model, we conjuncture that the late-accelerating behaviour of Universe can be viewed as a means for the UDM fluid to attain a global equilibrium state.</description>

      <title>Fast, Accurate and Perturbative Forward Modeling of Galaxy Clustering Part I: Galaxies in the Restframe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Forward models of the galaxy density field enable simulation based inference as well as field level inference of galaxy clustering. However, these analysis techniques require forward models that are both computationally fast and robust to modeling uncertainties in the relation between galaxies and matter. Both requirements can be addressed with the Effective Field Theory of Large Scale Structure. Here, we focus on the physical and numerical convergence of the LEFTfield model. Based on the perturbative nature of the forward model, we derive an analytic understanding of the leading numerical errors, and we compare our estimates to high-resolution and N-body references. This allows us to derive a set of best-practice recommendations for the numerical accuracy parameters, which are completely specified by the desired order of the perturbative solution and the cut-off scale. We verify these recommendations by an extended set of parameter recovery tests from fully nonlinear mock data and find very consistent results. A single evaluation of the forward model takes seconds, making cosmological analyses of galaxy clustering data based on forward models computationally feasible.</description>

      <title>Fast radio bursts as a probe of gravity on cosmological scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the potential for improving constraints on gravity by leveraging correlations in the dispersion measure derived from Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) in combination with cosmic shear. Specifically, we focus on Horndeski gravity, inferring the kinetic braiding and Planck mass run rate from a stage-4 cosmic shear mock survey alongside a survey comprising $10^4$ FRBs. For the inference pipeline, we utilise hi_class to predict the linear matter power spectrum in modified gravity scenarios, while non-linear corrections are modelled with HMcode, including feedback mechanisms. Our findings indicate that FRBs can disentangle degeneracies between baryonic feedback and cosmological parameters, as well as the mass of massive neutrinos. Since these parameters are also degenerate with modified gravity parameters, the inclusion of FRBs can enhance constraints on Horndeski parameters by up to $40$ percent, despite being a less significant measurement. Additionally, we apply our model to current FRB data and use the uncertainty in the $\mathrm{DM}-z$ relation to impose limits on gravity. However, due to the limited sample size of current data, constraints are predominantly influenced by theoretical priors. Despite this, our study demonstrates that FRBs will significantly augment the limited set of cosmological probes available, playing a critical role in providing alternative tests of feedback, cosmology, and gravity. All codes used in this work are made publically available.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from primordial black hole isocurvature: the effect of non-Gaussianities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-light primordial black holes (PBHs) with masses $M_{\rm PBH}&lt;5\times 10^8\mathrm{g}$ can dominate transiently the energy budget of the Universe and reheat the Universe through their evaporation taking place before Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. The isocurvature energy density fluctuations associated to the inhomogeneous distribution of a population of such PBHs can induce an abundant production of GWs due to second-order gravitational effects. In this work, we discuss the effect of primordial non-Gaussianity on the clustering properties of PBHs and study the effect of a clustered PBH population on the spectral shape of the aforementioned induced GW signal. In particular, focusing on local-type non-Gaussianity we find a double-peaked GW signal with the amplitude of the low-frequency peak being proportional to the square of the non-Gaussian parameter $\tau_\mathrm{NL}$. Remarkably, depending on the PBH mass $M_{\rm PBH}$ and the initial abundance of PBHs at formation time, i.e. $\Omega_\mathrm{PBH,f}$, this double-peaked GW signal can lie well within the frequency bands of forthcoming GW detectors, namely LISA, ET, SKA and BBO, hence rendering this signal falsifiable by GW experiments and promoting it as a novel portal probing the primordial non-Gaussianity.</description>

      <title>Assessing the potential of LIGO-India in resolving the Hubble Tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determining the Hubble constant (H0), a fundamental parameter describing cosmic expansion, remains a challenge due to conflicting measurements from the early and late universe. Gravitational wave (GW) observations from binary neutron star (BNS) mergers, with identified host galaxies through electromagnetic (EM) follow-up, offer an independent method to measure H0. However, this requires detection of numerous events, which could take decades with current GW detectors. LIGO-India can dramatically accelerate this effort. With sensitivity comparable to the existing LIGO detectors, its addition to the LIGO-Virgo network could increase detected events by 70%. This improvement nearly doubles when accounting for the detector's 70% duty cycle, increasing the probability of simultaneous operation of three detectors by a factor of ~2. We perform end-to-end simulations to estimate triple-coincidence detection rates and sky localization, considering realistic BNS populations, lightcurves, and EM observatory specifications. Our findings suggest LIGO-India could increase BNS events with observed kilonovae by ~2-7 times. The factor of few improvements in source localization precision with LIGO-India can allow much deeper EM follow-up campaigns (not considered in the simulations), potentially increasing the overall rate of detection of EM counterparts by a factor of ~20, which can have an enormous impact in addressing critical questions in different areas of astronomy. We evaluate the impact of LIGO-India in the context of H0 measurement and argue that it can cut down the required observation time of several decades by a factor of few and possibly to just few years with regular sensitivity upgrades.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent reports of cosmological parity violation in the 4PCF raises the question of how such violations could be systematically generated. Here we present a constructive procedure to generate arbitrary violations of vectorial and tensorial types on any scale, which is computationally efficient in the squeezed limit. We directly compute their numerical transfer function, and find strong conservation in the linear regime. This procedure spans all squeezed parity violating observables at the 4PCF, following the quadratic estimator classification.</description>

Abstract: We develop a transformer-based conditional generative model for discrete point objects and their properties. We use it to build a model for populating cosmological simulations with gravitationally collapsed structures called dark matter halos. Specifically, we condition our model with dark matter distribution obtained from fast, approximate simulations to recover the correct three-dimensional positions and masses of individual halos. This leads to a first model that can recover the statistical properties of the halos at small scales to better than 3% level using an accelerated dark matter simulation. This trained model can then be applied to simulations with significantly larger volumes which would otherwise be computationally prohibitive with traditional simulations, and also provides a crucial missing link in making end-to-end differentiable cosmological simulations. The code, named GOTHAM (Generative cOnditional Transformer for Halo's Auto-regressive Modeling) is publicly available at \url{https://github.com/shivampcosmo/GOTHAM}.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves from High Temperature Strings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13803v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study finite temperature effects in string cosmology and their potential gravitational wave signature. Expanding on our recent work arXiv:2310.11494 , we consider a general configuration of highly excited open and closed strings at high enough temperature to be in the Hagedorn phase in 3+1 dimensions, in order to explore its cosmological implications. We find conditions, which can be satisfied in compactifications with moduli stabilization, that allow the long strings to remain in equilibrium in a controlled effective field theory, with equilibration driven by the joining and splitting of the dominant open string population. We calculate the emission rate of gravitons by long open strings, which we show is determined by ten dimensional flat space transition amplitudes available in the literature, and then find the total gravitational wave spectrum generated by the gas of long strings. The gravitational wave spectrum has robust characteristics. It peaks at frequencies of order 50-100 GHz, the same as for gravitational waves from the reheating epoch of the Standard Model. But the amplitude of the string signal is significantly larger than predicted by the Standard Model and its field theoretic extensions. The amplitude and other physical observables (such as the contribution to $\Delta N_{\text eff}$) are directly proportional to the string scale $M_s$; indicating that a potential signal may also determine the string scale. Our calculations provide one of the few examples of a signal of stringy origin that dominates over the field theory predictions. We give a physical explanation of our results and discuss further implications.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Probes of Higgs-Axion non-perturbative Couplings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we investigate the phenomenological implications of several non-trivial axion-Higgs couplings, which cover most of the possible non-perturbative scenarios. Specifically we consider the combination of having higher order non-renormalizable Higgs-axion couplings originating from a weakly coupled effective theory combined with non-perturbative couplings of the form $\sim \epsilon \Lambda_c^2|H|^2\cos (\frac{\phi}{f_a})$. Since we consider the misalignment axion, the non-perturbative couplings can be expanded in the form of a perturbation expansion in powers of $\phi/f_a$, thus after the electroweak symmetry breaking, the effective potential of the axion is drastically affected by these terms. We investigate the phenomenological implications of these terms for various values of the mass scale $\Lambda_c$, and some scenarios are theoretically disfavored, while other scenarios with non-perturbative Higgs-axion couplings of the form $\sim \epsilon \Lambda_c^2|H|^2\cos (\frac{\phi}{f_a})$ with $\Lambda_c\sim 10^{-10}\times m_a$ and $m_a\sim 10^{-10}\,$eV, lead to a characteristic pattern in the stochastic gravitational wave background via the deformation of the background equation of state parameter occurring at frequencies probed by the Einstein Telescope. We also consider loop effects from the Higgs sector caused by the term $\sim \epsilon \Lambda_c^2|H|^2\cos (\frac{\phi}{f_a})$ if we close the Higgs in one loop.</description>

      <title>Advances in ArborX to support exascale applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: ArborX is a performance portable geometric search library developed as part of the Exascale Computing Project (ECP). In this paper, we explore a collaboration between ArborX and a cosmological simulation code HACC. Large cosmological simulations on exascale platforms encounter a bottleneck due to the in-situ analysis requirements of halo finding, a problem of identifying dense clusters of dark matter (halos). This problem is solved by using a density-based DBSCAN clustering algorithm. With each MPI rank handling hundreds of millions of particles, it is imperative for the DBSCAN implementation to be efficient. In addition, the requirement to support exascale supercomputers from different vendors necessitates performance portability of the algorithm. We describe how this challenge problem guided ArborX development, and enhanced the performance and the scope of the library. We explore the improvements in the basic algorithms for the underlying search index to improve the performance, and describe several implementations of DBSCAN in ArborX. Further, we report the history of the changes in ArborX and their effect on the time to solve a representative benchmark problem, as well as demonstrate the real world impact on production end-to-end cosmology simulations.</description>

      <title>Probing dark-matter effects with gravitational waves using the parameterized post-Einsteinian framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A massive black hole can develop a dark-matter overdensity, and the dark matter changes the evolution of a stellar-mass compact object inspiraling around the massive black hole through the dense dark-matter environment. Specifically, dynamical friction speeds up the inspiral of the compact object and causes feedback on the dark-matter distribution. These intermediate mass-ratio inspirals with dark matter are a source of gravitational waves (GWs), and the waves can dephase significantly from an equivalent system in vacuum. Prior work has shown that this dephasing needs to be modeled to detect the GWs from these systems with LISA (the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna); it also showed that the density and distribution of dark matter can be inferred from a GW measurement. In this paper, we study whether the parametrized post-Einsteinian (ppE) framework can be used to infer the presence of dark matter in these systems. We confirm that if vacuum waveform templates are used to model the GWs from an inspiral in a dark-matter halo, then the resulting parameter estimation is biased. We then apply the ppE framework to determine whether it can reduce the parameter-estimation biases, and we find that adding one ppE phase term to a waveform template eliminates the parameter-estimation biases (statistical errors become larger than the systematic ones), but the effective post-Newtonian order in the ppE framework must be specified without uncertainties. When the post-Newtonian order has uncertainty, we find that the systematic errors on the ppE and the binary's parameters exceed the statistical errors. Thus, the simplest ppE framework would not give unbiased results for these systems, and a further extension of it, or dedicated parameter estimation with gravitational waveforms that include dark-matter effects would be needed.</description>

      <title>Capability of Cosmic Gravitational Focusing on Identifying the Neutrino Mass Ordering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cosmic gravitational focusing (CGF) of relic neutrinos can provide an independent measurement of the absolute neutrino masses $m_i$ with fourth-power dependence ($m^4_i$). We demonstrate in this paper for the first time how this can help identifying the neutrino mass ordering (NMO). Upon incorporating the projected CGF sensitivity at DESI, the preference for the normal ordering (NO) with a prior $\sum m_\nu &gt; 0.509\,{\rm eV}$ would increase from the original 89.9\% of the current clustering method with both DESI BAO and CMB to 98.2\% while the inverted ordering (IO) is further disfavored from 10.1\% to 1.8\%. We also show how this can affect the prospects of the neutrinoless double beta decay and single beta decay measurements.</description>

      <title>Mapping Anisotropies in the Stochastic Gravitational-Wave Background with TianQin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the milli-Hertz frequency band, stochastic gravitational-wave background can be composed of both astronomical and cosmological sources, both can be anisotropic. Numerically depicting these anisotropies can be critical in revealing the underlying properties of their origins. For the first time, we perform a theoretical analysis of the constraining ability of TianQin on multiple moments of the stochastic background. First, we find that with a one-year operation, for a background with a signal-to-noise ratio of 16, TianQin can recover the multiple moments up to $l=4$. We also identified a unique feature of the stochastic background sky map, which is the mirror symmetry along the fixed orbital plane of TianQin. Thirdly, we explain the difference in anisotropy recovering ability between TianQin and LISA, by employing the criteria of the singularity of the covariance matrix (which is the condition number). Finally, we find that since the different data channel combinations correspond to different singularities, certain combinations might have an advantage in stochastic background map-making. We believe that the findings of this work can provide an important reference to future stochastic background analysis pipelines. It can also serve as a guideline for designing better gravitational-wave detectors aiming to decipher anisotropies in the stochastic background.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the maximal number of dark degrees of freedom from black hole evaporation, cosmic rays, colliders, and supernovae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A dark sector with a very large number of massive degrees of freedom is generically constrained by radiative corrections to Newton's constant. However, there are caveats to this statement, especially if the degrees of freedom are light or mass-less. Here, we examine in detail and update a number of constraints on the possible number of dark degrees of freedom, including from black hole evaporation, from perturbations to systems including an evaporating black hole, from direct gravitational production at colliders, from high-energy cosmic rays, and from supernovae energy losses.</description>

      <title>Full-shape BOSS constraints on dark matter interacting with dark radiation and lifting the $S_8$ tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.03974v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we derive constraints on interacting dark matter-dark radiation models from a full-shape analysis of BOSS-DR12 galaxy clustering data, combined with Planck legacy cosmic microwave background (CMB) and baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements. We consider a set of models parameterized within the effective theory of structure formation (ETHOS), quantifying the lifting of the $S_8$ tension in view of KiDS weak-lensing results. The most favorable scenarios point to a fraction $f\sim 10-100\%$ of interacting dark matter as well as a dark radiation temperature that is smaller by a factor $\xi\sim 0.1-0.15$ compared to the CMB, leading to a reduction of the tension to the $\sim 1\sigma$ level. The temperature dependence of the interaction rate favored by relaxing the $S_8$ tension is realized for a weakly coupled unbroken non-Abelian $SU(N)$ gauge interaction in the dark sector. To map our results onto this $SU(N)$ model, we compute higher-order corrections due to Debye screening. We find a lower bound $\alpha_d\equiv g_d^2/(4\pi)\gtrsim 10^{-8} (10^{-9})$ for dark matter mass $1000 (1)$ GeV for relaxing the $S_8$ tension, consistent with upper bounds from galaxy ellipticities and compatible with self-interactions relevant for small-scale structure formation.</description>

      <title>Loop Corrections in Bispectrum in USR Inflation with PBHs Formation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03841v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We calculate the one-loop corrections in bispectrum of CMB scale perturbations induced from the small scale modes undergoing an intermediate phase of USR inflation in scenarios employed for PBHs formation. Using the formalism of effective field theory of inflation we calculate the cubic and quartic Hamiltonians and perform the in-in analysis for a subset of Feynman diagrams comprising both the cubic and the quartic exchange vertices. We show the one-loop corrections in bispectrum has the local shape with $f_{NL}$ having the same structure as the one-loop correction in power spectrum in their dependence on the duration of the USR phase and the sharpness of the transition to the final attractor phase. It is shown that in the models with a sharp transition the induced loop corrections in bispectrum can quickly violate the observational bounds on $f_{NL}$.</description>

      <title>A comparison between Shapefit compression and Full-Modelling method with PyBird for DESI 2024 and beyond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07283v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: DESI aims to provide one of the tightest constraints on cosmological parameters by analysing the clustering of more than thirty million galaxies. However, obtaining such constraints requires special care in validating the methodology and efforts to reduce the computational time required through data compression and emulation techniques. In this work, we perform a rigorous validation of the PyBird power spectrum modelling code with both a traditional emulated Full-Modelling approach and the model-independent ShapeFit compression approach. By using cubic box simulations that accurately reproduce the clustering and precision of the DESI survey, we find that the cosmological constraints from ShapeFit and Full-Modelling are consistent with each other at the $\sim0.5\sigma$ level for the $\Lambda$CDM model. Both ShapeFit and Full-Modelling are also consistent with the true $\Lambda$CDM simulation cosmology down to a scale of $k_{\mathrm{max}} = 0.20 h\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ even after including the hexadecapole. For extended models such as the wCDM and the oCDM models, we find that including the hexadecapole can significantly improve the constraints and reduce the modelling errors with the same $k_{\mathrm{max}}$. While their discrepancies between the constraints from ShapeFit and Full-Modelling are more significant than $\Lambda$CDM, they remain consistent within $0.7\sigma$. Lastly, we also show that the constraints on cosmological parameters with the correlation function evaluated from PyBird down to $s_{\mathrm{min}} = 30 h^{-1} \mathrm{Mpc}$ are unbiased and consistent with the constraints from the power spectrum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04577v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a combined strong and weak gravitational-lensing analysis of the massive galaxy cluster MACS J1423.8+2404 ($z=0.545$, MACS J1423 hereafter), one of the most dynamically relaxed and massive cool-core clusters discovered in the MAssive Cluster Survey at $z&gt;0.5$. We combine high-resolution imaging from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) in the F606W, F814W, and F160W pass-bands with spectroscopic observations taken as part of the KALEIDOSCOPE survey with the Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer mounted on the Very Large Telescope. Our strong lensing analysis of the mass distribution in the cluster core is constrained by four multiple-image systems (17 individual images) within redshift range $1.779&lt;z&lt;2.840$. Our weak-lensing analysis of the cluster outskirts, confined to the HST field of view, is based on a background galaxy catalogue with a density of 57 gal.arcmin$^{-2}$. We measure a projected mass of M($\textrm{R}&lt;200$ kpc) = (1.6 $\pm$ 0.05) $\times$ 10$^{14}$ M$_{\rm\odot}$ from our strong-lensing model, and a projected mass of M($\textrm{R}&lt;640$ kpc) = (6.6 $\pm$ 0.6) $\times$ 10$^{14}$ M$_{\rm\odot}$ when combining with our the weak-lensing constraints. Our analysis of the cluster mass distribution yields no evidence of substructures, confirming the dynamically relaxed state of MACS J1423. Our work sets the stage for future analysis of MACS J1423 in the upcoming Canadian Near Infrared Imager and Stiltless Spectrograph Unbiased Cluster Survey for the James Webb Space Telescope.</description>

Abstract: A novel approach to the class of cosmic barotropic fluids in which the speed of sound squared is defined as a function of the Equation of State parameter, so called $c_s^2(w)$ models, is examined. For this class of models, a new analytical reconstruction method is introduced for finding their equivalent purely kinetic k-essence formulation. The method is explicitly demonstrated for several $c_s^2(w)$ models. The application of the obtained explicit or closed form solutions in understanding dark sector unification models is discussed.</description>

      <title>Multidimensionality of the Hubble tension: the roles of $\Omega_m$ and $\omega_c$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04530v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Hubble tension is inherently multidimensional, and bears important implications for parameters beyond $H_0$. We discuss the key role of the matter density parameter $\Omega_m$ and the physical cold dark matter density $\omega_c$. We argue that once $\Omega_m$ and the physical baryon density $\omega_b$ are calibrated, through Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) and/or Type Ia Supernovae (SNeIa) for $\Omega_m$, and via Big Bang Nucleosynthesis for $\omega_b$, any model raising $H_0$ requires raising $\omega_c$ and, under minimal assumptions, also the clustering parameter $S_8$. We explicitly verify that this behaviour holds when analyzing recent BAO and SNeIa data. We argue that a calibration of $\Omega_m$ as reliable and model-independent as possible should be a priority in the Hubble tension discussion, and an interesting possibility in this sense could be represented by galaxy cluster gas mass fraction measurements.</description>

      <title>Global 21 cm Signal Recovery Under Changing Environmental Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06012v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The redshifted 21 cm line of cosmic atomic hydrogen is one of the most auspicious tools in deciphering the early Universe. Recovering this signal remains an ongoing problem for cosmologists in the field, with the signal being hidden behind foregrounds approximately five orders of magnitude brighter than itself. A traditional forward modelling data analysis pipeline using Bayesian data analysis and a physically motivated foreground model to find this signal shows great promise in the case of unchanging environmental conditions. However we demonstrate in this paper that in the presence of a soil with changing dielectric properties under the antenna over time, or a changing soil temperature in the far field of our observation these traditional methods struggle.
  In this paper we detail a tool using Masked Auto-regressive Flows that improves upon previous physically motivated foreground models when one is trying to recover this signal in the presence of changing environmental conditions. We demonstrate that with these changing parameters our tool consistently recovers the signal with a much greater Bayesian evidence than the traditional data analysis pipeline, decreasing the root mean square error in the recovery of the injected signal by up to 45 %.</description>

      <title>Supermassive black holes from inflation constrained by dark matter substructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11098v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent James Webb Space Telescope observations of high-redshift massive galaxy candidates have initiated renewed interest in the important mystery around the formation and evolution of our Universe's largest supermassive black holes (SMBHs). We consider the possibility that some of them were seeded by the direct collapse of primordial density perturbations from inflation into primordial black holes and analyze the consequences of this on current dark matter substructures assuming non-Gaussian primordial curvature perturbation distributions. We derive bounds on the enhanced curvature perturbation amplitude from the number of dwarf spheroidal galaxies in our Galaxy, observations of stellar streams and gravitational lensing. We find this bound region significantly overlaps with that required for SMBH seed formation and enables us to probe Gaussian and non-Gaussian curvature perturbations corresponding to the SMBH seeds in the range ${\cal O}(10^5$-$10^{12}) M_\odot$.</description>

      <title>Signatures of ultralight bosons in the orbital eccentricity of binary black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02415v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the existence of clouds of ultralight particles surrounding black holes during their cosmological history as members of a binary system can leave a measurable imprint on the distribution of masses and orbital eccentricities observable with future gravitational-wave detectors. Notably, we find that for nonprecessing binaries with chirp masses ${\cal M} \lesssim 10\,M_\odot$, formed exclusively in isolation, larger-than-expected values of the eccentricity, i.e. $e\gtrsim 10^{-2}$ at gravitational-wave frequencies $f_{\rm GW} \simeq 10^{-2}\,$Hz, would provide tantalizing evidence for a new particle of mass between $[0.5,2.5] \times 10^{-12}\,$eV in nature. The predicted evolution of the eccentricity can also drastically affect the in-band phase evolution and peak frequency. These results constitute unique signatures of boson clouds of ultralight particles in the dynamics of binary black holes, which will be readily accessible with the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna, as well as future mid-band and Deci-hertz detectors.</description>

      <title>Parity violation in primordial tensor non-Gaussianities from matter bounce cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05464v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been shown that primordial tensor non-Gaussianities from a cubic Weyl action with a non-dynamical coupling are suppressed by the so-called slow-roll parameter in a conventional framework of slow-roll inflation. In this paper, we consider matter bounce cosmology in which the background spacetime is no longer quasi-de Sitter, and hence one might expect that the matter bounce models could predict non-suppressed non-Gaussianities. Nevertheless, we first show that the corresponding non-Gaussian amplitudes from the cubic Weyl term with a non-dynamical coupling are much smaller than those from the conventional slow-roll inflation, in spite of the fact that there is no slow-roll suppression. We then introduce a dynamical coupling that can boost the magnitude of graviton cubic interactions and clarify that there is a parameter region where the tensor non-Gaussianities can be enhanced and can potentially be tested by cosmic microwave background experiments.</description>

      <title>Galaxy groups in the presence of Cosmological Constant: Increasing the Masses of Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14944v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The boundaries of galaxy groups and clusters are defined by the interplay between the Newtonian attractive force and the decoupling from the local expansion of the Universe. This work extends the definition of a zero radial acceleration surface (ZRAS) and the turnaround surface (TS) for a general distribution of the masses in an expanding background, governed by the cosmological constant. We apply these definitions to different galaxy groups in the local Universe, mapping these groups up to ten megaparsec distances. We discuss the dipole and the quadrupole rate for the Local Group of Galaxies and the implementations on the Hubble diagram correction and galaxy groups virialization. With these definitions, we present the surfaces showing the interplay between the local expansion vs the local Newtonian attraction for galaxy groups in the local Universe. Further, we estimate the masses of different galaxy groups and show that the inclusion of the Cosmological Constant in the analysis predicts these masses to be higher by 5-10\%. For instance the Local Group of Galaxies is estimated to be $(2.47 \pm 0.08) \cdot 10^{12} M_{\odot}$. For the groups with enough tracers close to the TS, the contribution of the Cosmological Constant makes the masses to be even higher. The results show the importance of including the local cosmic expansion in analyzing the Cosmic Flow of the local Universe.</description>

      <title>A new parametrization of Hubble function and Hubble tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17212v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new Hubble parameterization method and employ observational data from Hubble, Pantheon, and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations to constrain model parameters. The proposed method is thoroughly validated against these datasets, demonstrating a robust fit to the observational data. The obtained best-fit values are $H_0 = 67.5^{+1.3}_{-1.6}$ $\text{km s}^{-1} \text{Mpc}^{-1}$, $\Omega_{\rm{m0}} = 0.2764\pm{0.0094}$, and $\alpha = 0.33\pm{0.22}$, consistent with the Planck 2018 results, highlighting the existence of Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>Explaining PTA Results by Metastable Cosmic Strings from SO(10) GUT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17014v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a recent paper (see https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.108.095053), we have demonstrated that the 2023 PTA results, which hint at a stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background at nanohertz frequencies, point towards a promising model-building route for realizing $SO(10)$ Grand Unification with embedded inflation. The proposed supersymmetric scenario solves the doublet-triplet splitting without fine-tuning, accounts for charged fermion and neutrino masses, avoids conflicts with current proton decay bounds, and includes only representations no larger than the adjoint. It features multi-step breaking of $SO(10)$ to the Standard Model gauge symmetry, with inflation embedded such that metastable cosmic strings are produced at the end of inflation. This cosmic string network generates a stochastic GW background that can explain the PTA results. In this paper, we provide a detailed analysis of the singled out GUT model class, focusing on how the gauge coupling unification condition affects the scales of multi-step $SO(10)$ breaking and the preferred GW spectra. The lowest breaking scale, linked to inflation, the generation of right-handed neutrino masses for the seesaw mechanism, and metastable cosmic string production, coincides with the range suggested by the PTA results.</description>
