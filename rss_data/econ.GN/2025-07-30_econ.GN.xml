      <title>Cash and Cognition: The Impact of Transfer Timing on Standardized Test Performance and Human Capital</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper shows that the timing of monetary transfers to low-income families affects students' cognitive performance on high-stakes standardized tests. We combine administrative records from the world's largest conditional cash transfer program with college admission exam results of 185,000 high school students from beneficiary families. Exploiting random variation in payment dates, we find that receiving the transfer in the days preceding the exam increases test scores by 0.01 standard deviations relative to receiving it the subsequent week. Question-level analysis reveals that effects are concentrated in final questions and easier questions, suggesting improved cognitive endurance and effort allocation. The impacts are largest for recipients of larger transfers, who experience persistent gains in human capital accumulation: their college enrollment increases by 0.6 percentage points, with higher graduation and formal employment rates seven years later. Our findings show that short-term liquidity constraints during high-stakes events can have long-lasting implications, and suggest opportunities to improve social programs through improved payment scheduling.</description>

      <title>From macro to micro: Economic complexity indicators for firm growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A rich theoretical and empirical literature investigated the link between export diversification and firm performance. Prior theoretical works hinted at the key role of capability accumulation in shaping production activities and performance, without however producing product-level indicators able to forecast corporate growth. Building on economic complexity theory and the corporate growth literature, this paper examines which characteristics of a firm's export basket predict future performance. We analyze a unique longitudinal dataset that covers export and financial data for 12,852 Italian firms. We find that firms exporting products typically exported by wealthier countries -- a proxy for greater product sophistication and market value -- tend to experience higher growth and profit per employee. Moreover, we find that diversification outside of a firm's core production area is positively associated with future growth, whereas diversification within the core is negatively associated. This is revealed by introducing novel measures of in-block and out-of-block diversification, based on algorithmically-detected production blocks. Our findings suggest that growth is driven not just by how many products a firm exports, but also by where these products lie within the production ecosystem, at both local and global scales.</description>

      <title>Markowitz Variance May Vastly Undervalue or Overestimate Portfolio Variance and Risks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the investor who doesn't trade shares of his portfolio. The investor only observes the current trades made in the market with his securities to estimate the current return, variance, and risks of his unchanged portfolio. We show how the time series of consecutive trades made in the market with the securities of the portfolio can determine the time series that model the trades with the portfolio as with a single security. That establishes the equal description of the market-based variance of the securities and of the portfolio composed of these securities that account for the fluctuations of the volumes of the consecutive trades. We show that Markowitz's (1952) variance describes only the approximation when all volumes of the consecutive trades with securities are assumed constant. The market-based variance depends on the coefficient of variation of fluctuations of volumes of trades. To emphasize this dependence and to estimate possible deviation from Markowitz variance, we derive the Taylor series of the market-based variance up to the 2nd term by the coefficient of variation, taking Markowitz variance as a zero approximation. We consider three limiting cases with low and high fluctuations of the portfolio returns, and with a zero covariance of trade values and volumes and show that the impact of the coefficient of variation of trade volume fluctuations can cause Markowitz's assessment to highly undervalue or overestimate the market-based variance of the portfolio. Incorrect assessments of the variances of securities and of the portfolio cause wrong risk estimates, disturb optimal portfolio selection, and result in unexpected losses. The major investors, portfolio managers, and developers of macroeconomic models like BlackRock, JP Morgan, and the U.S. Fed should use market-based variance to adjust their predictions to the randomness of market trades.</description>

      <title>Gender Similarities Dominate Mathematical Cognition at the Neural Level: A Japanese fMRI Study Using Advanced Wavelet Analysis and Generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent large scale behavioral studies suggest early emergence of gender differences in mathematical performance within months of school entry. However, these findings lack direct neural evidence and are constrained by cultural contexts. We conducted functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during mathematical tasks in Japanese participants (N = 156), employing an advanced wavelet time frequency analysis to examine dynamic brain processes rather than static activation patterns. Wavelet decomposition across four frequency bands (0.01-0.25 Hz) revealed that neural processing mechanisms underlying mathematical cognition are fundamentally similar between genders. Time frequency analysis demonstrated 89.1% similarity in dynamic activation patterns (p = 0.734, d = 0.05), with identical temporal sequences and frequency profiles during mathematical processing. Individual variation in neural dynamics exceeded group differences by 3.2:1 (p $&lt;$ 0.001). Machine learning classifiers achieved only 53.8% accuracy in distinguishing gender based neural patterns essentially at chance level even when analyzing sophisticated temporal spectral features. Cross frequency coupling analysis revealed similar network coordination patterns between genders, indicating shared fundamental cognitive architecture. These findings provide robust process level neural evidence that gender similarities dominate mathematical cognition, particularly in early developmental stages, challenging recent claims of inherent differences and demonstrating that dynamic brain analysis reveals neural mechanisms that static behavioral assessments cannot access.</description>

      <title>Efficacy of AI RAG Tools for Complex Information Extraction and Data Annotation Tasks: A Case Study Using Banks Public Disclosures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We utilize a within-subjects design with randomized task assignments to understand the effectiveness of using an AI retrieval augmented generation (RAG) tool to assist analysts with an information extraction and data annotation task. We replicate an existing, challenging real-world annotation task with complex multi-part criteria on a set of thousands of pages of public disclosure documents from global systemically important banks (GSIBs) with heterogeneous and incomplete information content. We test two treatment conditions. First, a "naive" AI use condition in which annotators use only the tool and must accept the first answer they are given. And second, an "interactive" AI treatment condition where annotators use the tool interactively, and use their judgement to follow-up with additional information if necessary. Compared to the human-only baseline, the use of the AI tool accelerated task execution by up to a factor of 10 and enhanced task accuracy, particularly in the interactive condition. We find that when extrapolated to the full task, these methods could save up to 268 hours compared to the human-only approach. Additionally, our findings suggest that annotator skill, not just with the subject matter domain, but also with AI tools, is a factor in both the accuracy and speed of task performance.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Equity: Overcoming the Gender Gap in VC Funding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14984v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the growing gender gap in venture capital funding, focusing on accelerator programs in the U.S. We collect a unique dataset with detailed information on accelerators and startups. Using a two-stage methodology, we first estimate a matching model between startups and accelerators, and then use its output to analyze the gender gap in post-graduation outcomes through a control function approach. Our results suggest that female-founded startups face a significant funding disadvantage due to relocation challenges tied to family obligations. However, larger cohorts and higher-quality accelerators help reduce this gap by potentially offering female founders better networking opportunities and mentorship.</description>
