      <title>Network geometry of the Drosophila brain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent reconstruction of the Drosophila brain provides a neural network of unprecedented size and level of details. In this work, we study the geometrical properties of this system by applying network embedding techniques to the graph of synaptic connections. Since previous analysis have revealed an inhomogeneous degree distribution, we first employ a hyperbolic embedding approach that maps the neural network onto a point cloud in the two-dimensional hyperbolic space. In general, hyperbolic embedding methods exploit the exponentially growing volume of hyperbolic space with increasing distance from the origin, allowing for an approximately uniform spatial distribution of nodes even in scale-free, small-world networks. By evaluating multiple embedding quality metrics, we find that the network structure is well captured by the resulting two-dimensional hyperbolic embedding, and in fact is more congruent with this representation than with the original neuron coordinates in three-dimensional Euclidean space. In order to examine the network geometry in a broader context, we also apply the well-known Euclidean network embedding approach Node2vec, where the dimension of the embedding space, $d$ can be set arbitrarily. In 3 dimensions, the Euclidean embedding of the network yields lower quality scores compared to the original neuron coordinates. However, as a function of the embedding dimension the scores show an improving tendency, surpassing the level of the 2d hyperbolic embedding roughly at $d=16$, and reaching a maximum around $d=64$. Since network embeddings can serve as valuable inputs for a variety of downstream machine learning tasks, our results offer new perspectives on the structure and representation of this recently revealed and biologically significant neural network.</description>

      <title>Mapping tuberculosis fatalities by region and age group in South Korea: A dataset for targeted health policy optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In South Korea, age-disaggregated tuberculosis (TB) data at the district level are not publicly available due to privacy constraints, limiting fine-scale analyses of healthcare accessibility. To address this limitation, we present a high-resolution, district-level dataset on tuberculosis (TB) fatalities and hospital accessibility in South Korea, covering the years 2014 to 2022 across 228 districts. The dataset is constructed using a reconstruction method that infers age-disaggregated TB cases and fatalities at the district level by integrating province-level age-specific statistics with district-level spatial and demographic data, enabling analyses that account for both spatial heterogeneity and age structure. Building on an existing hospital allocation framework, we extend the objective function to an age-weighted formulation and apply it to the reconstructed dataset to minimize TB fatalities under different age-weighting schemes. We demonstrate that incorporating age structure can give rise to distinct optimized hospital allocation patterns, even when the total number of minimized fatalities is similar, revealing trade-offs between efficiency and demographic targeting. In addition, the dataset supports temporal analyses of TB burden, hospital availability, and demographic variation over time, and provides a testbed for spatial epidemiology and optimization studies that require high-resolution demographic and healthcare data.</description>

      <title>Neutral species facilitate coexistence among cyclically competing species under birth and death processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Natural birth and death are fundamental mechanisms of population dynamics in ecosystems and have played pivotal roles in shaping population dynamics. Nevertheless, in studies of cyclic competition systems governed by the rock-paper-scissors (RPS) game, these mechanisms have often been ignored in analyses of biodiversity. On the other hand, given the prevalence and profound impact on biodiversity, understanding how higher-order interactions (HOIs) can affect biodiversity is one of the most challenging issues, and thus HOIs have been continuously studied for their effects on biodiversity in systems of cyclic competing populations, with a focus on neutral species. However, in real ecosystems, species can evolve and die naturally or be preyed upon by predators, whereas previous studies have considered only classic reaction rules among three species with a neutral, nonparticipant species. To identify how neutral species can affect the biodiversity of the RPS system when species' natural birth and death are assumed, we consider a model of neutral species in higher-order interactions within the spatial RPS system, assuming birth-and-death processes. Extensive simulations show that when neutral species interfere positively, they dominate the available space, thereby reducing the proportion of other species. Conversely, when the interference is harmful, the density of competing species increases. In addition, unlike traditional RPS dynamics, biodiversity can be effectively maintained even in high-mobility regimes. Our study reaffirms the critical role of neutral species in preserving biodiversity.</description>

      <title>Modeling Human Behavior in a Strategic Network Game with Complex Group Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03795v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Human networks greatly impact important societal outcomes, including wealth and health inequality, poverty, and bullying. As such, understanding human networks is critical to learning how to promote favorable societal outcomes. As a step toward better understanding human networks, we compare and contrast several methods for learning models of human behavior in a strategic network game called the Junior High Game (JHG) [39]. These modeling methods differ with respect to the assumptions they use to parameterize human behavior (behavior matching vs. community-aware behavior) and the moments they model (mean vs. distribution). Results show that the highest-performing method, called hCAB, models the distribution of human behavior rather than the mean and assumes humans use community-aware behavior rather than behavior matching. When applied to small societies, the hCAB model closely mirrors the population dynamics of human groups (with notable differences). Additionally, in a user study, human participants had difficulty distinguishing hCAB agents from other humans, thus illustrating that the hCAB model also produces plausible (individual) behavior in this strategic network game.</description>
