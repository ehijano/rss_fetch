      <title>Understanding and Scaling Collaborative Filtering Optimization from the Perspective of Matrix Rank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collaborative Filtering (CF) methods dominate real-world recommender systems given their ability to learn high-quality, sparse ID-embedding tables that effectively capture user preferences. These tables scale linearly with the number of users and items, and are trained to ensure high similarity between embeddings of interacted user-item pairs, while maintaining low similarity for non-interacted pairs. Despite their high performance, encouraging dispersion for non-interacted pairs necessitates expensive regularization (e.g., negative sampling), hurting runtime and scalability. Existing research tends to address these challenges by simplifying the learning process, either by reducing model complexity or sampling data, trading performance for runtime. In this work, we move beyond model-level modifications and study the properties of the embedding tables under different learning strategies. Through theoretical analysis, we find that the singular values of the embedding tables are intrinsically linked to different CF loss functions. These findings are empirically validated on real-world datasets, demonstrating the practical benefits of higher stable rank, a continuous version of matrix rank which encodes the distribution of singular values. Based on these insights, we propose an efficient warm-start strategy that regularizes the stable rank of the user and item embeddings. We show that stable rank regularization during early training phases can promote higher-quality embeddings, resulting in training speed improvements of up to 66%. Additionally, stable rank regularization can act as a proxy for negative sampling, allowing for performance gains of up to 21% over loss functions with small negative sampling ratios. Overall, our analysis unifies current CF methods under a new perspective, their optimization of stable rank, motivating a flexible regularization method.</description>

      <title>Demonstrating Linked Battery Data To Accelerate Knowledge Flow in Battery Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Batteries are pivotal for transitioning to a climate-friendly future, leading to a surge in battery research. Scopus (Elsevier) lists 14,388 papers that mention "lithium-ion battery" in 2023 alone, making it infeasible for individuals to keep up. This paper discusses strategies based on structured, semantic, and linked data to manage this information overload. Structured data follows a predefined, machine-readable format; semantic data includes metadata for context; linked data references other semantic data, forming a web of interconnected information. We use a battery-related ontology, BattINFO to standardise terms and enable automated data extraction and analysis. Our methodology integrates full-text search and machine-readable data, enhancing data retrieval and battery testing. We aim to unify commercial cell information and develop tools for the battery community such as manufacturer-independent cycling procedure descriptions and external memory for Large Language Models. Although only a first step, this approach significantly accelerates battery research and digitalizes battery testing, inviting community participation for continuous improvement. We provide the structured data and the tools to access them as open source.</description>

      <title>Towards Cross-Modal Text-Molecule Retrieval with Better Modality Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-modal text-molecule retrieval model aims to learn a shared feature space of the text and molecule modalities for accurate similarity calculation, which facilitates the rapid screening of molecules with specific properties and activities in drug design. However, previous works have two main defects. First, they are inadequate in capturing modality-shared features considering the significant gap between text sequences and molecule graphs. Second, they mainly rely on contrastive learning and adversarial training for cross-modality alignment, both of which mainly focus on the first-order similarity, ignoring the second-order similarity that can capture more structural information in the embedding space. To address these issues, we propose a novel cross-modal text-molecule retrieval model with two-fold improvements. Specifically, on the top of two modality-specific encoders, we stack a memory bank based feature projector that contain learnable memory vectors to extract modality-shared features better. More importantly, during the model training, we calculate four kinds of similarity distributions (text-to-text, text-to-molecule, molecule-to-molecule, and molecule-to-text similarity distributions) for each instance, and then minimize the distance between these similarity distributions (namely second-order similarity losses) to enhance cross-modal alignment. Experimental results and analysis strongly demonstrate the effectiveness of our model. Particularly, our model achieves SOTA performance, outperforming the previously-reported best result by 6.4%.</description>

      <title>Identify Then Recommend: Towards Unsupervised Group Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Group Recommendation (GR), which aims to recommend items to groups of users, has become a promising and practical direction for recommendation systems. This paper points out two issues of the state-of-the-art GR models. (1) The pre-defined and fixed number of user groups is inadequate for real-time industrial recommendation systems, where the group distribution can shift dynamically. (2) The training schema of existing GR methods is supervised, necessitating expensive user-group and group-item labels, leading to significant annotation costs. To this end, we present a novel unsupervised group recommendation framework named \underline{I}dentify \underline{T}hen \underline{R}ecommend (\underline{ITR}), where it first identifies the user groups in an unsupervised manner even without the pre-defined number of groups, and then two pre-text tasks are designed to conduct self-supervised group recommendation. Concretely, at the group identification stage, we first estimate the adaptive density of each user point, where areas with higher densities are more likely to be recognized as group centers. Then, a heuristic merge-and-split strategy is designed to discover the user groups and decision boundaries. Subsequently, at the self-supervised learning stage, the pull-and-repulsion pre-text task is proposed to optimize the user-group distribution. Besides, the pseudo group recommendation pre-text task is designed to assist the recommendations. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of ITR on both user recommendation (e.g., 22.22\% NDCG@5 $\uparrow$) and group recommendation (e.g., 22.95\% NDCG@5 $\uparrow$). Furthermore, we deploy ITR on the industrial recommender and achieve promising results.</description>

      <title>Beyond Content Relevance: Evaluating Instruction Following in Retrieval Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Instruction-following capabilities in large language models (LLMs) have significantly progressed, enabling more complex user interactions through detailed prompts. However, retrieval systems have not matched these advances, most of them still relies on traditional lexical and semantic matching techniques that fail to fully capture user intent. Recent efforts have introduced instruction-aware retrieval models, but these primarily focus on intrinsic content relevance, which neglects the importance of customized preferences for broader document-level attributes. This study evaluates the instruction-following capabilities of various retrieval models beyond content relevance, including LLM-based dense retrieval and reranking models. We develop InfoSearch, a novel retrieval evaluation benchmark spanning six document-level attributes: Audience, Keyword, Format, Language, Length, and Source, and introduce novel metrics -- Strict Instruction Compliance Ratio (SICR) and Weighted Instruction Sensitivity Evaluation (WISE) to accurately assess the models' responsiveness to instructions. Our findings reveal that while reranking models generally surpass retrieval models in instruction following, they still face challenges in handling certain attributes. Moreover, although instruction fine-tuning and increased model size lead to better performance, most models fall short of achieving comprehensive instruction compliance as assessed by our benchmark.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Large Language Models for Medical Information Extraction and Query Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a system that integrates large language models (LLMs) into the clinical trial retrieval process, enhancing the effectiveness of matching patients with eligible trials while maintaining information privacy and allowing expert oversight. We evaluate six LLMs for query generation, focusing on open-source and relatively small models that require minimal computational resources. Our evaluation includes two closed-source and four open-source models, with one specifically trained in the medical field and five general-purpose models. We compare the retrieval effectiveness achieved by LLM-generated queries against those created by medical experts and state-of-the-art methods from the literature. Our findings indicate that the evaluated models reach retrieval effectiveness on par with or greater than expert-created queries. The LLMs consistently outperform standard baselines and other approaches in the literature. The best performing LLMs exhibit fast response times, ranging from 1.7 to 8 seconds, and generate a manageable number of query terms (15-63 on average), making them suitable for practical implementation. Our overall findings suggest that leveraging small, open-source LLMs for clinical trials retrieval can balance performance, computational efficiency, and real-world applicability in medical settings.</description>

      <title>Investigating Bias in Political Search Query Suggestions by Relative Comparison with LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Search query suggestions affect users' interactions with search engines, which then influences the information they encounter. Thus, bias in search query suggestions can lead to exposure to biased search results and can impact opinion formation. This is especially critical in the political domain. Detecting and quantifying bias in web search engines is difficult due to its topic dependency, complexity, and subjectivity. The lack of context and phrasality of query suggestions emphasizes this problem. In a multi-step approach, we combine the benefits of large language models, pairwise comparison, and Elo-based scoring to identify and quantify bias in English search query suggestions. We apply our approach to the U.S. political news domain and compare bias in Google and Bing.</description>

      <title>Mind the Gap: A Generalized Approach for Cross-Modal Embedding Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enhance text generation by incorporating external knowledge but often struggle when retrieving context across different text modalities due to semantic gaps. We introduce a generalized projection-based method, inspired by adapter modules in transfer learning, that efficiently bridges these gaps between various text types, such as programming code and pseudocode, or English and French sentences. Our approach emphasizes speed, accuracy, and data efficiency, requiring minimal resources for training and inference. By aligning embeddings from heterogeneous text modalities into a unified space through a lightweight projection network, our model significantly outperforms traditional retrieval methods like the Okapi BM25 algorithm and models like Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR), while approaching the accuracy of Sentence Transformers. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our method across different tasks, highlighting its potential for real-time, resource-constrained applications.</description>

      <title>Unveiling User Satisfaction and Creator Productivity Trade-Offs in Recommendation Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On User-Generated Content (UGC) platforms, recommendation algorithms significantly impact creators' motivation to produce content as they compete for algorithmically allocated user traffic. This phenomenon subtly shapes the volume and diversity of the content pool, which is crucial for the platform's sustainability. In this work, we demonstrate, both theoretically and empirically, that a purely relevance-driven policy with low exploration strength boosts short-term user satisfaction but undermines the long-term richness of the content pool. In contrast, a more aggressive exploration policy may slightly compromise user satisfaction but promote higher content creation volume. Our findings reveal a fundamental trade-off between immediate user satisfaction and overall content production on UGC platforms. Building on this finding, we propose an efficient optimization method to identify the optimal exploration strength, balancing user and creator engagement. Our model can serve as a pre-deployment audit tool for recommendation algorithms on UGC platforms, helping to align their immediate objectives with sustainable, long-term goals.</description>

      <title>MoTaDual: Modality-Task Dual Alignment for Enhanced Zero-shot Composed Image Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) is a challenging vision-language task, utilizing bi-modal (image+text) queries to retrieve target images. Despite the impressive performance of supervised CIR, the dependence on costly, manually-labeled triplets limits its scalability and zero-shot capability. To address this issue, zero-shot composed image retrieval (ZS-CIR) is presented along with projection-based approaches. However, such methods face two major problems, i.e., task discrepancy between pre-training (image $\leftrightarrow$ text) and inference (image+text $\rightarrow$ image), and modality discrepancy. The latter pertains to approaches based on text-only projection training due to the necessity of feature extraction from the reference image during inference. In this paper, we propose a two-stage framework to tackle both discrepancies. First, to ensure efficiency and scalability, a textual inversion network is pre-trained on large-scale caption datasets. Subsequently, we put forward Modality-Task Dual Alignment (MoTaDual) as the second stage, where large-language models (LLMs) generate triplet data for fine-tuning, and additionally, prompt learning is introduced in a multi-modal context to effectively alleviate both modality and task discrepancies. The experimental results show that our MoTaDual achieves the state-of-the-art performance across four widely used ZS-CIR benchmarks, while maintaining low training time and computational cost. The code will be released soon.</description>

      <title>Auditing Google's Search Algorithm: Measuring News Diversity Across Brazil, the UK, and the US</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study examines the influence of Google's search algorithm on news diversity by analyzing search results in Brazil, the UK, and the US. It explores how Google's system preferentially favors a limited number of news outlets. Utilizing algorithm auditing techniques, the research measures source concentration with the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) and Gini coefficient, revealing significant concentration trends. The study underscores the importance of conducting horizontal analyses across multiple search queries, as focusing solely on individual results pages may obscure these patterns. Factors such as popularity, political bias, and recency were evaluated for their impact on news rankings. Findings indicate a slight leftward bias in search outcomes and a preference for popular, often national outlets. This bias, combined with a tendency to prioritize recent content, suggests that Google's algorithm may reinforce existing media inequalities. By analyzing the largest dataset to date -- 221,863 search results -- this research provides comprehensive, longitudinal insights into how algorithms shape public access to diverse news sources.</description>

      <title>Length-Induced Embedding Collapse in Transformer-based Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text embeddings enable various applications, but their performance deteriorates on longer texts. In this paper, we find that the performance degradation is due to a phenomenon called Length Collapse, where longer text embeddings collapse into a narrow space. This collapse results in a distributional inconsistency between embeddings of different text lengths, ultimately hurting the performance of downstream tasks. Theoretically, by considering the self-attention mechanism inherently functions as a low-pass filter, we prove that long sequences increase the attenuation rate of the low-pass filter effect of the self-attention mechanism. With layers going deeper, excessive low-pass filtering causes the token signals to retain only their Direct-Current (DC) component, which means the input token feature maps will collapse into a narrow space, especially in long texts. Based on the above analysis, we propose to mitigate the undesirable length collapse limitation by introducing a temperature in softmax(), which achieves a higher low-filter attenuation rate. The tuning-free method, called TempScale, can be plugged into multiple transformer-based embedding models. Empirically, we demonstrate that TempScale can improve existing embedding models, especially on long text inputs, bringing up to 0.53% performance gains on 40 datasets from Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) and 0.82% performance gains on 4 datasets from LongEmbed, which specifically focuses on long context retrieval.</description>

      <title>Recommendation Unlearning via Influence Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.02147v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recommendation unlearning is an emerging task to serve users for erasing unusable data (e.g., some historical behaviors) from a well-trained recommender model. Existing methods process unlearning requests by fully or partially retraining the model after removing the unusable data. However, these methods are impractical due to the high computation cost of full retraining and the highly possible performance damage of partial training. In this light, a desired recommendation unlearning method should obtain a similar model as full retraining in a more efficient manner, i.e., achieving complete, efficient and harmless unlearning.
  In this work, we propose a new Influence Function-based Recommendation Unlearning (IFRU) framework, which efficiently updates the model without retraining by estimating the influence of the unusable data on the model via the influence function. In the light that recent recommender models use historical data for both the constructions of the optimization loss and the computational graph (e.g., neighborhood aggregation), IFRU jointly estimates the direct influence of unusable data on optimization loss and the spillover influence on the computational graph to pursue complete unlearning. Furthermore, we propose an importance-based pruning algorithm to reduce the cost of the influence function. IFRU is harmless and applicable to mainstream differentiable models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IFRU achieves more than 250 times acceleration compared to retraining-based methods with recommendation performance comparable to full retraining. Codes are avaiable at https://github.com/baiyimeng/IFRU.</description>

      <title>End-to-end Learnable Clustering for Intent Learning in Recommendation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05975v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intent learning, which aims to learn users' intents for user understanding and item recommendation, has become a hot research spot in recent years. However, existing methods suffer from complex and cumbersome alternating optimization, limiting performance and scalability. To this end, we propose a novel intent learning method termed \underline{ELCRec}, by unifying behavior representation learning into an \underline{E}nd-to-end \underline{L}earnable \underline{C}lustering framework, for effective and efficient \underline{Rec}ommendation. Concretely, we encode user behavior sequences and initialize the cluster centers (latent intents) as learnable neurons. Then, we design a novel learnable clustering module to separate different cluster centers, thus decoupling users' complex intents. Meanwhile, it guides the network to learn intents from behaviors by forcing behavior embeddings close to cluster centers. This allows simultaneous optimization of recommendation and clustering via mini-batch data. Moreover, we propose intent-assisted contrastive learning by using cluster centers as self-supervision signals, further enhancing mutual promotion. Both experimental results and theoretical analyses demonstrate the superiority of ELCRec from six perspectives. Compared to the runner-up, ELCRec improves NDCG@5 by 8.9\% and reduces computational costs by 22.5\% on the Beauty dataset. Furthermore, due to the scalability and universal applicability, we deploy this method on the industrial recommendation system with 130 million page views and achieve promising results. The codes are available on GitHub (https://github.com/yueliu1999/ELCRec). A collection (papers, codes, datasets) of deep group recommendation/intent learning methods is available on GitHub (https://github.com/yueliu1999/Awesome-Deep-Group-Recommendation).</description>

      <title>Pistis-RAG: Enhancing Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Human Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00072v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: RAG systems face limitations when semantic relevance alone does not guarantee improved generation quality. This issue becomes particularly evident due to the sensitivity of large language models (LLMs) to the ordering of few-shot prompts, which can affect model performance. To address this challenge, aligning LLM outputs with human preferences using structured feedback, such as options to copy, regenerate, or dislike, offers a promising method for improvement. This feedback is applied to the entire list of inputs rather than giving specific ratings for individual documents, making it a Listwide Labels Learning-to-Rank task.
  To address this task, we propose Pistis-RAG, a new RAG framework designed with a content-centric approach to better align LLMs with human preferences. Pistis-RAG effectively utilizes human feedback, enhancing content ranking and generation quality. To validate our framework, we use public datasets to simulate human feedback, allowing us to evaluate and refine our method effectively. Experimental results indicate that Pistis-RAG improves alignment with human preferences relative to the baseline RAG system, showing a 6.06% increase in MMLU (English) and a 7.08% increase in C-EVAL (Chinese) accuracy metrics. These results highlight Pistis-RAG's effectiveness in overcoming the limitations associated with traditional RAG approaches.</description>

      <title>Breaking the Hourglass Phenomenon of Residual Quantization: Enhancing the Upper Bound of Generative Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21488v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative retrieval (GR) has emerged as a transformative paradigm in search and recommender systems, leveraging numeric-based identifier representations to enhance efficiency and generalization. Notably, methods like TIGER employing Residual Quantization-based Semantic Identifiers (RQ-SID), have shown significant promise in e-commerce scenarios by effectively managing item IDs. However, a critical issue termed the "\textbf{Hourglass}" phenomenon, occurs in RQ-SID, where intermediate codebook tokens become overly concentrated, hindering the full utilization of generative retrieval methods. This paper analyses and addresses this problem by identifying data sparsity and long-tailed distribution as the primary causes. Through comprehensive experiments and detailed ablation studies, we analyze the impact of these factors on codebook utilization and data distribution. Our findings reveal that the "Hourglass" phenomenon substantially impacts the performance of RQ-SID in generative retrieval. We propose effective solutions to mitigate this issue, thereby significantly enhancing the effectiveness of generative retrieval in real-world E-commerce applications.</description>

      <title>DTN: Deep Multiple Task-specific Feature Interactions Network for Multi-Task Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11611v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural-based multi-task learning (MTL) has been successfully applied to many recommendation applications. However, these MTL models (e.g., MMoE, PLE) did not consider feature interaction during the optimization, which is crucial for capturing complex high-order features and has been widely used in ranking models for real-world recommender systems. Moreover, through feature importance analysis across various tasks in MTL, we have observed an interesting divergence phenomenon that the same feature can have significantly different importance across different tasks in MTL. To address these issues, we propose Deep Multiple Task-specific Feature Interactions Network (DTN) with a novel model structure design. DTN introduces multiple diversified task-specific feature interaction methods and task-sensitive network in MTL networks, enabling the model to learn task-specific diversified feature interaction representations, which improves the efficiency of joint representation learning in a general setup. We applied DTN to our company's real-world E-commerce recommendation dataset, which consisted of over 6.3 billion samples, the results demonstrated that DTN significantly outperformed state-of-the-art MTL models. Moreover, during online evaluation of DTN in a large-scale E-commerce recommender system, we observed a 3.28% in clicks, a 3.10% increase in orders and a 2.70% increase in GMV (Gross Merchandise Value) compared to the state-of-the-art MTL models. Finally, extensive offline experiments conducted on public benchmark datasets demonstrate that DTN can be applied to various scenarios beyond recommendations, enhancing the performance of ranking models.</description>

      <title>Microstructures and Accuracy of Graph Recall by Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11821v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graphs data is crucial for many applications, and much of it exists in the relations described in textual format. As a result, being able to accurately recall and encode a graph described in earlier text is a basic yet pivotal ability that LLMs need to demonstrate if they are to perform reasoning tasks that involve graph-structured information. Human performance at graph recall has been studied by cognitive scientists for decades, and has been found to often exhibit certain structural patterns of bias that align with human handling of social relationships. To date, however, we know little about how LLMs behave in analogous graph recall tasks: do their recalled graphs also exhibit certain biased patterns, and if so, how do they compare with humans and affect other graph reasoning tasks? In this work, we perform the first systematical study of graph recall by LLMs, investigating the accuracy and biased microstructures (local structural patterns) in their recall. We find that LLMs not only underperform often in graph recall, but also tend to favor more triangles and alternating 2-paths. Moreover, we find that more advanced LLMs have a striking dependence on the domain that a real-world graph comes from -- by yielding the best recall accuracy when the graph is narrated in a language style consistent with its original domain.</description>

      <title>INDUS: Effective and Efficient Language Models for Scientific Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10725v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) trained on general domain corpora showed remarkable results on natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, previous research demonstrated LLMs trained using domain-focused corpora perform better on specialized tasks. Inspired by this insight, we developed INDUS, a comprehensive suite of LLMs tailored for the closely-related domains of Earth science, biology, physics, heliophysics, planetary sciences and astrophysics, and trained using curated scientific corpora drawn from diverse data sources. The suite of models include: (1) an encoder model trained using domain-specific vocabulary and corpora to address NLP tasks, (2) a contrastive-learning based text embedding model trained using a diverse set of datasets to address information retrieval tasks and (3) smaller versions of these models created using knowledge distillation for applications which have latency or resource constraints. We also created three new scientific benchmark datasets, CLIMATE-CHANGE NER (entity-recognition), NASA-QA (extractive QA) and NASA-IR (IR) to accelerate research in these multi-disciplinary fields. We show that our models outperform both general-purpose (RoBERTa) and domain-specific (SCIBERT) encoders on these new tasks as well as existing tasks in the domains of interest. Furthermore, we demonstrate the use of these models in two industrial settings -- as a retrieval model for large-scale vector search applications and in automatic content tagging systems.</description>

      <title>An engine not a camera: Measuring performative power of online search</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19073v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The power of digital platforms is at the center of major ongoing policy and regulatory efforts. To advance existing debates, we designed and executed an experiment to measure the performative power of online search providers. Instantiated in our setting, performative power quantifies the ability of a search engine to steer web traffic by rearranging results. To operationalize this definition we developed a browser extension that performs unassuming randomized experiments in the background. These randomized experiments emulate updates to the search algorithm and identify the causal effect of different content arrangements on clicks. Analyzing tens of thousands of clicks, we discuss what our robust quantitative findings say about the power of online search engines, using the Google Shopping antitrust investigation as a case study. More broadly, we envision our work to serve as a blueprint for how the recent definition of performative power can help integrate quantitative insights from online experiments with future investigations into the economic power of digital platforms.</description>

      <title>UDA: A Benchmark Suite for Retrieval Augmented Generation in Real-world Document Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15187v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The use of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has improved Large Language Models (LLMs) in collaborating with external data, yet significant challenges exist in real-world scenarios. In areas such as academic literature and finance question answering, data are often found in raw text and tables in HTML or PDF formats, which can be lengthy and highly unstructured. In this paper, we introduce a benchmark suite, namely Unstructured Document Analysis (UDA), that involves 2,965 real-world documents and 29,590 expert-annotated Q&amp;A pairs. We revisit popular LLM- and RAG-based solutions for document analysis and evaluate the design choices and answer qualities across multiple document domains and diverse query types. Our evaluation yields interesting findings and highlights the importance of data parsing and retrieval. We hope our benchmark can shed light and better serve real-world document analysis applications. The benchmark suite and code can be found at https://github.com/qinchuanhui/UDA-Benchmark.</description>

      <title>Modern Hopfield Networks meet Encoded Neural Representations -- Addressing Practical Considerations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16408v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Content-addressable memories such as Modern Hopfield Networks (MHN) have been studied as mathematical models of auto-association and storage/retrieval in the human declarative memory, yet their practical use for large-scale content storage faces challenges. Chief among them is the occurrence of meta-stable states, particularly when handling large amounts of high dimensional content. This paper introduces Hopfield Encoding Networks (HEN), a framework that integrates encoded neural representations into MHNs to improve pattern separability and reduce meta-stable states. We show that HEN can also be used for retrieval in the context of hetero association of images with natural language queries, thus removing the limitation of requiring access to partial content in the same domain. Experimental results demonstrate substantial reduction in meta-stable states and increased storage capacity while still enabling perfect recall of a significantly larger number of inputs advancing the practical utility of associative memory networks for real-world tasks.</description>
