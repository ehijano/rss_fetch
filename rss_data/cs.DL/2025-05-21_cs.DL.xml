      <title>From Metadata to Storytelling: A Framework For 3D Cultural Heritage Visualization on RDF Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a pipeline for integrating semantic metadata, 3D models, and storytelling, enhancing cultural heritage digitization. Using the Aldrovandi Digital Twin case study, it outlines a reusable workflow combining RDF-driven narratives and data visualization for creating interactive experiences to facilitate access to cultural heritage.</description>

      <title>PANDAVA: Semantic and Reflexive Protocol for Interdisciplinary and Cognitive Knowledge Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern science faces the need to move from linear systematic review protocols to deeper cognitive navigation across fields of knowledge. In this context, the PANDAVA protocol (Protocol for Analysis and Navigation of Deep Argumentative and Valued Knowledge) is designed for analysing the semantic structures of scientific knowledge. It combines semantic mapping, assessment of concept maturity, clustering, and generation of new hypotheses. PANDAVA is interpreted as the first interdisciplinary protocol for knowledge systematization focused on semantic and cognitive mapping. The PANDAVA protocol integrates quantitative analysis methods with reflective procedures for comprehending the structure of knowledge and is applied in interdisciplinary, theoretically saturated fields where traditional models such as PRISMA prove insufficient. As an example, the protocol was applied to analyse the abiogenesis hypotheses. Modelling demonstrated how to structure theories of the origin of life through the integration of data on microlight, turbulent processes, and geochemical sources. PANDAVA enables researchers to identify strong and weak concepts, construct knowledge maps, and develop new hypotheses. Overall, PANDAVA represents a cognitively enriched tool for meaningful knowledge management, fostering the transition from the representation of facts to the design of new scientific paradigms.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Keyphrase Extraction from Academic Articles Using Section Structure Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The exponential increase in academic papers has significantly increased the time required for researchers to access relevant literature. Keyphrase Extraction (KPE) offers a solution to this situation by enabling researchers to efficiently retrieve relevant literature. The current study on KPE from academic articles aims to improve the performance of extraction models through innovative approaches using Title and Abstract as input corpora. However, the semantic richness of keywords is significantly constrained by the length of the abstract. While full-text-based KPE can address this issue, it simultaneously introduces noise, which significantly diminishes KPE performance. To address this issue, this paper utilized the structural features and section texts obtained from the section structure information of academic articles to extract keyphrase from academic papers. The approach consists of two main parts: (1) exploring the effect of seven structural features on KPE models, and (2) integrating the extraction results from all section texts used as input corpora for KPE models via a keyphrase integration algorithm to obtain the keyphrase integration result. Furthermore, this paper also examined the effect of the classification quality of section structure on the KPE performance. The results show that incorporating structural features improves KPE performance, though different features have varying effects on model efficacy. The keyphrase integration approach yields the best performance, and the classification quality of section structure can affect KPE performance. These findings indicate that using the section structure information of academic articles contributes to effective KPE from academic articles.
