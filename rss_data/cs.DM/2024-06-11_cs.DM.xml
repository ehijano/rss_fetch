      <title>Open Packing in Graphs: Bounds and Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a graph $G(V,E)$, a vertex subset S of G is called an open packing in G if no pair of distinct vertices in S have a common neighbour in G. The size of a largest open packing in G is called the open packing number of G and is denoted by $\rho^o(G)$. It would be interesting to note that the open packing number is a lower bound for the total domination number in graphs with no isolated vertices [Henning and Slater, 1999]. Given a graph G and a positive integer k, the decision problem OPEN PACKING tests whether G has an open packing of size at least k. The optimization problem MAX-OPEN PACKING takes a graph G as input and finds the open packing number of G. It is known that OPEN PACKING is NP-complete on split graphs (i.e., the class of $\{2K_2,C_4,C_5\}$-free graphs) [Ramos et al., 2014]. In this work, we complete the study on the complexity (P vs NPC) of OPEN PACKING on H-free graphs for every graph H with at least three vertices by proving that OPEN PACKING is (i) NP-complete on $K_{1,3}$-free graphs and (ii) polynomial time solvable on $(P_4\cup rK_1)$-free graphs for every $r\geq 1$. In the course of proving (ii), we show that for every $t\in {2,3,4}$ and $r\geq 1$, if G is a $(P_t\cup rK_1)$-free graph, then $\rho^o(G)$ is bounded above by a linear function of r. Moreover, we show that OPEN PACKING parameterized by solution size is W[1]-complete on $K_{1,3}$-free graphs and MAX-OPEN PACKING is hard to approximate within a factor of $n^{(\frac{1}{2}-\delta)}$ for any $\delta&gt;0$ on $K_{1,3}$-free graphs unless P=NP. Further, we prove that OPEN PACKING is (a) NP-complete on $K_{1,4}$-free split graphs and (b) polynomial time solvable on $K_{1,3}$-free split graphs. We prove a similar dichotomy result on split graphs with degree restrictions on the vertices in the independent set of the clique-independent set partition of the split graphs.</description>

      <title>Topological Expressivity of ReLU Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11130v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the expressivity of ReLU neural networks in the setting of a binary classification problem from a topological perspective. Recently, empirical studies showed that neural networks operate by changing topology, transforming a topologically complicated data set into a topologically simpler one as it passes through the layers. This topological simplification has been measured by Betti numbers, which are algebraic invariants of a topological space. We use the same measure to establish lower and upper bounds on the topological simplification a ReLU neural network can achieve with a given architecture. We therefore contribute to a better understanding of the expressivity of ReLU neural networks in the context of binary classification problems by shedding light on their ability to capture the underlying topological structure of the data. In particular the results show that deep ReLU neural networks are exponentially more powerful than shallow ones in terms of topological simplification. This provides a mathematically rigorous explanation why deeper networks are better equipped to handle complex and topologically rich data sets.</description>

      <title>Data mining method of single-cell omics data to evaluate a pure tissue environmental effect on gene expression level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While single-cell RNA-seq enables the investigation of the celltype effect on the transcriptome, the pure tissue environmental effect has not been well investigated. The bias in the combination of tissue and celltype in the body made it difficult to evaluate the effect of pure tissue environment by omics data mining. It is important to prevent statistical confounding among discrete variables such as celltype, tissue, and other categorical variables when evaluating the effects of these variables. We propose a novel method to enumerate suitable analysis units of variables for estimating the effects of tissue environment by extending the maximal biclique enumeration problem for bipartite graphs to $k$-partite hypergraphs. We applied the proposed method to a large mouse single-cell transcriptome dataset of Tabala Muris Senis to evaluate pure tissue environmental effects on gene expression. Data Mining using the proposed method revealed pure tissue environment effects on gene expression and its age-related change among adipose sub-tissues. The method proposed in this study helps evaluations of the effects of discrete variables in exploratory data mining of large-scale genomics datasets.</description>

      <title>Constructions, bounds, and algorithms for peaceable queens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The peaceable queens problem asks to determine the maximum number $a(n)$ such that there is a placement of $a(n)$ white queens and $a(n)$ black queens on an $n \times n$ chessboard so that no queen can capture any queen of the opposite color.
  In this paper, we consider the peaceable queens problem and its variant on the toroidal board. For the toroidal board, we provide new upper and lower bounds. Somewhat surprisingly, our bounds show that there is a sharp contrast in behaviour between the odd torus and the even torus. Our lower bounds are given by explicit constructions. For the upper bounds, we formulate the problem as a quadratic optimization problem with at most $70$ variables, regardless of the size of the board. We solve our quadratic program exactly using modern optimization software. Our method is quite robust. For example, with very minor changes, it also provides upper bounds for the regular board. In particular, we show that $a(n) \leq 0.1641n^2$, for all $n$. This improves on the bound $a(n) \leq 0.25n^2$ of van Bommel and MacEachern.
  We also provide a local search algorithm and a software implementation which converges very rapidly to solutions which appear optimal. Our algorithm is sufficiently robust that it works on both the classical and toroidal boards. For example, for the classical board, the algorithm quickly finds the so-called Ainley construction. Thus, our work provides some further evidence that the Ainley construction is indeed optimal.</description>

      <title>Fast Adaptive Meta-Heuristic for Large-Scale Facility Location Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Facility location problems have been a major research area of interest in the last several decades. In particular, uncapacitated location problems (ULP) have enormous applications. Variations of ULP often appear, especially as large-scale subproblems in more complex combinatorial optimization problems. Although many researchers have studied different versions of ULP (e.g., uncapacitated facility location problem (UCFLP) and p-Median problem), most of these authors have considered small to moderately sized problems. In this paper, we address the ULP and provide a fast adaptive meta-heuristic for large-scale problems. The approach is based on critical event memory tabu search. For the diversification component of the algorithm, we have chosen a procedure based on a sequencing problem commonly used for traveling salesman-type problems. The efficacy of this approach is evaluated across a diverse range of benchmark problems sourced from the Internet, with a comprehensive comparison against four prominent algorithms in the literature. The proposed adaptive critical event tabu search (ACETS) demonstrates remarkable effectiveness for large-scale problems. The algorithm successfully solved all problems optimally within a short computing time. Notably, ACETS discovered three best new solutions for benchmark problems, specifically for Asymmetric 500A-1, Asymmetric 750A-1, and Symmetric 750B-4, underscoring its innovative and robust nature.</description>

      <title>Hardness of busy beaver value BB(15)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.12475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.12475v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The busy beaver value BB(n) is the maximum number of steps made by any n-state, 2-symbol deterministic halting Turing machine starting on blank tape. The busy beaver function $n \mapsto \text{BB}(n)$ is uncomputable and, from below, only 4 of its values, BB(1) ... BB(4), are known to date. This leads one to ask: from above, what is the smallest BB value that encodes a major mathematical challenge? Knowing BB(4,888) has been shown by Yedidia and Aaronson [28] to be at least as hard as solving Goldbach's conjecture, with a subsequent improvement, as yet unpublished, to BB(27) [4,1]. We prove that knowing BB(15) is at least as hard as solving the following Collatz-related conjecture by Erd\H{o}s, open since 1979 [9]: for all n &gt; 8 there is at least one digit 2 in the base 3 representation of $2^n$. We do so by constructing an explicit 15-state, 2-symbol Turing machine that halts if and only if the conjecture is false. This 2-symbol Turing machine simulates a conceptually simpler 5-state, 4-symbol machine which we construct first. This makes, to date, BB(15) the smallest busy beaver value that is related to a natural open problem in mathematics, bringing to light one of the many challenges underlying the quest of knowing busy beaver values.</description>

      <title>Limiting Moments of Autocorrelation Demerit Factors of Binary Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.14566v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An aperiodic binary sequence of length $\ell$ is a doubly infinite sequence $f=\ldots,f_{-1},f_0,f_1,\ldots$ with $f_j \in \{-1,1\}$ when $0 \leq j &lt; \ell$ and and $f_j=0$ otherwise. Various problems in engineering and natural science demand binary sequences that do not resemble translates of themselves. The autocorrelation of $f$ at shift $s$ is the dot product of $f$ with the sequence obtained by translating $f$ by $s$ places. The demerit factor of $f$ is the sum of the squares of the autocorrelations at all nonzero shifts for the sequence obtained by normalizing $f$ to unit Euclidean norm. Low demerit factor therefore indicates low self-similarity under translation. We endow the $2^\ell$ binary sequences of length $\ell$ with uniform probability measure and consider the distribution of their demerit factors. Earlier works used combinatorial techniques to find exact formulas for the mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis of the distribution as a function of $\ell$. These revealed that for $\ell \geq 4$, the $p$th central moment of this distribution is strictly positive for every $p \geq 2$. This article shows that every $p$th central moment is a quasi-polynomial function of $\ell$ with rational coefficients divided by $\ell^{2 p}$. It also shows that, in the limit as $\ell$ tends to infinity, the $p$th standardized moment is the same as that of the standard normal distribution.</description>
