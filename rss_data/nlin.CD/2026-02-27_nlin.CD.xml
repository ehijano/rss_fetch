      <title>Interplay of Nonsmoothness, Time Delay, and Stochasticity in Turning Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stochastic dynamics of orthogonal metal cutting with both regenerative and nonsmooth frictional effects are investigated numerically in this paper. The shortcomings of neglecting nonsmoothness in frictional and stochastic effects in modeling the dynamics of such a machining process are demonstrated. Dynamics of the tool motion is observed to exhibit rich nonlinear phenomena such as stick-slip during chatter, with stochastic perturbations in cutting forces adding further complexity, leading to the occurrence of stochastic P and D bifurcations. Measures of entropy are found to be effective in quantifying the dynamical transitions occurring in the dynamics of the tool. Subsequently, basin stability analyses, modified to account for stochasticity and time-delays, are carried out to systematically investigate the dynamics of the cutting tool across multiple surface roughness profiles of the workpiece. Basin stability analyses indicate that chatter can be controlled by restricting initial tool displacement and controlling initial workpiece surface roughness, suggesting practical strategies to improve machining outcomes for precision manufacturing.</description>

      <title>Partial Reversibility and Counterdiabatic Driving in Nearly Integrable Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adiabatic (or reversible) processes are the key concept unifying our understanding of thermodynamics and dynamical systems. Reversibility in the thermodynamic sense is understood as entropy-preserving processes, such as in the idealized Carnot engine, whereas in integrable dynamical systems it is understood as the conservation of the action variables. Between these two idealized limits, however, where the phase space can become mixed, things are much less clear. In this work, we first determine the extent to which reversible processes are even possible in this regime. We then explore how the dissipative losses resulting from rapidly driving these kinds of systems can be fought by approximate counterdiabatic driving. Finally, we argue that much of the phenomenology should be the same for quantum many-body systems with large degeneracy in the presence of integrability breaking perturbations.</description>

      <title>Resonant grazing bifurcations revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In vibro-impact mechanics, the division between an impact and a near miss is a zero-velocity grazing event. Grazing bifurcations of stable periodic motions often produce complicated attractors when grazing generates a square-root term in the Poincar\'e map. This paper concerns codimension-two scenarios for which the square-root term vanishes in some iterate of the Poincar\'e map. For forced one-degree-of-freedom oscillators, this occurs when the forcing frequency is a certain rational multiple of the damped natural frequency, i.e., the system is in resonance. In two-parameter bifurcation diagrams, curves of saddle-node and period-doubling bifurcations of single-impact periodic motions emanate from the codimension-two points. In this paper we prove these curves are quadratically tangent to the curve of grazing bifurcations, and derive explicit formulas for their quadratic coefficients. This is achieved by modifying the Poincar\'e map in a way that circumvents the square-root singularity, enabling us to use the implicit function theorem to demonstrate smoothness and perform asymptotic calculations of the saddle-node and period-doubling bifurcation curves. In doing so we resolve a long-standing conjecture on the admissibility of single-impact periodic motions by supplementing raw asymptotic computations with geometric and topological arguments. We illustrate the results with a linear impact oscillator model, matching the theoretical unfolding to numerically computed bifurcation curves. The results explain why previously reported physical experiments reveal an absence of chaos shortly past the grazing bifurcation.</description>

      <title>From synthetic turbulence to true solutions: A deep diffusion model for discovering periodic orbits in the Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence has shown remarkable success in synthesizing data that mimic complex real-world systems, but its potential role in the discovery of mathematically meaningful structures in physical models remains underexplored. In this work, we demonstrate how a generative diffusion model can be used to uncover previously unknown solutions of a nonlinear partial differential equation: the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations in a turbulent regime. Trained on data from a direct numerical simulation of turbulence, the model learns to generate time series that resemble physically plausible trajectories. By carefully modifying the temporal structure of the model and enforcing the symmetries of the governing equations, we produce synthetic trajectories that are periodic in time, despite the fact that the training data did not contain periodic trajectories. These synthetic trajectories are then refined into true solutions using an iterative solver, yielding 111 new periodic orbits (POs) with very short periods. Our results reveal a previously unobserved richness in the PO structure of this system and suggest a broader role for generative AI: not as replacements for simulation and existing solvers, but as a complementary tool for navigating the complex solution spaces of nonlinear dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Ruelle-Pollicott resonances of diffusive U(1)-invariant qubit circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24097v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study Ruelle-Pollicott resonances of translationally invariant magnetization-conserving qubit circuits via the spectrum of the quasi-momentum-resolved truncated propagator of extensive observables. Diffusive transport of the conserved magnetization is reflected in the Gaussian quasi-momentum $k$ dependence of the leading eigenvalue (Ruelle-Pollicott resonance) of the truncated propagator for small $k$. This, in particular, allows us to extract the diffusion constant. For large $k$, the leading Ruelle-Pollicott resonance is not related to transport and governs the exponential decay of correlation functions. Additionally, we conjecture the existence of a continuum of eigenvalues below the leading diffusive resonance, which governs non-exponential decay, for instance, power-law hydrodynamic tails. We expect our conclusions to hold for generic systems with exactly one U(1) conserved quantity.</description>

      <title>Inverse problems for dynamic patterns in coupled oscillator networks: When larger networks are simpler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21942v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Networks of coupled phase oscillators are one of the most studied dynamical systems with numerous applications in physics, chemistry, biology, and engineering. Their behaviour is often characterized by the emergence of various partially synchronized dynamic patterns, which in the case of large networks can be analysed using a variant of the mean-field approach. This method allows to predict what type of network dynamics can be observed for different system parameters. But it is less known that for different partially synchronized patterns it also allows to obtain statistical equilibrium relations that express the dependence of some time-averaged observable quantities of individual oscillators on the internal parameters of these oscillators and the interaction functions between them. In this paper, we show how such relations can be derived, what their typical accuracy is for finite-size networks, and how they can be used to reconstruct the parameters of the corresponding model. The proposed method is particularly effective for large networks, for unevenly sampled or noisy observables, and for partial observations. Its possibilities are demonstrated by application to chimera states in networks of phase oscillator with nonlocal coupling. The extension of the method to other systems with all-to-all and random network topologies is also described.</description>
