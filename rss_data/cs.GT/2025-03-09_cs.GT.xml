      <title>Using "Failure Costs" to Guarantee Execution Quality in Competitive and Permissionless Order Flow Auctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of decentralized blockchains, accurately simulating the outcome of order flow auctions (OFAs) off-chain is challenging due to adversarial sequencing, encrypted bids, and frequent state changes. Existing approaches, such as deterministic sorting via consensus layer modifications (e.g., MEV taxes) (Robinson and White 2024) and BRAID (Resnick 2024) or atomic execution of aggregated bids (e.g., Atlas) (Watts et al. 2024), remain vulnerable in permissionless settings where limited throughput allows rational adversaries to submit "spoof" bids that block their competitors' access to execution. We propose a new failure cost penalty that applies only when a solution is executed but does not pay its bid or fulfill the order. Combined with an on-chain escrow system, this mechanism empowers applications to asynchronously issue their users a guaranteed minimum outcome before the execution results are finalized. It implies a direct link between blockchain throughput, censorship resistance, and the capital efficiency of auction participants (e.g., solvers), which intuitively extends to execution quality. At equilibrium, bids fully reflect the potential for price improvement between bid submission and execution, but only partially reflect the potential for price declines. This asymmetry unbounded upside for winning bids, limited downside for failed bids, and no loss for losing bids - ultimately benefits users.</description>

      <title>On Almost Fair and Equitable Allocations of Indivisible Items for Non-monotone Valuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we revisit well-studied problems of fair allocation of indivisible items among agents with general, non-monotone valuations. We explore the existence and efficient computation of allocations that satisfy either fairness or equity constraints. The fairness notions we consider ensure that each agent values her bundle at least as much as others', allowing for (any or some) item removal, while the equity guarantees roughly equal valuations among agents, with similar adjustments. For objective valuations where items are classified as either goods or chores, we present a pseudo-polynomial local-search algorithm computing an ``equitable-up-to-any-good-or-any-chore'' (EQX*) allocation, a weaker version of an ``equitable-up-to-any-item" (EQX) allocation. Additionally, we provide a polynomial-time greedy algorithm that computes an ``equitable-up-to-one-item" (EQ1) allocation, and a similar algorithm returning an EQX* allocation when the valuations are also additive. As a key technical contribution of this work, by leveraging fixed-point theorems (such as Sperner's Lemma and its variants), we establish the existence of ``equitable-up-to-one-good-and-one-chore'' (EQ1*) and ``envy-free-up-to-one-good-and-one-chore'' (EF1*) allocations for non-negative (and possibly non-objective and non-monotone) valuations. This holds even when items are arranged in a path and bundles must form connected sub-paths. Additionally, we present a polynomial-time dynamic-programming algorithm that computes an EQ1* allocation. Finally, we extend the EF1* and EQ1* results to non-positive valuations using a novel multi-coloring variant of Sperner's lemma, a combinatorial result of independent interest. For monotone non-increasing valuations and path-connected bundles, this implies the existence of EF1 and EQ1 allocations, with EQ1 allocations being efficiently computable.</description>

      <title>Games with $\omega$-Automatic Preference Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates Nash equilibria (NEs) in multi-player turn-based games on graphs, where player preferences are modeled as $\omega$-automatic relations via deterministic parity automata. Unlike much of the existing literature, which focuses on specific reward functions, our results apply to any preference relation definable by an $\omega$-automatic relation. We analyze the computational complexity of determining the existence of an NE (possibly under some constraints), verifying whether a given strategy profile forms an NE, and checking whether a specific outcome can be realized by an NE. Finally, we explore fundamental properties of $\omega$-automatic relations and their implications in the existence of equilibria and finite-memory strategies.</description>

      <title>Framing the Game: How Context Shapes LLM Decision-Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across diverse contexts to support decision-making. While existing evaluations effectively probe latent model capabilities, they often overlook the impact of context framing on perceived rational decision-making. In this study, we introduce a novel evaluation framework that systematically varies evaluation instances across key features and procedurally generates vignettes to create highly varied scenarios. By analyzing decision-making patterns across different contexts with the same underlying game structure, we uncover significant contextual variability in LLM responses. Our findings demonstrate that this variability is largely predictable yet highly sensitive to framing effects. Our results underscore the need for dynamic, context-aware evaluation methodologies for real-world deployments.</description>

      <title>Statistical Inference and A/B Testing in Fisher Markets and Paced Auctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15522v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We initiate the study of statistical inference and A/B testing for two market equilibrium models: linear Fisher market (LFM) equilibrium and first-price pacing equilibrium (FPPE). LFM arises from fair resource allocation systems such as allocation of food to food banks and notification opportunities to different types of notifications. For LFM, we assume that the data observed is captured by the classical finite-dimensional Fisher market equilibrium, and its steady-state behavior is modeled by a continuous limit Fisher market. The second type of equilibrium we study, FPPE, arises from internet advertising where advertisers are constrained by budgets and advertising opportunities are sold via first-price auctions. For platforms that use pacing-based methods to smooth out the spending of advertisers, FPPE provides a hindsight-optimal configuration of the pacing method. We propose a statistical framework for the FPPE model, in which a continuous limit FPPE models the steady-state behavior of the auction platform, and a finite FPPE provides the data to estimate primitives of the limit FPPE. Both LFM and FPPE have an Eisenberg-Gale convex program characterization, the pillar upon which we derive our statistical theory. We start by deriving basic convergence results for the finite market to the limit market. We then derive asymptotic distributions, and construct confidence intervals. Furthermore, we establish the asymptotic local minimax optimality of estimation based on finite markets. We then show that the theory can be used for conducting statistically valid A/B testing on auction platforms. Synthetic and semi-synthetic experiments verify the validity and practicality of our theory.</description>

      <title>Cued to Queue: Information in Waiting-Line Auctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19553v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the effect of providing information to agents who queue before a scarce good is distributed at a fixed time. When agents have quasi-linear utility in time spent waiting, they choose entry times as they would bids in a descending auction. An information designer can influence their behavior by providing updates about the length of the queue. Many natural information policies release "sudden bad news," which occurs when agents learn that the queue is longer than previously believed. We show that sudden bad news can cause assortative inefficiency by prompting a mass of agents to simultaneously attempt to join the queue. As a result, if the value distribution has an increasing (decreasing) hazard rate, information policies that release sudden bad news increase (decrease) total surplus, relative to releasing no information. When agents face entry costs to join the queue and the value distribution has a decreasing hazard rate, an information designer maximizes total surplus by announcing only when the queue is full.</description>
