      <title>Cartesian closedness of the category of real-valued sets, I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $[0,1]_*$ be the unit interval $[0,1]$ equipped with a continuous t-norm $*$. It is shown that the category of $[0,1]_*$-sets is cartesian closed if, and only if, $*$ is the minimum t-norm on $[0,1]$.</description>

      <title>From Abelianization to Tangent Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A tangent category is a category with an endofunctor, called the tangent bundle functor, which is equipped with various natural transformations that capture essential properties of the classical tangent bundle of smooth manifolds. In this paper, we show that, surprisingly, the category of groups is a tangent category whose tangent bundle functor is induced by abelianization and whose differential bundles correspond to abelian groups. We generalize this construction by introducing the concept of linear assignments, which are endofunctors assigning to every object a commutative monoid in a natural and idempotent manner. We then show that a linear assignment induces a tangent bundle functor, whose differential bundles correspond to a notion of linear algebras. We show that any finitely cocomplete regular unital category is a tangent category whose tangent bundle functor is induced by the canonical abelianization functor, which is a monadic linear assignment. This allows us to provide multiple new examples of tangent categories including monoids, pointed magmas, loops, non-unital rings, J\'onsson--Tarski varieties, and pointed Mal'tsev varieties.</description>

      <title>Measuring Comodules and Enrichment</title>

      <description>arXiv:1703.10137v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper extends the theory of universal measuring comonoids to modules and comodules in braided monoidal categories. We generalise the universal measuring comodule Q(M,N), originally introduced for modules over k-algebras when k is a field, to arbitrary braided monoidal categories. In order to establish its existence, we prove a representability theorem for presheaves on opfibred categories and an adjoint functor theorem for opfibred functors. The global categories of modules and comodules, fibred and opfibred over monoids and comonoids respectively, are shown to exhibit an enrichment of modules in comodules. Additionally, we use our framework to study higher derivations of algebras and modules, defining along the way the non-commutative Hasse-Schmidt algebra.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Algebras and a Classification of Metric Monads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.01565v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantitative algebras are $\Sigma$-algebras acting on metric spaces, where operations are nonexpanding. Mardare, Panangaden and Plotkin introduced 1-basic varieties as categories of quantitative algebras presented by quantitative equations. We prove that for the category $\mathsf{UMet}$ of ultrametric spaces such varieties bijectively correspond to strongly finitary monads on $\mathsf{UMet}$. The same holds for the category $\mathsf{Met}$ of metric spaces, provided that strongly finitary endofunctors are closed under composition.
  For uncountable cardinals $\lambda$ there is an analogous bijection between varieties of $\lambda$-ary quantitative algebras and monads that are strongly $\lambda$-accessible. Moreover, we present a bijective correspondence between $\lambda$-basic varieties as introduced by Mardare et al and enriched, surjections-preserving $\lambda$-accesible monads on $\mathsf{Met}$. Finally, for general enriched $\lambda$-accessible monads on $\mathsf{Met}$ a bijective correspondence to generalized varieties is presented.</description>

      <title>Galois theory of differential schemes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21147v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since 1883, Picard-Vessiot theory had been developed as the Galois theory of differential field extensions associated to linear differential equations. Inspired by categorical Galois theory of Janelidze, and by using novel methods of precategorical descent applied to algebraic-geometric situations, we develop a Galois theory that applies to morphisms of differential schemes, and vastly generalises the linear Picard-Vessiot theory, as well as the strongly normal theory of Kolchin.</description>

      <title>Non-Hausdorff manifolds over locally ordered spaces via sheaf theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12087v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Locally ordered spaces can be used as topological models of concurrent programs: in that setting, the local order models the irreversibility of time during execution. Under certain conditions, one can even work with locally ordered manifolds. In this paper, we build the universal euclidean local order over every locally ordered space; in categorical terms, the subcategory of euclidean local orders is coreflective in the category of locally ordered spaces. Then we give conditions to ensure that it preserves the execution traces of the corresponding program. Our construction is based on a well-known correspondance between sheaves on a space and \'etale bundles over this space. This is a far reaching generalization of a result about realizations of graph products. We particularize the construction to locally ordered realization of precubical sets, and show that it admits a purely combinatorial description. With the same proof techniques, we show that, unlike for the topological realization, there is a unique precubical set whose locally ordered realization is isomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^n$.</description>
