      <title>Tethered Balloons for Radio Detection of Neutrinos?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The long-duration balloon platform for radio detection of energetic neutrinos, pioneered by ANITA, affords large instantaneous effective areas but has limited livetime. Conversely, tethered balloons, traditionally used for radio detection of non-science objectives (such as electronic surveillance), allow for much longer livetimes, albeit at significantly lower altitudes. In this contribution, a tethered balloon platform for neutrino detection is considered, including estimates of the neutrino sensitivity and a discussion the feasibility of such a platform. Both the Askaryan and tau-neutrino induced Extensive Air Shower channels are explored as target science data for the platform. Tethered balloons locations on ice sheets, land, and in steep valleys or fjords will be considered. Ground-based array calibration and cosmic-ray air shower use cases will also be briefly commented on.</description>

      <title>Influence of a continuous plane gravitational wave on Gaia-like astrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A gravitational wave (GW) passing through an astrometric observer causes periodic shifts of the apparent star positions measured by the observer. For a GW of sufficient amplitude and duration, and of suitable frequency, these shifts might be detected with a Gaia-like astrometric telescope. This paper aims to analyse in detail the effects of GWs on an astrometric solution based on Gaia-like observations, which are one-dimensional, strictly differential between two widely separated fields of view and following a prescribed scanning law. We present a simple geometric model for the astrometric effects of a plane GW in terms of the time-dependent positional shifts. Using this model, the general interaction between the GW and a Gaia-like observation is discussed. Numerous Gaia-like astrometric solutions are made, taking as input simulated observations that include the effects of a continuous plain GW with constant parameters and periods ranging from ~50 days to 100 years. The resulting solutions are analysed in terms of the systematic errors on astrometric and attitude parameters, as well as the observational residuals. It is found that a significant part of the GW signal is absorbed by the astrometric parameters, leading to astrometric errors of a magnitude (in radians) comparable to the strain parameters. These astrometric errors are in general not possible to detect, because the true (unperturbed) astrometric parameters are not known to corresponding accuracy. The astrometric errors are especially large for specific GW frequencies that are linear combinations of two characteristic frequencies of the scanning law. Nevertheless, for all GW periods smaller than the time span covered by the observations, significant parts of the GW signal also go into the astrometric residuals. This fosters the hope for a GW detection algorithm based on the residuals of standard astrometric solutions.</description>

      <title>Bayesian pulsar timing and noise analysis with Vela.jl: an overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Vela.jl, an efficient, modular, easy-to-use Bayesian pulsar timing and noise analysis package written in Julia. Vela.jl provides an independent, efficient, and parallelized implementation of the full non-linear pulsar timing and noise model along with a Python binding named pyvela. One-time operations such as data file input, clock corrections, and solar system ephemeris computations are performed by pyvela with the help of the PINT pulsar timing package. Its reliability is ensured via careful design utilizing Julia's type system, strict version control, and an exhaustive test suite. This paper describes the design and usage of Vela.jl focusing on the narrowband paradigm.</description>

      <title>Adding interferometric lightning detection to the Pierre Auger Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Pierre Auger Observatory has detected downward terrestrial gamma-ray flashes (TGFs) with its Surface Detector. A key to understanding this high-energy radiation in thunderstorms is to combine such measurements with measurements of lightning processes in their earliest stages. With eleven modified Auger Engineering Radio Array (AERA) stations we can build an interferometric lightning detection array working in the bandwidth between 30 - 80 MHz inside the Surface Detector array to precisely measure lightning stepped leaders in 3D. These measurements allow us to decipher the cause of TGFs and clarify the reason for the observed high-energy particles in thunderstorms. We will present the current status of the detection plans including the configuration of the interferometric lightning detection array and the steps to take as well as the reconstruction characteristics obtained with AERA.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the detection of low-energy M dwarf flares: wavelet-based denoising of CHEOPS data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellar flares are powerful bursts of electromagnetic radiation triggered by magnetic reconnection in the chromosphere of stars, occurring frequently and intensely on active M dwarfs. While missions like TESS and Kepler have studied regular and super-flares, their detection of flares with energies below $10^{30}$ erg remains incomplete. Extending flare studies to include these low-energy events could enhance flare formation models and provide insight into their impacts on exoplanetary atmospheres. This study investigates CHEOPS's capacity to detect low-energy flares in M dwarf light curves. Using CHEOPS's high photometric precision and observing cadence, along with a tailored wavelet-based denoising algorithm, we aim to improve detection completeness and refine flare statistics for low-energy events. We conducted a flare injection and recovery process to optimise denoising parameters, applied it to CHEOPS light curves to maximise detection rates, and used a flare breakdown algorithm to analyse complex structures. Our analysis recovered 349 flares with energies ranging from $2.2\times10^{26}$ to $8.1\times10^{30}$ erg across 63 M dwarfs, with $\sim$40% exhibiting complex, multi-peaked structures. The denoising algorithm improved flare recovery by $\sim$34%, though it marginally extended the lower boundary of detectable energies. For the full sample, the power-law index $\alpha$ was $1.92\pm0.07$, but a log-normal distribution fit better, suggesting multiple flare formation scenarios. While CHEOPS's observing mode is not ideal for large-scale surveys, it captures weaker flares than TESS or Kepler, expanding the observed energy range. Wavelet-based denoising enhances low-energy event recovery, enabling exploration of the micro-flaring regime. Expanding low-energy flare observations could refine flare generation models and improve the understanding of their role in star-planet interactions.</description>

      <title>From Galaxy Zoo DECaLS to BASS/MzLS: detailed galaxy morphology classification with unsupervised domain adaption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys (DESI-LIS) comprise three distinct surveys: the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey (DECaLS), the Beijing-Arizona Sky Survey (BASS), and the Mayall z-band Legacy Survey (MzLS).The citizen science project Galaxy Zoo DECaLS 5 (GZD-5) has provided extensive and detailed morphology labels for a sample of 253,287 galaxies within the DECaLS survey. This dataset has been foundational for numerous deep learning-based galaxy morphology classification studies. However, due to differences in signal-to-noise ratios and resolutions between the DECaLS images and those from BASS and MzLS (collectively referred to as BMz), a neural network trained on DECaLS images cannot be directly applied to BMz images due to distributional mismatch.In this study, we explore an unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) method that fine-tunes a source domain model trained on DECaLS images with GZD-5 labels to BMz images, aiming to reduce bias in galaxy morphology classification within the BMz survey. Our source domain model, used as a starting point for UDA, achieves performance on the DECaLS galaxies' validation set comparable to the results of related works. For BMz galaxies, the fine-tuned target domain model significantly improves performance compared to the direct application of the source domain model, reaching a level comparable to that of the source domain. We also release a catalogue of detailed morphology classifications for 248,088 galaxies within the BMz survey, accompanied by usage recommendations.</description>

      <title>Debiasing of Two-Line Element Sets for Batch Least Squares Pseudo-Orbit Determination in MEO and GEO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The availability of accurate and timely state predictions for objects in near-Earth orbits is becoming increasingly important due to the growing congestion in key orbital regimes. The Two-line Element Set (TLE) catalogue remains, to this day, one of the few publicly-available, comprehensive sources of near-Earth object ephemerides. At the same time, TLEs are affected by measurement noise and are limited by the low accuracy of the SGP4 theory, introducing significant uncertainty into state predictions. Previous literature has shown that filtering TLEs with batch least squares methods can yield significant improvements in long-term state prediction accuracy. However, this process can be highly sensitive to TLE quality which can vary throughout the year. In this study, it is shown that either extended-duration fit windows of the order of months, or the removal of systematic biases in along-track position prior to state estimation can produce significant reductions in post-fit position errors. Simple models for estimating these systematic biases are shown to be effective without introducing the need for high-complexity Machine Learning (ML) models. Furthermore, by establishing a TLE-based error metric, the need for high accuracy ephemerides is removed when creating these models. For selected satellites in the Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) regime, post-fit position errors are reduced by up to 80 %, from approximately 5 km to 1 km; meanwhile, for selected satellites in the Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO)/Geosynchronous Earth Orbit (GSO) regime, large oscillations in post-fit position error can be suppressed.</description>

      <title>Real-bogus scores for active anomaly detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10256v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the task of anomaly detection in modern time-domain photometric surveys, the primary goal is to identify astrophysically interesting, rare, and unusual objects among a large volume of data. Unfortunately, artifacts -- such as plane or satellite tracks, bad columns on CCDs, and ghosts -- often constitute significant contaminants in results from anomaly detection analysis. In such contexts, the Active Anomaly Discovery (AAD) algorithm allows tailoring the output of anomaly detection pipelines according to what the expert judges to be scientifically interesting. We demonstrate how the introduction real-bogus scores, obtained from a machine learning classifier, improves the results from AAD. Using labeled data from the SNAD ZTF knowledge database, we train four real-bogus classifiers: XGBoost, CatBoost, Random Forest, and Extremely Randomized Trees. All the models perform real-bogus classification with similar effectiveness, achieving ROC-AUC scores ranging from 0.93 to 0.95. Consequently, we select the Random Forest model as the main model due to its simplicity and interpretability. The Random Forest classifier is applied to 67 million light curves from ZTF DR17. The output real-bogus score is used as an additional feature for two anomaly detection algorithms: static Isolation Forest and AAD. While results from Isolation Forest remained unchanged, the number of artifacts detected by the active approach decreases significantly with the inclusion of the real-bogus score, from 27 to 3 out of 100. We conclude that incorporating the real-bogus classifier result as an additional feature in the active anomaly detection pipeline significantly reduces the number of artifacts in the outputs, thereby increasing the incidence of astrophysically interesting objects presented to human experts.</description>

      <title>A Review of NEST Models for Liquid Xenon and Exhaustive Comparison to Other Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.10726v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper will discuss the microphysical simulation of interactions in liquid xenon, the active detector medium in many leading rare-event searches for new physics, and describe experimental observables useful for understanding detector performance. The scintillation and ionization yield distributions for signal and background will be presented using the Noble Element Simulation Technique (NEST), which is a toolkit based on experimental data and simple, empirical formulae, which mimic previous microphysics modeling, but are guided by data. The NEST models for light and charge production as a function of the particle type, energy, and electric field will be reviewed, as well as models for energy resolution and final pulse areas. NEST will be compared to other models or sets of models, and vetted against real data, with several specific examples pulled from XENON, ZEPLIN, LUX, LZ, PandaX, and table-top experiments used for calibrations.</description>

      <title>The Clear Sky Corridor: Insights Towards Aerosol Formation in Exoplanets Using An AI-based Survey of Exoplanet Atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06804v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Producing optimized and accurate transmission spectra of exoplanets from telescope data has traditionally been a manual and labor-intensive procedure. Here we present the results of the first attempt to improve and standardize this procedure using artificial intelligence (AI) based processing of light curves and spectroscopic data from transiting exoplanets observed with the Hubble Space Telescope's (HST) Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) instrument. We implement an AI-based parameter optimizer that autonomously operates the Eureka pipeline to produce homogeneous transmission spectra of publicly available HST WFC3 datasets, spanning exoplanet types from hot Jupiters to sub-Neptunes. Surveying 42 exoplanets with temperatures between 280 and 2580 Kelvin, we confirm modeled relationships between the amplitude of the water band at 1.4um in hot Jupiters and their equilibrium temperatures. We also identify a similar, novel trend in Neptune/sub-Neptune atmospheres, but shifted to cooler temperatures. Excitingly, a planet mass versus equilibrium temperature diagram reveals a "Clear Sky Corridor," where planets between 700 and 1700 Kelvin (depending on the mass) show stronger 1.4um H2O band measurements. This novel trend points to metallicity as a potentially important driver of aerosol formation. As we unveil and include these new discoveries into our understanding of aerosol formation, we enter a thrilling future for the study of exoplanet atmospheres. With HST sculpting this foundational understanding for aerosol formation in various exoplanet types, ranging from Jupiters to sub-Neptunes, we present a compelling platform for the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to discover similar atmospheric trends for more planets across a broader wavelength range.</description>

      <title>Status of the CORSIKA 8 particle-shower simulation code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15097v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For over two decades, CORSIKA 7 and its previous versions have been the leading Monte Carlo code for simulating extensive air showers. However, its monolithic Fortran-based software design and hand-optimized code has created challenges for maintenance, adaptation to new computing paradigms, and extensions for more complex simulations. Addressing these limitations, the CORSIKA 8 project represents a comprehensive rewrite of CORSIKA 7, seeing its core functionality re-envisioned in a modern and modular C++ framework. CORSIKA 8 has now reached a "physics-complete" state, offering a robust platform that encourages expert development for specialized applications. It supports high-energy hadronic interactions using models such as Sibyll 2.3d, QGSJet-II.04, EPOS-LHC, and Pythia 8.3, alongside the treatment of electromagnetic cascades with PROPOSAL 7.6.2. Key highlights are the support for multiple interaction media, including cross-media particle showers, and an enhanced calculation of radio emissions from particle showers. This contribution provides an overview of the current functionalities, showcases validation results of its simulations, and discusses future development plans.</description>
