      <title>Groups Having a Character of Maximal Degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a group, let $d$ be a character degree, and let $e$ be the integer so that $|G| = d(d+e)$. It has been shown when $e &gt; 1$ that $|G| \le e^4 - e^3$. In this paper, we consider the groups where $|G| = e^4 - e^3$. It is known that $e$ must be a power of a prime. We classify the groups where $e$ is a prime and where $e$ is $4$, $9$, and $25$. In so doing, we find a new nonsolvable Camina pair.</description>

      <title>Uncountably many quasi-isometric torsion-free groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct uncountably many finitely generated, pairwise non-isomorphic torsion-free groups, all of which fall into the same quasi-isometry class. This is done by considering Schur covering groups and group cohomology, with the necessary geometric ingredient coming from the theory of bounded-valued cohomology.</description>

      <title>On Slender Generalized Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces the concept of slender generalized groups, extending the classical notion of slender abelian groups to the setting of generalized groups (completely simple semigroups). We establish fundamental properties of slender generalized groups and prove that, in the abelian case, the classical and generalized definitions of slenderness coincide. Several structural results are provided, including the behavior of slenderness under homomorphisms and subgroups. We also present examples and non-examples to illustrate the theory. Our results demonstrate that slenderness is preserved under taking generalized subgroups and that the group components $G_{e(a)}$ of a slender generalized group are slender in the classical sense.</description>

      <title>Testing chirality on hypertopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we give group-theoretical conditions on the maximal parabolic subgroups of a coset geometry for it to be a chiral hypertope, bypassing the need to construct the incidence graph of the coset geometry to determine whether or not it is a chiral hypertope. This result permits to study much larger coset geometries with computers and gives hope on proving theoretical results about coset geometries that are chiral hypertopes.</description>

      <title>Recurrence Relations for Cosets in Free Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $F_2$ be the free group on two generators and let $H$ be a subgroup of $F_2$. We investigate a method for calculating the number of elements in a coset of $H$ that have a given length when written in reduced form. More specifically, taking $S_n\subseteq F_2$ to be the set of elements of length $n$, we show that for any coset $yH$ there always exists a recurrence relation of the form \[
  |yH\cap S_n| = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1}\sum_{xH\in F_2/H}a_{i,xH}\cdot |xH\cap S_{n-i}| \] for some constants $(a_{i,xH})_{i\in \mathbb{N}, xH\in F_2/H}$, and we give an algorithm that calculates these constants. Further, we show that when $H$ has finite index and contains an element of odd length, only finitely many of the constants $a_{i,xH}$ are nonzero.</description>

      <title>On finite groups with soluble centralisers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We classify finite groups in which the centralisers of certain non-central elements are soluble. This includes a full structural description of groups whose non-central element centralisers are all soluble, and a reduction theorem for the case in which all non-central $\pi$-elements have soluble centralisers, for a suitable collection $\pi$ of primes. Our results yield further descriptions under mild local conditions and have applications to groups with soluble involution centralisers, as well as to questions concerning non-commuting graphs.</description>

      <title>Theory of Interpretations I. Foundations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is the first paper in a series in which we lay down the foundations of the theory of interpretations. We systematically study different types of interpretations and their properties. Some of these interpretations are known, while others are new. Each of them serves different purposes. In the last section, we describe applications of interpretations to Diophantine problems, first-order classification, isotypeness, definability of structures by types, elimination of imaginaries, richness, logical categories, and bi-interpretations with Z or N. Additionally, throughout the text, we pose some open questions that naturally arise in this context and provide the most typical examples, usually from algebra. The current literature is plagued by discrepancies and inconsistencies in definitions, concepts, and fundamental applications of interpretations. To address this, we thoroughly examine various principal notions, definitions, and arguments, bringing order to the existing theory. Simultaneously, we develop several key concepts, such as regular interpretations, regular bi-interpretations, and invertible interpretations, and outline their main applications.</description>

      <title>Symmetry notions for toric Fanos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We survey various notions of symmetry for toric varieties. These notions range from algebraic geometric, complex geometric, representation theoretic, combinatorial, convex geometric, to geometric stability. The main theorem gives the relationship between these notions. While mostly folklore knowledge, this does not seem to be readily available in the literature. Finally, we take the opportunity to give an accessible and simplified proof of Demazure's 1970 structure theorem for the automorphism group of a smooth toric variety, previously considered quite inaccessible.</description>

      <title>Flag-transitive $2$-$(v,k,\lambda)$ designs with $\lambda\ge (r,\lambda)^2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the study of $2$-designs with $\lambda\ge (r,\lambda)^2$ admitting a flag-transitive automorphism group $G$. The group $G$ has been shown to be point-primitive of either almost simple or affine type. In this paper, we classify the $2$-designs with $\lambda \geq (r,\lambda)^2&gt;1$ admitting a flag-transitive almost simple automorphism group with socle $\mathrm{PSL}_n(q)$ or $\mathrm{PSU}_n(q)$ for $n \geq 3$.</description>

      <title>An integral family of quasi-strongly regular Cayley graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasi-strongly regular graphs form a significant generalization of strongly regular graphs. We study the eigenvalues of a family of such graphs, $\Gamma_H(G)$, constructed from a finite group $G$ and a subgroup $H$. Our main results include a sufficient condition for $\Gamma_H(G)$ to be integral and an explicit computation of its entire spectrum when $H$ is normal, revealing that the spectrum in this case depends only on $|G|$ and the index $[G:H]$.</description>

      <title>A CFSG-free explicit Jordan's theorem over arbitrary fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a version of Jordan's classification theorem for finite subgroups of $\mathrm{GL}_{n}(K)$ that is at the same time quantitatively explicit, CFSG-free, and valid for arbitrary $K$. This is the first proof to satisfy all three properties at once. Our overall strategy follows Larsen and Pink [24], with explicit computations based on techniques developed by the authors and Helfgott [2, 3], particularly in relation to dimensional estimates.</description>

      <title>Conjugacy languages and conjugacy growth relative to subsets of groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20923v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore conjugacy languages when the base problem is the generalized conjugacy problem (with constraints): given $g\in G$ and $U\subset G$, does $g$ have a conjugate in $U$ (with conjugators in a certain subset)? To do so, for subsets $U,V\subseteq G$, we define the corresponding languages $\text{ConjGeo(U,V)}$, $\text{CycGeo(U)}$, $\text{ConjSL(U)}$ and $\text{ConjMinLenSL(U,V)}$, following the previously studied cases where $U=V=G$. Our results cover several classes of groups: for free groups, we prove that $\text{ConjGeo(U,V)}$ and $\text{ConjMinLenSL(U,V)}$ are regular if $U$ and $V$ are rational subsets; for hyperbolic groups, we show that if $L$ is a regular language of geodesics and $U$ is the subsets represented by it, then $\text{ConjGeo(U)}$ and $\text{ConjMinLenSL(U)}$ are regular; for virtually cyclic groups, we show that $\text{ConjSL(U)}$ is regular if $U$ is rational; and, for virtually abelian groups, we prove that $\text{ConjGeo(U)}$ belongs to a certain class of languages $\C$ when the language of words representing elements of $U$ also belongs to $\C$. We also define relative conjugacy growth and show that its behavior can be heavily dependent on the choice of subset.</description>

      <title>Classifying representations of finite classical groups of Lie type of dimension up to $\ell^4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11367v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite classical group of Lie type of rank $\ell$, defined over a field of characteristic $p&gt;2$. In this work, we classify the irreducible representations of $G$ whose dimensions are bounded by a constant proportional to $\ell$, and splits into two cases according to $G$ is of type $A_{\ell}$ or not. Furthermore, we discuss explicit formulas for computing the dimensions of such representations. The motivation for this work arises, in part, from a desire to obtain new results on two classical problems concerning Galois representations: the large image conjecture for automorphic Galois representations and the inverse Galois problem. We conclude the paper by giving some remarks on potential implications in these addresses.</description>

      <title>Embeddings of trees of hyperbolic spaces and Cannon--Thurston maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12883v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Suppose $G_1$ and $G_2$ are hyperbolic groups with a common quasiconvex subgroup $H$, and the free product with amalgamation $G = G_1 *_H G_2$ is hyperbolic. Let $K_i &lt; G_i$, $i = 1,2$, be quasiconvex subgroups containing $H$, and let $K = K_1 *_H K_2$. It follows from the work of Bestvina and Feighn that $K$ is hyperbolic, and it follows from the work of the second named author with M. Kapovich that the inclusion $K \to G$ extends continuously to the (Gromov) boundary.
  The present paper arose from the question of whether the same conclusion holds when $K_i &lt; G_i$ are no longer quasiconvex but merely hyperbolic. As an application of the main result of this paper, we answer this question affirmatively, provided each inclusion $K_i \to G_i$ extends continuously to the boundary.</description>
