      <title>Generating Sizing Fields for Mesh Generation via GCN-based Simplification of Adaptive Background Grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sizing field defined on a triangular background grid is pivotal for controlling the quality and efficiency of unstructured mesh generation. However, creating an optimal background grid that is geometrically conforming, computationally lightweight, and free from artifacts like banding is a significant challenge. This paper introduces a novel, adaptive background grid simplification (ABGS) framework based on a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN). We reformulate the grid simplification task as an edge score regression problem and train a GCN model to efficiently predict optimal edge collapse candidates. The model is guided by a custom loss function that holistically considers both geometric fidelity and sizing field accuracy. This data-driven approach replaces a costly procedural evaluation, accelerating the simplification process. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework across diverse and complex engineering models. Compared to the initial dense grids, our simplified background grids achieve an element reduction of 74%-94%, leading to a 35%-88% decrease in sizing field query times.</description>

      <title>A 3D Generation Framework from Cross Modality to Parameterized Primitive</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in AI-driven 3D model generation have leveraged cross modality, yet generating models with smooth surfaces and minimizing storage overhead remain challenges. This paper introduces a novel multi-stage framework for generating 3D models composed of parameterized primitives, guided by textual and image inputs. In the framework, A model generation algorithm based on parameterized primitives, is proposed, which can identifies the shape features of the model constituent elements, and replace the elements with parameterized primitives with high quality surface. In addition, a corresponding model storage method is proposed, it can ensure the original surface quality of the model, while retaining only the parameters of parameterized primitives. Experiments on virtual scene dataset and real scene dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving a Chamfer Distance of 0.003092, a VIoU of 0.545, a F1-Score of 0.9139 and a NC of 0.8369, with primitive parameter files approximately 6KB in size. Our approach is particularly suitable for rapid prototyping of simple models.</description>

      <title>MCMC: Bridging Rendering, Optimization and Generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has made unprecedented advances in vision language models over the past two years. During the generative process, new samples (images) are generated from an unknown high-dimensional distribution. Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are particularly effective in drawing samples from such complex, high-dimensional distributions. This makes MCMC methods an integral component for models like EBMs, ensuring accurate sample generation.
  Gradient-based optimization is at the core of modern generative models. The update step during the optimization forms a Markov chain where the new update depends only on the current state. This allows exploration of the parameter space in a memoryless manner, thus combining the benefits of gradient-based optimization and MCMC sampling. MCMC methods have shown an equally important role in physically based rendering where complex light paths are otherwise quite challenging to sample from simple importance sampling techniques.
  A lot of research is dedicated towards bringing physical realism to samples (images) generated from diffusion-based generative models in a data-driven manner, however, a unified framework connecting these techniques is still missing. In this course, we take the first steps toward understanding each of these components and exploring how MCMC could potentially serve as a bridge, linking these closely related areas of research. Our course aims to provide necessary theoretical and practical tools to guide students, researchers and practitioners towards the common goal of generative physically based rendering.

      <title>Real-Time Rendering of Dynamic Line Sets using Voxel Ray Tracing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-time rendering of dynamic line sets is relevant in many visualization tasks, including unsteady flow visualization and interactive white matter reconstruction from Magnetic Resonance Imaging. High-quality global illumination and transparency are important for conveying the spatial structure of dense line sets, yet remain difficult to achieve at interactive rates. We propose an efficient voxel-based ray-tracing framework for rendering large dynamic line sets with ambient occlusion and ground-truth transparency. The framework introduces a voxelization algorithm that supports efficient construction of acceleration structures for both voxel cone tracing and ray tracing. To further reduce per-frame preprocessing cost, we developed a voxel-based culling method that restricts acceleration structure construction to camera-visible voxels. Together, these contributions enable high-quality, real-time rendering of large-scale dynamic line sets with physically accurate transparency. The results show that our method outperforms the state of the art in quality and performance when rendering (semi-)opaque dynamic line sets.</description>

      <title>Two-Stage Gaussian Splatting Optimization for Outdoor Scene Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Outdoor scene reconstruction remains challenging due to the stark contrast between well-textured, nearby regions and distant backgrounds dominated by low detail, uneven illumination, and sky effects. We introduce a two-stage Gaussian Splatting framework that explicitly separates and optimizes these regions, yielding higher-fidelity novel view synthesis. In stage one, background primitives are initialized within a spherical shell and optimized using a loss that combines a background-only photometric term with two geometric regularizers: one constraining Gaussians to remain inside the shell, and another aligning them with local tangential planes. In stage two, foreground Gaussians are initialized from a Structure-from-Motion reconstruction, added and refined using the standard rendering loss, while the background set remains fixed but contributes to the final image formation. Experiments on diverse outdoor datasets show that our method reduces background artifacts and improves perceptual quality compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Moreover, the explicit background separation enables automatic, object-free environment map estimation, opening new possibilities for photorealistic outdoor rendering and mixed-reality applications.</description>

      <title>Human-VDM: Learning Single-Image 3D Human Gaussian Splatting from Video Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generating lifelike 3D humans from a single RGB image remains a challenging task in computer vision, as it requires accurate modeling of geometry, high-quality texture, and plausible unseen parts. Existing methods typically use multi-view diffusion models for 3D generation, but they often face inconsistent view issues, which hinder high-quality 3D human generation. To address this, we propose Human-VDM, a novel method for generating 3D human from a single RGB image using Video Diffusion Models. Human-VDM provides temporally consistent views for 3D human generation using Gaussian Splatting. It consists of three modules: a view-consistent human video diffusion module, a video augmentation module, and a Gaussian Splatting module. First, a single image is fed into a human video diffusion module to generate a coherent human video. Next, the video augmentation module applies super-resolution and video interpolation to enhance the textures and geometric smoothness of the generated video. Finally, the 3D Human Gaussian Splatting module learns lifelike humans under the guidance of these high-resolution and view-consistent images. Experiments demonstrate that Human-VDM achieves high-quality 3D human from a single image, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in both generation quality and quantity.

      <title>Reinforcement Learning-Driven Edge Management for Reliable Multi-view 3D Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-time multi-view 3D reconstruction is a mission-critical application for key edge-native use cases, such as fire rescue, where timely and accurate 3D scene modeling enables situational awareness and informed decision-making. However, the dynamic and unpredictable nature of edge resource availability introduces disruptions, such as degraded image quality, unstable network links, and fluctuating server loads, which challenge the reliability of the reconstruction pipeline. In this work, we present a reinforcement learning (RL)-based edge resource management framework for reliable 3D reconstruction to ensure high quality reconstruction within a reasonable amount of time, despite the system operating under a resource-constrained and disruption-prone environment. In particular, the framework adopts two cooperative Q-learning agents, one for camera selection and one for server selection, both of which operate entirely online, learning policies through interactions with the edge environment. To support learning under realistic constraints and evaluate system performance, we implement a distributed testbed comprising lab-hosted end devices and FABRIC infrastructure-hosted edge servers to emulate smart city edge infrastructure under realistic disruption scenarios. Results show that the proposed framework improves application reliability by effectively balancing end-to-end latency and reconstruction quality in dynamic environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In order to construct quantum trigonometric B\'ezier curves with shape parameter, one parameter family of trigonometric Bernstein basis functions are introduced. We study the total positivity of the basis functions to analyze the shape preserving properties of the quantum trigonometric B\'ezier curves. We also showed that quantum trigonometric B\'ezier curves can be evaluated by two different recursive evaluation algorithms. Finally, we have defined rational counterpart of quantum trigonometric B\'ezier curves and show that the rational quantum trigonometric B\'ezier curves posses nice shape preserving properties.</description>

      <title>Differential Analysis of Pseudo Haptic Feedback: Novel Comparative Study of Visual and Auditory Cue Integration for Psychophysical Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pseudo-haptics exploit carefully crafted visual or auditory cues to trick the brain into "feeling" forces that are never physically applied, offering a low-cost alternative to traditional haptic hardware. Here, we present a comparative psychophysical study that quantifies how visual and auditory stimuli combine to evoke pseudo-haptic pressure sensations on a commodity tablet. Using a Unity-based Rollball game, participants (n = 4) guided a virtual ball across three textured terrains while their finger forces were captured in real time with a Robotous RFT40 force-torque sensor. Each terrain was paired with a distinct rolling-sound profile spanning 440 Hz - 4.7 kHz, 440 Hz - 13.1 kHz, or 440 Hz - 8.9 kHz; crevice collisions triggered additional "knocking" bursts to heighten realism. Average tactile forces increased systematically with cue intensity: 0.40 N, 0.79 N and 0.88 N for visual-only trials and 0.41 N, 0.81 N and 0.90 N for audio-only trials on Terrains 1-3, respectively. Higher audio frequencies and denser visual textures both elicited stronger muscle activation, and their combination further reduced the force needed to perceive surface changes, confirming multisensory integration. These results demonstrate that consumer-grade isometric devices can reliably induce and measure graded pseudo-haptic feedback without specialized actuators, opening a path toward affordable rehabilitation tools, training simulators and assistive interfaces.</description>

      <title>Make the Fastest Faster: Importance Mask Synthesis for Interactive Volume Visualization using Reconstruction Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06053v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Visualizing a large-scale volumetric dataset with high resolution is challenging due to the substantial computational time and space complexity. Recent deep learning-based image inpainting methods significantly improve rendering latency by reconstructing a high-resolution image for visualization in constant time on GPU from a partially rendered image where only a portion of pixels go through the expensive rendering pipeline. However, existing solutions need to render every pixel of either a predefined regular sampling pattern or an irregular sample pattern predicted from a low-resolution image rendering. Both methods require a significant amount of expensive pixel-level rendering. In this work, we provide Importance Mask Learning (IML) and Synthesis (IMS) networks, which are the first attempts to directly synthesize important regions of the regular sampling pattern from the user's view parameters, to further minimize the number of pixels to render by jointly considering the dataset, user behavior, and the downstream reconstruction neural network. Our solution is a unified framework to handle various types of inpainting methods through the proposed differentiable compaction/decompaction layers. Experiments show our method can further improve the overall rendering latency of state-of-the-art volume visualization methods using reconstruction neural network for free when rendering scientific volumetric datasets. Our method can also directly optimize the off-the-shelf pre-trained reconstruction neural networks without elongated retraining.</description>

      <title>SMF: Template-free and Rig-free Animation Transfer using Kinetic Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04831v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Animation retargetting applies sparse motion description (e.g., keypoint sequences) to a character mesh to produce a semantically plausible and temporally coherent full-body mesh sequence. Existing approaches come with restrictions -- they require access to template-based shape priors or artist-designed deformation rigs, suffer from limited generalization to unseen motion and/or shapes, or exhibit motion jitter. We propose Self-supervised Motion Fields (SMF), a self-supervised framework that is trained with only sparse motion representations, without requiring dataset-specific annotations, templates, or rigs. At the heart of our method are Kinetic Codes, a novel autoencoder-based sparse motion encoding, that exposes a semantically rich latent space, simplifying large-scale training. Our architecture comprises dedicated spatial and temporal gradient predictors, which are jointly trained in an end-to-end fashion. The combined network, regularized by the Kinetic Codes' latent space, has good generalization across both unseen shapes and new motions. We evaluated our method on unseen motion sampled from AMASS, D4D, Mixamo, and raw monocular video for animation transfer on various characters with varying shapes and topology. We report a new SoTA on the AMASS dataset in the context of generalization to unseen motion.

      <title>Variable-Rate Texture Compression: Real-Time Rendering with JPEG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08166v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although variable-rate compressed image formats such as JPEG are widely used to efficiently encode images, they have not found their way into real-time rendering due to special requirements such as random access to individual texels. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of variable-rate texture compression on modern GPUs using the JPEG format, and how it compares to the GPU-friendly fixed-rate compression approaches BC1 and ASTC. Using a deferred rendering pipeline, we are able to identify the subset of blocks that are needed for a given frame, decode these, and colorize the framebuffer's pixels. Despite the additional $\sim$0.17 bit per pixel that we require for our approach, JPEG maintains significantly better quality and compression rates compared to BC1, and depending on the type of image, outperforms or competes with ASTC. The JPEG rendering pipeline increases rendering duration by less than 0.3 ms on an RTX 4090, demonstrating that sophisticated variable-rate compression schemes are feasible on modern GPUs, even in VR.

      <title>RAGDiffusion: Faithful Cloth Generation via External Knowledge Assimilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19528v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Standard clothing asset generation involves restoring forward-facing flat-lay garment images displayed on a clear background by extracting clothing information from diverse real-world contexts, which presents significant challenges due to highly standardized structure sampling distributions and clothing semantic absence in complex scenarios. Existing models have limited spatial perception, often exhibiting structural hallucinations and texture distortion in this high-specification generative task. To address this issue, we propose a novel Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, termed RAGDiffusion, to enhance structure determinacy and mitigate hallucinations by assimilating knowledge from language models and external databases. RAGDiffusion consists of two processes: (1) Retrieval-based structure aggregation, which employs contrastive learning and a Structure Locally Linear Embedding (SLLE) to derive global structure and spatial landmarks, providing both soft and hard guidance to counteract structural ambiguities; and (2) Omni-level faithful garment generation, which introduces a coarse-to-fine texture alignment that ensures fidelity in pattern and detail components within the diffusing. Extensive experiments on challenging real-world datasets demonstrate that RAGDiffusion synthesizes structurally and texture-faithful clothing assets with significant performance improvements, representing a pioneering effort in high-specification faithful generation with RAG to confront intrinsic hallucinations and enhance fidelity.</description>
