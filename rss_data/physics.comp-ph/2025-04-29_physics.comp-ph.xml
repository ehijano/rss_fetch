      <title>PaRO-DeepONet: a particle-informed reduced-order deep operator network for Poisson solver in PIC simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations are widely used for modeling plasma kinetics by tracking discrete particle dynamics. However, their computational cost remains prohibitively high, due to the need to simulate large numbers of particles to mitigate statistical noise and the inefficiency in handling complex geometries. To address these challenges, we propose PaRO-DeepONet, a particle-informed reduced-order surrogate framework that integrates Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) with Deep Operator Network (DeepONet). By performing manifold sampling of particle evolution in PIC simulations and constructing snapshot matrices from various particle states, PaRO-DeepONet applies POD projection to extract latent charge density features that are shared across similar plasma scenarios. These reduced features are fed into the branch network of DeepONet, enabling efficient mapping from charge distributions to electrostatic potential fields. We validate PaRO-DeepONet on four representative benchmark cases. The model consistently achieves relative L2 errors below 3.5%, with the best case reaching as low as 0.82%. Notably, although the charge deposition becomes highly discrete due to particle sparsity, PaRO-DeepONet still reconstructs smooth and continuous potential fields, demonstrating strong robustness to sparse inputs and excellent generalization beyond traditional grid-based solvers. In terms of computational performance, PaRO-DeepONet reduces total PIC simulation time by 68%-85% and cuts the Poisson solver runtime by up to 99.6%. By significantly reducing computational cost while maintaining high accuracy, this work establishes machine learning-based operator surrogates as a promising new paradigm for next-generation kinetic plasma simulations.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Neural Network-Based Discovery of Hyperelastic Constitutive Models from Extremely Scarce Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of constitutive models for hyperelastic materials is essential yet challenging due to their nonlinear behavior and the limited availability of experimental data. Traditional methods typically require extensive stress-strain or full-field measurements, which are often difficult to obtain in practical settings. To overcome these challenges, we propose a physics-informed neural network (PINN)-based framework that enables the discovery of constitutive models using only sparse measurement data - such as displacement and reaction force - that can be acquired from a single material test. By integrating PINNs with finite element discretization, the framework reconstructs full-field displacement and identifies the underlying strain energy density from predefined candidates, while ensuring consistency with physical laws. A two-stage training process is employed: the Adam optimizer jointly updates neural network parameters and model coefficients to obtain an initial solution, followed by L-BFGS refinement and sparse regression with l_p regularization to extract a parsimonious constitutive model. Validation on benchmark hyperelastic models demonstrates that the proposed method can accurately recover constitutive laws and displacement fields, even when the input data are limited and noisy. These findings highlight the applicability of the proposed framework to experimental scenarios where measurement data are both scarce and noisy.</description>

      <title>LAMBench: A Benchmark for Large Atomic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large atomic models (LAMs) have undergone remarkable progress recently, emerging as universal or fundamental representations of the potential energy surface defined by the first-principles calculations of atomic systems. However, our understanding of the extent to which these models achieve true universality, as well as their comparative performance across different models, remains limited. This gap is largely due to the lack of comprehensive benchmarks capable of evaluating the effectiveness of LAMs as approximations to the universal potential energy surface. In this study, we introduce LAMBench, a benchmarking system designed to evaluate LAMs in terms of their generalizability, adaptability, and applicability. These attributes are crucial for deploying LAMs as ready-to-use tools across a diverse array of scientific discovery contexts. We benchmark eight state-of-the-art LAMs released prior to April 1, 2025, using LAMBench. Our findings reveal a significant gap between the current LAMs and the ideal universal potential energy surface. They also highlight the need for incorporating cross-domain training data, supporting multi-fidelity modeling, and ensuring the models' conservativeness and differentiability. As a dynamic and extensible platform, LAMBench is intended to continuously evolve, thereby facilitating the development of robust and generalizable LAMs capable of significantly advancing scientific research. The LAMBench code is open-sourced at https://github.com/deepmodeling/lambench, and an interactive leaderboard is available at https://www.aissquare.com/openlam?tab=Benchmark.</description>

      <title>Efficient Tensor-Product Spectral-Element Operators with the Summation-by-Parts Property on Curved Triangles and Tetrahedra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.05975v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an extension of the summation-by-parts (SBP) framework to tensor-product spectral-element operators in collapsed coordinates. The proposed approach enables the construction of provably stable discretizations of arbitrary order which combine the geometric flexibility of unstructured triangular and tetrahedral meshes with the efficiency of sum-factorization algorithms. Specifically, a methodology is developed for constructing triangular and tetrahedral spectral-element operators of any order which possess the SBP property (i.e. satisfying a discrete analogue of integration by parts) as well as a tensor-product decomposition. Such operators are then employed within the context of discontinuous spectral-element methods based on nodal expansions collocated at the tensor-product quadrature nodes as well as modal expansions employing Proriol-Koornwinder-Dubiner polynomials, the latter approach resolving the time step limitation associated with the singularity of the collapsed coordinate transformation. Energy-stable formulations for curvilinear meshes are obtained using a skew-symmetric splitting of the metric terms, and a weight-adjusted approximation is used to efficiently invert the curvilinear modal mass matrix. The proposed schemes are compared to those using non-tensorial multidimensional SBP operators, and are found to offer comparable accuracy to such schemes in the context of smooth linear advection problems on curved meshes, but at a reduced computational cost for higher polynomial degrees.</description>

      <title>Efficient Entropy-Stable Discontinuous Spectral-Element Methods Using Tensor-Product Summation-by-Parts Operators on Triangles and Tetrahedra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07874v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new class of efficient and robust discontinuous spectral-element methods of arbitrary order for nonlinear hyperbolic systems of conservation laws on curved triangular and tetrahedral unstructured grids. Such discretizations employ a recently introduced family of sparse tensor-product summation-by-parts (SBP) operators in collapsed coordinates within an entropy-stable modal formulation. The proposed algorithms exploit the structure of such SBP operators alongside that of the Proriol-Koornwinder-Dubiner polynomial basis, and a weight-adjusted approximation is used to efficiently invert the local mass matrix for curvilinear elements. Using such techniques, the number of required entropy-conservative two-point flux evaluations between pairs of quadrature nodes is significantly reduced relative to existing entropy-stable formulations using (non-tensor-product) multidimensional SBP operators, particularly for high polynomial degrees, with an improvement in time complexity from $\mathcal{O}(p^{2d})$ to $\mathcal{O}(p^{d+1})$, where $p$ is the polynomial degree of the approximation and $d$ is the number of spatial dimensions. In numerical experiments involving smooth solutions to the compressible Euler equations, the proposed tensor-product schemes demonstrate similar levels of accuracy for a given mesh and polynomial degree to those using multidimensional SBP operators based on symmetric quadrature rules. Furthermore, both operator families are shown to give rise to entropy-stable methods which exhibit excellent robustness for under-resolved problems. Such results suggest that the algorithmic advantages resulting from the use of tensor-product operators are obtained without compromising accuracy or robustness, enabling the efficient extension of the benefits of entropy stability to higher polynomial degrees than previously considered for triangular and tetrahedral elements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While lattice Boltzmann methods were originally derived as the Boltzmann limit of a Boolean lattice gas, modern improvements to lattice Boltzmann methods have broken this link. Because of this most lattice Boltzmann methods are not unconditionally stable and extending them to model fluctuations is challenging. In this article we show that the integer lattice gas method developed by Blommel and Wagner has a lattice Boltzmann limit corresponding to entropic lattice Boltzmann methods, while also recovering proper ideal gas equilibrium fluctuations. We also show that it is possible to accelerate these integer lattice gases such that they become computationally competitive with the corresponding lattice Boltzmann method.</description>

      <title>Molecular Similarity in Machine Learning of Energies in Chemical Reaction Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning has emerged as a powerful tool for predicting molecular properties in chemical reaction networks with reduced computational cost. However, accurately predicting energies of transition state (TS) structures remains a challenge due to their distinct electronic characteristics compared to stable intermediates. In this work, we investigate the limitations of structural descriptors in capturing electronic differences between minima and TS structures. We explore $\Delta$-machine learning approaches to predict correlation energy corrections using both Hartree-Fock (HF) and density functional theory (DFT) as reference methods. Our results demonstrate that learning the energy difference between DFT and coupled cluster methods outperforms direct learning and HF-based $\Delta$-learning. We also assess the effectiveness of combining electronic descriptors with structural ones but find that simple electronic features do not significantly enhance the prediction of TS energies. These findings highlight the need for more sophisticated descriptors or integrated approaches to accurately predict the electronic energies of TS structures within chemical reaction networks.</description>

      <title>GPU Acceleration of Monte Carlo Tallies on Unstructured Meshes in OpenMC with PUMI-Tally</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unstructured mesh tallies are a bottleneck in Monte Carlo neutral particle transport simulations of fusion reactors. This paper introduces the PUMI-Tally library that takes advantage of mesh adjacency information to accelerate these tallies on CPUs and GPUs. For a fixed source simulation using track-length tallies, we achieved a speed-up of 19.7X on an NVIDIA A100, and 9.2X using OpenMP on 128 threads of two AMD EPYC 7763 CPUs on NERSC Perlmutter. On the Empire AI alpha system, we achieved a speed-up of 20X using an NVIDIA H100 and 96 threads of an Intel Xenon 8568Y+. Our method showed better scaling with number of particles and number of elements. Additionally, we observed a 199X reduction in the number of allocations during initialization and the first three iterations, with a similar overall memory consumption. And, our hybrid CPU/GPU method demonstrated a 6.69X improvement in the energy consumption over the current approach.</description>

      <title>Predicting neutron experiments from first principles: A workflow powered by machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning has emerged as a powerful tool in materials discovery, enabling the rapid design of novel materials with tailored properties for countless applications, including in the context of energy and sustainability. To ensure the reliability of these methods, however, rigorous validation against experimental data is essential. Scattering techniques -- using neutrons, X-rays, or electrons -- offer a direct way to probe atomic-scale structure and dynamics, making them ideal for this purpose. In this work, we describe a computational workflow that bridges machine learning-based simulations with experimental validation. The workflow combines density functional theory, machine-learned interatomic potentials, molecular dynamics, and autocorrelation function analysis to simulate experimental signatures, with a focus on inelastic neutron scattering. We demonstrate the approach on three representative systems: crystalline silicon, crystalline benzene, and hydrogenated scandium-doped BaTiO3, comparing the simulated spectra to measurements from four different neutron spectrometers. While our primary focus is inelastic neutron scattering, the workflow is readily extendable to other modalities, including diffraction and quasi-elastic scattering of neutrons, X-rays, and electrons. The good agreement between simulated and experimental results highlights the potential of this approach for guiding and interpreting experiments, while also pointing out areas for further improvement.</description>

      <title>Composable and adaptive design of machine learning interatomic potentials guided by Fisher-information analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An adaptive physics-informed model design strategy for machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) is proposed. This strategy follows an iterative reconfiguration of composite models from single-term models, followed by a unified training procedure. A model evaluation method based on the Fisher information matrix (FIM) and multiple-property error metrics is proposed to guide model reconfiguration and hyperparameter optimization. Combining the model reconfiguration and the model evaluation subroutines, we provide an adaptive MLIP design strategy that balances flexibility and extensibility. In a case study of designing models against a structurally diverse niobium dataset, we managed to obtain an optimal configuration with 75 parameters generated by our framework that achieved a force RMSE of 0.172 eV/{\AA} and an energy RMSE of 0.013 eV/atom.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine-learning-based surrogate models offer significant computational efficiency and faster simulations compared to traditional numerical methods, especially for problems requiring repeated evaluations of partial differential equations. This work introduces the Geometry-Informed Neural Operator Transformer (GINOT), which integrates the transformer architecture with the neural operator framework to enable forward predictions for arbitrary geometries. GINOT encodes the surface points cloud of a geometry using a sampling and grouping mechanism combined with an attention mechanism, ensuring invariance to point order and padding while maintaining robustness to variations in point density. The geometry information is seamlessly integrated with query points in the solution decoder through the attention mechanism. The performance of GINOT is validated on multiple challenging datasets, showcasing its high accuracy and strong generalization capabilities for complex and arbitrary 2D and 3D geometries.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of Mg$^+$ Properties using Multiconfiguration Dirac-Hartree-Fock and Relativistic Coupled-cluster Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate behaviors of correlation effects in the calculations of atomic properties through two commonly employed many-body methods; namely multiconfiguration Dirac-Hartree-Fock (MCDHF) and relativistic coupled-cluster (RCC) methods. Particularly, we have bench-marked excitation energies, electric dipole (E1) matrix elements, magnetic dipole hyperfine structure constants ($A_{hf}$), and isotope shift (IS) constants in the singly ionized magnesium (Mg$^+$) systematically at different levels of approximation of both methods. We have also estimated the E1 polarizability of the ground state and lifetimes of the excited states using the E1 matrix elements from both methods. All these results are compared with the experimental values wherever available. We find that the computed results agree well with each other with a few exceptions; particularly the $A_{hf}$ and IS constants from the RCC method are found to agree with the measurements better. This comparison analysis would be useful in evaluating the above-discussed properties in other atomic systems using the MCDHF and RCC methods more reliably.</description>

      <title>A Universal Spin-Orbit-Coupled Hamiltonian Model for Accelerated Quantum Material Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accurate modeling of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effects in diverse complex systems remains a significant challenge due to the high computational demands of density functional theory (DFT) and the limited transferability of existing machine-learning frameworks. This study addresses these limitations by introducing Uni-HamGNN, a universal SOC Hamiltonian graph neural network that is applicable across the periodic table. By decomposing the SOC Hamiltonian into spin-independent and SOC correction terms, our approach preserves SU(2) symmetry while significantly reducing parameter requirements. Based on this decomposition, we propose a delta-learning strategy to separately fit the two components, thereby addressing the training difficulties caused by magnitude discrepancies between them and enabling efficient training. The model achieves remarkable accuracy (mean absolute error of 0.0025 meV for the SOC-related component) and demonstrates broad applicability through high-throughput screening of the GNoME dataset for topological insulators, as well as precise predictions for 2D valleytronic materials and transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) heterostructures. This breakthrough eliminates the need for system-specific retraining and costly SOC-DFT calculations, paving the way for rapid discovery of quantum materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The silicon vacancy center in diamond is a promising system for quantum technologies due to its exceptional optical and spin properties. This has led to great interest in the silicon-vacancy center as well as in the other group IV vacancy centers. In this work, we model the charge cycle of the group IV vacancy centers from the $-2$ to $0$ charge state. As a first step, we compute the onset energies for all relevant one- and two-step ionization processes. Based on these results, we then derive the rate equations using Fermi's golden rule.</description>

      <title>TDP-43 multidomains and RNA modulate interactions and viscoelasticity in biomolecular condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: RNA-binding proteins form biomolecular condensates with RNA through phase separation, playing crucial roles in various cellular processes. While intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) are key drivers of phase separation, additional factors such as folded domains and RNA also influence condensate formation and physical properties. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this regulation remain elusive. Here, using molecular dynamics simulations, we investigate how the multidomain structure of TDP-43, which consists of its IDR, RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), and N-terminal domain (NTD), interacts with RNA and affects the characteristics of phase separation. Our analysis reveals that interaction sites within the IDR undergo dynamic rearrangement, driven by key residues that depend on the specific combination of folded domains. Upon RNA binding, several intermolecular interactions of TDP-43 are replaced by TDP-43-polyA interactions, altering viscoelastic properties of the condensate. Specifically, RRMs enhance viscosity, whereas the NTD reduces it. The presence of polyA increases elasticity, making viscosity and elasticity comparable in magnitude. These findings suggest that the multidomain structure of TDP-43 and its RNA interactions orchestrate condensate organization, modulating their viscoelastic properties.</description>

      <title>Dissipative particle dynamics models of encapsulated microbubbles and gas vesicles for biomedical ultrasound simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultrasound-guided drug and gene delivery (usdg) enables controlled and spatially precise delivery of drugs and macromolecules, encapsulated in microbubbles (embs) and submicron gas vesicles (gvs), to target areas such as cancer tumors. It is a non-invasive, high precision, low toxicity process with drastically reduced drug dosage. Rheological and acoustic properties of gvs and embs critically affect the outcome of usdg and imaging. Detailed understanding and modeling of their physical properties is thus essential for ultrasound-mediated therapeutic applications. State-of-the-art continuuum models of shelled bodies cannot incorporate critical details such as varying thickness of the encapsulating shell or specific interactions between its constituents and interior or exterior solvents. Such modeling approaches also do not allow for detailed modeling of chemical surface functionalizations, which are crucial for tuning the gv-blood interactions. We develop a general particle-based modeling framework for encapsulated bodies that accurately captures elastic and rheological properties of gvs and embs. We use dissipative particle dynamics to model the solvent, the gaseous phase in the capsid, and the triangulated surfaces of immersed objects. Their elastic behavior is studied and validated through stretching and buckling simulations, eigenmode analysis, shear flow simulations, and comparison of predicted gv buckling pressure with experimental data from the literature. The presented modeling approach paves the way for large-scale simulations of encapsulated bodies, capturing their dynamics, interactions, and collective behavior.</description>

      <title>The Diffuse Solid Method for Wetting and Multiphase Fluid Simulations in Complex Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a diffuse solid method that is versatile and accurate for modeling wetting and multiphase flows in highly complex geometries. In this scheme, we harness N + 1-component phase field models to investigate interface shapes and flow dynamics of N fluid components, and we optimize how to constrain the evolution of the component employed as the solid phase to conform to any pre-defined geometry. Implementations for phase field energy minimization and lattice Boltzmann method are presented. Our approach does not need special treatment for the fluid-solid wetting boundary condition, which makes it simple to implement. To demonstrate its broad applicability, we employ the diffuse solid method to explore wide-ranging examples, including droplet contact angle on a flat surface, particle adsorption on a fluid-fluid interface, critical pressure on micropillars and on Salvinia leaf structures, capillary rise against gravity, Lucas-Washburn's law for capillary filling, and droplet motion on a sinusoidally undulated surface. Our proposed approach can be beneficial to computationally study multiphase fluid interactions with textured solid surfaces that are ubiquitous in nature and engineering applications.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Subspace via Probabilistic Principal Component Analysis for Characterizing Model Error</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a probabilistic model of subspaces based on the probabilistic principal component analysis (PCA). Given a sample of vectors in the embedding space -- commonly known as a snapshot matrix -- this method uses quantities derived from the probabilistic PCA to construct distributions of the sample matrix, as well as the principal subspaces. It is applicable to projection-based reduced-order modeling methods, such as proper orthogonal decomposition and related model reduction methods. The stochastic subspace thus constructed can be used, for example, to characterize model-form uncertainty in computational mechanics. The proposed method has multiple desirable properties: (1) it is naturally justified by the probabilistic PCA and has analytic forms for the induced random matrix models; (2) it satisfies linear constraints, such as boundary conditions of all kinds, by default; (3) it has only one hyperparameter, which significantly simplifies training; and (4) its algorithm is very easy to implement. We compare the proposed method with existing approaches in a low-dimensional visualization example and a parametric static problem, and demonstrate its performance in a dynamics model of a space structure.</description>

      <title>Rigorous lower bounds for the domains of definition of extended generating functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recently developed theory of extended generating functions of symplectic maps are combined with methods to prove invertibility via high-order Taylor model methods to obtain rigorous lower bounds for the domains of definition of generating functions. The examples presented suggest that there are considerable differences in the size of the domains of definition of the various types of generating functions studied. Furthermore, the types of generating functions for which, in general, large domains of definitions can be guarantied were identified. The resulting domain sizes of these generators are usually sufficiently large to be useful in practice, for example for the long-term simulations of accelerator and other Hamiltonian system dynamics.</description>

      <title>Application of Machine Learning and Convex Limiting to Subgrid Flux Modeling in the Shallow-Water Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17214v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a combination of machine learning and flux limiting for property-preserving subgrid scale modeling in the context of flux-limited finite volume methods for the one-dimensional shallow-water equations. The numerical fluxes of a conservative target scheme are fitted to the coarse-mesh averages of a monotone fine-grid discretization using a neural network to parametrize the subgrid scale components. To ensure positivity preservation and the validity of local maximum principles, we use a flux limiter that constrains the intermediate states of an equivalent fluctuation form to stay in a convex admissible set. The results of our numerical studies confirm that the proposed combination of machine learning with monolithic convex limiting produces meaningful closures even in scenarios for which the network was not trained.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05823v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a boundary integral formulation for the dynamic problem of electromagnetic scattering and transmission by homogeneous dielectric obstacles. In the spirit of Costabel and Stephan, we use the transmission conditions to reduce the number of unknown densities and to formulate a system of coupled boundary integral equations describing the scattered and transmitted waves. The system is transformed into the Laplace domain where it is proven to be stable and uniquely solvable. The Laplace domain stability estimates are then used to establish the stability and unique solvability of the original time domain problem. Finally, we show how the bounds obtained in both Laplace and time domains can be used to derive error estimates for semi discrete Galerkin discretizations in space and for fully discrete numerical schemes that use Convolution Quadrature for time discretization and a conforming Galerkin method for discretization of the space variables.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic detection of crystal structures from computer simulation data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08808v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Detection of crystal structures from particle positions of crystalline assemblies formed in computer simulations is an unsolved problem. The standard protocol, formulated in the reciprocal space, for structure determination from experimental diffraction data is not suitable for analysis of computer simulation data, after converting them to the Fourier space. There is a long history of attempts to tackle this problem by analyzing the system in the real space by using ideas of local neighbors and broken symmetries of the crystalline state. In this paper, we propose a heuristic solution to this problem by detecting all possible unit cells directly from particle coordinates obtained in a typical computer simulation. The method is based on well known facts about crystal structures, some of which are underutilized in the context of the current problem. These include, the symmetry of the coordination polyhedron and its empirical relationship with directions of lattice vectors for a simple Bravais lattice, and the fact that any complex crystal can be systematically decomposed into multiple Bravais lattices. By using these ideas, along with standard computational techniques like search, clustering and convex hull construction, we were able to handle complex basis and construct all crystallographically viable unit cells from the coordinates. The method is capable of handling statistical noise by employing certain cutoffs and deals with multicomponent systems in a transparent manner. We validated it on real Monte Carlo simulation data and variety of test systems, including crystals with tens of particles in the basis. Our heuristic algorithm, which requires minimal human intervention and computational resources, provides a solution to the long standing problem and would be beneficial to the wider communities of condensed matter physics and computational materials science.</description>

      <title>Variationally optimizing infinite projected entangled-pair states at large bond dimensions: A split corner transfer matrix renormalization group approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10298v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Projected entangled-pair states (PEPS) have become a powerful tool for studying quantum many-body systems in the condensed matter and quantum materials context, particularly with advances in variational energy optimization methods. A key challenge within this framework is the computational cost associated with the contraction of the two-dimensional lattice, crucial for calculating state vector norms and expectation values. The conventional approach, using the corner transfer matrix renormalization group (CTMRG), involves combining two tensor network layers, resulting in significant time and memory demands. In this work, we introduce an alternative "split-CTMRG" algorithm, which maintains separate PEPS layers and leverages new environment tensors, reducing computational complexity while preserving accuracy. Benchmarks on quantum lattice models demonstrate substantial speedups for variational energy optimization, rendering this method valuable for large-scale PEPS simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18977v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diamond lattice magnets, formed by a framework of corner-sharing tetrahedra of magnetic cations, offer unique opportunities to realize novel states of matter for potential utility in information technology. However, research has mostly focused on AB2X4 spinels with Td magnetic ions. This hinders the atomically enabled tunability of competing interactions at different energy scales and the ability to harness many-body electronic states in quantum materials, making the discovery of quantum fluctuations and spin dynamics less accessible. We discover a new material CaCo2TeO6 featuring a diamond lattice of two distinct Oh-Co2+ sites. This material displays strong quantum fluctuations, increased competing magnetic exchange interactions, and field-induced tunability of magnetic structures. The results demonstrate how simple, fundamental refinements in ligand fields can profoundly influence the phase space of quantum matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22476v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the past two decades, 2D materials have rapidly evolved into a diverse and expanding family of material platforms. Many members of this materials class have demonstrated their potential to deliver transformative impact on fundamental research and technological applications across different fields. In this roadmap, we provide an overview of the key aspects of 2D material research and development, spanning synthesis, properties and commercial applications. We specifically present roadmaps for high impact 2D materials, including graphene and its derivatives, transition metal dichalcogenides, MXenes as well as their heterostructures and moir\'e systems. The discussions are organized into thematic sections covering emerging research areas (e.g., twisted electronics, moir\'e nano-optoelectronics, polaritronics, quantum photonics, and neuromorphic computing), breakthrough applications in key technologies (e.g., 2D transistors, energy storage, electrocatalysis, filtration and separation, thermal management, flexible electronics, sensing, electromagnetic interference shielding, and composites) and other important topics (computational discovery of novel materials, commercialization and standardization). This roadmap focuses on the current research landscape, future challenges and scientific and technological advances required to address, with the intent to provide useful references for promoting the development of 2D materials.</description>

Abstract: We present the computation of the scattering of light by a nonlinear slab under conical incidence and arbitrary polarization. We consider an anisotropic slab, fully described by its susceptibility tensors; as a result, the full vector problem must be considered. The two-dimensional problem is reduced to a one-dimensional problem using symmetry arguments, which is then solved by an iterative process using the finite element method. Energetic considerations are also addressed. Several numerical experiments involving a KTP slab are presented, including the incident TE and TM cases.</description>

      <title>PINN-MEP: Continuous Neural Representations for Minimum-Energy Path Discovery in Molecular Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16381v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Characterizing conformational transitions in physical systems remains a fundamental challenge in the computational sciences. Traditional sampling methods like molecular dynamics (MD) or MCMC often struggle with the high-dimensional nature of molecular systems and the high energy barriers of transitions between stable states. While these transitions are rare events in simulation timescales, they often represent the most biologically significant processes - for example, the conformational change of an ion channel protein from its closed to open state, which controls cellular ion flow and is crucial for neural signaling. Such transitions in real systems may take milliseconds to seconds but could require months or years of continuous simulation to observe even once. We present a method that reformulates transition path generation as a continuous optimization problem solved through physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) inspired by string methods for minimum-energy path (MEP) generation. By representing transition paths as implicit neural functions and leveraging automatic differentiation with differentiable molecular dynamics force fields, our method enables the efficient discovery of physically realistic transition pathways without requiring expensive path sampling. We demonstrate our method's effectiveness on two proteins, including an explicitly hydrated bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) system with over 8,300 atoms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16816v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A simple closed-form formula for the period of a pendulum with finite amplitude is proposed. It reproduces the exact analytical forms both in the small and large amplitude limits, while in the mid-amplitude range maintains average error of 0.06% and maximum error of 0.17%. The accuracy should be sufficient for typical engineering applications. Its unique simplicity should be useful in a theoretical development that requires trackable mathematical framework or in an introductory physics course that aims to discuss a finite amplitude pendulum. A simple and formally exact solution of angular displacement for the full range of amplitudes is illustrated.</description>
