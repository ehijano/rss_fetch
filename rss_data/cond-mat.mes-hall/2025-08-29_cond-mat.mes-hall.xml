      <title>Nonlinear Hall effect in topological Dirac semimetals in parallel magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the second-harmonic response of two-dimensional topological Dirac semimetals subjected to an external in-plane magnetic field. The quantum kinetic equation for the Wigner distribution function is derived and then solved to evaluate the second-order electric-field contributions to the current density. Both the Berry curvature dipole and the field-induced terms in the current are analyzed across a broad range of model parameters. We propose that our theory can be tested experimentally by measuring the dependence of the anomalous Hall resistivity on the in-plane magnetic field in the surface states of the topological insulator SnTe, in WTe$_2$ and WSe$_2$ monolayers, as well as in the Kondo lattice material Ce$_3$Bi$_4$Pd$_3$ at very low temperatures.</description>

      <title>Long-range spatial extension of exciton states in van der Waals heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Narrow lines in photoluminescence (PL) spectra of excitons are characteristic of low-dimensional semiconductors. These lines correspond to the emission of exciton states in local minima of a potential energy landscape formed by fluctuations of the local exciton environment in the heterostructure. The spatial extension of such states was in the nanometer range. In this work, we present studies of narrow lines in PL spectra of spatially indirect excitons (IXs) in a MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ van der Waals heterostructure. The narrow lines vanish with increasing IX density. The disappearance of narrow lines correlates with the onset of IX transport, indicating that the narrow lines correspond to localized exciton states. The narrow lines extend over distances reaching several micrometers and over areas reaching ca. ten percent of the sample area. This macroscopic spatial extension of the exciton states, corresponding to the narrow lines, indicates a deviation of the exciton energy landscape from random potential and shows that the excitons are confined in moir\'e potential with a weak disorder.</description>

      <title>When Dephasing Fails: Thermodynamic Consequences of Decoherence Models in Quantum Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how decoherence influences heat and information flow is essential for realizing the promise of quantum technologies. Two widely used models for incorporating decoherence in quantum transport are the voltage probe (VP), which imposes local charge current conservation, and the voltage-temperature probe (VTP), which also conserves heat current. Although these models are often treated as functionally equivalent, we demonstrate that this equivalence actually exists only under highly symmetric conditions, which may be challenging to achieve experimentally Under asymmetric coupling or thermal bias, the VTP respects thermodynamic constraints and enforces decoherence in both charge and heat channels, while the VP instead acts as a source or sink of heat. Strikingly, the VP can fail to model decoherence in the heat transport entirely, even with large probe coupling strengths. Using a benzene-based molecular junction as a realistic example, we show that these effects significantly impact the predicted heat transport. These results establish that the VP and VTP models are not interchangeable: only the VTP provides a thermodynamically consistent framework for modeling decoherence in quantum transport.</description>

      <title>Quantum Interference Supernodes, Thermoelectric Enhancement, and the Role of Dephasing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum interference (QI) can strongly enhance thermoelectric response, with higher-order "supernodes" predicted to yield scalable gains in thermopower and efficiency. A central question, however, is whether such features are intrinsically more fragile to dephasing. Using $B\"uttiker$ voltage-temperature probes, we establish an order-selection rule: the effective near-node order is set by the lowest among coherent and probe-assisted channels. Supernodes are therefore fragile in an absolute sense because their transmission is parametrically suppressed with order. However, once an incoherent floor dominates, the fractional suppression of thermopower, efficiency, and figure of merit becomes universal and order-independent. Illustrating these principles with benzene- and biphenyl-based junction calculations, we show that the geometry of environmental coupling -- through a single orbital or across many -- dictates whether coherence is lost by order reduction or by floor building. These results yield general scaling rules for the thermoelectric response of interference nodes under dephasing.</description>

      <title>Topological invariant responsible for the stability of the Fermi surfaces in non - homogeneous systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The topological invariant responsible for the stability of Fermi point/Fermi surface in homogeneous systems is expressed through the one particle Green function, which depends on momentum. It is given by an integral over the 3D hypersurface in momentum space surrounding the Fermi surface. Notion of Fermi surface may be extended to the non - homogeneous systems using Wigner - Weyl calculus. The Fermi surface becomes coordinate dependent, it may be defined as the position of the singularity in momentum space of the Wigner transformed Green function. Then the topological invariant responsible for the stability of this Fermi surface is given by the same expression as for the homogeneous case, in which the Green function is replaced by its Wigner transformation while the ordinary products are replaced by the Moyal products. We illustrate the proposed construction by the examples of the systems, in which the given topological invariant is nontrivial and may be calculated explicitly.</description>

      <title>Subspace-Protected Topological Phases and Bulk-Boundary Correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While tremendous research has revealed that symmetry enriches topological phases of matter, more general principles that protect topological phases have yet to be explored. In this Letter, we elucidate the roles of subspaces in free-fermionic topological phases. A subspace property for Hamiltonians enables us to define new topological invariants. They result in peculiar topological boundary phenomena, i.e., the emergence of an unpaired zero mode or zero-winding skin modes, characterizing subspace-protected topological phases. We establish and demonstrate the bulk-boundary correspondence in subspace-protected topological phases. We further discuss the interplay of the subspace property and internal symmetries. Toward application, we also propose possible platforms possessing the subspace property.</description>

      <title>Gate-tunable nonreciprocal thermoelectric effects on the surface states of topological insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermoelectric devices at the nanoscale offer promising routes for on-chip refrigeration and waste-heat recovery, yet most semiconductor-based implementations suffer from limited tunability and narrow operational ranges. We introduce a highly flexible thermoelectric platform based on a ballistic junction formed by two gate-tunable regions of a topological insulator surface state bridged by a magnetic barrier. We theoretically demonstrate that such device exhibits strong electrical control over both refrigeration and thermoelectric power generation via side gates. We exploit the interplay between strong spin-orbit coupling and magnetism to achieve pronounced nonreciprocal transport, asymmetric cooling and tunable diode-like behavior. To demonstrate experimental feasibility, we further analyze refrigeration efficiency and phonon-limited performance in realistic material settings.</description>

      <title>Quantum melting a Wigner crystal into Hall liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experiments have shown that, counterintuitively, applying a magnetic field to a Wigner crystal can induce quantum Hall effects. In this work, using variational Monte Carlo, we show that magnetic fields can melt zero-field Wigner crystals into integer quantum Hall liquids. This melting originates from quantum oscillations in the liquid's ground state energy, which develops downward cusps at integer filling factors due to incompressibility. Our calculations establish a range of densities in which this quantum melting transition occurs.</description>

      <title>Optical Response by Time-Varying Plasmonic Nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The temporal modulation of material parameters enables optical amplification within linear media. Here we consider the fundamental building block of plasmonics, a subwavelength metal nanoparticle, and study how temporal modulation alters the optical response of the frequency-dispersive scatterers. We show that modulating in time leads to Floquet replicas of the localized surface plasmon resonance of the nanoparticle, which can result in light amplification. We propose a model based on a point-like dipole description of the time-varying frequency-dispersive nanoparticle that fully captures the radiative and amplifying properties of the system in the subwavelength regime. By comparing our simplified model to full Floquet-Mie scattering calculations, we demonstrate that the optical scattering by the nanoparticle is accurately described by an analytical two-band model. This allows us to introduce a two-frequency effective polarizability that fully incorporates the properties of the localized surface plasmon and its amplifying replica, as well as their interaction. In addition, we analyze the emergence of the parametric amplification condition for the modulated nanoparticle, showing that amplification can be obtained in a broad range of parameters.</description>

      <title>Sub-Nanometer Interfacial Hydrodynamics: The Interplay of Interfacial Viscosity and Surface Friction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For an accurate description of nanofluidic systems, it is crucial to account for the transport properties of liquids at surfaces on sub-nanometer scales, where classical hydrodynamics fails due to the finite range of surface-liquid interactions and modifications of the local viscosity. We show how to account for both via generalized, position-dependent surface-friction and interfacial viscosity profiles, which enables the accurate description of interfacial flow on the nanoscale using the Stokes equation. Such profiles are extracted from non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations of water on polar, non-polar, fluorinated, and unfluorinated alkane and alcohol self-assembled monolayers of widely varying wetting characteristics. Power-law relationships among the Navier friction coefficient, interfacial viscosity excess, and depletion length are revealed, and these are each found to be exponential in the work of adhesion. Our framework forms the basis for describing sub-nanometer fluid flow at interfaces with implications for electrokinetics, biophysics, and nanofluidics.</description>

      <title>Dichography: Two-frame Ultrafast Imaging from a Single Diffraction Pattern</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: X-ray free-electron lasers can nowadays deliver pairs of ultrabright, ultrashort light pulses with controllable delays at different photon energies. When combined with diffraction experiments, the interaction of these pulses with a sample at different times can produce two snapshots of an evolving system, enabling spatial and temporal resolution of ultrafast dynamics in nanomatter at and beyond the terahertz time scale. However, light detectors are orders of magnitude slower. The diffraction signals from the two pulses overlap in the recorded data and cannot be separated using currently available analysis methods. Here, we address this challenge by introducing Dichography, a diffraction imaging technique that restores the two unique views of the sample from superimposed scattering signals. We apply Dichography to experimental diffraction patterns of isolated xenon-doped superfluid helium nanodroplets, imaged using time-delayed, two-color X-ray pulses at intensities near the detection limit. The reconstructed images provide evidence of the survival of the xenon structures up to 750 fs after the interaction with the first shot. The capabilities of Dichography are further explored by applying the method to data from a second experiment, in which we retrieve the images of two distinct silver nanoparticles intercepted by the same light pulse. Dichography enables a new class of experiments for spatially and temporally resolving ultrafast phenomena, making a significant step toward the original promise of X-ray free-electron lasers to capture ultrafast movies of nanomatter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose extended s-wave altermagnets (sAMs) as a class of magnetic states which are fully gapped, spin-compensated, and feature spin-polarized bands. sAMs are formed through valley-exchange symmetries, which act as momentum-space translations beyond standard crystallographic spin-group classifications. Using an effective two-valley model, we demonstrate that sAMs exhibit isotropic spin splitting, enable spin-selective transport in tailored heterostructures, and give rise to descendant pair density wave order. From a microscopic sAM minimal model, we develop the guiding principles to identify sAMs in quantum magnets.</description>

      <title>Topological photonics in nanoscaled systems with far field radiation and polarization singularities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topology is a powerful framework for controlling and manipulating light, minimizing detrimental perturbations on the photonic properties. Combining nanophotonics with topological concepts presents opportunities for both fundamental physics and technological applications. Although most topological photonic realizations have been inspired by condensed-matter analogue models, new topological ideas have just begun to be realized at the nanoscale. Nanophotonics is characterized by subtle phenomena that are not usually considered in other topological models' realizations, such as nonlocality, strong field confinement, and light radiating to the far-field continuum. In this perspective, we will discuss how standard topological band theory for photonic crystals needs to be extended by a more comprehensive approach that properly treats such nanophotonic intrinsic effects and, in particular, the interplay of polarization and far-field radiation. We highlight the emerging role that polarization singularities might play in defining the topological invariants in the far field, which are not fully captured by bulk observables alone. We conclude by outlining a set of open questions and promising directions for exploring novel concepts in topological nanophotonics and shaping next-generation photonic devices.</description>

      <title>Revival of Layered Ferroelectrics in Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Layered perovskites are a versatile class of ferroelectrics with their structural anisotropy reflected in unusual electrostatics that give rise to exceptional ferroelectric properties. These materials fall into four main families: Aurivillius, Carpy-Galy, Ruddlesden-Popper, and Dion-Jacobson phases; each forming natural superlattices by interleaving perovskite slabs with spacer layers. For a long time, these materials were considered too structurally complex to prepare as high-quality thin films. However, recent breakthroughs in deposition and advanced characterization have made it possible to stabilize high-quality films with atomic precision, uncovering a wide range of unconventional ferroelectric functionalities. These include robust in-plane polarization without a critical thickness, the emergence of charged domain walls and non-trivial polar textures, resilience to doping with magnetic ions and charge carriers, and possibility to epitaxially integrate them into standard perovskite heterostructures. This review aims to unify current knowledge on the fabrication and characterization of layered ferroelectric thin films, and to present research findings across all four structural families, with the goal of highlighting their common features despite differences in crystal structure and polarization mechanisms. We also discuss promising research directions, including polar metallicity, (alter-)magnetoelectricity, exfoliation, and soft-chemistry-driven phase transformations, with the goal of consolidating the field and encouraging further exploration of these materials for both fundamental studies and applications.</description>

Abstract: Single-photon sources operating in the telecom band are fundamental components for long-distance optical quantum communication and information processing. Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) offer a promising platform for such sources, but their development has been hindered by limited spectral range and poor single-photon indistinguishability. Here, we demonstrate a reproducible and systematic approach for generating near-infrared (1090-1200 nm) quantum emitters in bilayer MoTe$_2$ using deterministic strain and defect engineering. These emitters exhibit strong linear polarization (DOLP $&gt;70\%$), sub-nanosecond lifetimes ($\tau \leqslant$ ~450 ps), high single-photon purity ($g^{(2)}(0)&lt;0.1$), and resolution-limited emission ($\sim$200 $\mu$eV). Electrostatic biasing enables Stark tuning over a $\sim$3 meV range, reduced photon bunching, and significantly shortened radiative lifetimes, yielding narrow emission with ratios of experimental to transform-limited linewidths as low as $R\sim55$. Most notably, two-photon interference measurements reveal a Hong-Ou-Mandel visibility of $V_\text{HOM}\sim $10$\%$, and up to $V_\text{HOM}\sim$ 40$\%$ with post-selection by temporal filtering, representing the highest reported indistinguishability for any TMD quantum emitters and the first such demonstration in the near-infrared regime. These results establish MoTe$_2$ as a viable platform for tunable, low-noise, high-purity single-photon sources with promising indistinguishability, paving the way for their integration into telecom-compatible quantum photonic technologies.</description>

Abstract: Ferroelectric thin films present a powerful platform for next generation computing and memory applications. However, domain morphology and dynamics in buried ferroelectric stacks have remained underexplored, despite the importance for real device performance. Here, nanoprobe X-ray diffraction (nano-XRD) is used to image ferroelectric domains inside BiFeO3-based capacitors, revealing striking differences from bare films such as local disorder in domain architecture and partial polarization reorientation. We demonstrate sensitivity to ferroelectric reversal in poled capacitors, revealing expansive/compressive (001) strain for up-/down-polarization using nano-XRD. We observe quantitative and qualitative differences between poling by piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) and in devices. Further, biasing induces lattice tilt at electrode edges which may modify performance in down-scaled devices. Direct comparison with PFM polarized structures even demonstrates potential nano-XRD sensitivity to domain walls. Our results establish nano-XRD as a noninvasive probe of buried ferroelectric domain morphologies and dynamics, opening avenues for operando characterization of energy-efficient nanoscale devices.</description>

      <title>Control of polarization and polar chiral textures in BiFeO$_3$ by epitaxial strain and interfacial chemistry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The balance between interfacial chemistry, electrostatics, and epitaxial strain plays a crucial role in stabilizing polarization in ferroelectric thin films. Here, we bring these contributions into competition in BiFeO$_3$ (BFO) thin films grown on the charged-surface-terminated La$_{0.7}$Sr$_{0.3}$MnO$_3$ (LSMO)-buffered NdGaO$_3$ (001) substrates. The large anisotropic compressive strain from the substrate promotes the formation of ferroelectric domains despite the expected stabilization of a uniform out-of-plane polarization by the (La,Sr)O$^{0.7+}$ termination of the metallic buffer. Piezoresponse force microscopy and scanning transmission electron microscopy reveal that the resulting nanoscale domain architecture is stabilized by the deterministic formation of a fluorite-like Bi$_2$O$_2$ surface layer on regions polarized oppositely to the LSMO-imposed polarization orientation. Leveraging this polarization compensation mechanism, we stabilize a uniform out-of-plane polarization in our highly strained BFO films by inserting a Bi$_2$O$_2$-terminated Aurivillius film as a buffer layer. Additionally, we reveal signatures of homochiral polarization textures in our BFO films on the level of domain configurations using local polarization switching experiments. Our work thus brings new strategies for controlling polarization direction and chiral textures in oxide ferroelectrics, opening pathways for functional domain-wall and domain-based electronics.</description>

      <title>Bohr--Sommerfeld rules for systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a complete, self-contained formulation of the Bohr--Sommerfeld quantization rule for a semiclassical self-adjoint $2 \times 2$ system on the real line, arising from a simple closed curve in phase space. We focus on the case where the principal symbol exhibits eigenvalue crossings within the domain enclosed by the curve -- a situation commonly encountered in Dirac-type operators. Building on earlier work on scalar Bohr--Sommerfeld rules and semiclassical treatments of the Harper operator near rational flux quanta, we identify additional contributions to the quantization condition, and derive concise expressions for general self-adjoint $2 \times 2$ systems. The resulting formulas give explicit geometric phase corrections and clarify when these phases take quantized values.</description>

      <title>Controlled spin-to-charge conversion in noncollinear antiferromagnet-based Py/Mn$_{3}$Pt heterostructure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Noncollinear antiferromagnets (NCAFs) have recently emerged as promising candidates for future spintronic technologies, offering ultrafast switching, negligible stray fields allowing dense packing, and robustness against external magnetic perturbations. When interfaced with ferromagnets (FMs), they can strongly influence interfacial exchange and spin-torque mechanisms that enable manipulating magnetic order and realizing functionalities beyond conventional heavy metals (HMs) based FM/HM heterostructures. Here, we perform a broadband ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) study to systematically investigate the magnetization dynamics and spin-to-charge conversion in permalloy (Py) and Mn$_3$Pt bilayers. High-quality Py films provide a well-defined FMR spectra with a low Gilbert damping parameter ( $\alpha_{\mathrm{eff}} \approx 9.8 \times 10^{-3}$). We observe a pronounced enhancement of damping with intrinsic value $\alpha_{\mathrm{int}} \approx 3.1 \times 10^{-2}$ in the Py/Mn$_3$Pt bilayer, indicating efficient spin pumping into the NCAF layer. Frequency dependent linewidth analysis shows a predominantly Gilbert type damping in the bilayers and the corresponding effective spin-mixing conductance ( $g^{\uparrow\downarrow}_{\mathrm{eff}} \approx 4.8 \times 10^{18}$m$^{-2}$) is comparable to that of other high-performance antiferromagnetic heterostructures. These results are significant for establishing NCAFs as a candidate material for spin generation and highlights the potential of Py/Mn$_3$Pt bilayers for efficient and ultrafast spintronic applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular building blocks provide a versatile platform for realising exotic quantum phases. Using charge neutral, pure carbon fullerene molecules as an example, we design altermagnetic C$_{40}$ monolayers in Shastry-Sutherland lattice. The resonance structure of one unpaired electron leads to an effective spin-1/2 cluster on both long sides of the molecule, which, after rotating into a 2D rutile-like crystal structure, forms altermagnetic ground state. We show $d$-wave spitting of the spin-polarised electronic band structure and strong chiral-split magnon bands. Most interestingly, the effective spin-1/2 clusters form the Shastry-Sutherland model with a rich phase diagram including altermagenti, quantum spin liquid, plaquette, and dimer phases, which can be easily accessed to via moderate bi-axial strains. Our findings present magnetic fullerene monolayers as a tunable platform for exotic quantum magnetism and spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Origin of Detachable Boundary States in Topological Insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09458v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While topology can impose obstructions to exponentially localized Wannier functions, certain topological insulators are exempt from such Wannier obstructions. The absence of the Wannier obstructions can further accompany topological boundary states that are detachable from the bulk bands. Here, we elucidate a close connection between these detachable topological boundary states and non-Hermitian topology. Identifying topological boundary states as non-Hermitian topology, we demonstrate that intrinsic non-Hermitian topology leads to the inevitable spectral flow. By contrast, we show that extrinsic non-Hermitian topology underlies the detachment of topological boundary states and clarify anti-Hermitian topology of the detached boundary states. Based on this connection and $K$-theory, we complete the tenfold classification of Wannier localizability and detachable topological boundary states.</description>

      <title>$K$-theory classification of Wannier localizability and detachable topological boundary states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18273v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A hallmark of certain topology, including the Chern number, is the obstruction to constructing exponentially localized Wannier functions in the bulk bands. Conversely, other types of topology do not necessarily impose Wannier obstructions. Remarkably, such Wannier-localizable topological insulators can host boundary states that are detachable from the bulk bands. In our accompanying Letter [D. Nakamura {\it et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. 135, 096601 (2025), arXiv:2407.09458], we demonstrate that non-Hermitian topology underlies detachable boundary states in Hermitian topological insulators and superconductors, thereby establishing their tenfold classification based on internal symmetry. Here, using $K$-theory, we elucidate the relationship between Wannier localizability and detachability of topological boundary states. From the boundary perspective, we classify intrinsic and extrinsic non-Hermitian topology, corresponding to nondetachable and detachable topological boundary states, respectively. From the bulk perspective, on the other hand, we classify Wannier localizability through the homomorphisms of topological phases from the tenfold Altland-Zirnbauer symmetry classes to the threefold Wigner-Dyson symmetry classes. Notably, these two approaches from the boundary and bulk perspectives lead to the same classification. We clarify this agreement and develop a unified understanding of the bulk-boundary correspondence on the basis of $K$-theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00801v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interacting resonant level model (IRLM) is the simplest quantum impurity model to display strongly correlated effects in mesoscopic systems, which triggered its extensive theoretical study. However, to date, there have not been any realizations of the model with controllable interaction parameter, and thus the detailed predictions could not be confirmed. Here we use a recently developed approach to Anderson orthogonality catastrophe physics, using a charge detector coupled to a quantum dot (QD) system, to devise a simple experimental system which could display IRLM behavior and detail its predictions. At the same time, the mapping to IRLM allows us to determine the interaction parameter of the charge detector using simple experimental probes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04047v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the theory of the fractional quantum Hall effect (QHE) proposed a long time ago by Lopez and Fradkin \cite{Fradkin1991chern} to describe the principal Jain series. The magnetic fluxes of the statistical gauge field attached to electrons remain at rest in the reference frame moving together with the electron liquid. In the laboratory reference frame the electric field of the statistical gauge field forms and screens the external electric field. The fractional QHE conductivity appears as a consequence of this screening already on the mean field theory level. We consider a relativistic extension of the model, and propose an alternative description of the fractional QHE based on macroscopic motion of the electron liquid within the Zubarev statistical operator approach. It is this macroscopic motion of electrons which in this pattern gives rise to the fractional QHE. Within this approach we propose the proof to all orders of perturbation theory that the interaction corrections cannot change the above mentioned mean field theory result for the QHE conductivity.</description>

Abstract: Gate-tunable transmon qubits are based on quantum conductors used as weak links within hybrid Josephson junctions. These gatemons have been implemented in just a handful of systems, all relying on extended conductors, namely epitaxial semiconductors or exfoliated graphene. Here we present the coherent control of a gatemon based on a single molecule, a one-dimensional carbon nanotube, which is integrated into a circuit quantum electrodynamics architecture. The measured qubit spectrum can be tuned with a gate voltage and reflects the quantum dot behaviour of the nanotube. Our ultraclean integration, using a hexagonal boron nitride substrate, results in record coherence times of 200ns for carbon nanotube-based qubits. Furthermore, we investigate its decoherence mechanisms, thus revealing a strong gate dependence and identifying charge noise as a limiting factor. On top of positioning carbon nanotubes as contenders for future quantum technologies, our work paves the way for studying microscopic fermionic processes in low-dimensional quantum conductors.</description>

      <title>Measuring work in quantum many-body systems using a dynamical "work agent"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20729v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a generic quantum many-body system initiated at thermal equilibrium and driven by an external parameter, and discuss the prospect for measuring the work done by the varying parameter on the system. While existing methods are based on a full control of the system's Hamiltonian and are thus limited to few-level quantum systems, measuring work in many-body quantum systems remains challenging. Our approach relies on transforming the external parameter into a dynamical ``work agent", for which we consider an harmonic oscillator in a semiclassical coherent state with a large photon number. We define a work generating function which coincides with the standard two-point measurement protocol for work measurement in the limit of a large photon number. While \emph{in principle} it allows to relate the moments of work $\langle W^n \rangle$ to observables of the work agent, we focus on the average work, which is obtained from energy conservation by the change of the energy of the agent, which can be measured using photon number detection. We illustrate this concept on a transmon-microcavity system, which displays various quantum coherent effects including Landau-Zener St\"{u}kelberg interference and collapse and revival of Rabi oscillations. We discuss how our setup allows to measure work in a variety of quantum many-body systems.</description>

Abstract: Excitons in two dimensional Ruddlesden Popper perovskites (RPPs) exhibit large and tunable binding energies, making them promising candidates for optoelectronic applications. In particular, long-range exciton energy transfer in these materi-als holds potential for light-harvesting technologies and nanoscale interconnects. Here, using cathodoluminescence spectros-copy, we demonstrate that exciton energy can be transferred over ultralong distances, up to 150 micrometers, in heterostructures composed of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) and RPPs. This transfer is enabled by efficient exciton coupling to defect centers in hBN and subsequent defect defect interactions. This mechanism not only facilitates long-range energy transfer, but also leads to enhanced luminescence intensity, narrower emission linewidths, extended exciton lifetimes, and reduced electron-beam-induced degradation. Owing to the high density of emitters within the hBN layers, the investigated van der Waals heterostructure emerges as a robust and stable hybrid platform. Our findings open promising pathways for room-temperature excitonic devices with enhanced performance, including quantum transducers, light-harvesting systems, and optoelectronic interconnects.</description>

      <title>Fractional Chern insulator states in an isolated flat band of zero Chern number</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09009v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A flat band with Chern number $C=0$, and well isolated from the rest of Hilbert space by a gap much larger than interaction strength, is a context that has not been regarded as relevant for fractional quantum Hall physics. In this work, we demonstrate the emergence of the fractional Chern insulator (FCI) states in such a trivial flat band, using large-scale exact diagonalization (ED) and infinite density matrix renormalization group (iDMRG) simulations. The $C=0$ isolated flat band is hosted by an anisotropic fluxed dice lattice. Both the quantum metric and Berry curvature of the $C=0$ flat band have a sharp peak at the $\Gamma$ point, whereas in the rest of the Brillouin zone (BZ) they mimic the quantum geometry of the lowest Landau level. We consider nearest-neighbor repulsion that is weak enough to ensure the isolated-band limit is always satisfied. From the projected ED simulations at $\nu_\mathrm{F}=2/3$ electron filling of the flat band (i.e. $1/3$ hole filling), we find the unexpected FCI with 3-fold ground-state degeneracy and $\sigma_\mathrm{H}=-1/3 (e^2/h)$. The momentum space carrier distribution shows that the quantum metric peak tends to push the interacting holes away from $\Gamma$ point towards the BZ regions with the nearly ``ideal'' quantum geometry, underlying the formation of FCI in the $C=0$ flat band. Besides, when tuning the single-particle anisotropy such that the quantum geometry of the $C=0$ flat band becomes less sharp around $\Gamma$, we find the ground state becomes a charge density wave with tripled unit cell at $\nu_\mathrm{F}=2/3$. Our two-band iDMRG simulations further corroborate the FCI in the isolated $C=0$ flat band, demonstrating in such parameter regime the fractionally quantized charge pumping upon flux insertion as well as the momentum-resolved entanglement spectrum characteristic of the $1/3$ Laughlin state.</description>

Abstract: We report on the experimental study of the spectrum of plasma excitations in a plasmonic crystal fabricated from the two-dimensional electron system in an AlGaAs/GaAs semiconductor heterostructure. We perform a comprehensive research on the mode frequency and relaxation as a function of the gate width across different plasmonic crystal periods. Importantly, we develop an analytical approach that accurately describes the behavior of plasma excitations in plasmonic crystals, providing new insights into the fundamental physics of plasmonic systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08239v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum geometric tensor (QGT) of a quantum system in a given parameter space captures both the geometry of the state manifold and the topology of the system. While the local QGT elements have been successfully measured in various platforms, the challenge of detecting them in electronic transport systems - such as tunnel or molecular junctions - has yet to be resolved. To fill this gap, we propose a measurement protocol based on weak and resonant parameter modulations, and theoretically demonstrate how the local QGT in such systems can be directly probed from changes of the tunnel conductance. This approach enables the measurement of both geometrical and topological features of quantum states in a broad class of transport-based quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Realization and characterization of an all-bands-flat electrical lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13571v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct an electrical all-bands-flat (ABF) lattice and experimentally generate compact localized states (CLSs) therein. The lattice is a diamond (rhombic) chain and implemented as a network of capacitors and inductors, as well as voltage inverters (using operational amplifiers) in order to introduce a \(\pi\)-phase flux within each diamond. The network's normal modes split into three flat bands, and the corresponding CLSs can be excited in isolation via a two-node driving at the flat band frequencies. We also examine the role of the lattice edges and their interaction with the CLSs. Finally, we compare the experimental results to tight-binding predictions and obtain very good agreement. This analysis paves the way for further experimental implementations of ABF systems in electric networks, especially with an eye towards exploring their interplay with nonlinearity.</description>

      <title>Room temperature giant magnetoresistance detection of spin hall nano-oscillator dynamics in synthetic antiferromagnetic Spin-Valve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18770v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conventional spin Hall nano-oscillators (SHNOs) face fundamental power limitations due to the low anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR &lt; 0.3%) of ferromagnetic layers. To address this, we developed a synthetic antiferromagnetic spin-valve (SAF-SV) heterostructure [Ta/NiFe/Ru/NiFe/Cu/NiFe/Hf/Pt] that enables efficient giant magnetoresistance (GMR)-based detection of SHNO dynamics at room temperature. The NiFe/Ru/NiFe SAF reference layer, operating in the spin-flop state, couples with the NiFe free layer through a Cu spacer to achieve a remarkable GMR ratio of 0.568% - exhibiting complete independence of magnetic field/current orientation. Spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance (ST-FMR) verifies that the ferromagnetic resonance linewidth of the free layer can be effectively modulated by dc current through the Pt heavy metal layer, while maintaining decoupled dynamics from the SAF layer. Thermal management via high-thermal-conductivity SiC substrates and AlN capping layers successfully mitigates current-shunting-induced Joule heating. Notably, stable auto-oscillation peaks are observed at 0.82 mA bias current, with oscillation frequency tunable by external magnetic field and potential dual-mode behavior at low fields. This work establishes a new paradigm for room-temperature, high-power spintronic oscillators, offering significant potential for neuromorphic computing and coherent RF communication applications.</description>

      <title>Origin of the hidden energy scale and the $f$-ratio in geometrically frustrated magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12966v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sufficiently clean geometrically frustrated (GF) magnets are the largest class of candidate materials that may host quantum spin liquids (QSLs). Some of them have been shown to exhibit spin-glass freezing, potentially precluding QSLs, at the "hidden energy scale", which is significantly lower than the microscopic energy scale of spin interactions. Here, we investigate the origin of the hidden energy scale and its relationship to the $f$-ratio, the figure of merit for the degree of frustration in GF magnetic materials. The available experimental and numerical data provide evidence that GF magnets display, universally, two distinct temperature scales in the specific heat, the lowest of which is of the order of the hidden energy scale $T^*$. We argue that this scale is determined by non-magnetic excitations, similar to spin exchanges in chains of spins. The collective entropy of such excitations matches the entropy of the ground states of the Ising model on the same lattice, which provides a way to verify the proposed scenario in experiment. We demonstrate that in the presence of quenched disorder, a broad class of materials exhibits spin-glass freezing at temperatures of order $T^*$, in accordance with experimental observations. As $T^*$ is a property of the clean GF medium, it leads to a constraint on the $f$-ratio.</description>

      <title>Photon State Evolution in Arbitrary Time-Varying Media</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04836v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the instantaneous eigenstate method to study the evolution of quantum states in media with arbitrary time-varying permittivity and permeability. This method leverages the Heisenberg equation to bypass the Schr\"odinger equation, which leads to a complicated infinite set of coupled differential equations. Instead, the method allows the computation of the state evolution by solving only two coupled differential equations. Using this approach, we draw general conclusions about photon statistics in time-varying media. Our findings reveal that the maximum probability of generating a single photon pair from vacuum in such media is 25%, while Bell states can be created with a maximum probability of 84%. Additionally, we demonstrate that the spectral profile of emitted photons can be precisely controlled through the temporal profiles of permittivity and permeability. These results provide deeper insights into photon state manipulation in time-varying media. Furthermore, the instantaneous eigenstate method opens new opportunities to study state evolution in other systems where the Heisenberg equation offers a more tractable solution than the Schr\"odinger equation.</description>

      <title>5d orbital Induced Room Temperature Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect in TbCl</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09970v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Following the experimental realization of Quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect in thin films of chromium-doped (Bi,Sb)$_2$Te$_3$, enhancing the work temperature of QAH effect has emerged as a significant and challenging task. Here we demonstrate monolayer TbCl as a promising candidate to realize the room temperature QAH effect. Using DFT+U method, double checked by HSE06 and DMFT calculations, we identify the Hall conductivity $G = -e^2/h$ per layer in three-dimensional ferromagnetic insulator TbCl, which is a weakly stacking of QAH layers. The monolayer TbCl inherits the magnetic and topological properties, exhibiting the QAH effect with Chern number $C$=-1. The large topological band gap reaches 42.8 meV, which is beyond room temperatue. The extended 5$d$ electrons lead to sizable exchange and superexchange interactions, resulting in a high Curie temperature $T_c$$\sim$457K. All these features demonstrate that monolayer TbCl will provide an ideal platform to realize the room temperature QAH effect.</description>

      <title>Type-II Antiferroelectricity</title>

Abstract: Antiferroelectricity (AFE) is a fundamental concept in physics and materials science. Conventional AFEs have the picture of alternating local electric dipoles defined in real space. Here, we discover a new class of AFEs, termed type-II AFEs, which possess opposite polarizations defined in momentum space across a pair of symmetry decoupled subspaces. Unlike conventional AFEs, the order parameter of type-II AFEs is rigorously formulated through Berry-phase theory and can be quantitatively extracted from the electronic band structure. Focusing on a subclass of type-II AFEs that preserve spin-rotation symmetry, we establish the relevant symmetry constraints and identify all compatible spin point groups. Remarkably, we find that type-II AFE order intrinsically coexists with antiferromagnetism, revealing a robust form of magnetoelectric coupling. We construct an altermagnetic model and identify several concrete antiferromagnetic/altermagnetic materials, such as FeS, Cr2O3, MgMnO3, monolayer MoICl2 and bilayer CrI3, that exhibit this novel ordering. Furthermore, we uncover unique physical phenomena associated with type-II spin-AFE systems, including spin current generation upon AFE switching and localized spin polarization at boundaries and domain walls. Our findings reveal a previously hidden class of quantum materials with intertwined ferroic orders, offering exciting opportunities for both fundamental exploration and technological applications.</description>

      <title>A Field-Theoretical Paradigm via Hierarchical Coarse-Graining: I. Generalized Mode Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20025v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multiscale computer simulations facilitate the efficient exploration of large spatiotemporal scales in chemical and physical systems. However, molecular simulations predominantly rely on particle-based representations, which become computationally prohibitive when applied beyond the molecular scale. Field-theoretical simulations have emerged as an alternative to overcome these limitations. Despite their applicability in mesoscopic simulations, these approaches are typically derived from top-down principles, leaving a gap in the bottom-up derivation of field-theoretical models for targeted molecular systems. This work presents a systematic strategy for constructing statistical field models for molecular liquids from the atomistic level, marking a critical step toward bridging particle-based and field-theoretical modeling techniques. By introducing molecular coarse-grained models as an intermediate step, this hierarchical approach reduces the complexity of the atomistic-to-field-theoretical transformation while preserving important microscopic structural correlations. We systematically derive field-theoretical models in reciprocal space for both canonical and grand canonical ensembles using the Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation. By incorporating additional fields for both positive and negative Fourier modes, our generalized mode theory extends the applicability of bottom-up field-theoretical models beyond the conventional Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation, which can be limited to positive Fourier modes. Furthermore, we introduce an efficient perturbative approach for approximating Fourier modes of molecular interactions, reducing computational cost and allowing for integrating complex molecular interactions into the field-theoretic description.</description>
