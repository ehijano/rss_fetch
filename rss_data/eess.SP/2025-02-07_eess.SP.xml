      <title>Decoding Human Attentive States from Spatial-temporal EEG Patches Using Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning the spatial topology of electroencephalogram (EEG) channels and their temporal dynamics is crucial for decoding attention states. This paper introduces EEG-PatchFormer, a transformer-based deep learning framework designed specifically for EEG attention classification in Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) applications. By integrating a Temporal CNN for frequency-based EEG feature extraction, a pointwise CNN for feature enhancement, and Spatial and Temporal Patching modules for organizing features into spatial-temporal patches, EEG-PatchFormer jointly learns spatial-temporal information from EEG data. Leveraging the global learning capabilities of the self-attention mechanism, it captures essential features across brain regions over time, thereby enhancing EEG data decoding performance. Demonstrating superior performance, EEG-PatchFormer surpasses existing benchmarks in accuracy, area under the ROC curve (AUC), and macro-F1 score on a public cognitive attention dataset.

      <title>UAV Cognitive Semantic Communications Enabled by Knowledge Graph for Robust Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are widely used for object detection. However, the existing UAV-based object detection systems are subject to severe challenges, namely, their limited computation, energy and communication resources, which limits the achievable detection performance. To overcome these challenges, a UAV cognitive semantic communication system is proposed by exploiting a knowledge graph. Moreover, we design a multi-scale codec for semantic compression to reduce data transmission volume while guaranteeing detection performance. Considering the complexity and dynamicity of UAV communication scenarios, a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) adaptive module with robust channel adaptation capability is introduced. Furthermore, an object detection scheme is proposed by exploiting the knowledge graph to overcome channel noise interference and compression distortion. Simulation results conducted on the practical aerial image dataset demonstrate that our proposed semantic communication system outperforms benchmark systems in terms of detection accuracy, communication robustness, and computation efficiency, especially in dealing with low bandwidth compression ratios and low SNR regimes.</description>

      <title>Compact Nested Hexagonal Metamaterial Sensor for High-Sensitivity Permittivity Characterization Across S and X-Band Frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents a Compact Nested Hexagonal Metamaterial Sensor designed for microwave sensing to characterize material permittivity in S and X-band applications. The proposed sensor attained compact dimensions of merely 30 mm x 30 mm x 0.79 mm. This innovative design technique employs a distinctive and compact architecture with elevated electromagnetic (EM) field strength, enhancing the precision of the sensing mechanism in the microwave frequency spectrum. The design geometry and dimensions attained resonance frequencies of 3.98 GHz and 11.57 GHz, with notch depths of -13.16129 dB and -10.23024 dB, respectively. The design evolution, metamaterial properties, equivalent circuit model, and electric (E) is delineated to elucidate the stopband features at the resonant frequency. The suggested sensor attains a very high sensitivity of 9.55% in transmission mode (S21) for a permittivity range of 1 to 6. The reflection and transmission properties of the proposed CRR-based sensor are validated by simulations using the mathematical equations of the design. Furthermore, the sensor's performance is corroborated by utilizing several dielectric materials (Roger R04350B, Roger RT5880 and FR-4). The computed outcomes demonstrate alignment with the simulated results. The compact, low-profile sensor design and its excellent sensitivity for characterizing material permittivity render the suggested sensor appropriate for permittivity sensing applications.</description>

      <title>Blind Capon Beamformer Based on Independent Component Extraction: Single-Parameter Algorithm,</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a phase-shift mixing model for linear sensor arrays in the context of blind source extraction. We derive a blind Capon beamformer that seeks the direction where the output is independent of the other signals in the mixture. The algorithm is based on Independent Component Extraction and imposes an orthogonal constraint, thanks to which it optimizes only one real-valued parameter related to the angle of arrival. The Cram\'er-Rao lower bound for the mean interference-to-signal ratio is derived. The algorithm and the bound are compared with conventional blind and direction-of-arrival estimation+beamforming methods, showing improvements in terms of extraction accuracy. An application is demonstrated in frequency-domain speaker extraction in a low-reverberation room.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Network Enabled Fluid Antenna Systems: A Two-Stage Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An emerging fluid antenna system (FAS) brings a new dimension, i.e., the antenna positions, to deal with the deep fading, but simultaneously introduces challenges related to the transmit design. This paper proposes an ``unsupervised learning to optimize" paradigm to optimize the FAS. Particularly, we formulate the sum-rate and energy efficiency (EE) maximization problems for a multiple-user multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO) FAS and solved by a two-stage graph neural network (GNN) where the first stage and the second stage are for the inference of antenna positions and beamforming vectors, respectively. The outputs of the two stages are jointly input into a unsupervised loss function to train the two-stage GNN. The numerical results demonstrates that the advantages of the FAS for performance improvement and the two-stage GNN for real-time and scalable optimization. Besides, the two stages can function separately.</description>

      <title>SWIPTNet: A Unified Deep Learning Framework for SWIPT based on GNN and Transfer Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the deep learning based approaches for simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT). The quality-of-service (QoS) constrained sum-rate maximization problems are, respectively, formulated for power-splitting (PS) receivers and time-switching (TS) receivers and solved by a unified graph neural network (GNN) based model termed SWIPT net (SWIPTNet). To improve the performance of SWIPTNet, we first propose a single-type output method to reduce the learning complexity and facilitate the satisfaction of QoS constraints, and then, utilize the Laplace transform to enhance input features with the structural information. Besides, we adopt the multi-head attention and layer connection to enhance feature extracting. Furthermore, we present the implementation of transfer learning to the SWIPTNet between PS and TS receivers. Ablation studies show the effectiveness of key components in the SWIPTNet. Numerical results also demonstrate the capability of SWIPTNet in achieving near-optimal performance with millisecond-level inference speed which is much faster than the traditional optimization algorithms. We also show the effectiveness of transfer learning via fast convergence and expressive capability improvement.</description>

      <title>ICGNN: Graph Neural Network Enabled Scalable Beamforming for MISO Interference Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the graph neural network (GNN)-enabled beamforming design for interference channels. We propose a model termed interference channel GNN (ICGNN) to solve a quality-of-service constrained energy efficiency maximization problem. The ICGNN is two-stage, where the direction and power parts of beamforming vectors are learned separately but trained jointly via unsupervised learning. By formulating the dimensionality of features independent of the transceiver pairs, the ICGNN is scalable with the number of transceiver pairs. Besides, to improve the performance of the ICGNN, the hybrid maximum ratio transmission and zero-forcing scheme reduces the output ports, the feature enhancement module unifies the two types of links into one type, the subgraph representation enhances the message passing efficiency, and the multi-head attention and residual connection facilitate the feature extracting. Furthermore, we present the over-the-air distributed implementation of the ICGNN. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of key components in the ICGNN. Numerical results also demonstrate the capability of ICGNN in achieving near-optimal performance with an average inference time less than 0.1 ms. The scalability of ICGNN for unseen problem sizes is evaluated and enhanced by transfer learning with limited fine-tuning cost. The results of the centralized and distributed implementations of ICGNN are illustrated.</description>

      <title>Semantic Feature Division Multiple Access for Digital Semantic Broadcast Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a digital semantic feature division multiple access (SFDMA) paradigm in multi-user broadcast (BC) networks for the inference and the image reconstruction tasks. In this SFDMA scheme, the multi-user semantic information is encoded into discrete approximately orthogonal representations, and the encoded semantic features of multiple users can be simultaneously transmitted in the same time-frequency resource. Specifically, for inference tasks, we design a SFDMA digital BC network based on robust information bottleneck (RIB), which can achieve a tradeoff between inference performance, data compression and multi-user interference. Moreover, for image reconstruction tasks, we develop a SFDMA digital BC network by utilizing a Swin Transformer, which significantly reduces multi-user interference. More importantly, SFDMA can protect the privacy of users' semantic information, in which each receiver can only decode its own semantic information. Furthermore, we establish a relationship between performance and signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR), which is fitted by an Alpha-Beta-Gamma (ABG) function. Furthermore, an optimal power allocation method is developed for the inference and reconstruction tasks. Extensive simulations verify the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed SFDMA scheme.</description>

      <title>Pre-Optimized Irregular Arrays versus Moveable Antennas in Multi-User MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems exploit the spatial diversity achieved with an array of many antennas to perform spatial multiplexing of many users. Similar performance can be achieved using fewer antennas if movable antenna (MA) elements are used instead. MA-enabled arrays can dynamically change the antenna locations, mechanically or electrically, to achieve maximum spatial diversity for the current propagation conditions. However, optimizing the antenna locations for each channel realization is computationally excessive, requires channel knowledge for all conceivable locations, and requires rapid antenna movements, thus making real-time implementation cumbersome. To overcome these challenges, we propose a pre-optimized irregular array (PIA) concept, where the antenna locations at the base station are optimized a priori for a given coverage area. The objective is to maximize the average sum rate and we take a particle swarm optimization approach to solve it. Simulation results show that PIA achieves performance comparable to MA-enabled arrays while outperforming traditional uniform arrays. Hence, PIA offers a fixed yet efficient array deployment approach without the complexities associated with MA-enabled arrays.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of BEM-based Channel Estimation for OTFS with Hardware Impairments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter studies the low-complexity channel estimation for orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) in the presence of hardware impairments. Firstly, to tackle the computational complexity of channel estimation, the basis expansion model (BEM) is utilized. Then, the mean square error (MSE) of the estimated channel is theoretically derived, revealing the effects of hardware impairments on channel estimation. Based on the estimated channel, the minimum mean square error (MMSE) detector is adopted to analyze the impacts of imperfect hardware on the bit error rate (BER). Finally, the numerical results validate the correctness of our theoretical analysis of the MSE for channel estimation and lower bound of the BER, and also demonstrate that even minor hardware impairments can significantly degrade the performance of the OTFS system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-destructive testing is an important technique for detecting defects in multi-layer materials, enabling the evaluation of structural integrity without causing damage on test materials. Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) offers unique capabilities for this purpose due to its sensitivity and resolution. Inspired by room geometry estimation methods in acoustic signal processing, this work proposes a novel approach for defect detection in multi-layer composite materials using THz-TDS, enhanced by high-power sources. The proposed method utilizes Euclidean distance matrices to reduce problem complexity compared to state-of-the-art approaches, and effectively distinguishes and maps higher-order reflections from sublayers, enabling precise defect localization in composite materials without artifacts.</description>

      <title>Beyond Diagonal RIS: A New Frontier for 6G Internet of Things Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) technology has emerged as a promising enabler for next-generation wireless networks, offering a paradigm shift from passive environments to programmable radio wave propagation. Despite the potential of diagonal RIS (D-RIS), its limited wave manipulation capability restricts performance gains. In this paper, we investigate the burgeoning concept of beyond-diagonal RIS (BD-RIS), which incorporates non-diagonal elements in its scattering matrix to deliver more fine-grained control of electromagnetic wavefronts. We begin by discussing the limitations of traditional D-RIS and introduce key BD-RIS architectures with different operating modes. We then highlight the features that make BD-RIS particularly advantageous for 6G IoT applications, including advanced beamforming, enhanced interference mitigation, and flexible coverage. A case study on BD-RIS-assisted vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication in an underlay cellular network demonstrates considerable improvements in spectral efficiency when compared to D-RIS and conventional systems. Lastly, we present current challenges such as hardware design complexity, channel estimation, and non-ideal hardware effects, and propose future research directions involving AI-driven optimization, joint communication and sensing, and physical layer security. Our findings illustrate the transformative potential of BD-RIS in shaping high-performance, scalable, and reliable 6G IoT networks.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Channel Modeling and Capacity Analysis for HMIMO Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advancements in emerging technologies, e.g., reconfigurable intelligent surfaces and holographic MIMO (HMIMO), facilitate unprecedented manipulation of electromagnetic (EM) waves, significantly enhancing the performance of wireless communication systems. To accurately characterize the achievable performance limits of these systems, it is crucial to develop a universal EM-compliant channel model. This paper addresses this necessity by proposing a comprehensive EM channel model tailored for realistic multi-path environments, accounting for the combined effects of antenna array configurations and propagation conditions in HMIMO communications. Both polarization phenomena and spatial correlation are incorporated into this probabilistic channel model. Additionally, physical constraints of antenna configurations, such as mutual coupling effects and energy consumption, are integrated into the channel modeling framework. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed probabilistic channel model, indicating that traditional Rician and Rayleigh fading models cannot accurately depict the channel characteristics and underestimate the channel capacity. More importantly, the proposed channel model outperforms free-space Green's functions in accurately depicting both near-field gain and multi-path effects in radiative near-field regions. These gains are much more evident in tri-polarized systems, highlighting the necessity of polarization interference elimination techniques. Moreover, the theoretical analysis accurately verifies that capacity decreases with expanding communication regions of two-user communications.</description>

      <title>A Gaussian-Sinc Pulse Shaping Filter for Zak-OTFS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The choice of delay-Doppler domain (DD) pulse shaping filter plays an important role in determining the performance of Zak-OTFS. Sinc filter has good main lobe characteristics (with nulls at information grid points) which is good for equalization/detection, but has high side lobes which are detrimental for input-output (I/O) relation estimation. Whereas, Gaussian filter is highly localized with very low side lobes which is good for I/O relation estimation, but has poor main lobe characteristics which is not good for equalization/detection. In this paper, we propose a new filter, termed as {\em Gaussian-sinc (GS) filter}, which inherits the complementary strengths of both Gaussian and sinc filters. The proposed filter does not incur time or bandwidth expansion. We derive closed-form expressions for the I/O relation and noise covariance of Zak-OTFS with the proposed GS filter. We evaluate the Zak-OTFS performance for different pulse shaping filters with I/O relation estimated using exclusive and embedded pilots. Our results show that the proposed GS filter achieves better bit error rate (BER) performance compared to other filters reported in the literature. For example, with model-free I/O relation estimation using embedded pilot and 8-QAM, the proposed GS filter achieves an SNR gain of about 4 dB at $10^{-2}$ uncoded BER compared to Gaussian and sinc filters, and the SNR gain becomes more than 6 dB at a coded BER of $10^{-4}$ with rate-1/2 coding.</description>

Abstract: Diffusion transformers (DiTs) combine transformer architectures with diffusion models. However, their computational complexity imposes significant limitations on real-time applications and sustainability of AI systems. In this study, we aim to enhance the computational efficiency through model quantization, which represents the weights and activation values with lower precision. Multi-region quantization (MRQ) is introduced to address the asymmetric distribution of network values in DiT blocks by allocating two scaling parameters to sub-regions. Additionally, time-grouping quantization (TGQ) is proposed to reduce quantization error caused by temporal variation in activations. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm achieves performance comparable to the original full-precision model with only a 0.29 increase in FID at W8A8. Furthermore, it outperforms other baselines at W6A6, thereby confirming its suitability for low-bit quantization. These results highlight the potential of our method to enable efficient real-time generative models.</description>

      <title>Environmental Variation or Instrumental Drift? A Probabilistic Approach to Gas Sensor Drift Modeling and Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17488</link>

Abstract: Drift is a significant issue that undermines the reliability of gas sensors. This paper introduces a probabilistic model to distinguish between environmental variation and instrumental drift, using low-cost non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) CO2 sensors as a case study. Data from a long-term field experiment is analyzed to evaluate both sensor performance and environmental changes over time. Our approach employs importance sampling to isolate instrumental drift from environmental variation, providing a more accurate assessment of sensor performance. The results show that failing to account for environmental variation can significantly affect the evaluation of sensor drift, leading to improper calibration processes.</description>

      <title>Generalization analysis of an unfolding network for analysis-based Compressed Sensing</title>

Abstract: Unfolding networks have shown promising results in the Compressed Sensing (CS) field. Yet, the investigation of their generalization ability is still in its infancy. In this paper, we perform a generalization analysis of a state-of-the-art ADMM-based unfolding network, which jointly learns a decoder for CS and a sparsifying redundant analysis operator. To this end, we first impose a structural constraint on the learnable sparsifier, which parametrizes the network's hypothesis class. For the latter, we estimate its Rademacher complexity. With this estimate in hand, we deliver generalization error bounds -- which scale like the square root of the number of layers -- for the examined network. Finally, the validity of our theory is assessed and numerical comparisons to a state-of-the-art unfolding network are made, on synthetic and real-world datasets. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework complies with our theoretical findings and outperforms the baseline, consistently for all datasets.</description>

      <title>Graph-Enhanced EEG Foundation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19507v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) signals provide critical insights for applications in disease diagnosis and healthcare. However, the scarcity of labeled EEG data poses a significant challenge. Foundation models offer a promising solution by leveraging large-scale unlabeled data through pre-training, enabling strong performance across diverse tasks. While both temporal dynamics and inter-channel relationships are vital for understanding EEG signals, existing EEG foundation models primarily focus on the former, overlooking the latter. To address this limitation, we propose a novel foundation model for EEG that integrates both temporal and inter-channel information. Our architecture combines Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which effectively capture relational structures, with a masked autoencoder to enable efficient pre-training. We evaluated our approach using three downstream tasks and experimented with various GNN architectures. The results demonstrate that our proposed model, particularly when employing the GCN architecture with optimized configurations, consistently outperformed baseline methods across all tasks. These findings suggest that our model serves as a robust foundation model for EEG analysis.</description>
