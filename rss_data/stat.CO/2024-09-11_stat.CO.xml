      <title>Extending Explainable Ensemble Trees (E2Tree) to regression contexts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensemble methods such as random forests have transformed the landscape of supervised learning, offering highly accurate prediction through the aggregation of multiple weak learners. However, despite their effectiveness, these methods often lack transparency, impeding users' comprehension of how RF models arrive at their predictions. Explainable ensemble trees (E2Tree) is a novel methodology for explaining random forests, that provides a graphical representation of the relationship between response variables and predictors. A striking characteristic of E2Tree is that it not only accounts for the effects of predictor variables on the response but also accounts for associations between the predictor variables through the computation and use of dissimilarity measures. The E2Tree methodology was initially proposed for use in classification tasks. In this paper, we extend the methodology to encompass regression contexts. To demonstrate the explanatory power of the proposed algorithm, we illustrate its use on real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Efficient Shapley Performance Attribution for Least-Squares Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19245v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the performance of a least-squares regression model, as judged by out-of-sample $R^2$. Shapley values give a fair attribution of the performance of a model to its input features, taking into account interdependencies between features. Evaluating the Shapley values exactly requires solving a number of regression problems that is exponential in the number of features, so a Monte Carlo-type approximation is typically used. We focus on the special case of least-squares regression models, where several tricks can be used to compute and evaluate regression models efficiently. These tricks give a substantial speed up, allowing many more Monte Carlo samples to be evaluated, achieving better accuracy. We refer to our method as least-squares Shapley performance attribution (LS-SPA), and describe our open-source implementation.</description>

      <title>Robust estimations from distribution structures: I. Mean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12110v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As the most fundamental problem in statistics, robust location estimation has many prominent solutions, such as the trimmed mean, Winsorized mean, Hodges Lehmann estimator, Huber M estimator, and median of means. Recent studies suggest that their maximum biases concerning the mean can be quite different, but the underlying mechanisms largely remain unclear. This study exploited a semiparametric method to classify distributions by the asymptotic orderliness of quantile combinations with varying breakdown points, showing their interrelations and connections to parametric distributions. Further deductions explain why the Winsorized mean typically has smaller biases compared to the trimmed mean; two sequences of semiparametric robust mean estimators emerge, particularly highlighting the superiority of the median Hodges Lehmann mean. This article sheds light on the understanding of the common nature of probability distributions.</description>

      <title>On Neighbourhood Cross Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16490v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many varieties of cross validation would be statistically appealing for the estimation of smoothing and other penalized regression hyperparameters, were it not for the high cost of evaluating such criteria. Here it is shown how to efficiently and accurately compute and optimize a broad variety of cross validation criteria for a wide range of models estimated by minimizing a quadratically penalized loss. The leading order computational cost of hyperparameter estimation is made comparable to the cost of a single model fit given hyperparameters. In many cases this represents an $O(n)$ computational saving when modelling $n$ data. This development makes if feasible, for the first time, to use leave-out-neighbourhood cross validation to deal with the wide spread problem of un-modelled short range autocorrelation which otherwise leads to underestimation of smoothing parameters. It is also shown how to accurately quantifying uncertainty in this case, despite the un-modelled autocorrelation. Practical examples are provided including smooth quantile regression, generalized additive models for location scale and shape, and focussing particularly on dealing with un-modelled autocorrelation.</description>

      <title>Process-based Inference for Spatial Energetics Using Bayesian Predictive Stacking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09906v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rapid developments in streaming data technologies have enabled real-time monitoring of human activity that can deliver high-resolution data on health variables over trajectories or paths carved out by subjects as they conduct their daily physical activities. Wearable devices, such as wrist-worn sensors that monitor gross motor activity, have become prevalent and have kindled the emerging field of "spatial energetics" in environmental health sciences. We devise a Bayesian inferential framework for analyzing such data while accounting for information available on specific spatial coordinates comprising a trajectory or path using a Global Positioning System (GPS) device embedded within the wearable device. We offer full probabilistic inference with uncertainty quantification using spatial-temporal process models adapted for data generated from "actigraph" units as the subject traverses a path or trajectory in their daily routine. Anticipating the need for fast inference for mobile health data, we pursue exact inference using conjugate Bayesian models and employ predictive stacking to assimilate inference across these individual models. This circumvents issues with iterative estimation algorithms such as Markov chain Monte Carlo. We devise Bayesian predictive stacking in this context for models that treat time as discrete epochs and that treat time as continuous. We illustrate our methods with simulation experiments and analysis of data from the Physical Activity through Sustainable Transport Approaches (PASTA-LA) study conducted by the Fielding School of Public Health at the University of California, Los Angeles.</description>
