      <title>Textile hinges enable extreme properties of mechanical metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mechanical metamaterials -- structures with unusual properties that emerge from their internal architecture -- that are designed to undergo large deformations typically exploit large internal rotations, and therefore, necessitate the incorporation of flexible hinges. In the mechanism limit, these metamaterials consist of rigid bodies connected by ideal hinges that deform at zero energy cost. However, fabrication of structures in this limit has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate that the fabrication and integration of textile hinges provides a scalable platform for creating large structured metamaterials with mechanism-like behaviors. Further, leveraging recently introduced kinematic optimization tools, we demonstrate that textile hinges enable extreme shape-morphing responses, paving the way for the development of the next generation of mechanism-based metamaterials.</description>

      <title>Convective Instability Driven by Diffusiophoresis of Colloids in Binary Liquid Mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a binary fluid mixture, the concentration gradient of a heavier molecular solute leads to a diffusive flux of solvent and solute to achieve thermodynamic equilibrium. If the solute concentration decreases with height, the system is always in a condition of stable mechanical equilibrium against gravity. We show experimentally that this mechanical equilibrium becomes unstable in case colloidal particles are dispersed uniformly within the mixture, and that the resulting colloidal suspension undergoes a transient convective instability with the onset of convection patterns. By means of a numerical analysis, we clarify the microscopic mechanism from which the observed destabilisation process originates. The solute concentration gradient drives an upward diffusiophoretic migration of colloids, in turn causing the development of a mechanically unstable layer within the sample, where the density of the suspension increases with height. Convective motions arise to minimize this localized rise in gravitational potential energy.</description>

      <title>Universal mechanistic rules for de novo design of enzymes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enzymes are nano-scale machines that have evolved to drive chemical reactions out of equilibrium in the right place at the right time. Thermodynamically favourable reactions such as ATP hydrolysis are used by the cell to convert chemical energy into useful structure, function, and mechanical work. This includes the `fuelled' catalysis of chemical reactions that would otherwise be thermodynamically unfavourable. Given the complexity and specificity of enzymatic function, bottom-up design of enzymes presents a daunting task that is far more challenging than making passive molecules with specific binding affinities or building nano-scale mechanically active devices. Here, we present a thermodynamically-consistent model for the operation of such a fuelled enzyme, which uses the energy from a favourable reaction to undergo non-equilibrium conformational changes that in turn catalyze a chemical reaction on an attached substrate molecule. We show that enzymatic function can emerge through a bifurcation upon appropriate implementation of momentum conservation on the effective reaction coordinates of the low dimensional description of the enzyme, and thanks to a generically present dissipative coupling. By considering the different aspects of the dynamics, such as the interplay of the non-equilibrium drive and the geometry of the enzyme-substrate complex, we propose three golden rules that should be universally applicable for de novo design of enzymes, as they are based on generic ingredients and physical constraints. These rules lead to optimal combinations of parameters, which can vastly accelerate reactions, while at the same time decreasing the energy dissipation of the combined reaction process, or, in other words, to an efficient enzyme. Our results can complement the recently developed strategies for de novo enzyme design based on machine learning approaches.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of adhesion strength in viscoelastic unsteady contacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11524v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a general energy approach to study the unsteady adhesive contact of viscoelastic materials. Under the assumption of infinitely short-range adhesive interactions, we exploit the principle of virtual work to generalize Griffith local energy balance at contact edges to the case of a non conservative (viscoelastic) material, subjected to a generic contact time history. We apply the proposed energy balance criterion to study the approach retraction motion of a rigid sphere in contact with a viscoelastic halfspace. A strong interplay between adhesion and viscoelastic hysteretic losses is reported which can lead to strongly increased adhesion strength, depending on the loading history. Specifically, two different mechanisms are found to govern the increase of pulloff force during either approach retraction cycles and approach, full relaxation, retraction tests. In the former case, hysteretic losses occurring close to the circular perimeter of the contact play a major role, significantly enhancing the energy release rate. In the latter case, instead, the pulloff enhancement mostly depends on the glassy response of the whole (bulk) material which, triggered by the fast retraction after relaxation, leads to a sort of frozen state and results in a flat punch like detachment mechanism (i.e., constant contact area). In this case, the JKR theory of adhesive contact cannot be invoked to relate the observed pulloff force to the effective adhesion energy, i.e. the energy release rate G, and strongly overestimates it. Therefore, a rigorous mathematical procedure is also proposed to correctly calculate the energy release rate in viscoelastic dissipative contacts.</description>

      <title>Phantom chain simulations for fracture of star polymer networks on the effect of arm molecular weight</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14058v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite many efforts, the fracture of network polymers under extension is yet to be elucidated. This study investigated the effect of strand molecular weight on the fracture characteristics of the networks made from star-branched prepolymers with various node functionalities $3 \le f \le 8$ and conversion ratios $0.6 \le {\phi}_c \le 0.95$ via molecular simulations with phantom chains. The networks were created via end-linking reactions of star polymers with the arm molecular weight $N_a$ = 2, 5, and 10, simulated by a Brownian dynamics scheme. The cycle rank of the percolated network ${\xi}$ was entirely consistent with the mean-field theory, implying that the reaction occurred independently and the network connectivity was statistically fair. Afterward, the networks were alternatively subjected to energy minimization and uniaxial stretch until the break. From the stress-strain curves recorded during the stretch, the stretch and stress at the break, ${\lambda}_b$ and ${\sigma}_b$, and work for fracture $W_b$ were obtained. For these values, the following relations were found: ${\lambda}_b \sim N_a^{(1/2)} {\xi}^{(-1/3)}$, ${\sigma}_b \sim {\nu}_{br} N_a^{(4/3)} {\xi}^{(2/3)}$, and $W_b \sim {\nu}_{br} N_a^{(4/3)} {\xi}^{(2/3)}$, where ${\nu}_{br}$ is the branch point density.</description>

      <title>Memory and Rejuvenation in Glassy Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.17296v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The memory effect in a single crystal spin glass ($\mathrm{Cu}_{0.92}\mathrm{Mn}_{0.08}$) has been measured using \freq ac susceptibility techniques over a temperature range of $0.4 - 0.7 \, T_g$ and a model of the memory effect has been developed. A double-waiting-time protocol is carried out where the spin glass is first allowed to age at a temperature below $T_g$, followed by a second aging at a lower temperature, \Tw{2}, after it has fully rejuvenated. The model is based on calculating typical coincident growth of correlated regions at the two temperatures. It accounts for the absolute magnitude of the memory effect as a function of both waiting times and temperatures. The data can be explained by the memory loss being a function of the relative change in the correlated volume at the first waiting temperature because of the growth in the correlations at the second waiting temperature.</description>

      <title>Roadmap for Animate Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10623v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Humanity has long sought inspiration from nature to innovate materials and devices. As science advances, nature-inspired materials are becoming part of our lives. Animate materials, characterized by their activity, adaptability, and autonomy, emulate properties of living systems. While only biological materials fully embody these principles, artificial versions are advancing rapidly, promising transformative impacts across various sectors. This roadmap presents authoritative perspectives on animate materials across different disciplines and scales, highlighting their interdisciplinary nature and potential applications in diverse fields including nanotechnology, robotics and the built environment. It underscores the need for concerted efforts to address shared challenges such as complexity management, scalability, evolvability, interdisciplinary collaboration, and ethical and environmental considerations. The framework defined by classifying materials based on their level of animacy can guide this emerging field encouraging cooperation and responsible development. By unravelling the mysteries of living matter and leveraging its principles, we can design materials and systems that will transform our world in a more sustainable manner.</description>

      <title>Boltzmann approach to collective motion via non-local visual interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09917v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Visual cues play crucial roles in the collective motion of animals, birds, fish, and insects. The interaction mediated by visual information is essentially non-local and has many-body nature due to occlusion, which poses a challenging problem in modeling the emergent collective behavior. In this Letter, we introduce a Boltzmann-equation approach incorporating non-local visual interaction. Occlusion is treated in a self-consistent manner via a coarse-grained density field, which renders the interaction effectively pairwise. Our model also incorporates the recent finding that each organism stochastically selects a neighbor to interact at each instant. We analytically derive the order-disorder transition point, and show that the visual screening effect substantially raises the transition threshold, which does not vanish when the density of the agents or the range of the intrinsic interaction is taken to infinity. Our analysis suggests that the model exhibits a discontinuous transition as in the local interaction models, and but the discontinuity is weakened by the non-locality. Our study clarifies the essential role of non-locality in the visual interactions among moving organisms.</description>
