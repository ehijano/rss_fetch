      <title>Demand for catastrophe insurance under the path-dependent effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates optimal investment and insurance strategies under a mean-variance criterion with path-dependent effects. We use a rough volatility model and a Hawkes process with a power kernel to capture the path dependence of the market. By adding auxiliary state variables, we degenerate a non-Markovian problem to a Markovian problem. Next, an explicit solution is derived for a path-dependent extended Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation. Then, we derive the explicit solutions of the problem by extending the Functional Ito formula for fractional Brownian motion to the general path-dependent processes, which includes the Hawkes process. In addition, we use earthquake data from Sichuan Province, China, to estimate parameters for the Hawkes process. Our numerical results show that the individual becomes more risk-averse in trading when stock volatility is rough, while more risk-seeking when considering catastrophic shocks. Moreover, an individual's demand for catastrophe insurance increases with path-dependent effects. Our findings indicate that ignoring the path-dependent effect would lead to a significant underinsurance phenomenon and highlight the importance of the path-dependent effect in the catastrophe insurance pricing.</description>

      <title>Through-the-Cycle PD Estimation Under Incomplete Data -- A Single Risk Factor Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Banks are required to use long-term default probabilities (PDs) of their portfolios when calculating credit risk capital under internal ratings-based (IRB) models. However, the calibration models and historical data typically reflect prevailing market conditions. According to Basel recommendations, averaging annual PDs over a full economic cycle should yield the long-term PD. In practice, the available data are often temporally incomplete - even for high-risk portfolios. In this paper, we present a method for the simultaneous calibration of long-term PDs across all sub-portfolios, based on the single risk factor model embedded in the Basel framework. The method is suitable even for smaller, budget-constrained institutions, as it relies exclusively on the bank's own default data. A complete dataset is not required - not even for any individual sub-portfolio - as the only prerequisite is the presence of overlapping data before and after the missing values, a mild condition that is typically met in practical situations.</description>

      <title>Eco-Innovation and Earnings Management: Unveiling the Moderating Effects of Financial Constraints and Opacity in FTSE All-Share Firms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our research investigates the relationship between eco-innovation and earnings management among 567 firms listed on the FTSE All-Share Index from 2014 to 2022. By examining how sustainability-driven innovation influences financial reporting practices, we explore the strategic motivations behind income smoothing in firms engaged in environmental initiatives. The findings reveal a positive association between eco-innovation and earnings management, suggesting that firms may leverage ecoinnovation not only for environmental signalling but also to project financial stability and meet stakeholder expectations. The analysis further uncovers that the propensity for earnings management is amplified in firms facing financial constraints, proxied by low Whited-Wu (WW) scores and weak sales performance, and in those characterised by high financial opacity. We employ a robust multi-method approach to address potential endogeneity and selection bias, including entropy balancing, propensity score matching (PSM), and the Heckman Test correction. Our research contributes to the literature by providing empirical evidence on the dual strategic role of ecoinnovation -balancing sustainability signalling with earnings management, under varying financial conditions. The findings offer actionable insights for regulators, investors, and policymakers navigating the intersection of corporate transparency, financial health, and environmental responsibility.</description>
