      <title>Accelerating multigrid with streaming chiral SVD for Wilson fermions in lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A modification to the setup algorithm for the multigrid preconditioner of Wilson fermions in lattice QCD is presented. A larger basis of test vectors than that used in conventional multigrid is calculated by the smoother and truncated by singular value decomposition on the chiral components of the test vectors. The truncated basis is used to form the prolongation and restriction matrices of the multigrid hierarchy. This modification of the setup method is demonstrated to increase the convergence of linear solvers on an anisotropic lattice with $m_{\pi} \approx 239$ MeV from the Hadron Spectrum Collaboration and an isotropic lattice with $m_{\pi} \approx 220$ MeV from the MILC Collaboration. The lattice volume dependence of the method is also examined. Increasing the number of test vectors improves speedup up to a point, but storing these vectors becomes impossible in limited memory resources such as GPUs. To address storage cost, we implement a \emph{streaming} singular value decomposition of the basis of test vectors on the chiral components and demonstrate a decrease in the number of fine level iterations by a factor of 1.7 for $m_q \approx m_{crit}$.</description>

      <title>LaMET's Asymptotic Extrapolation vs. Inverse Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-Momentum Effective Theory (LaMET) is a physics-guided systematic expansion to calculate light-cone parton distributions, including collinear (PDFs) and transverse-momentum-dependent ones, at any fixed momentum fraction $x$ within a range of $[x_{\rm min}, x_{\rm max}]$. It theoretically solves the ill-posed inverse problem that afflicts other theoretical approaches to collinear PDFs, such as short-distance factorizations. Recently, arXiv:2504.17706~\cite{Dutrieux:2025jed} raised practical concerns about whether current or even future lattice data will have sufficient precision in the sub-asymptotic correlation region to support an error-controlled extrapolation -- and if not, whether it becomes an inverse problem where the relevant uncertainties cannot be properly quantified. While we agree that not all current lattice data have the desired precision to qualify for an asymptotic extrapolation, some calculations do, and more are expected in the future. We comment on the analysis and results in Ref.~\cite{Dutrieux:2025jed} and argue that a physics-based systematic extrapolation still provides the most reliable error estimates, even when the data quality is not ideal. In contrast, re-framing the long-distance asymptotic extrapolation as a data-driven-only inverse problem with {\it ad hoc} mathematical conditioning could lead to unnecessarily conservative errors.</description>

      <title>Magnetic properties of the hadron resonance gas with physical magnetic moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study magnetic properties of the Hadron Resonance Gas in the presence of a strong ($0 \le B \le 0.15~{\rm GeV}^2$) uniform magnetic field, using physical values of the magnetic moments of hadrons, i.e., including their anomalous parts. The values of these moments are taken from experiment, or when unavailable, from theoretical estimates. We evaluate the conserved charge susceptibilities, finding the expected sizable effects of the anomalous magnetic moments, in particular of the octet baryons, such as the proton and neutron, where they are exceptionally large. We also study in detail the large effects of the magnetic moments of the $\Delta(1232)$ states, for which various theoretical estimates and experimental values differ significantly. We compare our model results with the lattice QCD data and find reasonable agreement within the model uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Dark Energy from Lattice Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08963v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the behavior of the vacuum in Euclidean dynamical triangulations (EDT). Algorithmic improvements and better lattice spacing determinations allow us to test the properties of the emergent de Sitter geometries of our simulations to higher precision than previously possible. Although the agreement with de Sitter is good, the improved precision reveals deviations that can be interpreted as non-trivial vacuum dynamics, well-described by a cosmological constant that runs with scale. The simulations show that the dominant running is quadratic and that the scale can be identified with the Hubble rate. Several key cross-checks support this picture, including consistent results across multiple lattice spacings and the fact that the null energy condition is not violated. The parameters of the running are fully determined by simulations, enabling predictions when extrapolated to the scales relevant for our universe. This leads to a model for dark energy that is compatible with current observations, but which predicts deviations from $\Lambda$CDM at the ${\cal O}(10^{-3})$ level in cosmological observables that could be tested with future improvements in precision measurements.</description>

      <title>Improved evaluation of the electroweak contribution to muon $g-2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04883v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A precise evaluation of the electroweak contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon requires control over all aspects of the Standard Model, ranging from Higgs physics, over multi-loop computations for bosonic and (heavy-)fermion diagrams, to non-perturbative effects in the presence of light quarks. Currently, the dominant uncertainties arise from such hadronic effects in the vector-vector-axial-vector three-point function, an improved understanding of which has recently emerged in the context of hadronic light-by-light scattering. Profiting from these developments as well as new perturbative and non-perturbative input for the charm contribution, we obtain $a_\mu^\text{EW}=154.4(4)\times 10^{-11}$.</description>

      <title>Can we determine the exact size of the nucleon?: A comprehensive study of different radii</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08847v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The concept of nucleon radii plays a central role in our understanding of the internal structure of protons and neutrons, providing critical insights into the non-perturbative regime of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). While the charge radius is often interpreted as the ``size" of the nucleon, this interpretation is an oversimplification that overlooks the multifaceted nature of nucleon structure. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the different nucleon radii, including the charge and magnetic radii, the axial radius, and the emerging concepts of mechanical and mass radii. We discuss the definitions as well as the experimental, theoretical and phenomenological determinations of these radii, highlighting their distinct physical origins and implications. By synthesizing recent experimental results and theoretical advancements, we emphasize that each radius reflects a specific aspect of the nucleon's internal structure, such as its electric charge distribution, magnetic properties, weak interactions, or internal mechanical stress. In particular, we address the common but misleading interpretation of the proton radius as a simple measure of its size, underscoring the nuanced and context-dependent nature of nucleon radii. Through this exploration, we aim to clarify the roles of these radii in characterizing nucleon structure and to identify open questions that remain to be addressed. This work contributes to a deeper understanding of the nucleon and its significance in the broader context of particle and nuclear physics.</description>

      <title>Scalar Thermal Field Theory for a Rotating Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09677v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper it is initiated the systematic study of thermal field theory for generic equilibrium density matrices, which feature arbitrary values not only of temperature and chemical potentials, but also of average angular momentum. The focus here is on scalar fields, although some results also apply to fields with arbitrary spins. A general technique to compute ensemble averages is provided. Moreover, path-integral methods are developed to study thermal Green's functions (with an arbitrary number of points) in generic theories, which cover both the real-time and imaginary-time formalism. It is shown that, while the average angular momentum, like the chemical potentials, does not contribute positively to the Euclidean action, its negative contributions can be compensated by some other contributions that are instead positive, at least in some cases. As an application of the developed general formalism, it is shown that the production of particles weakly coupled to a rotating plasma can be significantly enhanced compared to the non-rotating case. The Higgs boson production through a portal coupling to a dark sector in the early universe is studied in some detail. The findings of this paper can also be useful, for example, to investigate the physics of rotating stars, ordinary and primordial black holes and more exotic compact objects.</description>

      <title>Reappraisal of rho meson in nuclear matter by inverse QCD sum rules method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10343v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive reappraisal of the in-medium properties of the rho meson using the inverse QCD sum rules (QCDSR) formalism, offering a novel, model-independent approach to studying hadronic modifications in nuclear matter. Unlike conventional QCDSR, which rely on a predefined pole+continuum structure, the inverse method reconstructs the spectral function directly from the operator product expansion (OPE), eliminating assumptions about the spectral ansatz. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of the inverse QCDSR method to the rho meson in nuclear matter. Our analysis reveals a significant reduction in the rho meson mass, consistent with previous theoretical predictions, and highlights the crucial role of medium-induced modifications, including condensate suppression and factorization-breaking effects. Furthermore, we assess the sensitivity of our results to the factorization assumption and higher-dimensional condensates, demonstrating the necessity of refining nonperturbative contributions for an accurate description of in-medium hadron properties. Our findings establish the inverse QCDSR method as a robust alternative to conventional spectral analysis techniques, providing a systematically controlled framework for exploring strongly interacting matter under extreme conditions. These results offer important theoretical benchmarks for lattice QCD simulations and heavy-ion collision experiments, shedding light on the restoration of chiral symmetry and the evolution of hadronic matter in dense environments.</description>

      <title>Hadronic light-by-light scattering in the anomalous magnetic moments of electron and $\tau$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10582v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In Refs. [1,2] we provided a complete dispersive evaluation of the hadronic light-by-light (HLbL) contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. While the evaluation strategy was developed for the kinematic situation determined by the muon mass, a similar approach also applies to the HLbL corrections to the anomalous magnetic moments of the electron and $\tau$ lepton, shifting the sensitivity in the loop integrals to smaller and larger momenta, respectively. In this Letter, we propagate the corresponding uncertainties of the various contributions, obtaining $a_e^\text{HLbL}= 3.51(23)\times 10^{-14}$ and $a_\tau^\text{HLbL}= 3.77(29)\times 10^{-8}$.</description>

      <title>Scale Factorized-Quantum Field Theory (SF-QFT): An innovative framework for yielding scale and scheme invariant observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09947v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Scale Factorized-Quantum Field Theory (SF-QFT), a framework that performs path-integral factorization of ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR) momentum modes at a physical scale $Q^*$ before perturbative expansion. This approach yields a UV-finite effective action whose Wilson coefficients $C_i(Q)$ and coupling $a_{\mathrm{eff}}(Q)$ are fixed by matching to experiment. Because the two-loop $\beta$-function is universal in massless QCD, $a_{\mathrm{eff}}(Q)$ evolves with a scheme-independent equation, with higher-order $\beta$-coefficients absorbed into the $C_i$. Applying SF-QFT to the inclusive ratio $R_{e^{+}e^{-}}$ gives $R^{\mathrm{SF-QFT}}(31.6\,\mathrm{GeV}) = 1.04911 \pm 0.00084$, in excellent agreement with experiment ($R^{\mathrm{exp}}(31.6\,\mathrm{GeV})= 1.0527 \pm 0.005$) while requiring orders of magnitude fewer calculations than a conventional four-loop $\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$ approach. We find universal algebraic recursion relations that generate all higher-order contributions without additional Feynman diagrams, yielding scheme-invariant predictions with remarkable convergence. SF-QFT provides a rigorous proof for the existence of a positive mass gap in Yang-Mills theory, resolving one of the Millennium Prize Problems by demonstrating how non-perturbative effects emerge naturally from the path-integral factorization. For QED, the same formalism integrates out high-energy modes above $Q^*$, producing scheme-independent predictions for the electron anomalous magnetic moment with unprecedented precision ($a_e^{\text{theory}} = 0.001~159~652~183~56(76)$). SF-QFT heralds a paradigm shift in quantum field theory, replacing the pursuit of ever-higher loop orders with a unified framework that handles both perturbative and non-perturbative physics while maintaining manifest gauge invariance and eliminating renormalization ambiguities.</description>
