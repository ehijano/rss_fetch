      <title>Identifying Causal Effects under Kink Setting: Theory and Evidence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a generalized framework for identifying causal impacts in a reduced-form manner under kinked settings when agents can manipulate their choices around the threshold. The causal estimation using a bunching framework was initially developed by Diamond and Persson (2017) under notched settings. Many empirical applications of bunching designs involve kinked settings. We propose a model-free causal estimator in kinked settings with sharp bunching and then extend to the scenarios with diffuse bunching, misreporting, optimization frictions, and heterogeneity. The estimation method is mostly non-parametric and accounts for the interior response under kinked settings. Applying the proposed approach, we estimate how medical subsidies affect outpatient behaviors in China.</description>

      <title>Julia as a universal platform for statistical software development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Like Python and Java, which are integrated into Stata, Julia is a free programming language that runs on all major operating systems. The julia package links Stata to Julia as well. Users can transfer data between Stata and Julia at high speed, issue Julia commands from Stata to analyze and plot, and pass results back to Stata. Julia's econometric software ecosystem is not as mature as Stata's or R's, or even Python's. But Julia is an excellent environment for developing high-performance numerical applications, which can then be called from many platforms. The boottest program for wild bootstrap-based inference (Roodman et al. 2019) can call a Julia back end for a 33-50% speed-up, even as the R package fwildclusterboot (Fischer and Roodman 2021) uses the same back end for inference after instrumental variables estimation. reghdfejl mimics reghdfe (Correia 2016) in fitting linear models with high-dimensional fixed effects but calls an independently developed Julia package for tenfold acceleration on hard problems. reghdfejl also supports nonlinear models--preliminarily, as the Julia package for that purpose matures.</description>

      <title>The Role of Carbon Pricing in Food Inflation: Evidence from Canadian Provinces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carbon pricing, including carbon tax and cap-and-trade, is usually seen as an effective policy tool for mitigating emissions. Although such policies are often perceived as worsening affordability issues, earlier studies find insignificant or deflationary effects of carbon pricing. We verify this result for the food sector by using provincial-level data on food CPI from Canada. By using a staggered difference-in-difference (DiD) approach, we show that the deflationary effects of carbon pricing on food do exist. Additionally, such effects are weak at first and grow stronger after two years of implementation. However, the overall magnitudes are too small to make carbon pricing blamable for the current high inflation. Our subsequent analysis suggests a reduction in consumption is likely to be the cause of deflation. Contrarily, carbon pricing has little impact on farm production costs owing to the special treatment farmers receive within carbon pricing systems. This paper decomposes the long-term influence Canadian carbon pricing has on food affordability and its possible mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Quality of Answers in Political Q&amp;A Sessions with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a new approach to evaluating the quality of answers in political question-and-answer sessions. We propose to measure an answer's quality based on the degree to which it allows us to infer the initial question accurately. This conception of answer quality inherently reflects their relevance to initial questions. Drawing parallels with semantic search, we argue that this measurement approach can be operationalized by fine-tuning a large language model on the observed corpus of questions and answers without additional labeled data. We showcase our measurement approach within the context of the Question Period in the Canadian House of Commons. Our approach yields valuable insights into the correlates of the quality of answers in the Question Period. We find that answer quality varies significantly based on the party affiliation of the members of Parliament asking the questions and uncover a meaningful correlation between answer quality and the topics of the questions.</description>

      <title>Multiply-Robust Causal Change Attribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Comparing two samples of data, we observe a change in the distribution of an outcome variable. In the presence of multiple explanatory variables, how much of the change can be explained by each possible cause? We develop a new estimation strategy that, given a causal model, combines regression and re-weighting methods to quantify the contribution of each causal mechanism. Our proposed methodology is multiply robust, meaning that it still recovers the target parameter under partial misspecification. We prove that our estimator is consistent and asymptotically normal. Moreover, it can be incorporated into existing frameworks for causal attribution, such as Shapley values, which will inherit the consistency and large-sample distribution properties. Our method demonstrates excellent performance in Monte Carlo simulations, and we show its usefulness in an empirical application.</description>

      <title>Overfitting Reduction in Convex Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Convex regression is a method for estimating an unknown function $f_0$ from a data set of $n$ noisy observations when $f_0$ is known to be convex. This method has played an important role in operations research, economics, machine learning, and many other areas. It has been empirically observed that the convex regression estimator produces inconsistent estimates of $f_0$ and extremely large subgradients near the boundary of the domain of $f_0$ as $n$ increases. In this paper, we provide theoretical evidence of this overfitting behaviour. We also prove that the penalised convex regression estimator, one of the variants of the convex regression estimator, exhibits overfitting behaviour. To eliminate this behaviour, we propose two new estimators by placing a bound on the subgradients of the estimated function. We further show that our proposed estimators do not exhibit the overfitting behaviour by proving that (a) they converge to $f_0$ and (b) their subgradients converge to the gradient of $f_0$, both uniformly over the domain of $f_0$ with probability one as $n \rightarrow \infty$. We apply the proposed methods to compute the cost frontier function for Finnish electricity distribution firms and confirm their superior performance in predictive power over some existing methods.</description>

      <title>Semiparametric Single-Index Estimation for Average Treatment Effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.08503v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a semiparametric method to estimate the average treatment effect under the assumption of unconfoundedness given observational data. Our estimation method alleviates misspecification issues of the propensity score function by estimating the single-index link function involved through Hermite polynomials. Our approach is computationally tractable and allows for moderately large dimension covariates. We provide the large sample properties of the estimator and show its validity. Also, the average treatment effect estimator achieves the parametric rate and asymptotic normality. Our extensive Monte Carlo study shows that the proposed estimator is valid in finite samples. We also provide an empirical analysis on the effect of maternal smoking on babies' birth weight and the effect of job training program on future earnings.</description>

      <title>The boosted HP filter is more general than you might think</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.09810v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The global financial crisis and Covid recession have renewed discussion concerning trend-cycle discovery in macroeconomic data, and boosting has recently upgraded the popular HP filter to a modern machine learning device suited to data-rich and rapid computational environments. This paper extends boosting's trend determination capability to higher order integrated processes and time series with roots that are local to unity. The theory is established by understanding the asymptotic effect of boosting on a simple exponential function. Given a universe of time series in FRED databases that exhibit various dynamic patterns, boosting timely captures downturns at crises and recoveries that follow.</description>

      <title>Temporal Aggregation for the Synthetic Control Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12084v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The synthetic control method (SCM) is a popular approach for estimating the impact of a treatment on a single unit with panel data. Two challenges arise with higher frequency data (e.g., monthly versus yearly): (1) achieving excellent pre-treatment fit is typically more challenging; and (2) overfitting to noise is more likely. Aggregating data over time can mitigate these problems but can also destroy important signal. In this paper, we bound the bias for SCM with disaggregated and aggregated outcomes and give conditions under which aggregating tightens the bounds. We then propose finding weights that balance both disaggregated and aggregated series.</description>

      <title>Doubly Robust Inference in Causal Latent Factor Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11652v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article introduces a new estimator of average treatment effects under unobserved confounding in modern data-rich environments featuring large numbers of units and outcomes. The proposed estimator is doubly robust, combining outcome imputation, inverse probability weighting, and a novel cross-fitting procedure for matrix completion. We derive finite-sample and asymptotic guarantees, and show that the error of the new estimator converges to a mean-zero Gaussian distribution at a parametric rate. Simulation results demonstrate the practical relevance of the formal properties of the estimators analyzed in this article.</description>

      <title>Macroeconomic Spillovers of Weather Shocks across U.S. States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10907v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We estimate the short-run effects of severe weather shocks on local economic activity and cross-border spillovers operating through economic linkages between U.S. states. We measure weather shocks using emergency declarations triggered by natural disasters and estimate their impacts with a monthly Global Vector Autoregressive (GVAR) model for U.S. states. Impulse responses highlight country-wide effects of weather shocks hitting individual regions. Taking into account economic interconnections between states allows capturing much stronger spillovers than those associated with mere spatial adjacency. Also, geographical heterogeneity is critical for assessing country-wide effects of weather shocks, and network effects amplify the local impacts of shocks.</description>

      <title>A Combinatorial Central Limit Theorem for Stratified Randomization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14764v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes a combinatorial central limit theorem for stratified randomization, which holds under a Lindeberg-type condition. The theorem allows for an arbitrary number or sizes of strata, with the sole requirement being that each stratum contains at least two units. This flexibility accommodates both a growing number of large and small strata simultaneously, while imposing minimal conditions. We then apply this result to derive the asymptotic distributions of two test statistics proposed for instrumental variables settings in the presence of potentially many strata of unrestricted sizes.</description>
