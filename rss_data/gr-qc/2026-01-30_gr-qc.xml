      <title>Cosmological Expansion from Machian Phase Normalization by Horizon Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We argue that cosmological expansion is governed by Machian phase normalization of the gravitational path integral, fixed by causal horizon boundary conditions rather than by local dynamics. In this formulation, the cosmological conformal factor is not a propagating degree of freedom but a global gauge variable fixed by the Hamiltonian constraint, rendering the conventional conformal-factor problem inapplicable. Thermal equilibrium at cosmological turning points uniquely fixes the equilibrium phase density ($\Lambda=R/6$) as the integrating factor that renders the horizon Clausius relation exact. Controlled departures from equilibrium are encoded by a single variance parameter governing non-adiabatic background evolution. The resulting framework clarifies the conceptual status of $\Lambda$CDM, explains the emergence of effective $w$CDM behavior--including phantom regimes without new degrees of freedom--and provides a natural origin for late-time cosmological tensions, arising from global constraints that preclude a stable de Sitter state.</description>

      <title>Generalized ModMax and the Early Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study a cosmological model driven by Generalized ModMax nonlinear electrodynamics. We find that, with an appropriate choice of the theory's parameters, the universe's initial singularity can be avoided. Moreover, we also find that this model has an inflationary epoch that is consistent with the current values for $N$, $n_s$ and $r$. Therefore, using Generalized ModMax, we can construct a non singular Universe with an inflationary epoch.</description>

      <title>Lyapunov Exponents and Phase Transitions in Four-Dimensional AdS Black Holes with a Nonlinear Electrodynamics Source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the relationship between dynamical instability and thermodynamic phase transitions in four-dimensional Anti--de Sitter black holes in Einstein gravity coupled to a nonlinear power-law electromagnetic field with exponent $p = 3/4$. In the canonical ensemble, we identify a critical electric charge $Q_c$ separating a regime exhibiting a first-order small/large black-hole (SBH/LBH) phase transition from a regime with a single thermodynamically stable phase. For both massless and massive probes, the thermal profile of the Lyapunov exponent $\lambda(T)$ becomes multivalued in the SBH/LBH coexistence region and exhibits a finite discontinuity at the transition temperature. This jump vanishes continuously as $Q \to Q_c$, signaling the termination of the first-order transition at a second-order critical point. Near criticality, the Lyapunov discontinuity obeys a universal mean-field scaling law with critical exponent $1/2$. For massless probes, we further analyze the critical impact parameter $b_c$, which displays the same multivalued structure and critical behavior as the Lyapunov exponent. We also demonstrate that the spinodal temperatures, defined by the extrema of the $T(r_h)$ curve where the heat capacity at fixed charge diverges, coincide with singular features in the Lyapunov exponent. Our results identify the Lyapunov exponent as a unified dynamical probe capable of capturing both first-order phase coexistence and second-order critical behavior in black-hole thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Violation of the third law of black hole mechanics in vacuum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate numerically the existence of solutions of five-dimensional vacuum gravity describing the formation, in finite time, of an extremal rotating black hole from a pre-existing Schwarzschild black hole. This is the first example of a violation of the third law of black hole mechanics in vacuum gravity and demonstrates that the third law is false independently of any matter model. We also demonstrate the existence of solutions describing the formation, in finite time, of an extremal rotating black hole from vacuum initial data that does not contain a black hole.</description>

      <title>The Spherical-Rindler framework: From compact Minkowski regions to black-Hole and cosmological Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we first develop novel Rindler-type representations of flat spacetime by demonstrating that the standard hyperbolic transformation is a member of an infinite family of coordinate mappings. We specifically introduce cyclic coordinates, which, in contrast to the conventional Rindler wedge, delineate a compact region of Minkowski spacetime. By extending this framework, and motivated by near horizon coordinates in Schwarzschild metric, we propose a class of Spherical Rindler metrics. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by deriving and analyzing a black hole solution and a cosmological metric, both emerging naturally from a Spherical Rindler origin. Our results highlight unique geometric properties of these solutions, providing new insights into the relationship between accelerated frames and global spacetime curvature.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Resonance Detectability during Binary Neutron Star Inspiral: Accurate Mismatch Computations for Low-lying Dynamical Tides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute deviations from observed gravitational wave signals, where the amplitude of the signal is unchanged. As an example, we consider the detectability of low lying dynamical tides in binary neutron star or neutron star black hole mergers. Tidal forces can excite oscillatory modes of one or both of the stars in the binary when the orbital frequency of the binary system sweeps through the resonant mode frequency dissipating energy into the vibrational mode. The orbital energy loss to the vibrational mode extracts energy from the orbital motion, advancing the time to merger. The inspiral then continues with an excess phase and a time advance. Both will cause a mismatch when fitting to a system that has not gone through the resonance. To resolve this effect, we compute the mismatch for current and planned detectors using both a quasi-analytical approach that relies on the computation of moment integrals and an optimized version of the standard numerical match function. We conclude that detectability can occur for time advances of the order of 1 ms with advanced LVK detectors for an excess energy-flux that is a few percent of the gravitational wave emission. Our results contrast with previous work, which model this effect solely as a phase shift of the waveform or by using the difference in the number of cycles induced by the resonant behavior. We show that tidal resonance effects primarily cause a time advance of the merger, rather than a phase difference, and that the single-frequency approximation commonly used in the literature significantly overestimates the detectability of this effect.</description>

      <title>On the quantum nature of strong gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Belenchia et al. [Phys. Rev. D 98, 126009 (2018)] have analyzed a gedankenexperiment where two observers, Alice and Bob, attempt to communicate via superluminal signals using a superposition of massive particles dressed by Newtonian fields and a test particle as field detector. Quantum fluctuations in the particle motion and in the field prevent signaling or violations of quantum mechanics in this setup. We reformulate this thought experiment by considering gravitational waves emitted by an extended quadrupolar object as a detector for Newtonian tidal fields. We find that quantum fluctuations in the gravitational waves prevent signaling. In the Newtonian limit, rotating black holes behave as extended quadrupolar objects, as consequence of the strong equivalence principle. It follows that consistency of the Newtonian limit of general relativity with quantum mechanics requires the quantization of gravitational radiation, even when the waves originate in strong gravity sources.</description>

      <title>Exact analytic rotating black-hole solutions with primary hair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exact, analytic, asymptotically flat rotating black-hole solutions are exceedingly rare, with only a handful of examples known. Using a Kerr-Schild ansatz, we derive a multitude of exact, analytic, asymptotically flat rotating black-hole solutions within a broad class of Generalized Proca theories. These black holes differ significantly from Kerr black holes, as they possess primary hair and are non-circular, thus breaking a symmetry that vacuum black holes exhibit in General Relativity.</description>

      <title>Is Phantom Divide Crossing in General Relativity Completely Impossible? Shortcomings and Possible Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: General relativity has its successes at the local astrophysical level, however, it seems to be insufficient in describing the Universe at large scales. In this work we investigate how the most general field theories in the context of general relativity can accomodate a phantom-to-quintessence transition which may be essential element of realistic Dark Energy scenarios in the late Universe. As we demonstrate in a very detailed manner, this is impossible for a canonical and minimally coupled single scalar field theory, but it may be possible for ghost condensate theories like $k$-essence theories. We point out how the ghost instabilities may be eliminated, and we analyze the quantitative features of a $k$-essence theory that may realize a phantom-to-quintessence transition in the late Universe. We also qualitatively compare the difficulties and fine-tunings required for $k$-essence theories to realize a phantom-to-quintessence transition, and how such a transition is naturally realized in modified gravity, without unnecessary fine-tunings and ghost eliminations.</description>

      <title>$\mathcal{R}^2$-corrected Tachyon Scalar Field Inflation, the ACT Data, and Phantom Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phantom divide line transitions are not possible in the context of single scalar field scalar-tensor theories. In this article we study a combined framework of a tachyonic minimally coupled single scalar field theory in the presence of an $\mathcal{R}^2$ correction term and with a rescaled Einstein-Hilbert term of the form $\sim \lambda \frac{\mathcal{R}}{16\pi G}$. Such terms can be part of an $f(\mathcal{R})$ gravity which in the large curvature regime yields such correction terms effectively. Alternatively, such terms can simply be quantum corrections to the scalar field action. We aim to answer two questions, firstly if this framework can lead to phantom divide line transitions and secondly whether the resulting model can be compatible with the ACT data. The model we studied is an inverse square power-law model, well known from tachyon inflation models. As we show, the field equations can be cast in terms of the scalar field solely, however the resulting theory is distinct from a single scalar field theory, because the phantom divide line is crossed during inflation. Thus initially the tachyonic nature of the scalar field generates a phantom equation of state parameter, and during inflation the phantom divide line is crossed, with the effective equation of state parameter at the end of inflation being $w=-1/3$ which corresponds to the non-accelerating state of the Universe. The model is proved to be compatible with the ACT data, only when the gravity during inflation is stronger than Einstein-Hilbert gravity, with the effective gravitational constant during inflation being $\frac{G}{\lambda}$. The effective theory is valid only during inflation, thus Big-Bang nucleosynthesis is not affected by the rescaling of the Einstein-Hilbert gravity. The feature of a phantom crossing in $f(\mathcal{R},\phi)$ frameworks is new in the literature.</description>

      <title>Analytic Solution for the Motion of Spinning Particles in Plane Gravitational Wave Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction between spin and gravitational waves causes spinning bodies to deviate from their geodesics. In this work, we obtain the complete analytic solution of the Mathisson--Papapetrou--Dixon equations at linear order in the spin for a general plane gravitational wave with arbitrary polarization profiles. Our approach combines a parallel-transported tetrad with the translational Killing symmetries of plane wave spacetimes, yielding six conserved quantities that fully determine the momentum, spin evolution, and worldline. The resulting transverse and longitudinal motions are expressed in closed form as single integrals of the retarded time, providing a unified and model-independent framework for computing spin--curvature-induced deviations for realistic or theoretical gravitational-wave signals. This analytic solution offers a versatile tool for studying spin-dependent effects in gravitational memory, Penrose-limit geometries, and future high-precision space-based detectors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) generally requires large density perturbations, which is widely supported by researchers. This paper studies the local coupling properties of the Starobinsky potential and KKLT potential by introducing a linear Lorentzian-type coupling, which locally breaks the slow roll conditions. We found that both positive and negative coupling can form a considerable abundance of PBH. Additionally, we also studied the scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) generated by this model.</description>

      <title>Leveraging rapid parameter estimates for efficient gravitational-wave Bayesian inference via posterior repartitioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational wave astronomy typically relies on rigorous, computationally expensive Bayesian analyses. Several methods have been developed to perform rapid Bayesian inference, but they are not yet used to inform our full analyses. We present a novel approach for doing this whilst ensuring that the Bayesian prior remains independent of the data, providing a statistically rigorous way to leverage low-latency information to accelerate the final inference. By combining the fast constraints from the simple-pe algorithm with the nested sampling acceleration technique of posterior repartitioning, we demonstrate that our method can guide the nested sampler towards the most probable regions of parameter space more efficiently for signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) greater than 20, while mathematically guaranteeing that the final inference is identical to that of a standard, uninformed analysis. We validate the method through an injection study, demonstrating that it produces statistically robust and unbiased results, whilst providing speedups of up to $2.2\times$ for binaries with SNRs $&lt; 150$. Importantly, we show that the performance gain provided by our method scales with SNR, establishing it as a powerful technique to mitigate the cost of analysing signals from current and future gravitational-wave observatories.</description>

      <title>Elementary blocks of Loop Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We embark on the vast program of integrating the dynamics of Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG). Adopting the strategy of decomposing spin network states into small blocks of (quantum) geometry which can later be glued back together, we focus on the more modest objective of studying the Hamiltonian dynamics on the {\it candy graph}, that is two nodes linked together by an arbitrary number of edges and also having open edges. This elementary setting allows both for curvature to develop around the bulk loops and both non-trivial boundary data and dynamics on the open edges. We study this system at the classical level and leave the detailed of its quantum regime for future investigation. Working on a single loop with two external legs, we show how the LQG Hamiltonian ansatz reduces to a pair of non-linear differential equations, similar to the cubic Schr\"odinger equation, on the areas carried by the bulk links. We provide analytical solutions to this evolution equation, identifying oscillatory modes (bounded modes) and divergent modes (similar to bouncing cosmological trajectories). This provides an explicit template for future investigations of LQG dynamics on more sophisticated spin network architecture built as arrays of candy graphs.</description>

      <title>Beyond Kasner Epochs: Ordered Oscillations and Spike Dynamics Inside Black Holes with Higher-Derivative Corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building upon the long-standing paradigm that dynamics near a spacelike singularity are governed by a sequence of Kasner epochs, we demonstrate that this picture is fundamentally altered when higher-curvature or quantum gravitational corrections are included. By incorporating such terms alongside a minimally coupled scalar field, we discover three distinct dynamical phases near the singularity: modified Kasner eons, persistent periodic oscillations, and oscillatory spike dynamics with growing amplitude. In particular, the Kasner-like geometry persisting only in highly constrained situations. The latter two regimes represent a clean departure from classical Kasner phenomenology, revealing a richer and more ordered landscape of behaviors in the deep interior of black holes beyond Einstein gravity. This work establishes a comprehensive approach for understanding the gravitational nonlinearity in the most extreme gravitational environment.</description>

Abstract: The unimodular version of the Kaluza-Klein theory is briefly recalled, and its projection on the $4$-dimensional spacetime is constructed. Imposing unimodularity condition on the $5$-dimensional Kaluza-Klein metric, det$g_{AB}=1$ is equivalent with introducing cosmological term in Einstein's equations in $4$ dimensions, and with scalar field of the Brans-Dicke type. Singularity-free cosmological solutions with scalar field and with matter sources are constructed, and their basic properties analyzed, along the results obtained in previous publications. In the present paper, attention is focussed on the perturbative analysis of cosmological solutions, providing a clue concerning their stability against small fluctuations.</description>

      <title>The reason peculiar velocities grow faster in general relativity than in Newtonian gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An increasing number of surveys has been reporting large-scale peculiar motions with sizes and speeds in excess of those allowed by the concordance cosmological model. These are the so called bulk flows, the presence of which has come to be treated as a problem for the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. However, the limits of the $\Lambda$CDM model are based on Newtonian studies, which predict the mediocre $v\propto t^{1/3}$ growth-rate for the peculiar-velocity field ($v$). Recently, a few fully relativistic treatments have appeared in the literature, arguing for a much stronger velocity growth that could explain the reported fast and deep bulk flows. What separates the Newtonian from the relativistic studies is the gravitational input of the peculiar flux, namely of the kinetic energy triggered by the moving matter. The latter has no direct gravitational contribution in Newtonian theory, but it does so in general relativity. This drastically changes the driving agent of the peculiar-velocity field and boosts its linear growth. The aim of this work is to directly compare the two treatments, as well as identify and discuss the reasons for their different results. In the process, we also demonstrate how one could recover the relativistic growth-rate from a Newtonian setup by selectively including certain (typically ignored) source-free terms into the Poisson equation. This way, we provide a unified covariant comparison of the Newtonian, the quasi-Newtonian and the fully relativistic studies.</description>

      <title>Scattering laws for interfaces in self-gravitating matter flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the evolution of self-gravitating matter fields that may undergo phase transitions, and we connect ideas from phase transition dynamics with concepts from bouncing cosmology. Our framework introduces scattering maps prescribed on two classes of hypersurfaces: a gravitational singularity hypersurface and a fluid-discontinuity hypersurface. By analyzing the causal structures induced by the light cone and the acoustic cone, we formulate a local evolution problem for the Einstein-Euler system in the presence of such interfaces. We explain how suitable scattering relations must supplement the field equations in order to ensure uniqueness and thus yield a complete macroscopic description of the evolution. This viewpoint builds on a theory developed in collaboration with G. Veneziano for quiescent (velocity-dominated) singularities in solutions of the Einstein equations coupled to a scalar field, where the passage across the singular hypersurface is encoded by a singularity scattering map. The guiding question is to identify junction prescriptions that are compatible with the Einstein and Euler equations, in particular with the propagation of constraints. The outcome is a rigid set of universal relations, together with a family of model-dependent parameters. Under physically motivated requirements (general covariance, causality, constraint compatibility, and ultra-locality), we aim to classify admissible scattering relations arising from microscopic physics and characterizing, at the macroscopic level, the dynamics of a fluid coupled to Einstein gravity.</description>

      <title>Action integrals for quantum BTZ black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black holes exactly incorporating quantum matter backreaction effects, namely, quantum black holes, are notoriously difficult to construct, let alone study their horizon thermodynamics. Here, we derive the thermodynamics of three-dimensional charged and rotating quantum black holes via the tree-level gravitational partition function. Specifically, we primarily focus on holographic quantum BTZ black holes, dual to $(3+1)$-dimensional accelerating black holes in anti-de Sitter space that localize on Karch-Randall end-of-the-world (ETW) branes. To derive their horizon thermodynamics, we regulate the bulk Euclidean geometry by adding a second ETW brane at asymptotic spatial infinity. We compute the on-shell action of the complexified accelerating black hole in the grand canonical ensemble and derive the quantum BTZ black hole thermodynamics, where the thermal entropy is equal to the generalized entropy. This provides a first principles derivation of the generalized entropy of three-dimensional quantum black holes. Further, we construct charged and rotating quantum black holes in three-dimensional de Sitter and Minkowski space using Randall-Sundrum ETW branes, and compute their horizon thermodynamics.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct an exact magnetized generalization of the Zipoy-Voorhees spacetime by applying the magnetic Harrison transformation to a static seed with quadrupolar deformation parameter $k$. The resulting Melvin-Zipoy-Voorhees metric is a solution to the Einstein-Maxwell equations that interpolates between the unmagnetized Zipoy-Voorhees geometry and the Melvin magnetic universe. We analyze the algebraic structure, finding the spacetime to be generically of Petrov type I, and investigate the equatorial dynamics of charged test particles and photons. Our analysis reveals that the external magnetic field $b$ induces a ``Lorentz shift'' in the effective angular momentum, suppressing the potential barrier and causing the Innermost Stable Circular Orbit (ISCO) to migrate inward. In contrast, the radius of the photon ring shifts slightly outward with increasing magnetization.</description>

      <title>Compact Stars Sourced by Perfect Fluid Dark Matter Halos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have shown that dark matter halos can support regular black holes or compact stars by assuming an anisotropic energy-momentum tensor. In this paper, we extend the analysis to the dark matter halo as an isotropic perfect fluid. By employing galactic dark matter profiles-specifically the Einasto and Dehnen models-as the mass-energy density source, we numerically solve the Einstein field equations and find a class of non-singular, horizonless compact star solutions. Moreover, these configurations remain stable against axial perturbations while satisfying the dominant energy condition.</description>

      <title>Numerical simulations of primordial black hole formation via delayed first-order phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform fully nonlinear, spherically symmetric numerical simulations of superhorizon false-vacuum-domain (FVD) collapse in a coupled gravity-scalar-fluid system to study primordial black hole (PBH) formation during delayed first-order phase transitions (FOPTs). Using adaptive mesh refinement to resolve the bubble wall, we identify three dynamical outcomes: type B (supercritical) PBHs with an interior baby universe and a bifurcating trapping horizon, type A (subcritical) PBHs with an apparent horizon formed by direct wall collapse, and dispersal with no PBH formation. To separate these three cases, we evaluate two commonly used PBH-formation criteria: the time scale ratio $t_\mathrm{H}/t_\mathrm{V}$ (horizon crossing time versus vacuum-energy domination time) and the local density contrast $\delta(t_\mathrm{H})$ at horizon crossing. For the parameter space explored, we find that $t_\mathrm{H}/t_\mathrm{V}$ is a more robust predictor of outcome: type B PBHs form when $t_\mathrm{H}/t_\mathrm{V} \gtrsim 1$ (critical range $\sim 1.1 - 1.6$ in our survey), type A PBHs arise when $t_\mathrm{H}/t_\mathrm{V}$ is below this threshold but remains above a lower bound (typical range $\sim 0.35 - 0.7$), and no-PBH dispersal occurs when $t_\mathrm{H}/t_\mathrm{V}$ falls below this lower bound. When a clear thin-wall FVD boundary exists, $\delta(t_\mathrm{H})$ can correspondingly distinguish different outcomes (roughly $\delta_c(t_\mathrm{H}) \sim 1 - 1.7$ for type B and $\delta_c(t_\mathrm{H}) \sim 0.35 - 0.5$ for type A), but is highly sensitive to wall structure and model details and thus less universal. These results offer new insights into the dynamics of FVD collapse, quantify practical PBH-formation thresholds, and pave the way for precise predictions of PBH abundance from delayed FOPTs.</description>

      <title>St\"uckelberg inspired approach for avoiding singular Hamiltonians in Lorentz violating models of antisymmetric tensor field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spontaneous Lorentz violation models of antisymmetric tensor field are known to possess singular Hamiltonian on the vacuum manifold, leading to unresolvable pathologies that render such theories unfit for cosmological studies. In this work, we show that by introducing an auxiliary vector field inspired by the St\"uckelberg mechanism to restore the gauge symmetry of the Lagrangian, it is possible to resolve such pathologies on vacuum manifold. The constraint analysis using Dirac-Bergmann method leads to a constraint matrix that acquires dependence on gradients and conjugate momentum of the St\"uckelberg field and therefore remains non-singular on the vacuum manifold.</description>

      <title>Decomposition of Schwarzschild Green's Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a full description of the spherically decomposed Green's function of a non-rotating black hole, which naturally splits into three components: the direct part, the quasinormal modes, and the tail. Both the direct part and the tail are contributed by branch cut integrals on the complex-frequency domain, and the quasinormal modes correspond to poles of the Green's function. We show that these different components match the Green's function numerically obtained by solving a time-domain Regge-Wheeler code. In addition, the components of the Green's function also agree with earlier studies in Schwarzschild spacetime with small cosmological constant. The identification of all the various parts of the Schwarzschild Green's function represents an important step towards analyzing direct waves and quasinormal modes in the ringdown stage of binary black hole coalescence, as well as their nonlinear interaction near the merger.</description>

      <title>Optimal cross-correlation technique to search for strongly lensed gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the number of detected gravitational wave (GW) events increases with the improved sensitivity of the observatories, detecting strongly lensed pairs of events is becoming a real possibility. Identifying such lensed pairs, however, remains challenging due to the computational cost and/or the reliance on prior knowledge of source parameters in existing methods. This study investigates a novel approach, Optimal Cross-Correlation Analysis for Multiplets (OCCAM), applied to strain data from one or more detectors for Compact Binary Coalescence (CBC) events identified by GW searches, using an optimal, mildly model-dependent, low computation cost approach to identify strongly lensed candidates. This technique efficiently narrows the search space, allowing for more sensitive, but (much) higher latency, algorithms to refine the results further. We demonstrate that our method performs significantly better than other computationally inexpensive methods. In particular, we achieve 97 percent (80 percent) lensed event detection at a pairwise false positive probability of approximately 13 percent (7 percent) for a single detector with LIGO design sensitivity, assuming an SNR greater than or equal to 10 astrophysically motivated lensed and unlensed populations. Thus, this method, using a network of detectors and in conjunction with sky-localisation information, can enormously reduce the false positive probability, making it highly viable to efficiently and quickly search for lensing pairs among thousands of events, including the sub-threshold candidates.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Safety in Generalized Proca Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generalized Proca Theories are the most general higher-derivative extensions of a massive vector field that retain second-order equations of motion. They are phenomenologically interesting as models of dynamical dark energy that, unlike scalar-tensor theories, can naturally accommodate cosmological anisotropies. A key open question is whether such theories can be fundamental. As a first step in this direction, we investigate whether they admit an ultraviolet completion within a quantum field theory framework, working with a truncation comprising up to four powers of the Proca field and up to two derivatives. We find a triplet of non-Gaussian ultraviolet fixed points, that lie very close to one another. Only one of them features a non-tachyonic Proca mass and could thus serve as a consistent ultraviolet completion for Generalized Proca Theories. We name it the Proca fixed point. We discuss its stability and contrast its features with those of the standard Reuter fixed point of the asymptotic safety scenario for quantum gravity and matter. In particular, we show that the Gaussian and Reuter fixed points lie on singular hypersurfaces of the flow of Generalized Proca Theories, yet can act as quasi-fixed points in certain regimes.</description>

      <title>Turbulent Dynamo Action in Binary Neutron Star Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Binary neutron star mergers are expected to generate intense magnetic fields that power relativistic and non-relativistic outflows and shape their multimessenger signatures. These fields likely arise from the turbulent amplification of initially weak magnetic fields during the merger, particularly via the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability at the collisional interface between the stars. While previous studies have shown efficient amplification to magnetar-level strengths, the degree of large-scale coherence of the resulting field remains uncertain. We present general-relativistic, dynamical spacetime, magnetohydrodynamic simulations following the evolution of initially weak, pulsar-like magnetic fields in a binary neutron star merger. We find rapid magnetic field growth at small scales with clear signatures of small-scale turbulent dynamo action. At the highest resolutions, we additionally observe the emergence of coherent magnetic structures on larger scales. Our results imply that strong, ordered magnetic fields may be present immediately after merger, with important implications for the subsequent evolution of the remnant and its observable electromagnetic and gravitational-wave signals.</description>

      <title>Spectral Form Factor of Gapped Random Matrix Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the spectral form factor of random matrix models which exhibit a large number of degenerate ground states accompanied by a macroscopic gap in the spectrum. The central aim of this work is to understand how the standard narrative about the behavior of the spectral form factor is modified in the presence of these parametrically large number of ground states. We show that, at sufficiently low temperatures, the spectral form factor is dominated by the disconnected contribution, even at arbitrarily late times. Moreover, we demonstrate that the connected form factor only depends on the eigenvalues of the non-degenerate sector. Using the Christoffel-Darboux kernel, we analyze a number of examples including the Bessel model and $\mathcal{N}=2$ Jackiw-Teitelboim supergravity. In these examples, we find damped oscillations in the disconnected form factor, with a period set by the inverse size of the gap. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the slope of the ramp in the connected form factor arises from a universal sine-kernel, which emerges from a truncation of the full non-perturbative kernel in the $\hbar \to 0$ limit, and find agreement with the leading double trumpet result. Finally, we present predictions for how the ramp will transition to a plateau in the connected form factor and demonstrate how the transition depends on the details of the leading spectral density of states.</description>

      <title>The Tensionless Lives of Null Strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The tensionless limit probes the very high energy regime of string theory in contrast to the well studied point-particle limit which reduces to Einstein gravity. Tensionless strings sweep out null worldsheets in the target space and hence are also called null strings. This article aims to provide a comprehensive review of tensionless null string theory beginning with the initial work of Schild, and continuing to the foundational work of Isberg et al (ILST) and then focussing on developments in the past decade.
  Recent work centres on the emergence of the Carrollian Conformal Algebra as residual worldsheet symmetries of the ILST action and the identification of tensionless limit as a worldsheet Carrollian limit on the string worldsheet. Carrollian structures are used to address the classical and quantum aspects of the null string. In the classical theory, the aforementioned limit agrees with the analysis from the ILST action. Symmetries, constraints, mode expansions computed from both perspectives match nicely providing a robust cross-check of the analyses. We discuss closed and open null strings as well as their supersymmetric cousins.
  The quantum null string comes with several surprises, the foremost of which is the emergence of three consistent quantum theories from the ILST action. We detail the canonical quantisation and the spectrum of the triumvirate of theories. We discuss the novelties of the quantum null theories and the effect compactifaction has on them. We also discuss Carroll strings, applications of these ideas to strings approaching black holes and give a quick overview of other related developments.</description>

      <title>Extremal Love: tidal/electromagnetic deformability, logarithmic running and the weak gravity conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In General Relativity, the tidal Love numbers of black holes vanish, implying they are resistant to tidal deformation. This "rigidity" is easily broken in the presence of higher-derivative corrections. Focusing on extremal charged black holes in Einstein-Maxwell EFT, we compute the static linear response for both the vector ($\ell=1$) and parity-odd tensor ($\ell \ge 2$) sectors. We find that the resulting tidal Love numbers are non-zero and exhibit logarithmic running, a hallmark of quantum corrections. Crucially, we show that the sign of these deformations is not arbitrary; the induced electric and magnetic susceptibilities and their log runnings in the $\ell=1$ sector are constrained by unitarity and the Weak Gravity Conjecture. Furthermore, due to gravito-electromagnetic mixing, we find the cross log runnings and show that they are the same, which we explain through the worldline effective field theory.</description>

      <title>A Universal CMB $B$-Mode Spectrum from Early Causal Tensor Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many early universe scenarios predict post-inflationary tensor perturbations from causality-limited, sub-horizon sources. While the microphysical details may differ, as long as these sources are bounded in duration and correlation length, their tensor power spectra exhibit a universal scaling behavior at small wavenumber: $P_h(k) \propto k^3$, corresponding to white noise on super-horizon scales at the time of production. If these early causal tensor sources (ECTs) exclusively produce gravitational waves before redshift $z \sim 10^5$, this scaling is realized on all of the scales observed in the cosmic microwave background (CMB), and thus yields a universal multipole distribution for the $B$-mode angular power spectrum. Unlike the scale-invariant distributions of inflationary $B$ modes, ECTs generically predict enhanced power on small scales and suppressed power on large scales, which allows these source classes to be distinguished given measurements over a sufficient range of angular scales. In this paper, we introduce a unified framework for characterizing ECTs and demonstrate how their universal infrared scaling manifests in low-frequency observables, including CMB $B$ modes and stochastic gravitational wave spectral densities. We illustrate this mapping with representative case studies of this universality class involving first-order phase transitions, topological defects, and enhanced scalar perturbations, which source tensor modes at second order in perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>The Lambert $W$ equation of state in light of DESI BAO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the hypothesis that the evolution of the Universe can be described by a single dark fluid whose effective equation of state (EoS), $\omega_{\rm{eff}}$, is a linear combination of a logarithmic term and a power law term, both involving the Lambert $W$ function. This particular form of EoS was first proposed by S. Saha and K. Bamba in 2019 and has two parameters, $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$, which must be determined from observations. To this end, we place limits on these parameters by combining recent baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data -- including measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) -- with Type Ia supernova observations from the Pantheon+ compilation, along with direct determinations of the Hubble parameter. From this combined analysis, we obtain a best-fit value for the Hubble parameter, $H_0 = 67.4 \pm 1.2~\text{km\,s}^{-1}\text{Mpc}^{-1}$, while current measurements of the sound horizon at the baryon drag epoch yield $r_d = 146\pm 2.5$~Mpc. Furthermore, we study the evolution of the deceleration parameter, the effective EoS, and the jerk parameter, and support our findings using the $Om(z)$ diagnostic. The model exhibits noticeable deviations from the predictions of the concordance $\Lambda$CDM model. Despite these differences, our results indicate that the model provides a coherent description of late-time cosmic evolution and the observed accelerated expansion of the Universe. Finally, we assess the observational viability of the model using information criteria, particularly the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), and compare these results with those obtained for the $\Lambda$CDM model, which serves as our reference.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Casimir effect under the action of gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several nontrivial phenomena emerge when a quantum field is subjected to dynamical perturbations, with prominent examples including the Hawking and Unruh effects, as well as the dynamical Casimir effect. In this work, we compute the number of particles produced via the dynamical Casimir effect in an ideal cavity, where one of the mirrors is allowed to move under the influence of a gravitational wave. Assuming an oscillatory mirror motion and a plane gravitational wave, we identify the resonance conditions that lead to an exponential increase in the number of created particles through parametric amplification.</description>

      <title>A matter-wave Fabry-P\'erot cavity in the ultrastrong driving regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When the length of an optical cavity is modulated, theory predicts exponential concentration of energy around particular space-time trajectories. Viewed stroboscopically, photons in such a driven cavity propagate as if in a curved spacetime, with black hole and white hole event horizons corresponding to unstable and stable fixed points of the evolution. Such phenomena have resisted direct experimental realization due to the difficulty of relativistically accelerating massive cavity mirrors. We report results of an experiment which overcomes this limitation by exchanging the roles of light and matter. A matter wave endowed with quasi-relativistic dispersion is confined between two barriers made of light, one of which is periodically translated at speeds comparable to the matter wave group velocity. In this strongly-modulated cavity we observe the emergence of the predicted bright and dark fixed point trajectories, and demonstrate that changing the modulation waveform can vary the number of fixed points and exchange their stability character. We observe signatures of nontrivial dynamics beyond those predicted for photons, and attribute them to residual curvature in the dispersion relation. In addition to experimentally realizing and characterizing cavity dynamics in the ultra-strong driving regime, these results point the way to implementations of related dynamics in electro-optic materials, with potential applications in pulse generation and signal compression.</description>

      <title>Background instability of quintessence model in light of entropy and distance conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply the covariant entropy bound argument supporting the de Sitter swampland conjecture to the quintessence model, to find out the condition for the background to be unstable. More concretely, the background is unstable when the matter entropy given by the species number of the effective field theory increases more rapidly than the geometrical entropy proportional to the apparent horizon area, since it contradicts the covariant entropy bound. The rapid increase in the matter entropy is proposed by the distance conjecture, which states that the time evolution of some scalar field along the geodesic in the field space brings about the descent of a tower of states from UV. From this, we find that for the quintessence model, the accelerating background having the event horizon is unstable, and the instability condition as well as the lifetime of the unstable background is equivalent to the trans-Planckian censorship bound forbidding the classicalization of the trans-Planckian modes. We also point out that the scale separation between the Kaluza-Klein mass scale and the Hubble parameter can be realized when the product between the increasing rates of the matter and the geometrical entropies is bounded from below, which is consistent with the AdS distance conjecture. Our study suggests that various swampland conjectures can be comprehensively understood in the language of the entropy.</description>

      <title>Holographic Network and Traversable Parallel Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the holographic network connecting different CFTs, modeled by Gauss-Bonnet gravity with varying couplings across different bulk branches. By applying the holographic Noether's theorem, we prove that the junction condition on the Net-brane leads to conservation laws at network nodes. We analyze the stability of the gravitational KK modes on the Net-brane and derive the constraints on theory parameters. Additionally, we discuss various proposals for network entropy, confirm that the type I and II network entropies obey the holographic g-theorem, and show that the type III network entropy is non-negative.
  We explore the two-point functions of various NCFTs at different edges, using examples like free scalars and the AdS/NCFT with a tensionless brane. We then examine the gravitational dual of compact networks, which feature both EOW branes and Net-branes in the bulk. We derive the joint condition for EOW branes at the Net-brane and analyze vacuum solutions in AdS$_3$/NCFT$_2$. Finally, we demonstrate that AdS/NCFT provides a natural way to envision traversable parallel universes that have different geometries and physical laws. Remarkably, unlike traversable wormholes, our model of parallel universes satisfies all the energy conditions.</description>

      <title>Reflecting boundary induced modulation of tripartite coherence harvesting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the extraction of quantum coherence by three static Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detectors that interact locally with a massless scalar vacuum field in the vicinity of an infinite perfectly reflecting boundary. Depending on the setup, the detectors are positioned either parallel or orthogonal to the boundary, with their energy gaps chosen to satisfy the hierarchy $\Omega_C\geq \Omega_B\geq \Omega_A$. Our analysis reveals that decreasing the detector-boundary separation leads to a monotonic degradation of quantum coherence, whereas the same boundary effect can simultaneously preserve and even amplify the harvested quantum entanglement. Moreover, when the detectors possess distinct energy gaps, coherence extraction is further inhibited; strikingly, such non-identical configurations substantially enhance the efficiency of entanglement harvesting and markedly extend the range of detector separations over which non-negligible entanglement can be generated. Nevertheless, the harvesting of nonlocal quantum coherence is achievable over a significantly broader range of detector separations than that of quantum entanglement. Despite exhibiting similar overall behavior, orthogonal detector configurations outperform parallel ones in coherence harvesting, highlighting the quantitative influence of detector geometry. Overall, our study reveals a hierarchical distinction between quantum coherence and entanglement as operational resources in structured vacuum fields: quantum coherence is not only more readily accessible across space but also more robust than entanglement, whereas entanglement exhibits richer features and can be selectively activated and enhanced through boundary effects and detector non-uniformity.</description>

      <title>Realizing the phantom-divide crossing with vector and scalar fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In generalized Proca theories, characterized by a vector field with broken $U(1)$ gauge invariance, late-time cosmic acceleration can be realized with a dark energy equation of state in the regime $w_{\rm DE} &lt; -1$. In such scenarios, however, a phantom-divide crossing, as recently suggested by DESI observations, is not achieved without encountering theoretical inconsistencies. We incorporate a canonical scalar field with a potential, in addition to the vector field, and show that the phantom-divide crossing from $w_{\rm DE} &lt; -1$ to $w_{\rm DE} &gt; -1$ can occur at low redshifts. We propose a minimal model that admits such a transition and identify the region of parameter space in which all dynamical degrees of freedom in the scalar, vector, and tensor sectors are free from ghost and Laplacian instabilities. We further investigate the evolution of linear cosmological perturbations by applying the quasi-static approximation to modes well inside the Hubble radius. The dimensionless quantities $\mu$ and $\Sigma$, which characterize the growth of matter perturbations and the bending of light rays, respectively, depend on the sound speed $c_\psi$ of the longitudinal scalar perturbation associated with the vector field. Since $c_\psi$ is influenced by the transverse vector mode, the model exhibits sufficient flexibility to yield values of $\mu$ and $\Sigma$ close to 1. Consequently, unlike theories such as scalar Galileons, the present model can be consistent with observations of redshift-space distortions and integrated Sachs-Wolfe-galaxy cross-correlations.</description>

Abstract: We prove the past nonlinear stability of the sub-critical Kasner-scalar field solutions to the Einstein-scalar field equations on a truncated cone domain in spacetime dimensions $n\geq4$. Our analysis demonstrates that the perturbed solutions are asymptotically pointwise Kasner, geodesically incomplete in the contracting direction and terminate at quiescent and crushing singularities characterized by the blow-up of curvature invariants. This work generalizes the result of Beyer-Oliynyk-Zheng in [arXiv:2502.09210v2] to all higher dimensional spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Gravitational amplitudes in the Regge limit: waveforms, shock waves and unitarity cuts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent progress in the high-energy description of gravitational scattering, we develop a systematic Regge-theory framework for $2\to2+n$ amplitudes describing the scattering of two massive particles with $n$ graviton emissions, including spin effects. Working in the ultra-relativistic limit at leading logarithmic accuracy, the massive result smoothly reduces to its massless counterpart. We describe both quantum (Regge trajectory and BFKL $t$-channel evolution) and classical ($s$-channel multi-$H$ evolution) contributions using both an exponential representation of the S-matrix and a shock-wave formalism in light-cone quantisation. In the latter approach, gravitational Wilson lines evolve in rapidity space under a boost-invariant Hamiltonian, providing a space-time realisation of the high-energy dynamics and making contact with recent effective field theory descriptions in the forward limit. As an application, we compute the leading-logarithmic contribution to the massive spinless $2\to2$ amplitude at 5PM-2SF order, recovering the previously determined massless result, and derive the tree-level $2\to3$ amplitude and its associated scattering waveform for Kerr black holes in the ultra-relativistic limit.</description>

      <title>Detection of Gravitational Anomaly at Low Acceleration from a Highest-quality Sample of 36 Wide Binaries with Accurate 3D Velocities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We set out to accurately measure gravity in the low-acceleration range $(10^{-11},10^{-9})$ m\,s$^{-2}$ from 3D motions of isolated wide binary stars. Gaia DR3 provides precise measurements of the four sky-plane components of the 3D relative displacement and velocity ($\mathbf{r}, \mathbf{v}$) for a wide binary, but not comparably precise line-of-sight (radial) separation and relative velocity $v_{r}$. Based on our new observations and the public databases/publications, we assemble a sample of 36 nearby (distance $&lt;150$pc) wide binaries in the low-acceleration regime with accurate values of $v_{r}$ (uncertainty $&lt; 100$ m\,s$^{-1}$). Kinematic contaminants such as undetected stellar companions are well under control using various observational diagnostics such as Gaia's ruwe parameter, the color-magnitude diagram, multi-epoch observations of radial velocities, Speckle interferometric follow-up observations, and requiring Hipparcos-Gaia proper motion consistency. For the parameter $\Gamma \equiv \log_{10}\sqrt{\gamma}$ with $\gamma \equiv G/G_{\rm N}$ (where $G$ is a parameter generalizing Newton's constant $G_{\rm N}$ in elliptical orbits), we find $\Gamma=0.102_{-0.021}^{+0.023}$, inconsistent with standard gravity at $4.9\sigma$, giving a gravity boost factor of $\gamma=1.600_{-0.141}^{+0.171}$. Four wide binaries have 3D relative velocities exceeding their estimated Newtonian escape velocities with $1&lt;v_{\rm obs}/v_{\rm escN}\le1.2$. These systems are unlikely to be chance associations and are expected in a nonstandard paradigm such as Milgromian dynamics (MOND). The hypothesis that Newtonian gravity can be extrapolated to the low-acceleration limit is falsified by this independent study with accurate 3D velocities. Future radial velocity monitoring and Speckle interferometric imaging for larger samples will be useful to refine the present result.</description>

With the aim of exploring the global observable properties of those compact stars, we investigate the total masses and radii, the tidal deformabilities and especially the fundamental (f -) mode oscillations. While we choose two typical models in this work, this method applies to any analytical equations of state. By comparing with the multi-messenger observations, one can constrain the corresponding parameters in those models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.22033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a framework for generative machine learning that leverages the holographic principle of quantum gravity, or to be more precise its manifestation as the anti-de Sitter/conformal field theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence, with techniques for deep learning and transport theory. Our proposal is to represent the flow of data from a base distribution to some learned distribution using the bulk-to-boundary mapping of scalar fields in AdS. In the language of machine learning, we are representing and augmenting the flow-matching algorithm with AdS physics. Using a checkerboard toy dataset and MNIST, we find that our model achieves faster and higher quality convergence than comparable physics-free flow-matching models. Our method provides a physically interpretable version of flow matching. More broadly, it establishes the utility of AdS physics and geometry in the development of novel paradigms in generative modeling.</description>

      <title>A null test of the Hubble tension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.22043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The origin of the Hubble tension remains one of the central open problems in modern cosmology, with competing explanations invoking either early-Universe physics, late-time modifications of cosmic expansion, or unresolved observational systematics. In this Letter we propose a new, purely geometric null test of the late-time expansion history that is exactly independent of the Hubble constant. By combining strong-lensing time-delay distances with gravitational-wave standard-siren luminosity distances, we construct a dimensionless ratio that depends only on the redshift dependence of the expansion rate and can be both predicted from early-Universe data and measured directly at late times, without relying on the cosmic distance ladder or the sound horizon. We show that the comparison between the early- and late-time determinations of this ratio provides a transparent consistency test of the standard cosmological expansion. When combined with an independent standard-siren measurement of $H_{0}$, this framework allows one to unambiguously distinguish between early- and late-time origins of the Hubble tension. With the forthcoming detection of lensed gravitational-wave standard sirens, the proposed test provides a timely and robust framework for probing this long-standing cosmological puzzle.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The sound speed of dark energy encodes fundamental information about the microphysics underlying cosmic acceleration, yet remains essentially unconstrained by existing observations. We demonstrate that a lunar-based laser interferometer, such as the proposed Laser Interferometer Lunar Antenna (LILA), can directly probe the sound speed of dark energy by measuring the real-time evolution of horizon-scale gravitational potentials. Operating in the ultra-low-frequency gravitational band inaccessible from Earth, LILA is sensitive to scalar metric perturbations sourced by dark energy dynamics. Using both fluid and effective field theory descriptions, we develop a complete framework linking dark energy sound speed to observable strain signatures. We construct a likelihood pipeline and Fisher forecasts, showing that LILA can either detect clustering dark energy or exclude broad classes of models with unprecedented sensitivity. This establishes lunar interferometry as a novel and powerful probe of the physics driving cosmic acceleration.</description>

      <title>Convergent sum of EFT corrections to Schwarzschild metric requires UV locality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Corrections to vacuum black hole solutions of general relativity (GR) are considered in an effective field theory (EFT) framework, perturbatively in EFT coefficients, focusing on the Schwarzschild solution of GR. We find dominant corrections to the Schwarzschild metric in all orders in the derivative expansion far away from the horizon. These corrections can be summed up in a closed form through EFT coefficients up to all orders in derivatives and to the second order in curvature. It occurs that such a summation is convergent only for localizable theories, making a direct connection between the graviton scattering amplitudes properties and the applicability of a perturbative treatment of an EFT of gravity. We further apply our results to logarithmic form-factors which appear in the 1-loop effective action for GR in four dimensions. We find out that the corresponding corrections to the Schwarzschild metric are stronger than those from the tree-level EFT operators. The developed framework can be extended to account for the corrections to the other BH solutions in GR, such as the Kerr metric.</description>

      <title>Firewalls in the non-perturbative bulk Hilbert space of JT gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.22121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been shown that a very old black hole can tunnel into a white hole through the emission of a large baby universe. This process can be modeled by a genus-one geometry corresponding to a single baby universe emission, with a tunneling probability proportional to \( t^{2} e^{-2S(E)} \), where \( t \) denotes the black hole age and \( S(E) \) its entropy at energy \( E \). The growth of this probability at late times raises the question of its behavior near \( t \sim e^{S} \). A natural possibility is that the full genus expansion, together with its non-perturbative completion, leads to saturation of the tunneling probability. Motivated by this idea, the present analysis employs a non-perturbative bulk inner product in place of the perturbative one and shows that, at late times, the probabilities of realizing firewall geometries and smooth geometries approach constant values.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Harvesting from Quantum Field: Insights via the Partner Formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18129v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the condition necessary for extracting entanglement from a quantum field through the use of two local modes A and B (detector modes). We show that Simon's entanglement criterion for the bipartite Gaussian state can be reformulated in terms of commutators between the canonical operators of the detector mode B and the partner mode P of the detector mode A. Using the profile representation of detector modes, we identify that harvesting is prohibited under certain specific conditions. According to analyses based on moving mirror models, Hawking radiation originates from the Milne modes at past null infinity, that reflect off at the mirror and ultimately transform into real particle modes. Drawing parallels between the Unruh effect and Hawking radiation, our findings indicate an absence of quantum correlations between ``real particles" emitted as Hawking radiation.</description>

      <title>Linear analysis of I-C-Love universal relations for neutron stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13110v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutron stars (NSs) are excellent laboratories for testing gravity theories as they are strongly self-gravitating bodies and have rich observational phenomena. However, strong-field gravity effects in NS could be degenerate with their equation of state (EOS) which is largely unknown. Fortunately, there exist the so-called universal relations among the NS macroscopic quantities that are found to be insensitive to the underlying EOS. Studying the origin of these relations can lead to a better understanding of NSs and the gravitational interaction. We develop a new perspective of view to analyze the I-C and I-Love universal relations for NSs. At the linear order, we separate the deviation of the universal relations into two factors that are multiplied together. One is the EOS difference while the other factor only depends on the background star structure. The smallness of the second factor that does not depend on the EOS difference then indicates the origin of the universality. We discuss the validity of our linear approximation when considering the difference among realistic EOSs. Our study can be regarded as a new frame for quantitative representation of the universality and may provide new insights to the universal relations of NSs.</description>

Abstract: The theory of General Relativity has successfully passed a large number of observational tests. The theory has been extensively tested in the weak-field regime with experiments in the Solar System and observations of binary pulsars. The past 10 years have seen significant advancements in the study of the strong-field regime, which can now be tested with gravitational waves, X-ray data, and black hole imaging. Here I summarize the state-of-the-art of the tests of General Relativity with black hole X-ray data and I briefly discuss the long-term vision of the possibility of an interstellar mission to the closest black hole for more precise and accurate tests.</description>

      <title>Vector Horndeski black holes in nonlinear electrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23134v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: On a spherically symmetric and static background, we study the existence of linearly stable black hole (BH) solutions in nonlinear electrodynamics (NED) with a Horndeski vector-tensor (HVT) coupling, with and without curvature singularities at the center ($r=0$). Incorporating the electric charge $q_E$ and the magnetic charge $q_M$, we first show that nonsingular BHs can exist only if $q_M = 0$. We then study the stability of purely electric BHs by analyzing the behavior of perturbations in the metric and the vector field. Nonsingular electric BHs are unstable due to a Laplacian instability in the vector perturbation near the regular center. In the absence of the HVT coupling ($\beta=0$), singular BHs in power-law NED theories can be consistent with all linear stability conditions, while Born-Infeld BHs encounter strong coupling due to a vanishing propagation speed as $r \to 0$. In power-law NED and Born-Infeld theories with $\beta \neq 0$, the electric fields for singular BHs are regular near $r=0$, while the metric functions behave as $\propto r^{-1}$. Nevertheless, we show that Laplacian instabilities occur for regions inside the outer horizon $r_h$, unless the HVT coupling constant $\beta$ is significantly smaller than $r_h^2$. For $\beta \neq 0$, we also reconstruct the NED Lagrangian so that one of the metric functions takes the Reissner-Nordstr\"om form. In this case, there exists a branch where all squared propagation speeds are positive, but the ghost and strong coupling problems are present around the BH center. Thus, the dominance of the HVT coupling generally leads to BH instability in the high-curvature regime.</description>

      <title>Primordial magnetogenesis in loop quantum cosmology</title>

Abstract: Primordial magnetic fields (PMFs) are magnetic fields generated during the early universe. These fields are thought to be the seeds of extragalactic magnetic fields. The origin of PMFs is not well known. Further, if they are indeed sources of extragalactic fields, then there is a possibility that observations of extragalactic magnetic fields could provide insights into the primordial physics. With this motivation, we study the generation of the primordial magnetic field in the context of loop quantum cosmology (LQC). In LQC, inflation is preceded by a quantum bounce. In this work, we consider an electromagnetic field coupled to the background as a test field and study its evolution through the bounce and through the subsequent inflationary phase. We investigate the power spectra generated in LQC and show that it is scale-dependent. We study the power spectra with different initial conditions, discuss equivalent forms of coupling functions, investigate backreaction, and compute the amount of primordial magnetic field which can be measured today. We conclude the article with a summary and discussion of the results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25815v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the evolution of black hole mass within a cosmological background modeled by a Modified Chaplygin Gas (MCG) under various dark energy equation of state parametrizations, including Linear, Logarithmic, CPL, JBP models. The logarithmic mass ratio $\log_{10}[M(z)/M_0]$ is found to be highly sensitive to the redshift-dependent evolution of $\omega(z)$, with gentle slopes in Linear, Logarithmic and CPL models indicating quasi-static accretion and steep slopes in JBP corresponding to rapid late-time variations highlighting transient suppression or enhancement of accretion due to repulsive dark energy effects. Peaks, minima and amplitude offsets in the mass ratio reflect the dynamic interplay between horizon thermodynamics, the evolving pressure of the MCG and cosmic expansion, illustrating how the black hole mass growth is directly influenced by both the temporal evolution of dark energy and the effective gravitational potential of the surrounding cosmic fluid. Our results demonstrate that black hole accretion acts as a sensitive probe of the time-dependent cosmic pressure landscape and provides physical insights into the coupling between local strong gravity and global accelerated expansion.</description>

Abstract: Gravitational waves can be gravitationally lensed by massive objects along their path. Depending on the lens mass and the lens--source geometry, this can lead to the observation of a single distorted signal or multiple repeated events with the same frequency evolution. We present the results for gravitational-wave lensing searches on the data from the first part of the fourth LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA observing run (O4a). We search for strongly lensed events in the newly acquired data by (1) searching for an overall phase shift present in an image formed at a saddle point of the lens potential, (2) looking for pairs of detected candidates with consistent frequency evolution, and (3) identifying sub-threshold counterpart candidates to the detected signals. Beyond strong lensing, we also look for lensing-induced distortions in all detected signals using an isolated point-mass model. We do not find evidence for strongly lensed gravitational-wave signals and use this result to constrain the rate of detectable strongly lensed events and the merger rate density of binary black holes at high redshift. In the search for single distorted lensed signals, we find one outlier: GW231123_135430, for which we report more detailed investigations. While this event is interesting, the associated waveform uncertainties make its interpretation complicated, and future observations of the populations of binary black holes and of gravitational lenses will help determine the probability that this event could be lensed.</description>

      <title>Generalized Birkhoff theorems and 2+2 direct pruduct spacetimes in Weyl conformal gravity</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we study 2+2 direct product spacetimes sourced by separated electromagnetic and Yang--Mills fields within Weyl conformal gravity. We prove that all such configurations admit at least 2 independent, commuting non-null Killing vectors, which we use to find general solutions. As a special case, we obtain a generalization of the Birkhoff--Riegert theorem to all spacetimes containing a two-dimensional subspace of constant Gaussian curvature, and we also revisit the original formulation of the theorem. We further analyze the resulting solutions in terms of Weyl equivalence classes. Their connections to known solutions in both Weyl conformal gravity and Einstein gravity are established through conformal relations. We also examine the fundamental physical and geometric properties of the newly obtained configurations and their equivalence classes.</description>

      <title>Quasi-homogeneous geometrothermodynamics of a noncommutative Reissner-Nordstrom black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17081v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the thermodynamic properties of a noncommutative Reissner Nordstrom (NCRN) black hole (BH) modeled with Lorentzian distributions. The analysis is carried out using a Legendre invariant formalism called Geometrothermodynamics (GTD) which is applied to a quasihomogeneous system generated by the NCRN BH. This formalism enables the study of phase transitions by locating Ricci scalar singularities, from which the phase transition points are determined in terms of the thermodynamic variables. We also examine how the noncommutative (NC) parameter can be interpreted as a thermodynamic variable within quasi-homogeneous thermodynamic laws, highlighting its potential role on phase transitions beyond those well-known characterized by divergences in the heat capacity.</description>

      <title>Untangling PBH overproduction in $w$-SIGWs generated by Pulsar Timing Arrays for MST-EFT of single field inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15065v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our work highlights the crucial role played by the equation of state (EoS) parameter $w$ within the context of single field inflation with Multiple Sharp Transitions (MSTs) to untangle the current state of the PBH overproduction issue. We examine the situation for a broad interval of EoS parameter that remains most favourable to explain the recent data released by the pulsar timing array (PTA) collaboration. Our analysis yields the interval, $0.2 \leq w \leq 1/3$, to be the most acceptable window from the SIGW interpretation of the PTA signal and where sizeable PBHs abundance, $f_{\rm PBH} \in (10^{-3},1)$, is observed. We also obtain $w=1/3$, radiation-dominated era, to be the best scenario to explain the early stages of the Universe and address the overproduction problem. Within the range of $1 \leq c_{s} \leq 1.17$, we construct a regularized-renormalized-resummed scalar power spectrum whose amplitude obeys the perturbativity criterion while being substantial enough to generate EoS dependent scalar induced gravitational waves ($w$-SIGWs) consistent with NANOGrav-15 data. Working for both $c_{s} = 1\;{\rm and}\;1.17$, we find the $c_{s}=1.17$ case more favourable for generating large mass PBHs, $M_{\rm PBH}\sim {\cal O}(10^{-6}-10^{-3})M_{\odot}$, as potential dark matter candidates with substantial abundance after constraints coming from microlensing experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12287v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Affleck-Dine (AD) baryogenesis is compelling yet challenging to probe because of the high-energy physics involved. We demonstrate that this mechanism can be generically realized with low-energy new physics, without supersymmetry, while producing detectable gravitational waves (GWs) sourced by the parametric resonance of a light scalar field. In viable models, the scalar has a mass of $\mathcal{O}(0.1-10)$ GeV, yielding GWs with peak frequencies of $\mathcal{O}(10-100)$ Hz. This study further reveals a new complementarity between upcoming LIGO-frequency GW detectors and laboratory searches across frontiers of particle physics.</description>

      <title>Resilience of Quantum Teleportation Fidelity for Bipartite Mixed States near Schwarzschild and Dilaton Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06484v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the robustness of quantum teleportation in the presence of strong gravitational fields by analysing bipartite mixed states derived from tripartite GHZ and W-class states near black hole event horizons. Considering a scenario where two observers approach the horizon of either a Schwarzschild or a Garfinkle Horowitz Strominger (GHS) Dilaton black hole while a third remains in flat space, we quantify the teleportation fidelity of the resulting bipartite channels after tracing out one party. Through the quantization of Dirac fields and Bogoliubov transformations, we compute the teleportation fidelity under the influence of Hawking radiation and spacetime curvature. Our results show that while entanglement degrades, teleportation fidelity remains above the classical threshold of $f&gt;\frac{2}{3}$ for channels derived from W-class states, but not for GHZ-derived states. This indicates that quantum teleportation can remain feasible near black holes provided the initial entangled state retains useful bipartite entanglement.</description>

      <title>Convective stability analysis of massive neutron stars formed in binary mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19053v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform fully general-relativistic hydrodynamics simulations of binary neutron star mergers over $100\,\rm ms$ post-merger to investigate the dynamics of remnant massive neutron stars (NSs). Our focus is mainly on the analysis of convective stability and mode characteristics of the massive NSs. We derive stability criteria for hot, differentially rotating relativistic stars that account for both buoyant and rotational restoring forces, and apply them for the first time to the post-merger massive NSs. Our results show no evidence of large-scale convective instability, as both angle-averaged specific entropy and specific angular momentum increase outward within the massive NSs. Rotational effects significantly enhance stability for local regions that would be otherwise unstable by the Schwarzschild criterion. Additionally, our mode analysis of matter fields and gravitational waves reveals no excitation of observable inertial modes after the damping of quadrupolar $f$-modes in the massive NSs, contrasting with previous studies. As in many previous works, we observe the excitation of an $m=1$ one-armed mode. However, we also find that the growth of the $m=1$ mode amplitude after the merger may correlate strongly with the violation of linear momentum conservation, indicating that we cannot reject the possibility that the excitation of the one-armed mode has a numerical origin.</description>

      <title>Modeling Non-Gaussianities in Pulsar Timing Array data analysis using Gaussian Mixture Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08365v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) data analysis, noise is typically assumed to be Gaussian, and the marginalized likelihood has a well-established analytical form derived within the framework of Gaussian processes. However, this Gaussianity assumption may break down for certain classes of astrophysical and cosmological signals, particularly for a gravitational wave background (GWB) generated by a population of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs). In this work, we present a new method for testing the presence of non-Gaussian features in PTA data. We go beyond the Gaussian assumption by modeling the noise or signal statistics using a Gaussian mixture model (GMM). An advantage of this approach is that the marginalization of the likelihood remains fully analytical, expressed as a linear combination of Gaussian PTA likelihoods. This makes the method straightforward to implement within existing data analysis tools. Moreover, this method extends beyond the free spectrum analysis by producing posterior probability distributions of higher-order moments inferred from the data, which can be incorporated into spectral refitting techniques. We validate the model using simulations and demonstrate the sensitivity of PTAs to non-Gaussianity by computing the Bayes factor in favor of the GMM as a function of the injected excess moments. We apply the method to a more astrophysically motivated scenario where a single SMBHB is resolved on top of a Gaussian GWB and show that significant non-Gaussianities are introduced by the individual source. Finally, we test our model on a realistic GWB generated from a simulated population of SMBHBs.</description>

      <title>Large $n$-point Functions in Resonant Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19240v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a qualitatively new regime of inflationary models with small and rapid oscillations in the potential--resonant non-Gaussianity. In contrast to the standard scenario, where most of the observable information is encoded in the power spectrum, in this regime the oscillatory signal predominantly appears in higher-order correlation functions with large $n$. This behavior emerges when the oscillation frequency $\omega$ exceeds the naive cutoff of the theory, $4\pi f$. However, as noted by Hook and Rattazzi [2306.12489], the actual cutoff is somewhat higher -- though only logarithmically -- when the amplitude of the oscillations is small. We identify a phenomenologically relevant window in which $n$-point functions with $3 \lesssim n \lesssim 9$ are potentially observable. In this regime, the signal exhibits 350-1000 oscillations per decade in $k$.</description>

      <title>Nonradial oscillations of stratified neutron stars with solid crusts: Mode characterization and tidal resonances in coalescing binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00257v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamical tides of neutron stars in the late stages of binary inspirals provide a viable probe into dense matter through gravitational waves, and potentially trigger electromagnetic precursors. We model the tidal response as a set of driven harmonic oscillators, where the natural frequencies are given by the quasinormal modes of a nonrotating neutron star. These modes are calculated in general relativity by applying linear perturbation theory to stellar models that include a solid crust and compositional stratification. For the mode spectrum, we find that the canonical interface mode associated with the crust-core boundary vanishes in stratified neutron stars and is replaced by compositional gravity modes with mixed gravity-interfacial character, driven primarily by strong buoyancy in the outer core. We also find that fluid modes such as the core gravity mode and the fundamental mode can penetrate the crust, and we establish a criterion for such penetration. Regarding the tidal interaction, we find that transfer of binding energy to oscillations is dominated by the fundamental mode despite its frequency being too high to resonate with the tidal forcing. In general, we find that lower-frequency modes induce gravitational-wave phase shifts smaller than $\sim 10^{-3},\rm rad$ for the equation of state we consider. We discover that nonresonant fundamental and crustal shear modes can trigger crust breaking already near the first gravity-mode resonance, while gravity-mode resonance concentrates strain at the base of the crust and may marginally crack it. These results suggest that both resonant and nonresonant excitations can overstress the crust and may channel energy into the magnetosphere prior to merger, potentially powering electromagnetic precursors. Our work represents an important step toward realistic modeling of dynamical tides of neutron stars in multimessenger observations.</description>

      <title>Quantum Effects for Black Holes with On-Shell Amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12111v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a framework based on modern amplitude techniques to analyze emission and absorption effects in black hole physics, including Hawking radiation. We first discuss quantum field theory on a Schwarzschild background in the Boulware and Unruh vacua, and introduce the corresponding $S$-matrices. We use this information to determine on-shell absorptive amplitudes describing processes where a black hole transitions to a different mass state by absorbing or emitting quanta, to all orders in gravitational coupling. This on-shell approach allows for a universal description of black holes, with their intrinsic differences encapsulated in the discontinuities of the amplitudes, without suffering from off-shell ambiguities such as gauge freedom. Furthermore, the absorptive amplitudes serve as building blocks to describe physics beyond that of isolated black holes. As applications, we find that the Hawking thermal spectrum is well understood by three-point processes. We also consider a binary system and compute the mass shift of a black hole induced by the motion of a companion object, including quantum effects. We show that the mean value of the mass shift is classical and vacuum-independent, while its variance differs depending on the vacuum choice. Our results provide confirmation of the validity of the on-shell program in advancing our understanding of black hole physics.</description>

      <title>Evidence for the dynamical dark energy with evolving Hubble constant</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14390v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hubble constant tension, together with the recent indications of dynamical dark energy proposed from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements, poses significant challenges to the standard cosmological model. We investigate the possible redshift evolution of dark energy and the Hubble constant through a data-driven approach, and assess whether such evolution can alleviate the Hubble constant tension. We perform a model-independent reconstruction of the dark-energy equation of state $w(z)$, jointly with an evolving Hubble constant $H_0(z)$. The analysis combines the DESI DR2 BAO dataset with multiple Type Ia supernova samples and evaluates the statistical preference for the reconstructed model using Bayesian evidence. The reconstructed $w(z)$ varies with redshift and exhibits two potential phantom crossings at $z\sim0.5$ and $z\sim1.5$. Meanwhile, $H_0$ decreases continually from local to high redshift, alleviating the Hubble constant tension effectively. The joint $w(z)$-$H_0(z)$ model is favored over the $w$CDM ($\Lambda$CDM) framework, with a logarithmic Bayes factor $\ln \boldsymbol{\mathcal B}= 5.04~(8.53)$. The results remain stable under different prior choices and dataset combinations. Our data-driven reconstructions suggest redshift evolution in both $w(z)$ and $H_0(z)$, offering a potential route to mitigate the Hubble constant tension. Future BAO measurements from Euclid and next-generation CMB experiments will provide critical tests of these results and bring deeper insights into the nature of dark energy and the evolution of cosmic expansion.</description>

Abstract: It was recently shown that the time variation of the polarization of electromagnetic waves from pulsars can be used, in cross-correlation with pulsar timing, to probe the chirality of an isotropic gravitational wave background. Here, we show that the expression for the cross-correlation is derived efficiently with the total-angular-momentum formalism and use this framework to extend the formulation to cross-correlation with astrometry. We do so for spin-1 gravitational waves (that may arise in alternative-gravity theories) as well as the general-relativistic spin-2 gravitational waves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.16891v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Supergravity theories in de Sitter spacetime are known to be very constrained, and rather unnatural within String/M Theory. We revisit the seminal paper by Pilch, van Nieuwenhuizen and Sohnius, where the possible existence of a real Lagrangian for ${\cal N}=2$ pure supergravity in four-dimensional de Sitter spacetime was pointed out. We clarify several issues related to the non-unitarity of the theory and explicitly construct the unique, complete theory searched for long ago by the aforementioned authors. We argue that the lack of unitarity of the Lorentzian theory may be revisited in the Euclidean approach to de Sitter quantum gravity, where alternative definitions of unitarity can be introduced.</description>

      <title>EFT Perspective On de-Sitter S-Matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18101v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-perturbative limitations on low-energy effective field theories (EFTs) based on the characteristics of high-energy theory are provided by the analyticity of the flat-space version of the S-matrix. Although the analyticity of the flat-space S-matrix is widely established, it is difficult to apply this framework to de Sitter space because the growing backdrop breaks time-translation symmetry and makes it more difficult to define asymptotic states. The flat-space analyticity imprint on the de Sitter S-matrix is examined in this study. On a certain limit, we derive a comprehensive relationship between the flat-space amplitude and the de Sitter S-matrix. In particular, we demonstrate that the relationship is valid for tree-level amplitude exchanging with arbitrary local derivative interactions with a large scalar field. Next, we contend that this specific limit is more consistent with the definition of EFT since, similar to flat space, the Mandelstam variable may be identified as the unique energy scale because the total energy dependence of the de Sitter S-matrix becomes negligible. Finally, we also find an unexpected connection between the idea of generalized energy conservation of an S-matrix of four-dimensional de Sitter and exceptional EFTs in de Sitter space. We restrict the coupling constants in theories of self-interacting scalars dwelling in the exceptional series of de Sitter representations by requiring that such an S-matrix only has support when the total energies of in and out states are equal. We rediscover the Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) and Special Galileon theories, in which a single coupling constant uniquely fixes the four-point scalar self-interactions.</description>
