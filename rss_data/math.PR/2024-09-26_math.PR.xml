      <title>Cutoff of the simple exclusion process with inhomogeneous conductances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the mixing time of the simple exclusion process with $k$ particles in the line segment $[1, N]$ with conductances $c^{(N)}(x, x+1)_{1\le x&lt;N}$ where $c^{(N)}(x, x+1)&gt;0$ is the rate of swapping the contents of the two sites $x$ and $ x+1$. Writing $r^{(N)}(x, x+1) := 1/c^{(N)}(x, x+1)$, under the assumption \begin{equation*}
  \limsup_{N\to \infty}\, \frac{1}{N}\sup_{1&lt; m \le N}\, \left| \sum_{x=2}^m r^{(N)}(x-1, x)- (m-1) \right|\;=\;0\,, \end{equation*} and some further assumptions on $r^{(N)}(x, x+1)_{x \in \mathbb{N} }$ and $k$, we prove that around time $(1+o(1)) (2 \pi^2)^{-1} N^2 \log k$, the total variation distance to equilibrium of the simple exclusion process drops abruptly from $1$ to $0$.</description>

      <title>Cutoff for the Biased Random Transposition Shuffle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the biased random transposition shuffle, a natural generalization of the classical random transposition shuffle studied by Diaconis and Shahshahani. We diagonalize the transition matrix of the shuffle and use these eigenvalues to prove that the shuffle exhibits total variation cutoff at time $t_N = \frac{1}{2b} N \log N$ with window $N$. We also prove that the limiting distribution of the number of fixed cards near the cutoff time is Poisson.</description>

      <title>Approximation of Smooth Numbers for Harmonic Samples A Stein method Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a de Bruijn type approximation for quantifying the content of m smooth numbers, derived from samples obtained through a probability measure over the set of integers less than or equal to n, with point mass function at k inversely proportional to k. Our analysis is based on a stochastic representation of the measure of interest, utilizing weighted independent geometric random variables. This representation is analyzed through the lens of Stein method for the Dickman distribution. A pivotal element of our arguments relies on precise estimations concerning the regularity properties of the solution to the Dickman Stein equation for heaviside functions, recently developed by Bhattacharjee and Schulte. Remarkably, our arguments remain mostly in the realm of probability theory, with Mertens first and third theorems standing as the only number theory estimations required.</description>

      <title>SLE Loop Measure and Liouville Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As recently shown by Holden and two of the authors, the conformal welding of two Liouville quantum gravity (LQG) disks produces a canonical variant of SLE curve whose law is called the SLE loop measure. In this paper, we demonstrate how LQG can be used to study the SLE loop measure. Firstly, we show that for $\kappa\in (8/3,8)$, the loop intensity measure of the conformal loop ensemble agrees with the SLE loop measure as defined by Zhan (2021). The former was initially considered by Kemppainen and Werner (2016) for $\kappa\in (8/3,4]$, and the latter was constructed for $\kappa\in (0,8)$. Secondly, we establish a duality for the SLE loop measure between $\kappa$ and $16/\kappa$. Thirdly, we obtain the exact formula for the moment of the electrical thickness for the shape (probability) measure of the SLE loop, which in the regime $\kappa\in (8/3,8)$ was conjectured by Kenyon and Wilson (2004). This relies on the exact formulae for the reflection coefficient and the one-point disk correlation function in Liouville conformal field theory. Finally, we compute several multiplicative constants associated with the SLE loop measure, which are not only of intrinsic interest but also used in our companion paper relating the conformal loop ensemble to the imaginary DOZZ formulae.</description>

      <title>BSDEs driven by G-Brownian motion with time-varying uniformly continuous generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the backward stochastic differential equations driven by G-Brownian motion under the condition that the generator is time-varying Lipschitz continuous with respect to y and time-varying uniformly continuous with respect to z. With the help of linearization method and the G-stochastic analysis techniques, we construct the approximating sequences of G-BSDE and obtain some precise a priori estimates. By combining this with the approximation method, we prove the existence and uniqueness of the solution under the time-varying conditions, as well as the comparison theorem.</description>

      <title>The Leftmost particle of branching subordinators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define a family of continuous-time branching particle systems on the non-negative real line called branching subordinators and closely related to branching L\'evy processes introduced by Bertoin and Mallein arXiv:1703.08078. We pay a particular attention to the asymptotic behavior of the leftmost particle of branching subordinators and it turns out, under some assumptions, that the growth of the position of this leftmost particle is sub-linear thus making a significant change compared with the usual linear growth classically observed in the case of regular branching random walks with non-negative displacement distribution.</description>

Abstract: Consider the chiral non-Hermitian random matrix ensemble with parameters $n$ and $v,$ and let $(\zeta_i)_{1\le i\le n}$ be its $n$ eigenvalues with positive $x$-coordinate. In this paper, we establish deviation probabilities and moderate deviation probabilities for the spectral radius $(n/(n+v))^{1/2}\max_{1\le i\le n}|\zeta_i|^2,$ as well as $(n/(n+v))^{1/2}\min_{1\le i\le n}|\zeta_i|^2.$</description>

      <title>Concentration of information on discrete groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the Asymptotic Equipartition Property and its recently discovered role in the cutoff phenomenon, we initiate the systematic study of varentropy on discrete groups. Our main result is an approximate tensorization inequality which asserts that the varentropy of any conjugacy-invariant random walk is, up to a universal multiplicative constant, at most that of the free Abelian random walk with the same jump rates. In particular, it is always bounded by the number d of generators, uniformly in time and in the size of the group. This universal estimate is sharp and can be seen as a discrete analogue of a celebrated result of Bobkov and Madiman concerning random d-dimensional vectors with a log-concave density (AOP 2011). A key ingredient in our proof is the fact that conjugacy-invariant random walks have non-negative Bakry-\'Emery curvature, a result which seems new and of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on rare events associated with the tail probabilities of the extremal eigenvalues in the $\beta$-Jacobi ensemble, which plays a critical role in both multivariate statistical analysis and statistical physics. Under the ultra-high dimensional setting, we give an exact approximation for the tail probabilities and construct an efficient estimator for the tail probabilities. Additionally, we conduct a numerical study to evaluate the practical performance of our algorithms. The simulation results demonstrate that our method offers an efficient and accurate approach for evaluating tail probabilities in practice.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal Hawkes processes with a graphon-induced connectivity structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a spatiotemporal self-exciting point process $(N_t(x))$, boundedly finite both over time $[0,\infty)$ and space $\mathscr X$, with excitation structure determined by a graphon $W$ on $\mathscr X^2$. This graphon Hawkes process generalizes both the multivariate Hawkes process and the Hawkes process on a countable network, and despite being infinite-dimensional, it is surprisingly tractable. After proving existence, uniqueness and stability results, we show, both in the annealed and in the quenched case, that for compact, Euclidean $\mathscr X\subset\mathbb R^m$, any graphon Hawkes process can be obtained as the suitable limit of $d$-dimensional Hawkes processes $\tilde N^d$, as $d\to\infty$. Furthermore, in the stable regime, we establish an FLLN and an FCLT for our infinite-dimensional process on compact $\mathscr X\subset\mathbb R^m$, while in the unstable regime we prove divergence of $N_T(\mathscr X)/T$, as $T\to\infty$. Finally, we exploit a cluster representation to derive fixed-point equations for the Laplace functional of $N$, for which we set up a recursive approximation procedure. We apply those results to show that, starting with multivariate Hawkes processes $\tilde N^d_t$ converging to stable graphon Hawkes processes, the limits $d\to\infty$ and $t\to\infty$ commute.</description>

      <title>t^{1/3} fluctuation around the shock of TASEP with random initial condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The totally asymmetric exclusion process (TASEP) is one of the solvable models in the KPZ universality class. When TASEP starts with the product Bernoulli measure with a smaller density on the left of the origin, it presents shocks in the evolution. For a long time, it has been known that fluctuations are the product of Gaussians on the scale t^{1/2} due to initial randomness. In this paper, we will describe how to see the t^{1/3} fluctuations for these initial conditions.</description>

Abstract: For general large non-Hermitian random matrices $X$ and deterministic normal deformations $A$, we prove that the local eigenvalue statistics of $A+X$ close to the critical edge points of its spectrum are universal. This concludes the proof of the third and last remaining typical universality class for non-Hermitian random matrices, after bulk and sharp edge universalities have been established in recent years.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper addresses linear hyperbolic systems in one space dimension with random field coefficients. In many applications, a low degree of regularity of the paths of the coefficients is required, which is not covered by classical stochastic analysis. For this reason, we place our analysis in the framework of Colombeau algebras of generalized functions. We obtain new characterizations of Colombeau stochastic processes and establish existence and uniqueness of solutions in this framework. A number of applications to stochastic wave and transport equations are given and the Colombeau solutions are related to classical weak solutions, when the latter exist.</description>

      <title>Interlacing Eigenvectors of Large Gaussian Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the eigenvectors of the principal minor of dimension $n&lt; N$ of the Dyson Brownian motion in $\mathbb{R}^{N}$ and investigate their asymptotic overlaps with the eigenvectors of the full matrix in the limit of large dimension. We explicitly compute the limiting rescaled mean squared overlaps in the large $n\,, N$ limit with $n\,/\,N$ tending to a fixed ratio $q\,$, for any initial symmetric matrix $A\,$. This is accomplished using a Burgers-type evolution equation for a specific resolvent. In the GOE case, our formula simplifies, and we identify an eigenvector analogue of the well-known interlacing of eigenvalues. We investigate in particular the case where $A$ has isolated eigenvalues. Our method is based on analysing the eigenvector flow under the Dyson Brownian motion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate sequences of discontinuous martingales on submanifolds of higher-dimensional Euclidean space. Those sequences naturally arise when we deal with a sequence of harmonic maps with respect to non-local Dirichlet forms, such as fractional harmonic maps. We prove that the semimartingale topology is equivalent to the topology of locally uniform convergence in probability on the space of discontinuous martingales on manifolds. In particular, we show that the limit of any sequence of discontinuous martingales on a compact Riemannian manifold, with respect to the topology of locally uniform convergence in probability, is a martingale on the manifold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the existence of probabilistically strong solutions for large classes of possibly degenerate stochastic differential equations with locally Sobolev-regular coefficients, using the restricted Yamada-Watanabe theorem. Our approach relies on existence results for the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation, combined with both novel and existing restricted pathwise uniqueness results for SDEs. Here, restricted pathwise uniqueness means pathwise uniqueness among a subclass of weak solutions to the SDE. Furthermore, we derive new uniqueness results for the Fokker-Planck equation.</description>

      <title>Damage detection in an uncertain nonlinear beam based on stochastic Volterra series: an experimental application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The damage detection problem becomes a more difficult task when the intrinsically nonlinear behavior of the structures and the natural data variation are considered in the analysis because both phenomena can be confused with damage if linear and deterministic approaches are implemented. Therefore, this work aims the experimental application of a stochastic version of the Volterra series combined with a novelty detection approach to detect damage in an initially nonlinear system taking into account the measured data variation, caused by the presence of uncertainties. The experimental setup is composed by a cantilever beam operating in a nonlinear regime of motion, even in the healthy condition, induced by the presence of a magnet near to the free extremity. The damage associated with mass changes in a bolted connection (nuts loosed) is detected based on the comparison between linear and nonlinear contributions of the stochastic Volterra kernels in the total response, estimated in the reference and damaged conditions. The experimental measurements were performed on different days to add natural variation to the data measured. The results obtained through the stochastic proposed approach are compared with those obtained by the deterministic version of the Volterra series, showing the advantage of the stochastic model use when we consider the experimental data variation with the capability to detect the presence of the damage with statistical confidence. Besides, the nonlinear metric used presented a higher sensitivity to the occurrence of the damage compared with the linear one, justifying the application of a nonlinear metric when the system exhibits intrinsically nonlinear behavior.</description>

      <title>Parameter Estimation for the Reduced Fracture Model via a Direct Filter Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a numerical method that provides accurate real-time detection for the widths of the fractures in a fractured porous medium based on observational data on porous medium fluid mass and velocity. To achieve this task, an inverse problem is formulated by first constructing a forward formulation based on the reduced fracture model of the diffusion equation. A parameter estimation problem is then performed online by utilizing a direct filter method. Numerical experiments are carried out to demonstrate the accuracy of our method in approximating the target parameters.</description>

      <title>Feynman-Kac Formula for Nonlinear Schr\"odinger Equations with Applications in Numerical Approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to a Feynman-Kac formula for general nonlinear time-dependent Schr\"odinger equations. Our formulation integrates both the Fisk-Stratonovich and It\^o integrals within the framework of backward stochastic differential equations. Utilizing this Feynman-Kac representation, we propose a deep-learning-based approach for numerical approximation. Numerical experiments are performed to validate the accuracy and efficiency of our method, and a convergence analysis is provided to support the results.</description>

      <title>Normalizing flow regularization for photoacoustic tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Proper regularization is crucial in inverse problems to achieve high-quality reconstruction, even with an ill-conditioned measurement system. This is particularly true for three-dimensional photoacoustic tomography, which is computationally demanding and requires rapid scanning, often leading to incomplete measurements. Deep neural networks, known for their efficiency in handling big data, are anticipated to be adept at extracting underlying information from images sharing certain characteristics, such as specific types of natural or medical images. We introduce a Normalizing Flow Regularization (NFR) method designed to reconstruct images from incomplete and noisy measurements. The method involves training a normalizing flow network to understand the statistical distribution of sample images by mapping them to Gaussian distributions. This well-trained network then acts as a regularization tool within a Bayesian inversion framework. Additionally, we explore the concept of adaptive regularization selection, providing theoretical proof of its admissibility. A significant challenge in three-dimensional image training is the extensive memory and computation requirements. We address this by training the normalizing flow model using only small-size images and applying a patch-based model for reconstructing larger images. Our approach is model-independent, allowing the reuse of a well-trained network as regularization for various imaging systems. Moreover, as a data-driven prior, NFR effectively leverages the available dataset information, outperforming artificial priors. This advantage is demonstrated through numerical simulations of three-dimensional photoacoustic tomography under various conditions of sparsity, noise levels, and limited-view scenarios.</description>

      <title>Limiting Spectral Distribution of a Random Commutator Matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the spectral properties of a class of random matrices of the form $S_n^{-} = n^{-1}(X_1 X_2^* - X_2 X_1^*)$ where $X_k = \Sigma^{1/2}Z_k$, for $k=1,2$, $Z_k$'s are independent $p\times n$ complex-valued random matrices, and $\Sigma$ is a $p\times p$ positive semi-definite matrix, independent of the $Z_k$'s. We assume that $Z_k$'s have independent entries with zero mean and unit variance. The skew-symmetric/skew-Hermitian matrix $S_n^{-}$ will be referred to as a random commutator matrix associated with the samples $X_1$ and $X_2$. We show that, when the dimension $p$ and sample size $n$ increase simultaneously, so that $p/n \to c \in (0,\infty)$, there exists a limiting spectral distribution (LSD) for $S_n^{-}$, supported on the imaginary axis, under the assumptions that the spectral distribution of $\Sigma$ converges weakly and the entries of $Z_k$'s have moments of sufficiently high order. This nonrandom LSD can be described through its Stieltjes transform, which satisfies a coupled Mar\v{c}enko-Pastur-type functional equations. In the special case when $\Sigma = I_p$, we show that the LSD of $S_n^{-}$ is a mixture of a degenerate distribution at zero (with positive mass if $c &gt; 2$), and a continuous distribution with a symmetric density function supported on a compact interval on the imaginary axis. Moreover, we show that the companion matrix $S_n^{+} = \Sigma_n^\frac{1}{2}(Z_1Z_2^* + Z_2Z_1^*)\Sigma_n^\frac{1}{2}$, under identical assumptions, has an LSD supported on the real line, which can be similarly characterized.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the tail probabilities of extremals of $\beta$-Jacobi ensemble which plays an important role in multivariate analysis. The key steps in constructing estimators rely on the rate functions of large deviations. Therefore, under specific conditions, we consider stretching and shifting transformations applied to the $\beta$-Jacobi ensemble to ensure that its extremals satisfy the large deviations. The estimator we construct characterize the large deviation behavior and moderate deviation behavior of extremals under different assumptions.</description>

      <title>Run-and-tumble particle in one-dimensional potentials: mean first-passage time and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a one-dimensional run-and-tumble particle (RTP), which is a prototypical model for active system, moving within an arbitrary external potential. Using backward Fokker-Planck equations, we derive the differential equation satisfied by its mean first-passage time (MFPT) to an absorbing target, which, without any loss of generality, is placed at the origin. Depending on the shape of the potential, we identify four distinct ``phases'', with a corresponding expression for the MFPT in every case, which we derive explicitly. To illustrate these general expressions, we derive explicit formulae for two specific cases which we study in detail: a double-well potential and a logarithmic potential. We then present different applications of these general formulae to (i) the generalization of the Kramer's escape law for an RTP in the presence of a potential barrier, (ii) the ``trapping'' time of an RTP moving in a harmonic well and (iii) characterizing the efficiency of the optimal search strategy of an RTP subjected to stochastic resetting. Our results reveal that the MFPT of an RTP in an external potential exhibits a far more complex and, at times, counter-intuitive behavior compared to that of a passive particle (e.g., Brownian) in the same potential.</description>

      <title>Dimension reduction and the gradient flow of relative entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dimension reduction, widely used in science, maps high-dimensional data into low-dimensional space. We investigate a basic mathematical model underlying the techniques of stochastic neighborhood embedding (SNE) and its popular variant t-SNE. Distances between points in high dimensions are used to define a probability distribution on pairs of points, measuring how similar the points are. The aim is to map these points to low dimensions in an optimal way so that similar points are closer together. This is carried out by minimizing the relative entropy between two probability distributions.
  We consider the gradient flow of the relative entropy and analyze its long-time behavior. This is a self-contained mathematical problem about the behavior of a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations. We find optimal bounds for the diameter of the evolving sets as time tends to infinity. In particular, the diameter may blow up for the t-SNE version, but remains bounded for SNE.</description>

      <title>Non-asymptotic convergence analysis of the stochastic gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm with discontinuous stochastic gradient with applications to training of ReLU neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide a non-asymptotic analysis of the convergence of the stochastic gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (SGHMC) algorithm to a target measure in Wasserstein-1 and Wasserstein-2 distance. Crucially, compared to the existing literature on SGHMC, we allow its stochastic gradient to be discontinuous. This allows us to provide explicit upper bounds, which can be controlled to be arbitrarily small, for the expected excess risk of non-convex stochastic optimization problems with discontinuous stochastic gradients, including, among others, the training of neural networks with ReLU activation function. To illustrate the applicability of our main results, we consider numerical experiments on quantile estimation and on several optimization problems involving ReLU neural networks relevant in finance and artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>On the Fourier coefficients of word maps on unitary groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.04164v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a word $w(x_{1},\ldots,x_{r})$, i.e., an element in the free group on $r$ elements, and an integer $d\geq1$, we study the characteristic polynomial of the random matrix $w(X_{1},\ldots,X_{r})$, where $X_{i}$ are Haar-random independent $d\times d$ unitary matrices. If $c_{m}(X)$ denotes the $m$-th coefficient of the characteristic polynomial of $X$, our main theorem implies that there is a positive constant $\epsilon(w)$, depending only on $w$, such that \[ \left|\mathbb{E}\left(c_{m}\left(w(X_{1},\ldots,X_{r})\right)\right)\right|\leq\left(\begin{array}{c} d\\ m \end{array}\right)^{1-\epsilon(w)}, \] for every $d$ and every $1\leq m\leq d$.
  Our main computational tool is the Weingarten Calculus, which allows us to express integrals on unitary groups such as the expectation above, as certain sums on symmetric groups. We exploit a hidden symmetry to find cancellations in the sum expressing $\mathbb{E}\left(c_{m}(w)\right)$. These cancellations, coming from averaging a Weingarten function over cosets, follow from Schur's orthogonality relations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.05208v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study biased random walks on dynamical percolation on $\mathbb{Z}^d$. We establish a law of large numbers and an invariance principle for the random walk using regeneration times. Moreover, we verify that the Einstein relation holds, and we investigate the speed of the walk as a function of the bias. While for $d=1$ the speed is increasing, we show that in general this fails in dimension $d \geq 2$. As our main result, we establish two regimes of parameters, separated by an explicit critical curve, such that the speed is either eventually strictly increasing or eventually strictly decreasing. This is in sharp contrast to the biased random walk on a static supercritical percolation cluster, where the speed is known to be eventually zero.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02101v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses a continuous-time contracting model that extends the problem introduced by Sannikov and later rigorously analysed by Possama\"{i} and Touzi. In our model, a principal hires a risk-averse agent to carry out a project. Specifically, the agent can perform two different tasks, namely to increase the instantaneous growth rate of the project's value, and to reduce the likelihood of accidents occurring. In order to compensate for these costly actions, the principal offers a continuous stream of payments throughout the entire duration of a contract, which concludes at a random time, potentially resulting in a lump-sum payment. We examine the consequences stemming from the introduction of accidents, modelled by a compound Poisson process that negatively impact the project's value. Furthermore, we investigate whether certain economic scenarii are still characterised by a golden parachute as in Sannikov's model. A golden parachute refers to a situation where the agent stops working and subsequently receives a compensation, which may be either a lump-sum payment leading to termination of the contract or a continuous stream of payments, thereby corresponding to a pension.</description>

Abstract: A L\'evy processes resurrected in the positive half-line is a Markov process obtained by removing successively all jumps that make it negative. A natural question, given this construction, is whether the resulting process is absorbed at 0 or not. We first describe the law of the resurrected process in terms of that of the initial L\'evy process. Then in many important classes of L\'evy processes, we give conditions for absorption and conditions for non absorption bearing on the characteristics of the initial L\'evy process.</description>

As applications, we (i) explore the long time probability distance estimate between an SDE and its delay version; (ii) investigate the issue on uniform-in-time propagation of chaos for McKean-Vlasov SDEs, where the drifts might be singular with respect to the spatial variables and need not to be of convolution type; (iii) tackle the discretization error bounds in an infinite-time horizon for stochastic algorithms (e.g. backward/tamed/adaptive Euler-Maruyama schemes as three typical candidates) associated with McKean-Vlasov SDEs.</description>

      <title>Skew-symmetric schemes for stochastic differential equations with non-Lipschitz drift: an unadjusted Barker algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14373v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new simple and explicit numerical scheme for time-homogeneous stochastic differential equations. The scheme is based on sampling increments at each time step from a skew-symmetric probability distribution, with the level of skewness determined by the drift and volatility of the underlying process. We show that as the step-size decreases the scheme converges weakly to the diffusion of interest, and also prove path-wise accuracy in a particular setting. We then consider the problem of simulating from the limiting distribution of an ergodic diffusion process using the numerical scheme with a fixed step-size. We establish conditions under which the numerical scheme converges to equilibrium at a geometric rate, and quantify the bias between the equilibrium distributions of the scheme and of the true diffusion process. Notably, our results do not require a global Lipschitz assumption on the drift, in contrast to those required for the Euler--Maruyama scheme for long-time simulation at fixed step-sizes. Our weak convergence result relies on an extension of the theory of Milstein \&amp; Tretyakov to stochastic differential equations with non-Lipschitz drift, which could also be of independent interest. We support our theoretical results with numerical simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09080v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper initiates the study of the conformal field theory of the SLE$_\kappa$ loop measure $\nu$ for $\kappa\in(0,4]$, the range where the loop is almost surely simple. First, we construct two commuting representations $(\mathbf{L}_n,\bar{\mathbf{L}}_n)_{n\in\mathbb{Z}}$ of the Virasoro algebra with central charge $c_\mathrm{M}=1-6(\frac{2}{\sqrt{\kappa}}-\frac{\sqrt{\kappa}}{2})^2\leq1$ as (unbounded) first order differential operators on $L^2(\nu)$. Second, we introduce highest-weight representations and characterise their structure: in particular, we prove the existence of vanishing singular vectors at arbitrary levels on the Kac table. Third, we prove an integration by parts formula for the SLE loop measure, and use it to define the Shapovalov form of the representation, a non degenerate (but \emph{not} positive definite) Hermitian form $\mathcal{Q}$ on $L^2(\nu)$ with a remarkably simple geometric expression. The fact that $\mathcal{Q}$ differs from the $L^2(\nu)$-inner product is a manifestation of non-unitarity. Finally, we write down a spectral resolution of $\mathcal{Q}$ using the joint diagonalisation of $\mathbf{L}_0$ and $\bar{\mathbf{L}}_0$. As an application of these results, we provide the first proof of the uniqueness of restriction measures, as conjectured by Kontsevich and Suhov.
  Our results lay the groundwork for an in-depth study of the CFT of SLE: in forthcoming works, we will define correlation functions on Riemann surfaces, and prove conformal Ward identities, BPZ equations, and conformal bootstrap formulas.</description>

      <title>Integrability of Conformal Loop Ensemble: Imaginary DOZZ Formula and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.01788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.01788v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The scaling limit of the probability that $n$ points are on the same cluster for 2D critical percolation is believed to be governed by a conformal field theory (CFT). Although this is not fully understood, Delfino and Viti (2010) made a remarkable prediction on the exact value of a properly normalized three-point probability. It is expressed in terms of the imaginary DOZZ formula of Schomerus, Zamolodchikov and Kostov-Petkova, which extends the structure constants of minimal model CFTs to continuous parameters. Later, similar conjectures were made for scaling limits of random cluster models and O$(n)$ loop models, representing certain three-point observables in terms of the imaginary DOZZ formula. Since the scaling limits of these models can be described by the conformal loop ensemble (CLE), such conjectures can be formulated as exact statements on CLE observables. In this paper, we prove Delfino and Viti's conjecture on percolation as well as a conjecture of Ikhlef, Jacobsen and Saleur (2015) on the nesting loop statistics of CLE. Our proof is based on the coupling between CLE and Liouville quantum gravity on the sphere, and is inspired by the fact that after reparametrization, the imaginary DOZZ formula is the reciprocal of the three-point function of Liouville CFT. Recently, Nivesvivat, Jacobsen and Ribault systematically studied a CFT with a large class of CLE observables as its correlation functions, including the ones from these two conjectures. We believe that our framework admits sufficient flexibility to exactly solve the three-point functions for CLE observables with natural geometric interpretations, including those from this CFT. As a demonstration, we solve the case corresponding to three points lying on the same loop, where the answer is a variant of the imaginary DOZZ formula.</description>

      <title>Risk-averse mean field games: exploitability and non-asymptotic analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.06930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.06930v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we use mean field games (MFGs) to investigate approximations of $N$-player games with uniformly symmetrically continuous heterogeneous closed-loop actions. To incorporate agents' risk aversion (beyond the classical expected utility of total costs), we use an abstract evaluation functional for their performance criteria. Centered around the notion of exploitability, we conduct non-asymptotic analysis on the approximation capability of MFGs from the perspective of state-action distributions without requiring the uniqueness of equilibria. Under suitable assumptions, we first show that scenarios in the $N$-player games with large $N$ and small average exploitabilities can be well approximated by approximate solutions of MFGs with relatively small exploitabilities. We then show that $\delta$-mean field equilibria can be used to construct $\varepsilon$-equilibria in $N$-player games. Furthermore, in this general setting, we prove the existence of mean field equilibria. This proof reveals a possible avenue for incorporating penalization for randomized action into MFGs.</description>

      <title>Counting graphic sequences via integrated random walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.07022v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given an integer $n$, let $G(n)$ be the number of integer sequences $n-1\ge d_1\ge d_2\ge\dotsb\ge d_n\ge 0$ that are the degree sequence of some graph. We show that $G(n)=(c+o(1))4^n/n^{3/4}$ for some constant $c&gt;0$, improving both the previously best upper and lower bounds by a factor of $n^{1/4}$ (up to polylog-factors).
  Additionally, we answer a question of Royle, extend the values of $n$ for which the exact value of $G(n)$ is known from $n\le290$ to $n\le 1651$ and determine the asymptotic probability that the integral of a (lazy) simple symmetric random walk bridge remains non-negative.</description>

      <title>An $L_{q}(L_{p})$-regularity theory for parabolic equations with integro-differential operators having low intensity kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08871v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we present the existence, uniqueness, and regularity of solutions to parabolic equations with non-local operators $$ \partial_{t}u(t,x) = \mathcal{L}^{a}u(t,x) + f(t,x), \quad t&gt;0 $$ in $L_{q}(L_{p})$ spaces. Our spatial operator $\mathcal{L}^{a}$ is an integro-differential operator of the form $$ \int_{\mathbb{R}^{d}} \left( u(x+y)-u(x) -\nabla u(x) \cdot y \mathrm{1}_{|y|\leq 1} \right) a(t,y) j_{d}(|y|)dy. $$ Here, $a(t,y)$ is a merely bounded measurable coefficient, and we employed the theory of additive process to handle it. We investigate conditions on $j_{d}(r)$ which yield $L_{q}(L_{p})$-regularity of solutions. Our assumptions on $j_d$ are general so that $j_d(r)$ may be comparable to $r^{-d}\ell(r^{-1})$ for a function $\ell$ which is slowly varying at infinity. For example, we can take $\ell(r)=\log{(1+r^{\alpha})}$ or $\ell(r) = \min{\{r^{\alpha},1\}}$ ($\alpha\in(0,2)$). Indeed, our result covers the operators whose Fourier multiplier $\psi(\xi)$ does not have any scaling condition for $|\xi|\geq 1$. Furthermore, we give some examples of operators, which cannot be covered by previous results where smoothness or scaling conditions on $\psi$ are considered.</description>

      <title>Metric Entropy-Free Sample Complexity Bounds for Sample Average Approximation in Convex Stochastic Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00664v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies sample average approximation (SAA) in solving convex or strongly convex stochastic programming (SP) problems. Under some common regularity conditions, we show -- perhaps for the first time -- that SAA's sample complexity can be completely free from any quantification of metric entropy (such as the logarithm of the covering number), leading to a significantly more efficient rate with dimensionality $d$ than most existing results. From the newly established complexity bounds, an important revelation is that SAA and the canonical stochastic mirror descent (SMD) method, two mainstream solution approaches to SP, entail almost identical rates of sample efficiency, rectifying a persistent theoretical discrepancy of SAA from SMD by the order of $O(d)$. Furthermore, this paper explores non-Lipschitzian scenarios where SAA maintains provable efficacy but the corresponding results for SMD remain mostly unexplored, indicating the potential of SAA's better applicability in some irregular settings.</description>

      <title>New Lower Bounds for the Schur-Siegel-Smyth Trace Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03252v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive and implement a new way to find lower bounds on the smallest limiting trace-to-degree ratio of totally positive algebraic integers and improve the previously best known bound to 1.80203. Our method adds new constraints to Smyth's linear programming method to decrease the number of variables required in the new problem of interest. This allows for faster convergence recovering Schur's bound in the simplest case and Siegel's bound in the second simplest case of our new family of bounds. We also prove the existence of a unique optimal solution to our newly phrased problem and express the optimal solution in terms of polynomials. Lastly, we solve this new problem numerically with a gradient descent algorithm to attain the new bound 1.80203.</description>

      <title>A model for horizontally restricted random square-tiled surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14041v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A square-tiled surface (STS) is a (finite, possibly branched) cover of the standard square-torus with possible branching over exactly 1 point. Alternately, STSs can be viewed as finitely many axis-parallel squares with sides glued in parallel pairs. After a labelling of the squares by $\{1, \dots, n\}$, we can describe an STS with $n$ squares using two permutations $\sigma, \tau \in S_n$, where $\sigma$ encodes how the squares are glued horizontally and $\tau$ encodes how the squares are glued vertically. Hence, a previously considered natural model for STSs with $n$ squares is $S_n \times S_n$ with the uniform distribution. We modify this model to obtain a new one: We fix $\alpha \in [0,1]$ and let $\mathcal{K}_{\mu_n}$ be a conjugacy class of $S_n$ with at most $n^\alpha$ cycles. Then $\mathcal{K}_{\mu_n} \times S_n$ with the uniform distribution is a model for STSs with restricted horizontal gluings. We deduce the asymptotic (as $n$ grows) number of components, genus distribution, most likely stratum and set of holonomy vectors of saddle connections for random STSs in this new model.</description>
