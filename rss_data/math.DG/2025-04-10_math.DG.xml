      <title>Poisson Manifolds of Compact Types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop the theory of Poisson and Dirac manifolds of compact types, a broad generalization in Poisson and Dirac geometry of compact Lie algebras and Lie groups. We establish key structural results, including local normal forms, canonical stratifications, and a Weyl type resolution, which provides a way to resolve the singularities of the original structure. These tools allow us to show that the leaf space of such manifolds is an integral affine orbifold and to define their Weyl group. This group is a Coxeter group acting on the orbifold universal cover of the leaf space by integral affine transformations, and one can associate to it Weyl chambers, reflection hyperplanes, etc. We further develop a Duistermaat-Heckman theory for Poisson manifolds of s-proper type, proving the linear variation of cohomology of leafwise symplectic form and establishing a Weyl integration formula. As an application, we show that every Poisson manifold of compact type is necessarily regular. We conclude the paper with a list of open problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the collpasing K\"{a}hler-Ricci flow on Hirzebruch surfaces, which develops finite time singularities. We show that any tangent flow based at a point in the singular time slice is the K\"{a}hler-Ricci flow associated with a nonflat gradient K\"{a}hler-Ricci shrinker with finitely many orbifold singularities .</description>

      <title>Invariant Poisson Structures on Homogeneous Manifolds: Algebraic Characterization, Symplectic Foliation, and Contravariant Connections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study invariant Poisson structures on homogeneous manifolds, which serve as a natural generalization of homogeneous symplectic manifolds previously explored in the literature. Our work begins by providing an algebraic characterization of invariant Poisson structures on homogeneous manifolds. More precisely, we establish a connection between these structures and solutions to a specific type of classical Yang-Baxter equation. This leads us to explain a bijective correspondence between invariant Poisson tensors and class of Lie subalgebras: For a connected Lie group $G$ with lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$, and $H$ a connected closed subgroup with Lie algebra $\mathfrak{h}$, we demonstrate that the class of $G$-invariant Poisson tensors on $G/H$ is in bijective correspondence with the class of Lie subalgebras $\mathfrak{a} \subset \mathfrak{g}$ containing $\mathfrak{h}$, equipped with a $2$-cocycle $\omega$ satisfying $\mathrm{Rad}(\omega) = \mathfrak{h}$. Then, we explore numerous examples of invariant Poisson structures, focusing on reductive and symmetric pairs. Furthermore, we show that the symplectic foliation associated with invariant Poisson structures consists of homogeneous symplectic manifolds. Finally, we investigate invariant contravariant connections on homogeneous spaces endowed with invariant Poisson structures. This analysis extends the study by K. Nomizu of invariant covariant connections on homogeneous spaces.</description>

      <title>Extremal metrics involving scalar curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate extremal metrics at which various types of rigidity theorems involving scalar curvatures hold. The rigidity we discuss here is related to the rigidity theorems presented by Mario Listing in his previous preprint. More specifically, we give some sufficient conditions for metrics not to be rigid in this sense. We also give several examples of Riemannian manifolds that satisfy such sufficient conditions.</description>

      <title>A Hilbert--Mumford criterion for generalised Monge--Amp\`ere equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a new numerical criterion in the spirit of GIT for existence of solutions to inverse Hessian equations, including in particular the J-equation. Our criterion is formulated in terms of stability of pairs in the sense of Paul. To that end, we build on previous work of the author with Dervan, and generalise a result of Zhang, proving isometry between generalised Chow line bundles and mixed Deligne pairings.</description>

      <title>Urysohn width of hypersurfaces and positive macroscopic scalar curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that if a complete Riemannian $n$-manifold with non-trivial codimension 1 homology with $\mathbb{Z}_2$-coefficients or $\mathbb{Z}$-coefficients has positive macroscopic scalar curvature large enough, then it contains a non-nullhomologous hypersurface of small Urysohn $(n-2)$-width. This constitutes a macroscopic analogue of a theorem by Bray--Brendle--Neves on the area of non-contractible 2-spheres in a closed Riemannian 3-manifold with positive scalar curvature. Our proof is based on an adaptation of Guth's macroscopic version of the Schoen-Yau descent argument.</description>

      <title>On manifolds with almost non-negative Ricci curvature and integrally-positive $k^{th}$-scalar curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider manifolds with almost non-negative Ricci curvature and strictly positive integral lower bounds on the sum of the lowest $k$ eigenvalues of the Ricci tensor.
  If $(M^n,g)$ is a Riemannian manifold satisfying such curvature bounds for $k=2$, then we show that $M$ is contained in a neighbourhood of controlled width of an isometrically embedded $1$-dimensional sub-manifold. From this, we deduce several metric and topological consequences: $M$ has at most linear volume growth and at most two ends, the first Betti number of $M$ is bounded above by $1$, and there is precise information on elements of infinite order in $\pi_1(M)$.
  If $(M^n,g)$ is a Riemannian manifold satisfying such bounds for $k\geq 2$ and additionally the Ricci curvature is asymptotically non-negative, then we show that $M$ has at most $(k-1)$-dimensional behavior at large scales. If $k=n={\rm dim}(M)$, so that the integral lower bound is on the scalar curvature, assuming in addition that the $n-2$-Ricci curvature is asymptotically non-negative, then we prove that the dimension drop at large scales improves to $n-2$. From the above results, we deduce topological restrictions, such as upper bounds on the first Betti number.</description>

      <title>The Singular CR Yamabe Problem and Hausdorff Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a compact pseudo-hermitian manifold (M,\theta, J), that is a manifold equipped with a contact form \theta and CR structure J. We consider a conformal deformation of the contact form to obtain a complete, singular contact form and a corresponding Yamabe problem. We estimate then the Hausdorff dimension of the singular set. The conformal geometry analog of this result is due to R. Schoen and S. -T. Yau. Results of this type have their origin in work by Huber for Riemann surfaces. In the second part of our paper we investigate the CR developing map for three dimensional CR manifolds. We establish the injectivity of the developing map essentially using the same strategy as Schoen and Yau for the conformal case which is based on the positive mass theorem. Higher dimensional analogs of Huber's theorem in the conformal case for Q curvature are due to Alice Chang, Jie Qing and P. Yang.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Totally real surfaces in the nearly K\"ahler $\mathbb{C}P^3$ are investigated and are completely classified under various additional assumptions, resulting in multiple new examples. Among others, the classification includes totally real surfaces that are extrinsically homogeneous; or minimal; or totally umbilical; or Codazzi-like (including parallel and non-parallel examples).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At a finite-time singularity of harmonic map flow in the critical dimension, we show that a Lojasiewicz inequality between the quantities appearing in Struwe's monotonicity formula implies continuity of the body map and the no-neck property for bubble-tree decompositions. We prove such an inequality when the target is $S^2,$ yielding both properties in this case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an obstruction theory for Hirsch extensions of cbba's with twisted coefficients. This leads to a variety of applications, including a structural theorem for minimal cbba's, a construction of relative minimal models with twisted coefficients, as well as a proof of uniqueness. These results are further employed to study automorphism groups of minimal cbba's and to characterize formality in terms of grading automorphisms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a family of dynamical systems with $k &gt; 0$ independent first integrals evolving in a compact region of an Euclidean space, we study the equilibrium locus. We show that under mild and generic conditions, it is a smooth manifold that can be viewed as the total space of a certain fiber bundle and that this bundle comes equipped with a natural connection. We then proceed to show parallel transport for this connection does exist and explore some of its properties. In particular, we elucidate how one can to some extent measure the variation of the system eigenvalues restricted to a given fiber.</description>

      <title>The conjugate locus on convex surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:1806.00278v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The conjugate locus of a point on a surface is the envelope of geodesics emanating radially from that point. In this paper we show that the conjugate loci of generic points on convex surfaces satisfy a simple relationship between the rotation index and the number of cusps. As a consequence we prove the `vierspitzensatz': the conjugate locus of a generic point on a convex surface must have at least four cusps. Along the way we prove certain results about evolutes in the plane and geodesic curvature. (Note: this is a corrected version of the original paper, see comment on page 5 and Appendix B).</description>

Abstract: We show that the combination of nonnegative 2-intermediate Ricci Curvature and strict positivity of scalar curvature forces rigidity of two-sided free boundary stable minimal hypersurface in a 4-manifold with bounded geometry and weakly convex boundary. This extends the method of Chodosh-Li-Stryker to free boundary minimal hypersurfaces in ambient manifolds with boundary.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16686v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a Lojasiewicz-Simon inequality $$ \left| E(u) - 4\pi n \right| \leq C \| \mathcal{T}(u) \|^\alpha $$ for maps $u \in W^{2,2}\left( S^2, S^2 \right).$ The inequality holds with $\alpha = 1$ in general and with $\alpha &gt; 1$ unless $u$ is nearly constant on an open set. We obtain polynomial convergence of weak solutions of harmonic map flow $u(t) : S^2 \to S^2$ as $t \to \infty$ on compact domains away from the singular set, assuming that the body map is nonconstant. The proof uses Topping's repulsion estimates together with polynomial lower bounds on the energy density coming from a bubble-tree induction argument.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04208v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the K\"ahler-Ricci flow on compact K\"ahler manifolds with semiample canonical bundle and intermediate Kodaira dimension, and show that the flow collapses to a canonical metric on the base of the Iitaka fibration in the locally smooth topology and with bounded Ricci curvature away from the singular fibers. This follows from an asymptotic expansion for the evolving metrics, in the spirit of recent work of the first and third-named authors on collapsing Calabi-Yau metrics, and proves two conjectures of Song and Tian.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we prove that any compact 2-sided smooth stable minimal hypersurface in gradient Ricci soliton $(M^{n},g,f)$ with scalar curvature $R\geq(n-1)\lambda$ must have vanished second fundamental form and vanished normal Ricci curvature. For shrinking gradient Ricci solitons with scalar curvature $R\geq(n-1)\lambda$, the existence of an area-minimizing hypersurface would imply $M$ is splitting.</description>

Abstract: For conformal boundary operators associated with the Paneitz operator, we introduce a rigorous definition of the biharmonic Poisson kernel consisting of a pair of kernel functions and derive its explicit representation formula. With this powerful tool, we establish classification theorems of nonnegative solutions to the $Q$-flat and constant $T$-curvature equations on $\mathbb{R}_+^{n+1}$ and $\mathbb{B}^{n+1}$.</description>

      <title>Isometric rigidity of $L^2$-spaces with manifold targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13914v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe the isometry group of $L^2(\Omega, M)$ for Riemannian manifolds $M$ of dimension at least two with irreducible universal cover. We establish a rigidity result for the isometries of these spaces: any isometry arises from an automorphism of $\Omega$ and a family of isometries of $M$, distinguishing these spaces from the classical $L^2(\Omega)$. Additionally, we prove that these spaces lack irreducible factors and that two such spaces are isometric if and only if the underlying manifolds are.</description>

      <title>Contact embeddings of 3-dimensional contact groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06085v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A 3-dimensional contact group is a 3-dimensional Lie group endowed with a left-invariant contact structure. Making use of techniques from Riemannian geometry, we prove that any simply connected 3-dimensional contact group not isomorphic to SU(2) satisfies a unique factorization property. As an application, we develop a method to construct embeddings of 3-dimensional simply connected contact groups into one among two model tight contact manifolds.</description>
