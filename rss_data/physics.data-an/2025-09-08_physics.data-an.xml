      <title>Detecting and Correcting Gain Jumps in TES Microcalorimeters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Arrays of microcalorimeters based on transition-edge sensors (TESs) are being actively deployed to laboratories all over the world. A TES microcalorimeter array produces very large quantities of data and users of these devices have varying levels of experience, so it is important to provide robust software for data acquisition and analysis that can function with minimal user supervision. This software should be capable of addressing common phenomena that can adversely affect spectrum quality. Gain jumping is one such phenomenon that is characterized by abrupt changes in the gain of a device. Left unaddressed, gain jumps can degrade spectra by introducing false peaks. We are not aware of any previously published methods for resetting gain jumps during data acquisition or existing algorithms for correcting data that is degraded by gain jumps. We have developed automated methods for detecting and correcting gain jumps in gamma-ray TES microcalorimeters. We present a procedure for resetting gain jumps during a live data acquisition that involves briefly driving the TES into its normal state using the bias current. We also describe an algorithm for locating gain jumps and identifying unique gain states within existing microcalorimeter data. Finally, we provide a possible approach for correcting gain jumps after they have been identified.</description>

      <title>When correcting for regression to the mean is worse than no correction at all</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ubiquitous regression to the mean (RTM) effect complicates statistical inference in biological studies of change. We demonstrate that common RTM correction methods are flawed: the Berry et al. method popularized by Kelly &amp; Price in The American Naturalist is unreliable for hypothesis testing, leading to both false positives and negatives, while the theoretically unbiased Blomqvist method has poor efficiency in limited sample sizes. Our findings show that the most robust approach to handling RTM is not to correct the data but to use the crude slope in conjunction with an assessment of the experiment's repeatability. Ultimately, we argue that any conclusion about a differential treatment effect is statistically unfounded without a clear understanding of the experiment's repeatability.</description>

      <title>Review of Machine Learning for Real-Time Analysis at the Large Hadron Collider experiments ALICE, ATLAS, CMS and LHCb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14578v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The field of high energy physics (HEP) has seen a marked increase in the use of machine learning (ML) techniques in recent years. The proliferation of applications has revolutionised many aspects of the data processing pipeline at collider experiments including the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). In this whitepaper, we discuss the increasingly crucial role that ML plays in real-time analysis (RTA) at the LHC, namely in the context of the unique challenges posed by the trigger systems of the large LHC experiments. We describe a small selection of the ML applications in use at the large LHC experiments to demonstrate the breadth of use-cases. We continue by emphasising the importance of collaboration and engagement between the HEP community and industry, highlighting commonalities and synergies between the two. The mutual benefits are showcased in several interdisciplinary examples of RTA from industrial contexts. This whitepaper, compiled by the SMARTHEP network, does not provide an exhaustive review of ML at the LHC but rather offers a high-level overview of specific real-time use cases.</description>
