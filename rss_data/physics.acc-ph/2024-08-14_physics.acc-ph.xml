      <title>Dynamic Exclusion of Low-Fidelity Data in Bayesian Optimization for Autonomous Beamline Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aligning beamlines at synchrotron light sources is a high-dimensional, expensive-to-sample optimization problem, as beams are focused using a series of dynamic optical components. Bayesian Optimization is an efficient machine learning approach to finding global optima of beam quality, but the model can easily be impaired by faulty data points caused by the beam going off the edge of the sensor or by background noise. This study, conducted at the National Synchrotron Light Source II (NSLS-II) facility at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL), is an investigation of methods to identify untrustworthy readings of beam quality and discourage the optimization model from seeking out points likely to yield low-fidelity beams. The approaches explored include dynamic pruning using loss analysis of size and position models and a lengthscale-based genetic algorithm to determine which points to include in the model for optimal fit. Each method successfully classified high and low fidelity points. This research advances BNL's mission to tackle our nation's energy challenges by providing scientists at all beamlines with access to higher quality beams, and faster convergence to these optima for their experiments.</description>

      <title>Target Development Using the Method of High-Intensity Vibrational Powder Plating (HIVIPP) at the Center for Accelerator Target Science (CATS) at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19052v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the primary goals of the Center for Accelerator Target Science (CATS) is to provide targets and foils in support of the ATLAS User Facility and the Low-Energy community at large. While a wide array of target production techniques are available at CATS, new methods that must be explored invariably arise. One such technique, the High-Intensity Vibrational Powder Plating (HIVIPP), was first reported in 1997 by Isao Sugai. It was developed to produce targets and stripper foils that were difficult to make by standard methods. At Argonne National Laboratory (ANL), we have successfully constructed and tested a simple system for this purpose. We have produced targets of carbon and titanium on various metal backings using the HIVIPP method. We are currently in the exciting phase of exploring the production of other elements, including isotopically enriched and radioactive material. This work is in progress and will be further detailed with specific examples.</description>
