      <title>Modeling Loss-Versus-Rebalancing in Automated Market Makers via Continuous-Installment Options</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper mathematically models a constant-function automated market maker (CFAMM) position as a portfolio of exotic options, known as perpetual American continuous-installment (CI) options. This model replicates an AMM position's delta at each point in time over an infinite time horizon, thus taking into account the perpetual nature and optionality to withdraw of liquidity provision. This framework yields two key theoretical results: (a) It proves that the AMM's adverse-selection cost, loss-versus-rebalancing (LVR), is analytically identical to the continuous funding fees (the time value decay or theta) earned by the at-the-money CI option embedded in the replicating portfolio. (b) A special case of this model derives an AMM liquidity position's delta profile and boundaries that suffer approximately constant LVR, up to a bounded residual error, over an arbitrarily long forward window. Finally, the paper describes how the constant volatility parameter required by the perpetual option can be calibrated from the term structure of implied volatilities and estimates the errors for both implied volatility calibration and LVR residual error. Thus, this work provides a practical framework enabling liquidity providers to choose an AMM liquidity profile and price boundaries for an arbitrarily long, forward-looking time window where they can expect an approximately constant, price-independent LVR. The results establish a rigorous option-theoretic interpretation of AMMs and their LVR, and provide actionable guidance for liquidity providers in estimating future adverse-selection costs and optimizing position parameters.</description>

      <title>Pricing energy spread options with variance gamma-driven Ornstein-Uhlenbeck dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11480v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the pricing of energy spread options for spot prices following an exponential Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process driven by a sum of independent multivariate variance gamma processes, which gives rise to mean-reverting, infinite activity price dynamics. Within this class of driving processes, the Esscher transform is used to obtain an equivalent martingale measure with a focus on the weak variance alpha-gamma process. By deriving an analytic expression for the cumulant generating function of the innovation term, we obtain a pricing formula for forwards and apply the FFT method of Hurd and Zhou to price spread options. Lastly, we demonstrate how the model should be both estimated on energy prices under the real world measure and calibrated on forward or call prices, and provide numerical results for the pricing of spread options.</description>
