      <title>GeoThinneR: An R Package for Efficient Spatial Thinning of Species Occurrences and Point Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we present GeoThinneR, an R package for efficient and flexible spatial thinning of species occurrence data. Spatial thinning is a widely used preprocessing step in species distribution modeling (SDM) that can help reduce sampling bias, but existing R implementations rely on brute-force algorithms that scale poorly with large datasets. GeoThinneR implements multiple thinning approaches, including ensuring a minimum distance between points, subsampling points on a grid, and filtering based on decimal precision. To handle large datasets, it introduces two optimized algorithms based on local kd-trees and adaptive neighbor estimation, which greatly reduce memory usage and execution time. Additional functionalities such as group-wise thinning and point prioritization are included to facilitate its use in SDM workflows. We here provide performance benchmarks using both simulated and real-world data to demonstrate substantial performance improvements over existing tools.</description>

      <title>How spatial patterns can lead to less resilient ecosystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several theoretical models predict that spatial patterning increases ecosystem resilience. However, these predictions rely on strong simplifying assumptions, such as isotropic and infinite ecosystems, and we lack empirical evidence directly linking spatial patterning to enhanced resilience. We introduce a unifying framework, encompassing existing models for vegetation pattern formation in water-stressed ecosystems, that relaxes these assumptions. This framework incorporates finite vegetated areas surrounded by desert and anisotropic environmental conditions that induce non-reciprocal plant interactions. Under these more realistic conditions, we identify a novel desertification mechanism, known as convective instability in physics but largely overlooked in ecology. These instabilities form when non-reciprocal interactions destabilize the vegetation-desert interface and can trigger desertification fronts even under stress levels where isotropic models predict stability. Importantly, ecosystems with periodic vegetation patterns are more vulnerable to convective instabilities than those with homogeneous vegetation, suggesting that spatial patterning may reduce, rather than enhance, resilience. These findings challenge the view of self-organized patterns as indicators of resilience and provide a new framework to investigate how spatial dynamics determine the stability and resilience of ecological systems across scales.</description>

      <title>The number of cultural traits, evolving genealogies, and the descendant process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a Moran-type model of cultural evolution, which describes how traits emerge, are transmitted, and get lost in populations. Our analysis focuses on the underlying cultural genealogies; they were first described by Aguilar (2015) and are closely related to the ancestral selection graph of population genetics, wherefore we call them ancestral learning graphs. We investigate their dynamical behaviour, that is, we are concerned with evolving genealogies. In particular, we consider the total length of the genealogy of a sample of individuals from a stationary population as a function of the (forward) time at which the sample is taken. This quantity shows a sawtooth-like dynamics with linear increase interrupted by collapses to near-zero at random times. We relate this to the metastable behaviour of the stochastic logistic model, which describes the evolution of the number of ancestors, or equivalently, the number of descendants of a given sample.
  We assume that new inventions appear independently in every individual, and all traits of the cultural parent are transmitted to the learner in any given learning event. The set of traits of an individual then agrees with the set of innovations along its genealogy. The properties of the genealogy thus translate into the properties of the trait set of a sample. In particular, the moments of the number of traits are obtained from the moments of the total length of the genealogy.</description>

      <title>Qualia &amp; Natural Selection: Formal Constraints on the Evolution of Consciousness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores foundational questions about the relationship of qualia to natural selection. The primary result is a derivation of specific formal conditions under which structural systems subject to natural selection can convey consistent effects in an associated qualitative domain, placing theoretical and empirical constraints on theories of consciousness. In order to achieve this result, information-theoretic measures are developed to quantify the mutual determinability between structure and quality, quantifying fidelity between the two domains. The fidelities represented by that space are then incorporated into the Price Equation to yield key bounds on the transmission of selective effects between domains. Finally, transmission of higher-order structures between domains is explored. Placement within a broader philosophical context can be found in the companion paper Structure &amp; Quality.</description>

      <title>New insights into population dynamics from the continuous McKendrick model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21103v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The article covers the continuous McKendrick model, which is key in epidemiology and population dynamics, developed by Anderson Gray McKendrick. It describes population age structure changes via birth and death rates as continuous functions, shedding light on population dynamics through differential equations. The article delves into the equations, boundary conditions, and survival rates, offering insights into disease progression and population dynamics. It aims for an asymptotic analysis of population dynamics using previous studies and illustrative examples. The main finding is that the population nears extinction only if the expected offspring per individual ($R$) is less than 1.</description>
