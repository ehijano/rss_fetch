      <title>Coherence length in a dilute flat-band superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To explore the influence of quantum-geometric effects on the Ginzburg-Landau coherence length in a dilute flat-band superconductor, we adopt a BCS-BEC crossover approach to the multiband pyrochlore-Hubbard model near the critical temperature for superconductivity. Our self-consistent formulation for this three-dimensional lattice benchmarks very well against the so-called zero-temperature coherence length, demonstrating the monotonic decay of the coherence length to zero as the interaction strength increases. Additionally, we show that the effective mass of the many-body bound states (i.e., Cooper pairs) is nearly identical to that of the lowest-lying two-body bound states in the dilute flat-band limit.</description>

      <title>Necklace-like pattern of vortex bound states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vortex is a topological defect in the superconducting condensate when a magnetic field is applied to a type-II superconductor, as elucidated by the Ginzburg-Landau theory. Due to the confinement of the quasiparticles by a vortex, it exhibits a circular shaped pattern of bound states with discrete energy levels, as predicted by the Caroli-de Gennes-Matricon theory in 1964. Here, however, we report a completely new type of vortex pattern which is necklace-like in an iron-based superconductor KCa2Fe4As4F2. Our theoretical analysis shows that this necklace-like vortex pattern arises from selective off-shell interference between vortex bound states of opposite angular momenta in the presence of rotational symmetry breaking due to disorders. This fascinating effect can be observed in a system with a small Fermi energy and wave vector, conditions fortuitously met in our samples. Our results not only disclose a novel vortex structure but also provide insights into comprehending the physics of the superconducting condensate.</description>

      <title>Inherently dissipative normal currents during thermodynamic changes of state in superconductors: Joule heating vs. magnetocaloric cooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A thermodynamic change of state in the Meissner phase of a superconductor at finite temperature, such as the cooling or the heating it in a constant external magnetic field, inevitably generates normal currents of unpaired electrons. These currents are induced by the time-dependent variations in the local magnetic-flux density associated with the imposed change of state. They may not only lead to certain deviations of the magnetic-field distribution from textbook Meissner profiles, but also cause dissipative Joule heating, which appears to be at odds with the expected reversibility in a truly thermodynamic superconducting state. We show that these normal currents also produce a magnetocaloric cooling, which in total instantaneously and precisely compensates for the dissipated heat, thus ensuring overall energy conservation and reversibility. However, the time-dependent Joule heating and magnetocaloric cooling processes are spatially distinct and therefore must result in small temperature inhomogeneities that will only fade away towards thermodynamic equilibrium after the thermodynamic change of state has halted.</description>

      <title>Influence of trapped magnetic field of Sn-Pb solders on electrical resistivity measurement: an example of superconducting transition of Sn</title>

Abstract: Soldering has been used in various scientific and industry cases for long time. In researches of materials science and condensed matter physics, researchers have used soldering to fabricate electrical terminals for characterization of electric properties. In a recent study, anomalously huge magnetic flux trapping has been observed in the Sn-Pb solders after field cooling or high-field experience at low temperatures lower than superconducting transition temperature (T &lt; Tc = 7.2 K) of the solders. In this letter, we tested the affection of the flux-trapped states of solders (Sn60-Pb40) on superconducting properties of a Sn wire (Tc = 3.7 K) because solders have been generally used for investigation of superconducting samples. The temperature dependence of electrical resistivity (\r{ho}-T) at H = 0 Oe after zero-field cooling (ZFC) showed normal sharp superconducting transition at T = 3.7 K. In contrast, the \r{ho}-T after field cooling (FC) showed lowered Tcs and broadening of the superconducting transition. The difference in \r{ho}-T between ZFC and FC states evidences the critical affection of the flux-trapped states of Sn-Pb solders on superconducting states. We propose that, in electrical measurements where magnetic field of several hundred Oe, the field experience should be seriously considered in the experiments.</description>

      <title>Modeling and Suppressing Unwanted Parasitic Interactions in Superconducting Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconducting qubits are among the most promising candidates for building quantum computers. Despite significant improvements in qubit coherence, achieving a fault-tolerant quantum computer remains a major challenge, largely due to imperfect gate fidelity. A key source of this infidelity is the parasitic interaction between coupled qubits, which this thesis addresses in two- and three-qubit circuits. This parasitic interaction causes a bending between computational and non-computational levels, leading to a parasitic ZZ interaction. The thesis first investigates the possibility of zeroing the ZZ interaction in two qubit combinations: a pair of interacting transmons, and a hybrid pair of a transmon coupled to a capacitively shunted flux qubit (CSFQ). The theory developed is used to accurately simulate experimental results from our collaborators, who measured a CSFQ-transmon pair with and without a cross-resonance (CR) gate. The strong agreement between theory and experiment motivated further study of a CR gate that achieves 99.9% fidelity in the absence of static ZZ interaction. Since the CR pulse adds an additional ZZ component to the static part, a new strategy called dynamical ZZ freedom is proposed to zero the total ZZ interaction. This strategy can be applied in all-transmon circuits to enable perfect entanglement. Based on these findings, a new two-qubit gate, the parasitic-free (PF) gate, is proposed. Additionally, the thesis explores how to utilize the ZZ interaction to enhance the performance of a controlled-Z gate. Lastly, the impact of a third qubit on two-qubit gate performance is examined, with several examples illustrating the properties of two-body ZZ and three-body ZZZ interactions in circuits with more than two qubits.</description>

      <title>DFT+DMFT study of correlated electronic structure in the monolayer-trilayer phase of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By preforming DFT+DMFT calculations, we systematically investigate the correlated electronic structure in the newly discovered monolayer-trilayer (ML-TL) phase of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ (1313-La327). Our calculated Fermi surfaces are in good agreement with the angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) results. We find that 1313-La327 is a multiorbital correlated metal. An orbital-selective Mott behavior is found in ML. The ML Ni-3$d_{z^2}$ orbitals exhibit a Mott behavior, while the ML Ni-3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals are metallic due to self-doping. And the ML also shows features of heavy fermions, which indicates that there may be Kondo physics in 1313-La327. We also find a large static local spin susceptibility of ML Ni, suggesting that there is large spin fluctuation in 1313-La327. The TL Ni-$e_g$ orbitals possess similar electronic correlation to those in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ (La4310). The $e_g$ orbitals of the outer-layer Ni in TL (TL-outer Ni) show non-Fermi liquid behaviors. Besides, large weight of high-spin states are found in TL-outer Ni and ML Ni, implying Hundness. Under 16 GPa, a Lifshitz transition is revealed by our calculations and a La-related band crosses the Fermi level. Our work provides a theoretical reference for studying other potential mixed-stacked nickelate superconductors.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in three-dimensional interacting doped topological insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Three-dimensional doped Dirac insulators foster simply connected (in both topological and trivial regimes) and annular (deep inside the topological regime) Fermi surfaces (FSs) in the normal state, and allow on-site repulsions among fermions with opposite spin ($U_1$) and parity ($U_2$) eigenvalues. From an unbiased leading-order (one-loop) renormalization group analysis, controlled by a suitable $\epsilon$ expansion, we show that this system develops strong propensity toward the nucleation of scalar $s$-wave and odd-parity pseudoscalar $p$-wave pairings, favored by repulsive $U_1$ and $U_2$ interactions, respectively, irrespective of the underlying FS topology. Our results can be pertinent for the observed superconductivity in various doped narrow gap semiconductors, and the theoretical foundation can readily be applied to investigate similar phenomenon in various doped topological materials.</description>

      <title>Search for inhomogeneous Meissner screening in Nb induced by low-temperature surface treatments</title>

Abstract: Empirical surface treatments, such as low-temperature baking (LTB) in a gaseous atmosphere or in vacuum, are important for the surface preparation of Nb superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavities. These treatments inhomogeneously dope the first $\sim$50 nm of Nb's subsurface and are expected to impart depth-dependent characteristics to its Meissner response; however, direct evidence supporting this remains elusive, suggesting the effect is subtle. In this work, we revisit the Meissner profile data for several LTB treatments obtained from low-energy muon spin rotation (LE-$\mu$SR) experiments [A. Romanenko et al., Appl. Phys. Lett. 104, 072601 (2014) and R. M. L. McFadden et al., Phys. Rev. Appl. 19, 044018 (2023)], and search for signatures of inhomogeneous field screening. Using a generalized London expression with a recently proposed empirical model for a depth-dependent magnetic penetration depth $\lambda(z)$, we obtain improved fits to the Meissner data, revealing that the presence of a non-superconducting surface "dead layer" $d \geq 25$ nm is a strong indicator of a reduced supercurrent density at shallow subsurface depths. Our analysis supports the notion that vacuum annealing at 120 $^{\circ}$C for 48 h induces a depth-dependent Meissner response, which has consequences for Nb's ability to maintain a magnetic-flux-free state. Evidence of similar behavior from a "nitrogen infusion" treatment is less compelling. Suggestions for further investigation into the matter are provided.</description>

      <title>Bypassing the lattice BCS-BEC crossover in strongly correlated superconductors: resilient coherence from multiorbital physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09063v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superconductivity emerges from the spatial coherence of a macroscopic condensate of Cooper pairs. Increasingly strong binding and localization of electrons into these pairs compromises the condensate's phase stiffness, thereby limiting critical temperatures -- a phenomenon known as the BCS-BEC crossover in lattice systems. In this study, we demonstrate enhanced superconductivity in a multiorbital model of alkali-doped fullerides (A$_3$C$_{60}$) that goes beyond the limits of the lattice BCS-BEC crossover. We identify that the interplay of strong correlations and multiorbital effects results in a localized superconducting state characterized by a short coherence length but robust stiffness and a domeless rise in critical temperature with increasing pairing interaction. To derive these insights, we introduce a new theoretical framework allowing us to calculate the fundamental length scales of superconductors, namely the coherence length ($\xi_0$) and the London penetration depth ($\lambda_{\mathrm{L}}$), even in presence of strong electron correlations.</description>

      <title>Theory of quasiparticle-induced errors in driven-dissipative Schr\"odinger cat qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15310v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the mechanisms of qubit decoherence is a crucial prerequisite for improving the qubit performance. In this work we discuss the effects of residual Bogolyubov quasiparticles in Schr\"odinger cat qubits, either of the dissipative or Kerr type. The major difference from previous studies of quasiparticles in superconducting qubits is that the Schr\"odinger cat qubits are operated under non-equilibrium conditions. Indeed, an external microwave drive is needed to stabilize "cat states", which are superpositions of coherent degenerate eigenstates of an effective stationary Lindbladian in the rotating frame. We present a microscopic derivation of the master equation for cat qubits and express the effect of the quasiparticles as dissipators acting on the density matrix of the cat qubit. This enables us to determine the conditions under which the quasiparticles give a substantial contribution to the qubit errors.</description>

      <title>Mean Field Study of Superconductivity in the Square Lattice $t$-$J$ Model with Three-Site Hopping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08780v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It remains an open question whether the two-dimensional single-band pure Hubbard model and its related pure $t$-$J$ model truly capture the superconducting order in cuprates. Recent numerical studies on this issue have raised a notable disparity in superconducting order between the pure Hubbard model and the pure $t$-$J$ model. Inspired by these, we investigate the role of the three-site hopping term in $d$-wave superconductivity, such a term is usually neglected in the effective Hamiltonian of the Hubbard model, though its amplitude is of the same order as the superexchange coupling $J$ in the $t$-$J$ model. Our slave-boson mean-field solution demonstrates the suppression of $d$-wave superconducting order by incorporating the three-site hopping term, consistent with numerical observations by the density matrix renormalization group. This suppression could be understood as a result of competition between superexchange interaction and three-site hopping, the former favors $d$-wave pairing while the latter favors $s$-wave pairing. We also discussed its role in quasiparticle dispersion and boson-condensation temperature. Our findings may offer an alternative understanding of the recent numerical contrasting findings in the strong coupling regime: the absent or weak superconductivity in the pure Hubbard model, while the robust superconductivity in the $t$-$J$ model without including the three-site hopping term.</description>
