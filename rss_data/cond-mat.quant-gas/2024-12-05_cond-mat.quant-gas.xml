      <title>Acoustic black holes, white holes, and wormholes in Bose-Einstein condensates in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a previous article, we studied stationary solutions to the dynamics of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) corresponding to acoustic (or Unruh) black/white holes, namely configurations where the flow becomes supersonic creating a horizon for phonons. In this paper, we consider again the Gross-Pitaevskii Equation (GPE) but looking for stationary numerical solutions in the case where the couplings are position dependent in a prescribed manner. Initially we consider a 2D quantum gas in a funnel-like spatial metric. We then reinterpret this solution as a solution in a flat metric but with spatially dependent coupling and external potential. In these solutions the local speed of sound and magnitude of flow velocity cross, indicating the existence of a supersonic region and therefore of sonic analogues of black/white holes and wormholes. We discuss the numerical techniques used. We also study phase (and density) fluctuations in these solutions and derive approximate acoustic metric tensors. For certain external potentials, we find uniform density acoustic black hole configurations and obtain their Hawking temperature.</description>

      <title>Self-Similar acoustic white hole solutions in Bose-Einstein condensates and their Borel analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study Self-Similar configurations of non-relativistic Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) described by the Gross-Pitaevskii Equation (GPE). To be precise, we discuss singular Self-similar solutions of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation in 2D (with circular symmetry) and 3D (with spherical symmetry). We use these solutions to check for the crossover between the local speed of sound in the condensate and the magnitude of the flow velocity of the condensate, indicating the existence of a supersonic region and thus a sonic analog of a black/white hole. This is because phonons cannot go against the condensate flow from the supersonic to the subsonic region in such a system. We also discuss numerical techniques used and study the semi-analytical Laplace-Borel resummation of asymptotic series solutions while making use of the asymptotic transseries to justify the choice of numerical and semi-analytical approaches taken.</description>

      <title>Algebraic law of local correlation in the dynamically tuned Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate both analytically and numerically the buildup of antiferromagnetic (AF) correlation in the dynamically tuned Ising model with various geometries by using the Rydberg atomic system. It is shown that Magnus expansion up to second order for the local lattice geometries can describe quantitatively the creation of the AF correlation for different lattice arrays, e.g., $2 \times n$ lattice, cyclic lattice with star, and triangular lattice. We find that the magnitude of AF correlation for the same Manhattan distance is the algebraic sum of the correlations contributed by all shortest paths -- a typical superposition law. Such a law is independent of nonequivalent paths, lattice geometries, and quench style.</description>

      <title>Non-Bloch Dirac Points and Phase Diagram in the Stacked Non-Hermitian SSH Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological semimetals exhibit protected band crossings in momentum space, accompanied by corresponding surface states. Non-Hermitian Hamiltonians introduce geometry-sensitive features that dissolve this bulk-boundary correspondence principle. In this paper, we exemplify this phenomenon by investigating a non-Hermitian 2D stacked SSH chain model with non-reciprocal hopping and on-site gain/loss. We derive an analytical phase diagram in terms of the complex energy gaps in the open-boundary spectrum. The phase diagram reveals the existence of non-Bloch Dirac points, which feature a real spectrum and only appear under open boundary conditions but disappear in Bloch bands under periodic boundary conditions. Due to the reality of the spectrum in the vicinity of non-Bloch Dirac points, we can locally map it to Hermitian semimetals within the Altland-Zirnabuer symmetry classes. Based on this mapping, we demonstrate that non-Bloch Dirac points are characterized by an integer topological charge. Unlike the band crossings in Hermitian semimetals, the locations of the non-Bloch Dirac points under different boundary geometries do not match each other, indicating a geometry-dependent bulk-boundary correspondence in non-Hermitian semimetals. Our findings provide new pathways into establishing unconventional bulk-boundary correspondence for non-Bloch Dirac metals in non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>A Lower-Dimensional Remnant of Flux Attachment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flux attachment is a mechanism allowing electric charges to capture magnetic flux in two spatial dimensions. Fundamentally, this is a consequence of the Aharonov-Bohm effect or, in field-theoretic language, of a Chern-Simons term. This is also intimately related to a transmutation of the exchange statistics of the original charges. We show that a remnant of this mechanism is found after a dimensional reduction of a pure Chern-Simons theory and its subsequent coupling to matter.</description>

      <title>Signature of Andreev-Bashkin superfluid drag from Cavity Optomechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21015v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Andreev-Bashkin (AB) effect, corresponding to the dissipationless dragging of one superfluid by another, was predicted almost fifty years ago but has so far eluded experimental detection. In this work, we theoretically introduce an entirely new detection paradigm to this quest, and show that it enables the observation of the hitherto undetected AB effect for realistic parameters. We accomplish this by using the powerful techniques of cavity optomechanics, which were crucial to the observation of gravitational waves, on a spinor ring Bose-Einstein condensate. In contrast to all known AB detection methods, our scheme allows for real-time, \textit{in situ}, minimally destructive and three orders-of-magnitude more sensitive measurement of the AB effect. Our proposal, which considers persistent currents in weakly repulsive atomic condensates, and amplifies the AB signal using a novel dynamic Bragg spectroscopy technique, is supported by numerical simulations of the stochastic Gross-Pitaevski equation, which agree very well with our analytic Bogoliubov-de Gennes calculations. Our work suggests a novel tool for sensitively and nondestructively probing the dynamics of rotationally interacting superfluids using cavities and has fundamental implications for ongoing studies of superfluid hydrodynamics, atomtronics, matter-wave interferometry, and cavity optomechanical sensing.</description>

      <title>Anomalous wave-packet transport on boundaries of Floquet topological systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02086v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A two-dimensional periodically driven (Floquet) system with zero winding number in the absence of time-reversal symmetry is usually considered topologically trivial. Here, we study the dynamics of a Gaussian wave packet placed at the boundary of a two-dimensional driven system with zero winding numbers but multiple valley-protected edge states that can be realized in a square Raman lattice, and investigate the unidirectionally propagating topological edge currents. By carefully tuning the initial parameters of the wave packet including its spin polarization as well as the initial time of the periodic driving, we control the population of different edge states, where the speed of the resulting propagation establishes a direct correspondence with the target dispersions across different gaps and valleys. Interestingly, we find that the edge states at different valleys in the $\pi$ gap can hybridize and form bowtie-shaped edge bands fully detached from the bulk. This phase, not only presents a favorable regime with narrower bulk bands, but also exhibits distinct edge dynamics where the majority of particles bounce back-and-forth confined to a boundary while a small portion can follow a chiral transport around the sample.</description>

      <title>Theory for dissipative time crystals in coupled parametric oscillators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.13652v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discrete time crystals are novel phases of matter that break the discrete time translational symmetry of a periodically driven system. In this work, we propose a classical system of weakly-nonlinear parametrically-driven coupled oscillators as a testbed to understand these phases. Such a system of parametric oscillators can be used to model period-doubling instabilities of Josephson junction arrays as well as semiconductor lasers. To show that this instability leads to a discrete time crystal we first show that a certain limit of the system is close to Langevin dynamics in a symmetry breaking potential. We numerically show that this phase exists even in the presence of Ising symmetry breaking using a Glauber dynamics approximation. We then use a field theoretic argument to show that these results are robust to other approximations including the semiclassical limit when applied to dissipative quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Boundary Flat Bands with Topological Spin Textures Protected by Sub-chiral Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.01851v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chiral symmetry plays an indispensable role in topological classifications as well as in the understanding of the origin of bulk or boundary flat bands. The conventional definition of chiral symmetry refers to the existence of a constant unitary matrix anticommuting with the Hamiltonian. As a constant unitary matrix has constant eigenvectors, boundary flat bands enforced by chiral symmetry, which share the same eigenvectors with the chiral symmetry operator, are dictated to carry fixed (pseudo)spin polarizations and be featureless in quantum geometry. In this work, we generalize the chiral symmetry and introduce a concept termed sub-chiral symmetry. Unlike the conventional chiral symmetry operator defined as constant matrix, the sub-chiral symmetry operator depends on partial components of the momentum vector, so as its eigenvectors. We show that topological gapped or gapless systems without chiral symmetry but with sub-chiral symmetry can support boundary flat bands, which exhibit topological spin textures and quantized Berry phases. We expect that such intriguing boundary flat bands could give rise to a variety of exotic physics in the presence of interactions or disorders.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Higher-Order Topology via Polarized Topological Charges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05505v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Higher-order topological phases (HOTPs) host exotic topological states that go beyond the traditional bulk-boundary correspondence. Up to now, there is still a lack of experimentally measurable momentum-space topological characterization for the HOTPs, which is not conducive to revealing the essential properties of these topological states and also restricts their detection in quantum simulation systems. Here, we propose a concept of polarized topological charges to characterize chiral-symmetric HOTPs in momentum space, which further facilitates a feasible experimental scheme to detect the HOTPs in $^{87}$Rb cold atomic system. Remarkably, our characterization theory not only shows that the second-order (third-order) topological phases are determined by a quarter (negative eighth) of the total polarized topological charges, but also reveals that the higher-order topological phase transitions are identified by the creation or annihilation of polarized topological charges. Particularly, these polarized topological charges can be measured by pseudospin structures of the systems. Due to theoretical simplicity and observational intuitiveness, this work shall advance the broad studies of the HOTPs in both theory and experiment.</description>

      <title>Space-time correlations in monitored kinetically constrained discrete-time quantum dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09872v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: State-of-the-art quantum simulators permit local temporal control of interactions and midcircuit readout. These capabilities open the way towards the exploration of intriguing nonequilibrium phenomena. We illustrate this with a kinetically constrained many-body quantum system that has a natural implementation on Rydberg quantum simulators. The evolution proceeds in discrete time and is generated by repeatedly entangling the system with an auxiliary environment that is monitored and reset after each time-step. Despite featuring an uncorrelated infinite-temperature average stationary state, the dynamics displays coexistence of fast and slow space-time regions in stochastic realizations of the system state. The time-record of measurement outcomes on the environment serves as natural probe for such dynamical heterogeneity, which we characterize using tools from large deviation theory. Our work establishes the large deviation framework for discrete-time open quantum many-body systems as a means to characterize complex dynamics and collective phenomena in quantum processors and simulators.</description>
