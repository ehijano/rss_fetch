      <title>Micromagnetic Simulation and Optimization of Spin-Wave Transducers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing demand for higher data volume and faster transmission in modern wireless telecommunication systems has elevated requirements for 5G high-band RF hardware. Spin-Wave technology offers a promising solution, but its adoption is hindered by significant insertion loss stemming from the low efficiency of magnonic transducers. This work introduces a micromagnetic simulation method for directly computing the spin-wave resistance, the real part of spin-wave impedance, which is crucial for optimizing magnonic transducers. By integrating into finite-difference micromagnetic simulations, this approach extends analytical models to arbitrary transducer geometries. We demonstrate its effectiveness through parameter studies on transducer design and waveguide properties, identifying key strategies to enhance the overall transducer efficiency. Our studies show that by varying single parameters of the transducer geometry or the YIG thickness, the spin-wave efficiency, the parameter describing the efficiency of the transfer of electromagnetic energy to the spin wave, can reach values up to 0.75. The developed numerical model allows further fine-tuning of the transducers to achieve even higher efficiencies.</description>

      <title>GPU acceleration of hybrid functional calculations in the SPARC electronic structure code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a GPU-accelerated version of the real-space SPARC electronic structure code for performing hybrid functional calculations in generalized Kohn-Sham density functional theory. In particular, we develop a batch variant of the recently formulated Kronecker product-based linear solver for the simultaneous solution of multiple linear systems. We then develop a modular, math kernel based implementation for hybrid functionals on NVIDIA architectures, where computationally intensive operations are offloaded to the GPUs while the remaining workload is handled by the CPUs. Considering bulk and slab examples, we demonstrate that GPUs enable up to 8x speedup in node-hours and 80x in core-hours compared to CPU-only execution, reducing the time to solution on V100 GPUs to around 300 seconds for a metallic system with over 6,000 electrons, and significantly reducing the computational resources required for a given wall time.</description>

      <title>Vortices and backflow in hydrodynamic heat transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experiments have provided compelling evidence supporting the theoretical predictions of phonon hydrodynamics in fast thermal conductors. Unlike diffusive heat transport, this regime is primarily governed by momentum-conserving phonon collisions. At the mesoscopic scale it is described by viscous heat equations (VHE), that resemble the Navier-Stokes equations (NSE) in the laminar regime. We show how the VHE can be separated and recast as modified biharmonic equations, allowing for an analytical solution of the velocity potential and stream function of the phonon fluid. These two can be merged into a complex potential defining the flow streamlines, and give rise to two distinct temperature contributions, ultimately related to thermal compressibility and vorticity. By examining thermal flow within a 2D graphite strip device, we explore the boundary conditions and transport coefficients needed to observe thermal vortices and negative thermal resistance, or heat backflow from cooler to warmer regions, and propose a straightforward experimental setup to detect these distinctive hallmarks of viscous transport. Finally, the irrotational and incompressible limits of the phonon VHE are analyzed, showing how the latter mirrors the NSE for the electron fluid. This work provides novel analytical tools to design hydrodynamic phonon flow, highlights the connection to electron hydrodynamics, and paves the way to improve heat management in next-generation devices.</description>

      <title>Multiscale simulations of three-dimensional nanotube networks: Enhanced modeling using unit cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a simulation approach for three-dimensional nanotube networks using cubic and tetragonal unit cells to enhance modeling efficiency. A random-walk algorithm was developed to generate these networks, which were analyzed in a Finite Element Method (FEM) simulation to assess their electrical conductivity. The percolation probability as a function of the nanotube filling factor can be derived from these simulation results. It is found that smaller tetragonal unit cells can replicate the behavior of larger networks with significantly reduced computational effort, achieving a 20 times reduction in computational time while receiving similar results. In this work, we focus on carbon-doped titanate nanotubes for hydrogen applications, but the method is adaptable for other nanocomposite applications. The findings provide a universal framework for the investigation of nanotube-based materials.</description>

      <title>A Flow-Based Hybrid Approach for Kinetic Plasma Simulations: Bridging Direct Vlasov and Particle Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel flow-based kinetic approach, inspired by continuous normalizing flows, for plasma simulation that unifies the complementary strengths of direct Vlasov solvers and particle-based methods. By tracking the distribution function along the characteristic curves defined by the Newton--Lorentz equations, our method directly computes f(z(t)) at selected points in phase space without reliance on Monte Carlo sampling.
  We employ a scatter-point integration scheme using smoothing kernels reminiscent of Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH), to calculate field quantities and moments, achieving higher accuracy with far fewer markers compared to Particle-in-Cell (PIC) methods.
  Unlike PIC, our approach supports strategic marker placement and dynamic refinement in regions of interest, thus reducing sampling noise and computational overhead. This capability is particularly advantageous in high-density plasmas, where PIC's particle requirements can be prohibitive. In addition, the method naturally accommodates collisional effects via an augmented phase-space flow description ensuring robust handling of both collisionless and collisional plasmas.
  Our simulations of Landau damping, two-stream instability, and collisional relaxation demonstrate reduced noise, accurate phase-space resolution with significantly fewer markers, and robust energy conservation. Moreover, the independent characteristic curves and local scatter integration are highly amenable to GPU acceleration, enabling efficient large-scale simulations.
  Overall, this flow-based framework offers a powerful, flexible, and computationally efficient alternative to traditional particle methods for kinetic plasma dynamics, with potential applications spanning inertial confinement, Zpinch, and other complex kinetic systems.</description>

      <title>VEGA: Voids idEntification using Genetic Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmic voids, the nearly empty regions nestled between walls and filaments, are recognized for their extensive applications in the field of cosmology and astrophysics. However, a consensus on the definition of voids remains elusive, as various void-finding methods identify different types of voids, each differing in shape and density based on the method that were used. In this paper, we introduce an innovative void identification method that utilizes Genetic Algorithm analysis. VEGA employs the Voronoi tessellation technique and the Convex Hull algorithm to partition the dataset plane into distinct regions and calculate the volume of each region. For the first time, VEGA integrates Genetic Algorithm analysis with the luminosity density contrast function to identify and locate the possible void region candidates. This method utilizes a set of grid points, which enhances the implementation of Voronoi tessellation and enables VEGA to more effectively access the dataset space for the identification of void regions candidates, finding the center and the ultimate structure of voids. Finally, we applied the VEGA and Aikio-M\"ah\"onen (AM) methods to the same test dataset and compared the cosmic voids identified by VEGA with those identified by the AM method. This comparison demonstrated that the VEGA void-finding method yields reliable results and can be effectively applied to various particle distributions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a generalization of the Kelvin-Voigt model in order to include and characterize heterogeneities in viscoelastic semisolid materials. By considering a microrheological approach, we present analytical expressions for the mean square displacement and for the time-dependent diffusion coefficient of probe particles immersed in a viscoelastic material described by this model. Besides validating our theoretical approach through Brownian dynamics simulations, we show how the model can be used to describe experimental data obtained for polyacrylamide and laponite gels.</description>

      <title>Symmetry- and Gradient-enhanced Gaussian Process Regression for the Active Learning of Potential Energy Surfaces in Porous Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The theoretical investigation of gas adsorption, storage, separation, diffusion and related transport processes in porous materials relies on a detailed knowledge of the potential energy surface of molecules in a stationary environment. In this article, a new algorithm is presented, specifically developed for gas transport phenomena, which allows for a highly cost-effective determination of molecular potential energy surfaces. It is based on a symmetry-enhanced version of Gaussian Process Regression with embedded gradient information and employs an active learning strategy to keep the number of single point evaluations as low as possible. The performance of the algorithm is tested for a selection of gas sieving scenarios on porous, N-functionalized graphene and for the intermolecular interaction of CH$_4$ and N$_2$.</description>

      <title>DBSCAN in domains with periodic boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many scientific problems involve data that is embedded in a space with periodic boundary conditions. This can for instance be related to an inherent cyclic or rotational symmetry in the data or a spatially extended periodicity. When analyzing such data, well-tailored methods are needed to obtain efficient approaches that obey the periodic boundary conditions of the problem. In this work, we present a method for applying a clustering algorithm to data embedded in a periodic domain based on the DBSCAN algorithm, a widely used unsupervised machine learning method that identifies clusters in data. The proposed method internally leverages the conventional DBSCAN algorithm for domains with open boundaries, such that it remains compatible with all optimized implementations for neighborhood searches in open domains. In this way, it retains the same optimized runtime complexity of $O(N\log N)$. We demonstrate the workings of the proposed method using synthetic data in one, two and three dimensions and also apply it to a real-world example involving the clustering of bubbles in a turbulent flow. The proposed approach is implemented in a ready-to-use Python package that we make publicly available.</description>

      <title>Universality of the complete-graph Potts model with $0&lt; q \leq 2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Universality is a fundamental concept in modern physics. For the $q$-state Potts model, the critical exponents are merely determined by the order-parameter symmetry $S_q$, spatial dimensionality and interaction range, independent of microscopic details. In a simplest and mean-field treatment--i.e., the Potts model on complete graph (CG), the phase transition is further established to be of percolation universality for the range of $0 &lt; q &lt;2$. By simulating the CG Potts model in the random-cluster representation, we numerically demonstrate such a hyper-universality that the critical exponents are the same for $0&lt; q &lt;2$ and, moreover, the Ising system ($q = 2$) exhibits a variety of critical geometric properties in percolation universality. On the other hand, many other universal properties in the finite-size scaling (FSS) theory, including Binder-like ratios and distribution function of the order parameter, are observed to be $q$-dependent. Our finding provides valuable insights for the study of critical phenomena in finite spatial dimensions, particularly when the FSS theory is utilized.</description>

      <title>Time-splitting methods for the cold-plasma model using Finite Element Exterior Calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we propose a high-order structure-preserving discretization of the cold plasma model which describes the propagation of electromagnetic waves in magnetized plasmas. By utilizing B-Splines Finite Elements Exterior Calculus, we derive a space discretization that preserves the underlying Hamiltonian structure of the model, and we study two stable time-splitting geometrical integrators. We approximate an incoming wave boundary condition in such a way that the resulting schemes are compatible with a time-harmonic / transient decomposition of the solution, which allows us to establish their long-time stability. This approach readily applies to curvilinear and complex domains. We perform a numerical study of these schemes which compares their cost and accuracy against a standard Crank-Nicolson time integrator, and we run realistic simulations where the long-term behaviour is assessed using frequency-domain solutions. Our solvers are implemented in the Python library Psydac which makes them memory-efficient, parallel and essentially three-dimensional.</description>

      <title>Robust purely optical signatures of Floquet-Bloch states in crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strong light-matter interactions enable triggering on-demand novel functionalities in materials. For periodically driven solids, the Floquet-Bloch states have emerged as the natural states to characterize the physical properties of these non-equilibrium systems. However, robust signatures of the Floquet-Bloch states are needed as common experimental conditions, such as pulsed laser excitation and dissipative many-body dynamics can disrupt their formation and survival. Here, we identify a tell-tale signature of Floquet-Bloch states in the linear optical response of laser-dressed solids that remains prominent even in the presence of strong spectral congestion of bulk matter. To do so, we introduce a computationally efficient strategy to finally capture the response properties of realistic laser-dressed solids, and use it to compute the optical absorption of ZnO using a model of full-dimensionality. The computations reveal intense, spectrally isolated, absorption/stimulated emission features at mid-infrared energies present for a wide range of laser-driving conditions that arise due to the hybridization of the Floquet-Bloch states. As such, these spectral features open a purely optical pathway to investigate the birth and survival of Floquet-Bloch states while avoiding the experimental challenges of fully reconstructing the band structure.</description>

      <title>Numerical Approximation of High-Dimensional Gibbs Distributions Using the Functional Hierarchical Tensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The numerical representation of high-dimensional Gibbs distributions is challenging due to the curse of dimensionality manifesting through the intractable normalization constant calculations. This work addresses this challenge by performing a particle-based high-dimensional parametric density estimation subroutine, and the input to the subroutine is Gibbs samples generated by leveraging advanced sampling techniques. Specifically, to generate Gibbs samples, we employ ensemble-based annealed importance sampling, a population-based approach for sampling multimodal distributions. These samples are then processed using functional hierarchical tensor sketching, a tensor-network-based density estimation method for high-dimensional distributions, to obtain the numerical representation of the Gibbs distribution. We successfully apply the proposed approach to complex Ginzburg-Landau models with hundreds of variables. In particular, we show that the approach proposed is successful at addressing the metastability issue under difficult numerical cases.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity of Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping in Clinical Brain Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background: Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) of the brain is an advanced MRI technique for assessing tissue characteristics based on magnetic susceptibility, which varies with the composition of the tissue, such as iron, calcium, and myelin levels. QSM consists of multiple processing steps, with various choices for each step. Despite its increasing application in detecting and monitoring neurodegenerative diseases, the impact of algorithmic choices in QSM's workflow on clinical outcomes has not been thoroughly quantified.
  Objective: This study aimed to evaluate how choices in background field removal (BFR), dipole inversion algorithms, and anatomical referencing impact the sensitivity and reproducibility error of QSM in detecting group-level and longitudinal changes in deep gray matter susceptibility in a clinical setting.
  Methods: We compared 378 different QSM pipelines using a 10-year follow-up dataset of healthy adults. We analyzed the sensitivity of pipelines to detect known aging-related susceptibility changes in the DGM over time.
  Results: We found high variability in the sensitivity of QSM pipelines to detect susceptibility changes. The study highlighted that while most pipelines could detect changes reliably, the choice of BFR algorithm and the referencing strategy substantially influenced the outcome reproducibility error and sensitivity. Notably, pipelines using RESHARP with AMP-PE, HEIDI or LSQR inversion showed the highest overall sensitivity.
  Conclusions: The findings underscore the critical influence of algorithmic choices in QSM processing on the accuracy and reliability of detecting physiological changes in the brain. This has profound implications for clinical research and trials where QSM is used as a biomarker for disease progression, highlighting that careful consideration should be given to pipeline configuration to optimize clinical outcomes.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Shooting Point Monte Carlo Methods for Transition Path Sampling</title>

Abstract: Rare event sampling algorithms are essential for understanding processes that occur infrequently on the molecular scale, yet they are important for the long-time dynamics of complex molecular systems. One of these algorithms, transition path sampling (TPS), has become a standard technique to study such rare processes since no prior knowledge on the transition region is required. Most TPS methods generate new trajectories from old trajectories by selecting a point along the old trajectory, modifying its momentum in some way, and then ``shooting'' a new trajectory by integrating forward and backward in time. In some procedures, the shooting point is selected independently for each trial move, but in others, the shooting point evolves from one path to the next so that successive shooting points are related to each other. To account for this memory effect, we introduce a theoretical framework based on an extended ensemble that includes both paths and shooting indices. We derive appropriate acceptance rules for various path sampling algorithms in this extended formalism, ensuring the correct sampling of the transition path ensemble. Our framework reveals the need for amended acceptance criteria in the flexible-length aimless shooting and spring shooting methods.</description>

      <title>A non-history dependent temporal superposition algorithm for the finite line source solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16027v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simulations of the operation of fields of borehole heat exchangers involve a wide spectrum of time scales, and hourly simulations for decades are required for the evaluation of the heat transfer in the subsurface due to these systems. Most current models rely on time and space superposition of fundamental analytical solutions of the heat equation to build the solution for complex borehole fields configurations and loading conditions. These procedures are robust and accurate but do not have favorable scaling properties, and the problems can become quickly computationally intractable as the size increases. In this context, acceleration algorithms for temporal superposition are key to overcome this limitation. This paper presents developments on the so-called "non-history dependent" acceleration scheme and its application to the point and line source solutions, which are commonly used as building blocks in borehole field simulations.
  The results obtained show promising properties as the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm is linear in the number of time steps, and near double precision accuracy can be achieved by refining the discretizations used to compute the integrals arising from the scheme.</description>

      <title>Theory and Modeling of Transport for Simple Fluids in Nanoporous Materials: From Microscopic to Coarse-Grained Descriptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03039v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the state-of-the-art theoretical modeling, molecular simulation, and coarse-graining strategies for the transport of gases and liquids in nanoporous materials (pore size 1-100 nm). Special emphasis is placed on the transport of small molecules in zeolites, active carbons, metal-organic frameworks, but also in nanoporous materials with larger pores such as ordered and disordered mesoporous oxides. We present different atomistic and mesoscopic methods as well as the theoretical formalisms. Attention is given to the investigation of different molecular transport coefficients - including the self, collective and transport diffusivities - but also to the determination of free energy barriers and their role in overall adsorption/separation process rates. We also introduce other available approaches such as hierarchical simulations and upscaling strategies. This review focuses on simple fluids in prototypical nanoporous materials. While the phenomena covered here capture the main physical mechanisms in such systems, complex molecules will exhibit additional specific features. For the sake of clarity and brevity, we also omit multicomponent systems (e.g. fluid mixtures, electrolytes, etc.) and electrokinetic effects arising when charged systems are considered (ionic species, charged surfaces, etc.), both of which add to the complexity.</description>

      <title>Bulk-Boundary Correspondence in 2D Photonics: Analysis and Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12498v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The centerpiece of topological photonics is the bulk-boundary correspondence principle (BBCP), which relates discrete invariants of the Bloch bands to the possible presence of interface modes between two periodic heterostructures. In addition to the fundamental significance of BBCP, interface modes per se are of interest in a variety of applications. In Maxwell's electrodynamics, the BBCP has been rigorously proved for 1D problems, but the 2D case is qualitatively different, as the boundary conditions involve nontrivial Dirichlet-to-Neumann maps rather than scalar impedances as in 1D. The theoretical analysis and numerical examples in the paper are consistent with the BBCP. Moreover, the BBCP is closely connected with the positivity of electromagnetic energy density, as has also been shown to be true in 1D cases.</description>

      <title>Energy-Specific Bethe-Salpeter Equation Implementation for Efficient Optical Spectrum Calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24168v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an energy-specific Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) implementation for efficient core and valence optical spectrum calculations. In energy-specific BSE, high-lying excitation energies are obtained by constructing trial vectors and expanding the subspace targeting excitation energies above the predefined energy threshold in the Davidson algorithm. To calculate optical spectra over a wide energy range, energy-specific BSE can be applied to multiple consecutive small energy windows, where trial vectors for each subsequent energy window are made orthogonal to the subspace of preceding windows to accelerate the convergence of the Davidson algorithm. For seven small molecules, energy-specific BSE combined with $G_0W_0$ provides small errors around 0.8 eV for absolute and relative $K$-edge excitation energies when starting from a hybrid PBEh solution with 45% exact exchange. We further showcase the computational efficiency of this approach by simulating the N $1s$ $K$-edge excitation spectrum of the porphine molecule and the valence optical spectrum of silicon nanoclusters involving 6,000 excited states using $G_0W_0$-BSE. This work expands the applicability of the $GW$-BSE formalism for investigating high-energy excited states of large systems.</description>

      <title>On the Estimation of Centre of Mass in Periodic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14578v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Calculation of the centre of mass of a group of particles in a periodically-repeating cell is an important aspect of chemical and physical simulation. One popular approach calculates the centre of mass via the projection of the individual particles' coordinates onto a circle [Bai \&amp; Breen, \emph{J. Graph. Tools}, \textbf{13}(4), 53, (2008)]. This approach, which is mathematically equivalent to finding the first moment of the Fourier series of the mass density, suffers from some numerical error. Here, we discuss this inaccuracy and propose an extension that overcomes it, enabling improved accuracy across computational simulation.</description>
