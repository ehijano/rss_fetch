      <title>Effects of a Vanishing Noise on Elementary Cellular Automata Phase-Space Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate elementary cellular automata (ECA) from the point of view of (discrete) dynamical systems. By studying small lattice sizes, we obtain the complete phase space of all minimal ECA, and, starting from a maximal entropy distribution (all configurations equiprobable), we show how the dynamics affects this distribution. We then investigate how a vanishing noise alters this phase space, connecting attractors and modifying the asymptotic probability distribution. What is interesting is that this modification not always goes in the sense of decreasing the entropy.</description>

      <title>Likelihood-based inference, identifiability and prediction using count data from lattice-based random walk models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In vitro cell biology experiments are routinely used to characterize cell migration properties under various experimental conditions. These experiments can be interpreted using lattice-based random walk models to provide insight into underlying biological mechanisms, and continuum limit partial differential equation (PDE) descriptions of the stochastic models can be used to efficiently explore model properties instead of relying on repeated stochastic simulations. Working with efficient PDE models is of high interest for parameter estimation algorithms that typically require a large number of forward model simulations. Quantitative data from cell biology experiments usually involves non-negative cell counts in different regions of the experimental images, and it is not obvious how to relate finite, noisy count data to the solutions of continuous PDE models that correspond to noise-free density profiles. In this work we illustrate how to develop and implement likelihood-based methods for parameter estimation, parameter identifiability and model prediction for lattice-based models describing collective migration with an arbitrary number of interacting subpopulations. We implement a standard additive Gaussian measurement error model as well as a new physically-motivated multinomial measurement error model that relates noisy count data with the solution of continuous PDE models. Both measurement error models lead to similar outcomes for parameter estimation and parameter identifiability, whereas the standard additive Gaussian measurement error model leads to non-physical prediction outcomes. In contrast, the new multinomial measurement error model involves a lower computational overhead for parameter estimation and identifiability analysis, as well as leading to physically meaningful model predictions.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary dynamics of any multiplayer game on regular graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11686v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multiplayer games on graphs are at the heart of theoretical descriptions of key evolutionary processes that govern vital social and natural systems. However, a comprehensive theoretical framework for solving multiplayer games with an arbitrary number of strategies on graphs is still missing. Here, we solve this by drawing an analogy with the Balls-and-Boxes problem, based on which we show that the local configuration of multiplayer games on graphs is equivalent to distributing $k$ identical co-players among $n$ distinct strategies. We use this to derive the replicator equation for any $n$-strategy multiplayer game under weak selection, which can be solved in polynomial time. As an example, we revisit the second-order free-riding problem, where costly punishment cannot truly resolve social dilemmas in a well-mixed population. Yet, in structured populations, we derive an accurate threshold for the punishment strength, beyond which punishment can either lead to the extinction of defection or transform the system into a rock-paper-scissors-like cycle. The analytical solution also qualitatively agrees with the phase diagrams that were previously obtained for non-marginal selection strengths. Our framework thus allows an exploration of any multi-strategy multiplayer game on regular graphs.</description>
