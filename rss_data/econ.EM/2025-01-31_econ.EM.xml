      <title>Universal Inference for Incomplete Discrete Choice Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A growing number of empirical models exhibit set-valued predictions. This paper develops a tractable inference method with finite-sample validity for such models. The proposed procedure uses a robust version of the universal inference framework by Wasserman et al. (2020) and avoids using moment selection tuning parameters, resampling, or simulations. The method is designed for constructing confidence intervals for counterfactual objects and other functionals of the underlying parameter. It can be used in applications that involve model incompleteness, discrete and continuous covariates, and parameters containing nuisance components.</description>

      <title>IV Estimation of Heterogeneous Spatial Dynamic Panel Models with Interactive Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a Mean Group Instrumental Variables (MGIV) estimator for spatial dynamic panel data models with interactive effects, under large N and T asymptotics. Unlike existing approaches that typically impose slope-parameter homogeneity, MGIV accommodates cross-sectional heterogeneity in slope coefficients. The proposed estimator is linear, making it computationally efficient and robust. Furthermore, it avoids the incidental parameters problem, enabling asymptotically valid inferences without requiring bias correction. The Monte Carlo experiments indicate strong finite-sample performance of the MGIV estimator across various sample sizes and parameter configurations. The practical utility of the estimator is illustrated through an application to regional economic growth in Europe. By explicitly incorporating heterogeneity, our approach provides fresh insights into the determinants of regional growth, underscoring the critical roles of spatial and temporal dependencies.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric Cointegrating Regression Functions with Endogeneity and Semi-Long Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.00972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.00972v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article develops nonparametric cointegrating regression models with endogeneity and semi-long memory. We assume that semi-long memory is produced in the regressor process by tempering of random shock coefficients. The fundamental properties of long memory processes are thus retained in the regressor process. Nonparametric nonlinear cointegrating regressions with serially dependent errors and endogenous regressors driven by long memory innovations have been considered in Wang and Phillips (2016). That work also implemented a statistical specification test for testing whether the regression function follows a parametric form. The limit theory of test statistic involves the local time of fractional Brownian motion. The present paper modifies the test statistic to be suitable for the semi-long memory case. With this modification, the limit theory for the test involves the local time of the standard Brownian motion and is free of the unknown parameter d. Through simulation studies, we investigate the properties of nonparametric regression function estimation as well as test statistic. We also demonstrate the use of test statistic through actual data sets.</description>

      <title>Dynamic treatment effects: high-dimensional inference under model misspecification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.06818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.06818v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimating dynamic treatment effects is crucial across various disciplines, providing insights into the time-dependent causal impact of interventions. However, this estimation poses challenges due to time-varying confounding, leading to potentially biased estimates. Furthermore, accurately specifying the growing number of treatment assignments and outcome models with multiple exposures appears increasingly challenging to accomplish. Double robustness, which permits model misspecification, holds great value in addressing these challenges. This paper introduces a novel "sequential model doubly robust" estimator. We develop novel moment-targeting estimates to account for confounding effects and establish that root-$N$ inference can be achieved as long as at least one nuisance model is correctly specified at each exposure time, despite the presence of high-dimensional covariates. Although the nuisance estimates themselves do not achieve root-$N$ rates, the carefully designed loss functions in our framework ensure final root-$N$ inference for the causal parameter of interest. Unlike off-the-shelf high-dimensional methods, which fail to deliver robust inference under model misspecification even within the doubly robust framework, our newly developed loss functions address this limitation effectively.</description>

      <title>Interference Among First-Price Pacing Equilibria: A Bias and Variance Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07322v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Online A/B testing is widely used in the internet industry to inform decisions on new feature roll-outs. For online marketplaces (such as advertising markets), standard approaches to A/B testing may lead to biased results when buyers operate under a budget constraint, as budget consumption in one arm of the experiment impacts performance of the other arm. To counteract this interference, one can use a budget-split design where the budget constraint operates on a per-arm basis and each arm receives an equal fraction of the budget, leading to ``budget-controlled A/B testing.'' Despite clear advantages of budget-controlled A/B testing, performance degrades when budget are split too small, limiting the overall throughput of such systems. In this paper, we propose a parallel budget-controlled A/B testing design where we use market segmentation to identify submarkets in the larger market, and we run parallel experiments on each submarket.
  Our contributions are as follows: First, we introduce and demonstrate the effectiveness of the parallel budget-controlled A/B test design with submarkets in a large online marketplace environment. Second, we formally define market interference in first-price auction markets using the first price pacing equilibrium (FPPE) framework. Third, we propose a debiased surrogate that eliminates the first-order bias of FPPE, drawing upon the principles of sensitivity analysis in mathematical programs. Fourth, we derive a plug-in estimator for the surrogate and establish its asymptotic normality. Fifth, we provide an estimation procedure for submarket parallel budget-controlled A/B tests. Finally, we present numerical examples on semi-synthetic data, confirming that the debiasing technique achieves the desired coverage properties.</description>
