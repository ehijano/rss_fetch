      <title>A New Approach to Compiling Exoatmospheric Target Lists And Quantifying the Ground-Based Resources Needed to Vet Them</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transiting exoplanet atmospheric characterization is currently in a golden age as dozens of exoplanet atmospheres are being studied by NASA's Hubble and James Webb Space Telescopes. This trend is expected to continue with NASA's Pandora Smallsat and Roman Space Telescope and ESA's Ariel mission (all expected to launch within this decade) and NASA's Habitable Worlds Observatory (expected to launch in the early 2040s) all of which are centered around studying the atmospheres of exoplanets. Here we explore a new approach to constructing large scale exoatmospheric survey lists, which combines the use of traditional transmission/emission spectroscopy figures of merit with a focus on more-evenly sampling planets across a range of radii and equilibrium temperatures. After assembling a sample target list comprised of 750 transmission spectroscopy targets and 150 emission spectroscopy targets, we quantify the potential time lost to stale transit and eclipse ephemerides and find that hundreds of hours of space-based observing could be wasted given current uncertainties in orbital periods, transit epochs, and orbital eccentricities. We further estimate the amount of ground-based telescope time necessary to obtain sufficiently precise exoplanet masses and find that it exceeds 100 nights of 10m telescope time. Based upon these findings, we provide a list of recommendations that would make community efforts for preparation and interpretation of atmospheric characterization endeavors more effective and efficient. The strategies we recommend here can be used to support both current (e.g., HST and JWST) and future exoplanet atmosphere characterization missions (e.g., Pandora, Ariel, Roman, and the Habitable Worlds Observatory).</description>

      <title>Worlds Next Door: A Candidate Giant Planet Imaged in the Habitable Zone of $\alpha$ Cen A. II. Binary Star Modeling, Planet and Exozodi Search, and Sensitivity Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: JWST observed our closest solar twin, $\alpha$ Cen A, with the MIRI coronagraph in F1550C (15.5 $\mu$m) at three distinct epochs between August 2024 and April 2025. For the first time with JWST, we demonstrate the application of reference star differential imaging to simultaneously subtract the coronagraphic image of a primary star and the point spread function (PSF) of its binary companion to conduct a deep search for exoplanets and dust emission. We achieve a typical 5$\sigma$ point source contrast sensitivity between $\sim$$10^{-5}$-$10^{-4}$ at separations $\gtrsim$ 1" and an exozodiacal disk (coplanar with $\alpha$ Cen AB) sensitivity of $\sim$5-8$\times$ the Solar System's zodiacal cloud around $\alpha$ Cen A. The latter is an extraordinary limit, representing the deepest sensitivity to exozodiacal disks achieved for any stellar system to date. Post-processing with the PCA-KLIP algorithm reveals a point source, called $S1$, in August 2024, detected at S/N $=$ 4-6 (3.3-4.3$\sigma$), a separation of $\approx$1.5" (2 au), and with a F1550C flux (contrast) of $\approx$3.5 mJy ($\approx 5.5 \times 10^{-5}$). Various tests conducted with the data show that $S1$ is unlikely to be a detector or PSF subtraction artifact and confirm that it is neither a background nor a foreground object. $S1$ is not re-detected in the two follow-up observations (February and April 2025). If $S1$ is astrophysical in nature, the only explanation is that it has moved to a region of poor sensitivity due to orbital motion. We perform PSF injection-recovery tests and provide 2D sensitivity maps for each epoch to enable orbital completeness calculations. Additional observations are necessary to re-detect candidate $S1$ and confirm its nature as a planet orbiting our nearest solar-type neighbor.</description>

      <title>Worlds Next Door: A Candidate Giant Planet Imaged in the Habitable Zone of $\alpha$ Cen A. I. Observations, Orbital and Physical Properties, and Exozodi Upper Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on coronagraphic observations of the nearest solar-type star, $\alpha$ Cen A, using the MIRI instrument on the James Webb Space Telescope. With three epochs of observation (August 2024, February 2025, and April 2025), we achieve a sensitivity sufficient to detect $T_{\rm eff}\approx$ 225-250 K (1-1.2 $R_{\rm Jup}$) planets between 1"-2" and exozodiacal dust emission at the level of $&gt;$5-8$\times$ the brightness of our own zodiacal cloud. The lack of exozodiacal dust emission sets an unprecedented limit of a few times the brightness of our own zodiacal cloud$-$a factor of $\gtrsim$10 more sensitive than measured toward any other stellar system to date. In August 2024, we detected a F$_\nu$(15.5 $\mu$m) = 3.5 mJy point source, called $S1$, at a separation of 1.5" from $\alpha$ Cen A. Because the August 2024 epoch had only one successful observation at a single roll angle, it is not possible to unambiguously confirm $S1$ as a bona fide planet. Our analysis confirms that $S1$ is neither a background nor a foreground object. $S1$ is not recovered in the February and April 2025 epochs. However, if $S1$ is the counterpart of the object, $C1$, seen by the VLT/NEAR program in 2019, we find that there is a 52% chance that the $S1+C1$ candidate was missed in both follow-up JWST/MIRI observations due to orbital motion. Incorporating constraints from the non-detections, we obtain families of dynamically stable orbits for $S1+C1$ with periods between 2-3 years. These suggest that the planet candidate is on an eccentric ($e \approx 0.4$) orbit significantly inclined with respect to $\alpha$ Cen AB orbital plane ($i_{\rm mutual} \approx 50^\circ$, or $\approx 130^\circ$). Based on the photometry and orbital properties, the planet candidate could have a temperature of 225 K, a radius of $\approx$1-1.1 $R_{\rm Jup}$ and a mass between 90-150 $M_{\rm Earth}$, consistent with RV limits.</description>

      <title>On the meaning of the dynamo radius in giant planets with stable layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current structure models of Jupiter and Saturn suggest that helium becomes immiscible in hydrogen in the outer part of the planets' electrically conducting regions. This likely leads to a layer in which overturning convection is inhibited due to a stabilizing compositional gradient. The presence of such a stably stratified layer impacts the location and mechanism of convectively-driven dynamo action. Juno's measurements of Jupiter's magnetic field enabled an estimate of its dynamo radius based on the magnetic Lowes spectrum. A depth of ~0.8R_J is obtained, where 1R_J is Jupiter's radius. This is rather deep, considering that the electrical conductivity inside Jupiter is expected to reach significant values at ~0.9R_J. Here we use 3-dimensional numerical dynamo simulations to explore the effects of the existence and location of a stably stratified helium rain layer on both the inferred Lowes radius and location of the radial extent of dynamo action. We focus on a Jupiter-like internal structure and electrical conductivity profile. We find that for shallower stable layers, there is no magnetic field generation occurring above the stable layer and the effective dynamo radius and the inferred Lowes radius is at the base of the layer. For deeper stable layers, Lowes radii of ~0.87R_J are inferred as a shallow secondary dynamo operates above the stable layer. Our results strongly suggest the existence of a stable layer extending from ~0.8R_J up to at least ~0.9R_J inside Jupiter. The physical origin of this extended stable layer and its connection to helium rain remain to be elucidated.</description>

      <title>Multi dust species inner rim in magnetized protoplanetary disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inner regions of protoplanetary disks, within ten astronomical units, are where terrestrial planets are born. By developing a new class of multi-dust radiative magnetized inner rim models, we can gain valuable insights into the conditions during planet formation. Our goal is twofold: to study the influence of highly refractory dust species on the inner rim shape and to determine how the magnetic field affects the inner disk structure. The resulting temperature and density structures are analyzed and compared to observations. The comparison focuses on a median SED of Herbig stars and interferometric constraints from the H, K, and N-band of three Herbig-type star-disk systems: HD 100546, HD 163296, and HD 169142. We investigate 1) the influence of a large-scale magnetic field on the inner disk structure and 2) the effect of having the four most important dust species (corundum, iron, forsterite, and enstatite) shaping the rim. We use frequency-dependent irradiation and the effect of accretion heating. With the Optool package, we obtain frequency-dependent opacities for each dust grain family and calculate the corresponding temperature-dependent Planck and Rosseland opacities. Our models with multiple dust species show a smoother and radially more extended inner rim. Strongly magnetized disks show a substantial increase in the emission flux between the L and N-bands. Weakly magnetized disk models with large-scale vertical magnetic fields &lt; 0.3 Gauss at 1 au best fit with NIR interferometric observations. Our model comparison supports the existence of moderate magnetic fields ($\beta$ &gt; $10^4$), which could still drive a magnetic wind in the inner disk. Our results show that multi-dust models, including magnetic fields, still lack NIR emission, especially in the H-band. One potential solution might be a heated gas disk or evaporating objects like planetesimals close to the star.</description>

      <title>Contact binary asteroid (153201) 2000 WO107: rotation, shape model, and density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We combine different methods to investigate the rotation, determine the shape and estimate the density of near-Earth asteroid (153201) 2000 WO$_{107}$. We carried out photometric observations of the asteroid during the 2020 apparition. Then we created a program able to simulate the lightcurves, and used it within a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm to reconstruct the asteroid shape model from the observational data. The Goldstone radar observations of the asteroid were used as an additional constraint on the asteroid model in the MCMC algorithm. The estimated shape and rotation rate of the contact binary were used to compute its density.
  The photometric observations of (153201) 2000 WO$_{107}$ obtained at a wide range of the phase angles from 5 to 68 degrees in the time interval November 28 -- December 8, 2020, show lightcurves typical for contact binary asteroids, which agrees with the results of the radar data. The lightcurves have a maximum amplitude of up to 1.24 mag. The best-fit modelled shape of the asteroid is composed of two ellipsoidal lobes with the axes $0.68\times 0.38 \times 0.36$ km and $0.44 \times 0.42 \times 0.16$ km. Its sidereal rotation period is determined to be $5.017\pm 0.002$ hr. The most probable solution for the angular velocity vector of the asteroid points at the ecliptic coordinates $\lambda=96^\circ \pm 8^\circ$ and $\beta=-78^\circ \pm 1^\circ$, whereas another less probable solution around $\lambda=286^\circ \pm 11 ^\circ$, $\beta=-76^\circ \pm 2 ^\circ$ cannot be disregarded. The estimated density of the asteroid $\rho=4.80^{+0.34}_{-0.63}$ g/cm$^3$ is consistent with its possible metallic composition. From the orbital simulation of this potentially hazardous asteroid, we find that its integral probability of colliding with the Earth in the next 10,000 years is $7\cdot 10^{-5}.$</description>

      <title>A Search for Transiting Exocomets in TESS Sectors 1-26</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a search for single photometric exocomet transits using a magnitude-limited sample of stars observed by the TESS primary mission. These events are asymmetric, with a sharp ingress and more gradual egress expected because the comet tail trails behind the coma. Our goals are to estimate the occurrence rate of exocomet transits, and given sufficient numbers comment on whether the host stars are biased towards being A/F spectral types, as suggested by a previous survey with Kepler data. We recovered the previously identified exocomet transit with TESS around $\beta$ Pic (TIC 270577175) and identified three additional main sequence systems with exocomet-like transits (TIC 280832588, TIC 73149665, and TIC 143152957). We also identified one exocomet candidate around a giant star (TIC 229790952) and one around a probable supergiant (TIC 110969638). We find a total occurrence rate of $2.64\times10^{-4}$ star$^{-1}$ year$^{-1}$, much higher than Kepler's rate of $6.7 \times 10^{-6}$ star$^{-1}$ year$^{-1}$. Some of this difference may be because our rate includes a correction for detection efficiency, where the Kepler search did not. However, with only a handful of detections in each survey, the rates are also very uncertain. In contrast to the Kepler search, we find two candidate hosts that may be G types, but the spectral types would be better supported with spectroscopic follow-up. Primarily, we conclude that exocomet-like transits are very rare at 0.1%-1% transit depth levels, and that higher precision photometry to detect and characterise shallower transits effectively is the most likely path to more detections and stronger statistical conclusions.</description>

      <title>Water Detection in the Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the first detection of water activity in the third confirmed interstellar object, 3I/ATLAS, based on ultraviolet imaging with the \emph{Neil Gehrels-Swift Observatory}. Observations acquired with the Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope on 2025 July 31st - Aug 1st revealed OH (A$^2\Sigma$ -- X$^2\Pi$) emission near 3085~\AA. The water production rate results highly depend on the reddening assumption. For a reddening of 38.6\% between 5437.8~\AA\ and 3325.7~\AA, the water production rate is $(1.35 \pm 0.27) \times 10^{27} $ molecules\,s$^{-1}$ (40~kg\,s$^{-1}$) at a heliocentric distance of 3.51~au. This places 3I/ATLAS among the few comets with confirmed OH emission beyond 3~au, where water ice sublimation is typically inefficient. The inferred production rate is consistent with an active area of at least 19~km$^2$, assuming equilibrium sublimation. Based on current upper limits of the nucleus' radius, this requires that over 20\% of the surface is active, which is larger than activity levels observed in most solar system comets. Contemporaneous near-infrared spectroscopy indicates the presence of large icy grains in the coma, which may serve as an extended source of water vapor. The detection of OH emission prior to any CN detection is unusual and may reflect differences in grain-driven outgassing or volatile inventory compared to typical comets. While similar behavior has been observed in solar system comets, the mechanisms controlling distant activity and the storage and release of volatiles remain poorly understood. If 3I/ATLAS' coma continues to be dominated by H$_2$O, supporting the early and low-metallicity formation hypothesis, the derived large size of the nucleus could be indicative of a key knowledge gap in low-metallicity system planetesimal formation and loss mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Time-dependent response of protoplanetary disk temperature to an FU Ori-type luminosity outburst</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. The most prominent cases of young star variability are accretion outbursts in FU Ori-type systems. The high power of such outbursts causes dramatic changes in the physical and chemical structure of a surrounding protoplanetary disk. As characteristic thermal timescales in the disk are comparable to the duration of the outburst, the response of its thermal structure is inherently time dependent.
  Aims. We analyzed how the disk thermal structure evolves under the substantial-yet transient-eating of the outburst. To cover different possible physical mechanisms driving the outburst, we examined two scenarios: one in which the increased accretion rate is confined to a compact sub-au inner region and the other where it affects the entire disk.
  Methods. To model the disk temperature response to the outburst we performed time-dependent radiation transfer using the HURAKAN code. The disk structure and the luminosity profile roughly correspond to those of the FU Ori system itself, which went into outburst about 90 years ago and reached a luminosity of 450 L_Sun.
  Results. We find that optically thick disk regions require several years to become fully heated during the outburst and a decade to cool after it. The upper layers and outer parts of the disk, which are optically thin to thermal radiation, are heated and cooled almost instantaneously. This creates an unusual radial temperature profile during the early heating phase with minima at several au both for the fully active and compact active disk scenarios. At the cooling phase, upper layers being colder than the midplane for both scenarios. Near- and mid-infrared SEDs demonstrate a significant and almost instantaneous rise by 1 - 2 orders of magnitude during the outburst, while the millimeter flux shows a change of only a factor of a few, and is slightly delayed with respect to the central region luminosity profile.</description>

      <title>A transition from H$_2$O to C$_2$H$_2$ dominated spectra with decreasing stellar luminosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The chemical composition of the inner regions of disks around young stars will determine the properties of planets forming there. Many disk physical processes drive the chemical evolution, some of which depend on/correlate with the stellar properties. We aim to explore the connection between stellar properties and inner disk chemistry, using mid-infrared spectroscopy. We use JWST-MIRI observations of a large, diverse sample of sources to explore trends between C$_2$H$_2$ and H$_2$O. Additionally, we calculate the average spectrum for the T Tauri ($M_{*}$$&gt;$0.2 $M_{\odot}$) and very low-mass star (VLMS, $M_{*}$$\leq$0.2 $M_{\odot}$) samples and use slab models to determine the properties. We find a significant anti-correlation between the flux ratio of C$_2$H$_2$/H$_2$O and the stellar luminosity. Disks around VLMS have significantly higher $F_{\rm{C_2H_2}}$/$F_{\rm{H_2O}}$ flux ratios than their higher-mass counterparts. We also explore trends with the strength of the 10 $\mu$m silicate feature, stellar accretion rate, and disk dust mass, all of which show correlations with the flux ratio, which may be related to processes driving the carbon-enrichment in disks around VLMS, but also have degeneracies with system properties. Slab model fits to the average spectra show that the VLMS H$_2$O emission is quite similar in temperature and column density to a warm ($\sim$600 K) H$_2$O component in the T Tauri spectrum, indicating that the high C/O gas phase ratio in these disks is not due to oxygen depletion alone. Instead, the presence of many hydrocarbons, including some with high column densities, points to carbon enhancement in the disks around VLMS. The observed differences in the inner disk chemistry as a function of host properties are likely to be accounted for by differences in the disk temperatures, stellar radiation field, and the evolution of dust grains.</description>

      <title>Meridional circulation molecular-weighted</title>

Abstract: Meridional circulation in stratified stellar/planetary interiors in the presence of stable molecular weight gradients remains poorly understood, thereby affecting angular momentum transport in evolutionary models. We extend the downward control principle of atmospheric sciences to include compositional stratification. Using a linearized analysis we show that stable compositional gradients slow down the penetration of circulation into the depths, emphasizing the importance of time-dependent solutions. However, additional effects such as horizontal turbulence or magnetic fields are needed to halt it completely. We also find limits demarcating linear and nonlinear regimes in terms of Schmidt and Rossby numbers. Nonlinear simulations exhibit compositional mixing due to meridional currents, enabling deeper penetration than otherwise. We propose slowly evolving and steady-state for the solar tachocline, and helioseismically observed heavy element abundances, acknowledging the absence of constraints on the radial variation of the Schmidt number. In the context of stellar evolution, differential rotation profiles of solar-type main-sequence stars may follow analytical solutions extending from Banik &amp; Menou (2024), thereby aiding further probes into magneto/hydrodynamic instabilities and outward angular momentum transport.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Search for Main-Sequence Dipper Stars Using the Zwicky Transient Facility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Main-sequence dipper stars, characterized by irregular and often aperiodic luminosity dimming events, offer a unique opportunity to explore the variability of circumstellar material and its potential links to planet formation, debris disks, and broadly star-planet interactions. The advent of all-sky time-domain surveys has enabled the rapid discovery of these unique systems. We present the results of a large systematic search for main-sequence dipper stars, conducted across a sample of 63 million FGK main-sequence stars using data from Gaia eDR3 and the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) survey. Using a novel light curve scoring algorithm and a scalable workflow tailored for analyzing millions of light curves, we have identified 81 new dipper star candidates. Our sample reveals a diverse phenomenology of light curve dimming shapes, such as skewed and symmetric dimmings with timescales spanning days to years, some of which closely resemble exaggerated versions of KIC 8462852. Our sample reveals no clear periodicity patterns sensitive to ZTF in many of these dippers and no infrared excess or irregular variability. Using archival data collated for this study, we thoroughly investigate several classification scenarios and hypothesize that the mechanisms of such dimming events are either driven by circumstellar clumps or occultations by stellar/sub-stellar companions with disks. Our study marks a significant step forward in understanding main-sequence dipper stars.</description>

      <title>Shepherding Miorita and its flock: A group of near-Earth asteroids driven by apsidal and von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai secular resonances. A source of low-perihelion asteroids</title>

Abstract: Context. Secular resonances can control the dynamical evolution of near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) and, in some cases, lead to increased orbital stability. Asteroid 622577 Miorita (2014 LU14 ) was the first NEA found by the Isaac Newton Telescope (INT) and exhibits unusual dynamical traits although it approaches Venus, Earth, and Mars at relatively close range.
  Aims. Here, we investigate the orbital context of Miorita and search for possible dynamical analogs within the NEA population.
  Methods. We studied the orbital evolution of Miorita using direct N-body calculations. We used the NEOMOD 3 orbital distribution model to verify our conclusions. Observational data were obtained with INT's Wide Field Camera.
  Results. Miorita is subjected to a von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai secular resonance, but it is also in a near apsidal resonance, both controlled by Jupiter. We identified a group of dynamical analogs of Miorita that includes 387668 (2002 SZ), 2004 US1 , 299582 (2006 GQ2), and 2018 AC4. Miorita-like orbits can evolve into metastable, low-perihelion trajectories driven by apsidal and von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai secular resonances like those of 504181 (2006 TC) and 482798 (2013 QK48). Objects in such paths may end up drawn into the Sun.
  Conclusions. Concurrent secular resonances tend to stabilize the orbits of these asteroids as they are protected against collision with Earth and other inner planets by the resonances. This group signals the existence of an active dynamical pathway capable of inserting NEAs in comet-like orbits. NEOMOD 3 gives a low probability for the existence of NEAs like Miorita, 504181 or 482798.</description>
