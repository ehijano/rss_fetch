      <title>Efficient Band Structure Calculation for Transitional-Metal Dichalcogenides Using the Semiempirical Pseudopotential Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Semiempirical Pseudopotential Method (SEPM) has emerged as a valuable tool for accurately determining band structures, especially in the realm of low-dimensional materials. SEPM operates by utilizing atomic pseudopotentials, which are derived from DFT calculations. SEPM calculations offer a unique advantage compared to DFT as they eliminate the requirement for iterative self-consistent solutions in solving the Schr\"odinger equation, leading to a substantial reduction in computational complexity. The incorporation of both non-local and local Semiempirical Pseudopotentials in our current approach yields band structures and wavefunctions with enhanced precision compared to traditional empirical methods. When applied to monolayer TMDCs, adjusting the parameters to align with pertinent values obtained from DFT computations enables us to faithfully replicate the band structure, opening avenues for investigating the optoelectronic properties of TMDCs and exploring their potential applications in nanodevices.</description>

      <title>Wave functions in the Critical Phase: a Planar \textit{Sierpi\'{n}ski} Fractal Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electronic states play a crucial role in many quantum systems of moire superlattices, quasicrystals, and fractals. As recently reported in \textit{Sierpi\'{n}ski} lattices [Phys. Rev. B 107, 115424 (2023)], the critical states are revealed by the energy level-correlation spectra, which are caused by the interplay between aperiodicity and determined self-similarity characters. In the case of the \textit{Sierpi\'{n}ski Carpet}, our results further demonstrate that there is some degree of spatial overlap between these electronic states. These states could be strongly affected by its `seed lattice' of the $generator$, and slightly modulated by the dilation pattern and the geometrical self-similarity level. These electronic states are multifractal by scaling the $q$-order inverse participation ratio or fractal dimension, which correlates with the subdiffusion behavior. In the $gene$ pattern, the averaged state-based multifractal dimension of second-order would increase as its \textit{Hausdoff dimension} increases. Our findings could potentially contribute to understanding quantum transports and single-particle quantum dynamics in fractals.</description>

      <title>Free Electron Theory for Thin Metal Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum free electrons, i.e. plane waves, with wavevector k, and occupancy constrained by the Pauli exclusion principle, are explained in all introductory texts about solids. A free-electron description works surprisingly well for many properties of "simple" metals. It is assumed that the interior of the metal is essentially infinite, and surfaces are presumed irrelevant. Over the past 30 years, experiments that visualize surfaces have revolutionized solid state physics, stimulating new theory and applications. Therefore, a basic question is, how can the free electron picture be applied to properties of solids where surfaces play a prominent role? Various versions of an extended free-electron theory are used, but not always explained pedagogically. This paper focusses on idealized metallic films. Three versions (an oversimplified one and two stages of improvement) of a free-electron description of metal films are given. These versions are illustrated in detail for the specific example of a slab of aluminum with six layers of atoms.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Floquet dynamics in absorption spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A theory of the absorption of a laser field by an atomic or condensed matter medium is presented for the case where the medium is also interacting with a strong electromagnetic field. The rotating wave approximation is not assumed for the latter. It is shown that in the weak probe limit the Lindblad master equation reduces to a smaller system of linear equations for the relevant steady state coherences. In this limit, the complex susceptibility of the medium can be expressed in terms of individual contributions of decaying dressed states, the latter being eigenstates of a non-Hermitian Floquet Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Terahertz Emission From Diamond Nitrogen-Vacancy Centers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coherent light sources emitting in the terahertz range are highly sought after for fundamental research and applications. THz lasers rely on achieving population inversion. We demonstrate the generation of THz radiation using nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in a diamond single crystal. Population inversion is achieved through the Zeeman splitting of the $S=1$ state in $15\ \text{T}$, resulting in a splitting of $0.42\ \text{THz}$, where the middle $S_z=0$ sublevel is selectively pumped by visible light. To detect the THz radiation, we utilize a phase-sensitive THz setup, optimized for electron spin resonance measurements (ESR). We determine the spin-lattice relaxation time up to $15\ \text{T}$ using the light-induced ESR measurement, which shows the dominance of phonon-mediated relaxation and the high efficacy of the population inversion. The THz radiation is tunable by the magnetic field, thus these findings may lead to the next generation of tunable coherent THz sources.</description>
