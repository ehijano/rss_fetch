      <title>Sharp isoanisotropic estimates for fundamental frequencies of membranes and connections with shapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The underlying motivation of the present work lies on one of the cornerstone problems in spectral optimization that consists of determining sharp lower and upper uniform estimates for fundamental frequencies of a set of uniformly elliptic operators on a given membrane. Our approach allows to give a complete solution of the problem for the general class of anisotropic operators in divergence form generated by arbitrary norms on R^2, including the computation of optimal constants and the characterization of all anisotropic extremizers. Such achievements demand that isoanisotropic type problems be addressed within the broader environment of nonnegative, convex and 1-homogeneous anisotropies and involve a deep and fine analysis of least energy levels associated to anisotropies with maximum degeneracy. As a central outcome we find out a key close relation between shapes and fundamental frequencies for rather degenerate elliptic operators. Our findings also permit to establish that the supremum of anisotropic fundamental frequencies over all fixed-area membranes is infinite for any nonzero anisotropy. This particularly proves the well-known maximization conjecture for fundamental frequencies of the p-laplacian for any p other than 2. Our new sharp lower estimate is just the planar isoanisotropic counterpart of the Faber-Krahn isoperimetric inequality and for the associated optimal constant we provide optimal geometric controls through isodiametric and isoperimetric shape optimization.</description>

      <title>A system of continuity equations with nonlocal interactions of Morse type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a system of two continuity equations with nonlocal velocity fields using interaction potentials of both attractive and repulsive Morse type. Such a system is of interest in many contexts in multi-population modelling. We prove existence, uniqueness and stability in the 2-Wasserstein spaces of probability measures via Jordan-Kinderlehrer-Otto scheme and gradient flow solutions in the spirit of the Ambrosio-Gigli-Savar\'e theory. We then formulate a deterministic particle scheme for this model and prove that gradient flow solutions are obtained in the many particle limit by discrete densities constructed out of moving particles satisfying a suitable system of ODEs. The ODE system is formulated in a non standard way in order to bypass the Lipschitz singularity of the kernel, with difference quotients of the kernel replacing its derivative.</description>

      <title>Higher order nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation in domains with moving boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The initial-boundary value problem in a bounded domain with moving boundaries and nonhomogeneous boundary conditions for a higher order nonlinear Schr\"odinger (HNLS) equation is considered. Existence and uniqueness of global weak solutions are proved as well as the stability of the solution. Additionally, a conservative numerical method of finite differences is introduced that also verifies stability properties with respect to the $L^2$-norm, and along with proving its convergence, some interesting numerical examples are shown that illustrate the behavior of the solution.</description>

      <title>The global dynamics for the Maxwell-Dirac system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the (1+3) dimensional massive Maxwell-Dirac system in the context of global existence and asymptotic behavior of solutions under the Lorenz gauge condition, as well as the modified and linear scattering phenomena for the Dirac spinor and the electromagnetic potential, respectively. We employ a vector fields energy method combined with a detailed analysis of the space-time resonance argument. This approach allows us to establish decay estimates and energy bounds crucial for proving the main theorems. Especially, we provide the explicit phase correction arising from the strong nonlinear resonances.</description>

      <title>Bifurcation structure of steady-states for a cooperative model with population flux by attractive transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the steady-states to a diffusive Lotka-Volterra cooperative model with population flux by attractive transition. The first result gives many bifurcation points on the branch of the positive constant solution under the weak cooperative condition. The second result shows each steady-state approaches a solution of the scalar field equation as the coefficients of the flux tend to infinity. Indeed, the numerical simulation using pde2path exhibits the global bifurcation branch of the cooperative model with large population flux is near that of the scalar field equation.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic extended Burgers model, its relaxation tensor and properties of the associated Boltzmann viscoelastic system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a new method for constructing the anisotropic relaxation tensor and proving its exponential decay property for the extended Burgers model (abbreviated by EBM). The EBM is an important viscoelasticity model in rheology, and used in Earth and planetary sciences. Upon having this tensor, the EBM can be converted to a Boltzmann-type viscoelastic system of equations (abbreviated by BVS). Historically, the relaxation tensor for the EBM is derived by solving the constitutive equation using the Laplace transform. (We refer to this approach by the L-method.) Since inverting the inverse Laplace transform needs a partial fractions expansion, the L-method needs to assume that the EBM elasticity tensors satisfy a commutivity condition. The new method not only avoids this condition but also enables obtaining several important properties of the relaxation tensor, including its positivity, smoothness with respect to the time variable, its exponential decay property together with its derivative, and its causality. Furthermore, we show that the BVS converted from the EBM has the exponential decay property. That is, any solution for its initial boundary value problem with homogeneous boundary data and source decays exponentially as time tends to infinity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to study existence results for a singular problem involving the $p$-biharmonic operator and the Hardy potential. More precisely, by combining monotonicity arguments with the variational method, the existence of solutions is established. By using the Nehari manifold method, the multiplicity of solutions is proved. An example is also given, to illustrate the importance of these results.</description>

      <title>The isoperimetric inequality for the capillary energy outside convex cylinders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the isoperimetric problem for capillary surfaces with a general contact angle $\theta \in (0, \pi)$, outside convex infinite cylinders with arbitrary two-dimensional convex section. We prove that the capillary energy of any surface supported on any such convex cylinder is strictly larger than that of a spherical cap with the same volume and the same contact angle on a flat support, unless the surface is itself a spherical cap resting on a facet of the cylinder. In this class of convex sets, our result extends for the first time the well-known Choe-Ghomi-Ritor\'e relative isoperimetric inequality, corresponding to the case $\theta = \pi/2$, to general angles.</description>

Abstract: We consider a class of parabolic nonlocal $1$-Laplacian equation \begin{align*} u_t+(-\Delta)^s_1u=f \quad \text{ in }\Omega\times(0,T]. \end{align*} By employing the Rothe time-discretization method, we establish the existence and uniqueness of weak solutions to the equation above. In particular, different from the previous results on the local case, we infer that the weak solution maintains $\frac{1}{2}$-H\"{o}lder continuity in time.</description>

      <title>Multiple solutions for a class of nonhomogeneous elliptic systems with Dirichlet boundary or Neumann boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we mainly establish the existence of at least three non-trivial solutions for a class of nonhomogeneous quasilinear elliptic systems with Dirichlet boundary value or Neumann boundary value in a bounded domain $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^N $ and $N\geq 1$. We exploit the method which is based on [6]. This method let us obtain the concrete open interval about the parameter $\lambda$. Since the quasilinear term depends on $u$ and $\nabla u$, it is necessary for our proofs to use the theory of monotone operators and the skill of adding one dimension to space.</description>

      <title>On decay and asymptotic properties of solutions to the Intermediate Long Wave equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider solutions to the initial value problem associated to the intermediate long wave (ILW) equation. We establish persistence properties of the solution flow in weighted Sobolev spaces, and show that they are sharp. We also deal with the long time dynamics of large solutions to the ILW equation. Using virial techniques, we describe regions of space where the energy of the solution must decay to zero along sequences of times. Moreover, in the case of exterior regions, we prove complete decay for any sequence of times. The remaining regions not treated here are essentially the strong dispersion and soliton regions.</description>

Abstract: Our main goal is to investigate supercritical Hardy-Sobolev type inequalities with a logarithmic term and their corresponding variational problem. We prove the existence of extremal functions for the associated variational problem, despite the loss of compactness. As an application, we show the existence of weak solution to a general class of related elliptic partial differential equations with a logarithmic term.</description>

Abstract: We prove the local Lipschitz regularity of the local minimizers of scalar integral functionals of the form \begin{equation*} \mathcal{F}(v;\Omega)= \int_{\Omega} f (x, Dv) dx \end{equation*} under $(p,q)$-growth conditions. The main novelty is that, beside a suitable regularity assumption on the partial map $x\mapsto f(x,\xi)$, we do not assume any special structure for the energy density as a function of the $\xi$-variable.</description>

      <title>Existence of solution of a triangular degenerate reaction-diffusion system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we study a chemical reaction-diffusion system with $m$ unknown concentration. The non-linearity in our study comes from a particular chemical reaction where one unit of a particular species generated from other $m-1$ species and disintegrates to generate all those $m-1$ species in the same manner, i.e., triangular in nature. Our objective is to find whether global in time solution exists for this system where one or more species stops diffusing. In particular we are able to show classical global in time solution exists for all the degenerate cases in any dimension except one and this particular case too attain classical global in time solution upto dimension $2$. Although weak global in time solution exists for all the degenerate cases in any dimension. We also analyse global in time existence result for the case of quadratic non-linear rate functions and also analyse a three dimensional case.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic stability of the equilibrium for the free boundary problem of a compressible atmospheric primitive model with physical vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper concerns the large time asymptotic behavior of solutions to the free boundary problem of the compressible primitive equations in atmospheric dynamics with physical vacuum. Up to second order of the perturbations of an equilibrium, we have introduced a model of the compressible primitive equations with a specific viscosity and shown that the physical vacuum free boundary problem for this model system has a global-in-time solution converging to an equilibrium exponentially, provided that the initial data is a small perturbation of the equilibrium. More precisely, we introduce a new coordinate system by choosing the enthalpy (the square of sound speed) as the vertical coordinate, and thanks to the hydrostatic balance, the degenerate density at the free boundary admits a representation with separation of variables in the new coordinates. Such a property allows us to establish horizontal derivative estimates without involving the singular vertical derivative of the density profile, which plays a key role in our analysis.</description>

Abstract: We consider the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation on the $d$-dimensional torus $\mathbb T^d$, with the nonlinearity of polynomial type $|u|^{2\sigma}u$. For any $\sigma \in \mathbb N$ and $s&gt;\frac d2$ we prove that adding to this equation a suitable stochastic forcing term there exists a unique global solution for any initial data in $H^s(\mathbb T^d)$. The effect of the noise is to prevent blow-up in finite time, differently from the deterministic setting. Moreover we prove existence of invariant measures and their uniqueness under more restrictive assumptions on the noise term.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2010.15104v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main goal of this manuscript is to prove the existence of insensitizing controls for the fourth-order dispersive nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with cubic nonlinearity. To obtain the main result we prove a null controllability property for a coupled fourth-order Schr\"odinger cascade type system with zero-order coupling which is equivalent to the insensitizing control problem. Precisely, employing a new Carleman estimate, we first obtain a null controllability result for the linearized system around zero, and then the null controllability for the nonlinear case is extended using an inverse mapping theorem.</description>

      <title>Blowup of cylindrically symmetric solutions for biharmonic NLS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.08167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.08167v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider blowup of solutions to the Cauchy problem for the following biharmonic NLS, $$ \textnormal{i} \, \partial_t u=\Delta^2 u-\mu \Delta u-|u|^{2 \sigma} u \quad \text{in} \,\, \R \times \R^d, $$ where $d \geq 1$, $\mu \in \R$ and $0&lt;\sigma&lt;\infty$ if $1 \leq d \leq 4$ and $0&lt;\sigma&lt;4/(d-4)$ if $d \geq 5$. In the mass critical and supercritical cases, we establish the existence of blowup solutions to the problem for cylindrically symmetric data. The result extends the known ones with respect to blowup of solutions to the problem for radially symmetric data.</description>

      <title>Elastic membranes spanning deformable boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.13614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.13614v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a variational analysis of an elastic membrane spanning a closed curve which may sustain bending and torsion. First, we deal with parametrized curves and linear elastic membranes proving the existence of equilibria and finding first-order necessary conditions for minimizers computing the first variation. Second, we study a more general case, both for the boundary curve and for the membrane, using the framed curve approach. The infinite dimensional version of the Lagrange multipliers' method is applied to get the first-order necessary conditions. Finally, a numerical approach is presented and employed in several numerical test cases.</description>

      <title>Effects of surface tension and elasticity on critical points of the Kirchhoff-Plateau problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.06269v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a modified Kirchhoff-Plateau problem adding an energy term to penalize shape modifications of the cross-sections appended to the elastic midline. In a specific setting, we characterize quantitatively some properties of minimizers. Indeed, choosing three different geometrical shapes for the cross-section, we derive Euler-Lagrange equations for a planar version of the Kirchhoff-Plateau problem. We show that in the physical range of the parameters, there exists a unique critical point satisfying the imposed constraints. Finally, we analyze the effects of the surface tension on the shape of the cross-sections at the equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Continuity of a spatial gradient of a weak solution to a very singular parabolic equation involving the one-Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.06868v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider weak solutions to very singular parabolic equations involving a one-Laplace-type operator, which is singular and degenerate, and a $p$-Laplace-type operator with $\frac{2n}{n+2}&lt;p&lt;\infty$, where $n\ge 2$ denotes the space dimension. This type of equation is used to describe the motion of a Bingham flow. It has been a long-standing open problem of whether a spatial gradient of a weak solution is continuous in space and time. This paper aims to give an affirmative answer for a wide class of such equations. This equation becomes no longer uniformly parabolic near a facet, the place where a spatial gradient vanishes. To achieve our goal, we show local a priori H\"{o}lder continuity of gradients suitably truncated near facets. For this purpose, we consider a parabolic approximate problem and appeal to standard methods, including De Giorgi's truncation and comparisons with Dirichlet heat flows. Our method is a parabolic adjustment of our method developed to prove the corresponding statements for stationary problems.</description>

      <title>Weak and Strong Solutions to Nonlinear SPDEs with Unbounded Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10076v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce an extended variational framework for nonlinear SPDEs with unbounded noise, defining three different solution types of increasing strength along with criteria to establish their existence. The three notions can be understood as probabilistically and analytically weak, probabilistically strong and analytically weak, as well as probabilistically and analytically strong. Our framework facilitates several well-posedness results for the Navier-Stokes Equation with transport noise, equipped with the no-slip and Navier boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Gradient continuity for the parabolic $(1,\,p)$-Laplace equation under the subcritical case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04951v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the gradient continuity for the parabolic $(1,\,p)$-Laplace equation. In the supercritical case $\frac{2n}{n+2}&lt;p&lt;\infty$, where $n\ge 2$ denotes the space dimension, this gradient regularity result has been proved recently by the author. In this paper, we would like to prove that the same regularity holds even for the subcritical case $1&lt;p\le \frac{2n}{n+2}$ with $n\ge 3$, on the condition that a weak solution admits the $L^{s}$-integrability with $s&gt;n(2-p)/p$. The gradient continuity is proved, similarly to the supercritical case, once the local gradient bounds of solutions are verified. Hence, this paper mainly aims to show the local boundedness of a solution and its gradient by Moser's iteration. The proof is completed by considering a parabolic approximate problem, and showing a priori gradient estimates of a bounded weak solution to the relaxed equation.</description>

      <title>Fine Structure of Singularities in Area-Minimizing Currents Mod$(q)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15889v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study fine structural properties related to the interior regularity of $m$-dimensional area minimizing currents mod$(q)$ in arbitrary codimension. We show: (i) the set of points where at least one tangent cone is translation invariant along $m-1$ directions is locally a connected $C^{1,\beta}$ submanifold, and moreover such points have unique tangent cones; (ii) the remaining part of the singular set is countably $(m-2)$-rectifiable, with a unique flat tangent cone (with multiplicity) at $\mathcal{H}^{m-2}$-a.e. flat singular point. These results are consequences of fine excess decay theorems as well as almost monotonicity of a universal frequency function.</description>

      <title>Sharp fractional Sobolev and related inequalities on H-type groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16278v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We determine the sharp constants for the fractional Sobolev inequalities associated with the conformally invariant fractional powers $\mathcal{L}_{s}(0&lt;s&lt;1)$ of the sublaplacian on H-type groups. From these inequalities we derive a sharp log-Sobolev inequality by considering a limiting case and a sharp Sobolev trace inequality. The later extends to this context the result of Frank, Gonz\'alez, Monticelli and Tan (Adv. Math, 2015).</description>

      <title>From incommensurate bilayer heterostructures to Allen-Cahn: An exact thermodynamic limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.18186v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a complete and rigorous derivation of the mechanical energy for twisted 2D bilayer heterostructures without any approximation beyond the existence of an empirical many-body site energy. Our results apply to both the continuous and discontinuous continuum limit. Approximating the intralayer Cauchy-Born energy by linear elasticity theory and assuming an interlayer coupling via pair potentials, our model reduces to a modified Allen-Cahn functional. We rigorously control the error, and, in the case of sufficiently smooth lattice displacements, provide a rate of convergence for twist angles satisfying a Diophantine condition.</description>

      <title>Learning Regions of Attraction in Unknown Dynamical Systems via Zubov-Koopman Lifting: Regularities and Convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15119v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The estimation for the region of attraction (ROA) of an asymptotically stable equilibrium point is crucial in the analysis of nonlinear systems. There has been a recent surge of interest in estimating the solution to Zubov's equation, whose non-trivial sub-level sets form the exact ROA. In this paper, we propose a lifting approach to map observable data into an infinite-dimensional function space, which generates a flow governed by the proposed `Zubov-Koopman' operators. By learning a Zubov-Koopman operator over a fixed time interval, we can indirectly approximate the solution to Zubov's equation through iterative application of the learned operator on certain functions. We also demonstrate that a transformation of such an approximator can be readily utilized as a near-maximal Lyapunov function. We approach our goal through a comprehensive investigation of the regularities of Zubov-Koopman operators and their associated quantities. Based on these findings, we present an algorithm for learning Zubov-Koopman operators that exhibit strong convergence to the true operator. We show that this approach reduces the amount of required data and can yield desirable estimation results, as demonstrated through numerical examples.</description>
