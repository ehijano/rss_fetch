      <title>From entropic constraints to reinforced processes: a probabilistic origin of multiscale measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate multiscale Gibbs measures from a variational and probabilistic viewpoint, focusing on the structural asymmetry among conditional entropies that characterizes their construction. We show how this asymmetry emerges both from variational principles with entropic constraints and from stochastic processes with reinforcement. We thus introduce the reinforced multinomial process and prove a large-deviation principle for its empirical histogram. The associated rate function reproduces precisely the entropy imbalance defining multiscale measures, thereby providing a genuine probabilistic mechanism for their emergence. The reinforced multinomial process thus offers a simple and rigorous stochastic foundation for multiscale Gibbs structures.</description>

      <title>Lorentz Invariance of the Multidimensional Dirac-Hestenes Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the Lorentz invariance of the multidimensional Dirac-Hestenes equation, that is, whether the equation remains form-invariant under pseudo-orthogonal transformations of the coordinates. We examine two distinct approaches: the tensor formulation and the spinor formulation. We first present a detailed examination of the four-dimensional Dirac-Hestenes equation, comparing both transformation approaches. These results are subsequently generalized to the multidimensional case with (1,n) signature. The tensor approach requires explicit invariants, while the spinor formulation naturally maintains Lorentz covariance through spin group action.</description>

      <title>A Phase Space Representation of the Metaplectic Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The symplectic group Sp(n) acts on phase space while the unitary representation of its double cover, Mp(n), the metaplectic group, acts on functions defined on configuration space. We will construct an extension Mp(n) of Mp(n) acting on square integrable functions on phase space. This is performed using previous results of ours involving explicit expressions of the twisted Weyl symbols of metaplectic operators and Bopp pseudodifferential operators, which are phase space extensions of the usual Weyl operators.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness Theorem: With Normal Components Specified on External Spherical Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A uniqueness theorem for time-harmonic electromagnetic fields which requires the normal components of electromagnetic fields specified on a spherical surface is proposed and proved. The statement of the theorem is : "For a spherical volume $V$ that contains only perfect conductors and homogeneous lossless materials and for which the impressed currents $\mathbf{J}$ are specified, a time-harmonic solution to the Maxwell's equations within the volume, having outgoing waves alone, is uniquely specified by the values of the radial components of both $\mathbf{E}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ over the exterior spherical surface $V$ and the tangential components of either $\mathbf{E}$ or $\mathbf{B}$ on the interior surfaces." The proof of this theorem relies on the uniqueness of multipole expansion of electromagnetic fields outside the enclosing sphere. The conventional uniqueness theorem for the volume $V$ having loss-less materials is considered to be the case of lossy materials in the limit the dissipation approaching zero.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Modes in Spherical Cavities: Complete Theory of Angular Spectra, Dispersion Relations, and Self-Adjoint Extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a complete theory of electromagnetic modes in spherical cavities, resolving fundamental questions about the nature of angular quantization. The standard result that angular indices $(\ell,m)$ must be integers is shown to be a consequence of domain constraints -- regularity at both poles and single-valuedness in the azimuthal coordinate -- rather than a requirement imposed by Maxwell's equations themselves. We prove that, for the sectoral case $\nu=m$, the function $\sin^{m}\theta$ exactly solves the angular eigenvalue equation for any real $m&gt;0$, giving rise to a continuous dispersion curve. We demonstrate why non-sectoral modes (tesseral and zonal) appear only at isolated integer points on the full sphere, and show how boundary modifications such as cones and wedges convert these isolated points into continuous families of modes. Complete field solutions, wave impedances, and energy integrability conditions are derived. At the limiting point $(\nu, m) = (0, 0)$, the electromagnetic field vanishes identically while the underlying Debye potential remains non-trivial -- a distinction with implications for mode counting that connects to longstanding questions in gauge theory and cavity quantization. Full-wave simulations validate the theoretical predictions with sub-percent accuracy. These results raise the possibility of structural analogues in wave equations on curved spacetimes, where conical deficits or horizon excisions similarly modify the angular domain.</description>

      <title>Localization of the 1D Non-Stationary Anderson Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers the family of Schr\"odinger operators on $\ell^2(\mathbb{Z})$ given by independent but not necessarily identically distributed and possibly unbounded potentials. We assume a finite exponential moment and allow the choice of distributions to come from any compact set away from deterministic distributions. With these assumptions we prove spectral localization with exponentially decaying eigenfunctions as well as dynamical localization. One of the main tools is a Furstenberg-type theorem for non-stationary matrix products.</description>

      <title>Group Contractions via Infinite-Dimensional Lie Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contractions are a procedure to construct a new Lie algebra out of a given one via a singular limit. Specifically, the \.In\"on\"u--Wigner construction starts with a Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ with Lie subalgebra $\mathfrak{h} \subseteq \mathfrak{g}$ and complement $\mathfrak{n}$. Then, the vectors in $\mathfrak{h}$ are rescaled by a formal parameter $\varepsilon \in \mathbb{R}_+$, which effectively turns the Lie bracket $[ \, \cdot \, , \cdot \, ]$ into a formal power series. Notably, the limit $\varepsilon \to 0$ trivialises certain relations, such that the complement $\mathfrak{n}$ becomes an abelian ideal. In the present article, we are not only interested in the limiting Lie algebras and groups, but also in the corresponding series expansions in $\varepsilon$ to understand the limiting behaviour. Particularly, we are interested in how to integrate the `power-series-expanded' Lie algebras to the Lie group level. To this end, we reformulate the above procedure using infinite-dimensional Lie algebras of analytic germs. Then, we apply their integration theory to obtain an extensive analysis of this expansion procedure. In particular, we obtain an explicit construction of the resulting Lie algebras and groups.</description>

      <title>Geometry-dependent Ekman layer approximations on curved domains: L^{\infty} convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Ekman boundary layer is a fundamental concept in fluid dynamics that describes fluid motion near boundaries affected by Earth's rotation. Most theoretical studies have simplified their analysis by assuming a planar boundary surface, resulting in limited exploration of structures with general smooth boundary conditions. Investigating the impact of boundary geometry in the Ekman boundary layer is essential, as initially suggested by J.L. Lions and further examined in Masmoudi's study [Comm. Pure Appl. Math. 53 (2000), 432-483] under small amplitude periodic boundary conditions. This paper clarifies how boundary geometry influences flow fields and characterizes its effects on near-boundary layer flow. We construct a class of multi-scale approximate solutions based on the boundary's geometric features and establish their convergence in the L^{\infty} framework. Our findings do not require a small-amplitude assumption, only an upper bound on the Gaussian curvature of the boundary surface. Notably, when the boundary is planar, our approach aligns with existing studies. Additionally, in the vanishing-viscosity limit, we derive a limiting-state system dependent on boundary geometric parameters. These contributions extend the theoretical understanding of boundary-layer interactions to general curved geometries and have possible applications in atmospheric, oceanic, and other geophysical flow contexts.</description>

      <title>Higher-Rank Mathieu Opers, Toda Chain, and Analytic Langlands Correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Riemann-Hilbert problem associated to flat sections of oper connections of arbitrary rank on the twice-punctured Riemann sphere with irregular singularities of the mildest type. We construct the solutions in terms of the solutions to a single non-linear integral equation. It follows from this construction that the generating function of the submanifold of opers coincides with the Yang-Yang function of the quantum Toda chain, proving a conjecture by Nekrasov, Rosly and Shatashvili. In this way we may furthermore reformulate the quantization conditions of the Toda chain in terms of the connection problem, for which we also provide a solution. We finally interpret our results as a variant of the Analytic Langlands Correspondence for the real version of the Hitchin system corresponding to the Toda chain.</description>

      <title>The Semiclassical Limit of the 2D Dirac--Hartree Equation with Periodic Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the semiclassical limit of the two-dimensional Dirac--Hartree equation in the presence of a periodic external potential. The spinor dynamics are formulated using the matrix-valued Wigner transform together with spectral projectors onto the positive and negative energy bands. Under suitable assumptions on the initial data and the potentials, we rigorously derive Vlasov-type transport equations describing the evolution of the band-resolved phase-space densities in both the massive and massless regimes. In the massless case, the limiting dynamics propagate ballistically with constant speed, while in the massive case the velocity is relativistic. Our analysis justifies the emergence of relativistic Vlasov equations from Dirac--Hartree dynamics in the semiclassical regime. As a corollary, we recover the relativistic Vlasov--Poisson equation from the Dirac equation with a regularized Coulomb interaction when the regularization vanishes together with the semiclassical parameter.</description>

      <title>Open Quantum Systems as Regular Holonomic $\mathcal{D}$-Modules: The Mixed Hodge Structure of Spectral Singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The geometric description of open quantum systems via the Quantum Geometric Tensor (QGT) traditionally relies on the assumption that the physical states form a differentiable vector bundle over the parameter manifold. This framework becomes ill-posed at spectral singularities, such as Exceptional Points, where the eigen-bundle admits no local trivialization due to dimension reduction. In this work, we resolve this obstruction by demonstrating that the family of Liouvillian superoperators $\mathcal{L}(k)$ over a complex parameter manifold $X$ canonically defines a \textbf{regular holonomic $\mathcal{D}_X$-module} $\mathcal{M}$. By identifying the physical coherence order with the Hodge filtration and the decay rate hierarchy with the \textbf{Kashiwara filtration}, we show that the open quantum system underlies a \textbf{Mixed Hodge Module (MHM)} structure in the sense of Saito.
  This identification allows us to apply the \textbf{Grothendieck six-functor formalism} rigorously to dissipative dynamics. We prove that the divergence corresponds to a non-trivial cohomology class in $\text{Ext}^1_{\mathcal{D}_X}$, thereby regularizing the Quantum Geometric Tensor without ad-hoc cutoffs. Specifically, the ``singular component'' of the Complete QGT arises as the residue of the connection on the \textbf{Brieskorn lattice} associated with the vanishing cycles functor.</description>

      <title>Evolution of finite temperature Bose-Einstein Condensates: Some rigorous studies on condensate growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In trapped Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs), \emph{condensate growth} refers to the process in which an increasing number of quasi-particles are immediately transferred from the non-condensate state (the thermal cloud) into the condensate state following the initial formation of the BEC. Despite its physical significance, this phenomenon has not yet been studied rigorously from a mathematical standpoint.
  In this work, we investigate a kinetic equation whose collision operator includes three types of wave interactions: one corresponding to a 3-wave process, and two classified as 4-wave processes. This wave kinetic equation models the evolution of the density function of the thermal cloud. We establish the immediate formation of condensation in solutions to this equation, thus providing a rigorous demonstration of the condensate growth phenomenon.</description>

Abstract: In this work we study a kinetic equation whose collision operator comprises three distinct wave interaction mechanisms: one representing a 3-wave process, and two corresponding to 4-wave processes. This wave kinetic equation describes the temporal evolution of the density function of the thermal cloud of a finite temperature trapped Bose gas. We establish that, for a broad class of initial data, solutions exhibit an immediate cascade of energy towards arbitrarily large frequencies. Furthermore, for other classes of initial conditions, we demonstrate that the energy is transferred to infinity in finite time.</description>

      <title>Topological cluster synchronization via Dirac spectral programming on directed hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collective synchronization in complex systems arises from the interplay between topology and dynamics, yet how to design and control such patterns in higher-order networks remains unclear. Here we show that a Dirac spectral programming framework enables programmable topological cluster synchronization on directed hypergraphs. By encoding tail-head hyperedges into a topological Dirac operator and introducing a tunable mass term, we obtain a spectrum whose isolated eigenvalues correspond to distinct synchronization clusters defined jointly on nodes and hyperedges. Selecting a target eigenvalue allows the system to self-organize toward the associated cluster state without modifying the underlying hypergraph structure. Simulations on directed-hypergraph block models and empirical systems--including higher-order contact networks and the ABIDE functional brain network--confirm that spectral selection alone determines the accessible synchronization patterns. Our results establish a general and interpretable route for controlling collective dynamics in directed higher-order systems.</description>

      <title>Convolutional-neural-operator-based transfer learning for solving PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Convolutional neural operator is a CNN-based architecture recently proposed to enforce structure-preserving continuous-discrete equivalence and enable the genuine, alias-free learning of solution operators of PDEs. This neural operator was demonstrated to outperform for certain cases some baseline models such as DeepONet, Fourier neural operator, and Galerkin transformer in terms of surrogate accuracy. The convolutional neural operator, however, seems not to be validated for few-shot learning. We extend the model to few-shot learning scenarios by first pre-training a convolutional neural operator using a source dataset and then adjusting the parameters of the trained neural operator using only a small target dataset. We investigate three strategies for adjusting the parameters of a trained neural operator, including fine-tuning, low-rank adaption, and neuron linear transformation, and find that the neuron linear transformation strategy enjoys the highest surrogate accuracy in solving PDEs such as Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, Brusselator diffusion-reaction system, and Navier-Stokes equations.</description>

      <title>Stability of nonlinear Dirac solitons under the action of external potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The instabilities observed in direct numerical simulations of the Gross-Neveu equation under linear and harmonic potentials are studied. The Lakoba algorithm, based on the method of characteristics, is performed to numerically obtain the two spinor components. We identify non-conservation of energy and charge in simulations with instabilities and we find that all studied solitons are numerically stable, except the low-frequency solitons oscillating in the harmonic potential over long periods of time. These instabilities, as in the case of Gross-Neveu equation without potential, can be removed by imposing absorbing boundary conditions. The dynamics of the soliton is in perfect agreement with the prediction obtained using an ansatz with only two collective coordinates, namely the position and momentum of the center of mass. We use the temporal variation of both field energy and momentum to determine the evolution equations satisfied by the collective coordinates. By applying the same methodology, we also demonstrate the spurious character of the reported instabilities in the Alexeeva-Barashenkov-Saxena model under external potentials.</description>

      <title>Geometry of autonomous discrete Painlev\'e equations related to the Weyl group $W(E_8^{(1)})$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discrete Painlev\'e equations are integrable two-dimensional birational maps associated to a family of generalized Halphen surfaces. The latter can be seen either as $\mathbb P^2$ blown up at nine points or as $\mathbb P^1\times\mathbb P^1$ blown up at eight points. These maps become autonomous if the blow-up points are in a special position (support a pencil of cubic curves in $\mathbb P^2$, respectively a pencil of biquadratic curves in $\mathbb P^1\times\mathbb P^1$), so that the generalized Halphen surfaces become rational elliptic surfaces. In the generic case, the symmetry of a discrete Painlev\'e equation is the Weyl group $W(E_8^{(1)})$. One has a system of commuting maps which correspond to translational elements of $W(E_8^{(1)})$ associated to the roots of the lattice $E_8^{(1)}$. In the present note, we give a geometric construction of these commuting maps. For this, we use some novel birational involutions based on the above mentioned pencils of curves.</description>

      <title>Topological edge states in two-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_4$ Potts paramagnet protected by the $\mathbb{Z}_4^{\times 3}$ symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a two-dimensional bosonic symmetry-protected topological (SPT) paramagnet protected by an on-site $G=\mathbb{Z}_4^{\times 3}$ symmetry, starting from a three-component $\mathbb{Z}_4$ Potts paramagnet on a triangular lattice. Within the group-cohomology framework, $H^{3}(G,U(1))\cong \mathbb{Z}_4^{\times 7}$, we focus on a "colorless" cocycle representative obtained by antisymmetrizing the basic $\mathbb{Z}_4$ three-cocycle, and generate the corresponding SPT Hamiltonian via a cocycle-induced nonlocal unitary transformation followed by symmetry averaging. For open geometry, we derive the boundary theory explicitly: one color sector decouples, while the nontrivial edge reduces to an interacting $\mathbb{Z}_4$ chain with next-to-nearest-neighbor constraints that admits a compact dressed-Potts form. Using DMRG we show that the boundary model is gapless, with the lowest gap scaling as $1/L$ and an entanglement-entropy scaling consistent with a conformal field theory of central charge $c=2.191(4)\simeq 11/5$. The rational value $c=11/5$ matches the coset $SU(3)_3/SU(2)_3$, making it a candidate for the continuum description of the $\mathbb{Z}_4^{\times 3}$ edge; we outline spectral and symmetry-resolved diagnostics needed to test this identification at the level of conformal towers beyond the central charge.</description>

      <title>Generalized Birkhoff theorems and 2+2 direct pruduct spacetimes in Weyl conformal gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study 2+2 direct product spacetimes sourced by separated electromagnetic and Yang--Mills fields within Weyl conformal gravity. We prove that all such configurations admit at least 2 independent, commuting non-null Killing vectors, which we use to find general solutions. As a special case, we obtain a generalization of the Birkhoff--Riegert theorem to all spacetimes containing a two-dimensional subspace of constant Gaussian curvature, and we also revisit the original formulation of the theorem. We further analyze the resulting solutions in terms of Weyl equivalence classes. Their connections to known solutions in both Weyl conformal gravity and Einstein gravity are established through conformal relations. We also examine the fundamental physical and geometric properties of the newly obtained configurations and their equivalence classes.</description>

      <title>Derivation of stochastic Burgers on the line with a Dirichlet boundary condition at the origin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the \emph{equilibrium fluctuations} of a Hamiltonian chain of oscillators on \(\mathbb{Z}\) with an exponential potential, perturbed by a conservative, symmetric noise. Under the canonical \emph{diffusive scaling} \(t \mapsto t n^2\) and an interaction strength tuned by \(n^{-1/2}\), the fluctuation field is known to converge to the \emph{energy solution} of the stochastic Burgers equation (SBE) on the torus~\cite{ABGS22}. We introduce a \emph{coupled moving heat bath} of strength \(n^{-\delta}\) acting on the particle system. We prove that for \(\delta \leq 1\) (the \emph{strong-coupling regime}), the equilibrium fluctuation field converges to the \emph{energy solution of the SBE with a Dirichlet boundary condition at zero}. We provide two distinct analytical characterizations of these boundary solutions, corresponding to different spaces of test functions. Conversely, for \(\delta &gt; 1\) (the \emph{weak-coupling regime}), the heat bath becomes irrelevant in the scaling limit: the fluctuations converge to the standard SBE on the full line without any boundary condition, reproducing the full-line result of~\cite{GJ14}. Our analysis thus reveals a sharp \emph{critical scaling} in the coupling strength \(\delta\), which dictates the emergence -- or absence -- of a macroscopic boundary condition from the microscopic perturbation.</description>

      <title>Global Regular Solutions of the Multidimensional Degenerate Compressible Navier-Stokes Equations with Large Initial Data of Spherical Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A fundamental open problem in the theory of the compressible Navier-Stokes equations is whether regular spherically symmetric flows can develop singularities -- such as cavitation or implosion -- in finite time. A formidable challenge lies in how the well-known coordinate singularity at the origin can be overcome to control the lower or upper bound of the density. For the barotropic Navier-Stokes system with constant viscosity coefficients, recent striking results have shown that such implosions do indeed occur. In this paper, we show that the situation is fundamentally different when the viscosity coefficients are degenerately density-dependent (as in the shallow water equations). We prove that, for general large spherically symmetric initial data with bounded positive density, solutions remain globally regular and cannot undergo cavitation or implosion in two and three spatial dimensions. Our results hold for all adiabatic exponents $\gamma\in (1,\infty)$ in two dimensions, and for physical adiabatic exponents $\gamma\in (1, 3)$ in three dimensions, without any restriction on the size of the initial data. To achieve these results, we make carefully designed weighted radial estimates via a region segmentation method, which is the key for obtaining uniform control over both the density and the effective velocity. The methodology developed here should also be useful for solving other related nonlinear partial differential equations involving similar difficulties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work focuses on three-component defocusing Kundu-Eckhaus equation, which serves as a significant coupled model for describing complex wave propagation in nonlinear optical fibers. By employing binary Darboux transformation based on 4x4 matrix spectral problem, we derive vector dark soliton solutions, and meanwhile, the exact expressions of asymptotic dark soliton components are obtained through an asymptotic analysis method. Furthermore, breather and Y-shaped breather solutions, absent from single-component defocusing kundu-Eckhaus systems, are obtained due to the mutual coupling effects between different components. The results significantly advance our understanding nonlinear wave phenomenon induced by coupling effects and provide a theoretical reference for subsequent studies on defocusing multi-component systems.</description>

      <title>Partition function and magnetization of two-dimensional Ising models in non-zero magnetic field: A semi-empirical approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The partition functions of ferromagnetic Ising models of square lattices in a finite magnetic field is deduced using topological considerations within a heuristic graph-theoretical approach. These equations are derived separately for low and high temperature regimes while the exact solution of Onsager is obtained therefrom when the magnetic field is zero. The derived partition function equations here are almost similar to those given by Onsager, thus indicating a straight-forward protocol, even when the magnetic field is present. The spontaneous magnetization derived here using the Helmholtz free energy is identical with that arising from the exact solution. The partition functions lead to the known series expansions of the magnetization and zero-field susceptibility.</description>

      <title>A Hidden Quantum Markov model framework for Entanglement and Topological Order in the AKLT Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a hidden quantum Markov models (HQMMs) framework to the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki (AKLT) state-a cornerstone example of a symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phase. The model's observation system is the physical spin-1 chain, which emerges from a hidden spin-1/2 layer through well-defined quantum emission operation. We show that the underlying Markov dynamics caputure maximal entanglement through the use of significant channels relevant to the AKLT state. We also show that SPT order induces a covariance on the observation decoding channels. This establishes an additional bridge between the quantum Machine learning and many-body physics, with promising implication in topological order and quantum information.</description>

Abstract: Quantum entanglement is an important resource in many modern technologies, like quantum computation or quantum communication and information processing. Therefore, most interest is given to detect and quantify entangled states. Entanglement degree of bipartite mixed quantum states can be quantified using the Schmidt number. Witnesses of the Schmidt numbers are closely related to $k$-positive linear maps, for which there is no general construction. Here, we use the generalized equiangular measurements to define a family of $k$-positive maps and the corresponding Schmidt number witnesses.</description>

The Weiss Tabor Carnevale test gives us coefficient restrictions to perform a time reparametrization to achieve an autonomous integrable model. We also show a Hirota bilinear form along with a simplified example to demonstrate how the shifted symmetries create new symmetry centers, but do not affect the shape of the soliton.</description>

Abstract: The group reduction procedure is applied to vector generalizations of the NLS, mKdV, and KdV equations. The resulting ODE systems admit isomonodromic Lax representations and are multicomponent generalizations of the Painlev\'e equations P$_1$, P$_2$, P$_{34}$, and P$_4$. Some of them can be interpreted as nonautonomous deformations of well-known systems integrable in the Liouville sense, in particular, the Garnier and H\'enon--Heiles systems. In one case, an unexpected connection with the equations of quasiperiodic dressing chain for the Schr\"odinger operator is established.</description>

      <title>Structure-Preserving Optimal Control of Open Quantum Systems via a Discrete Contact PMP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a discrete Pontryagin Maximum Principle (PMP) for controlled open quantum systems governed by Lindblad dynamics, and introduce a second--order \emph{contact Lie--group variational integrator} (contact LGVI) that preserves both the CPTP (completely positive and trace--preserving) structure of the Lindblad flow and the contact geometry underlying the discrete PMP. A type--II discrete contact generating function produces a strict discrete contactomorphism under which the state, costate, and cost propagate in exact agreement with the variational structure of the discrete contact PMP.
  We apply this framework to the optimal control of a dissipative qubit and compare it with a non--geometric explicit RK2 discretization of the Lindblad equation. Although both schemes have the same formal order, the RK2 method accumulates geometric drift (loss of trace, positivity violations, and breakdown of the discrete contact form) that destabilizes PMP shooting iterations, especially under strong dissipation or long horizons. In contrast, the contact LGVI maintains exact CPTP structure and discrete contact geometry step by step, yielding stable, physically consistent, and geometrically faithful optimal control trajectories.</description>

      <title>Optical perspective on the time-dependent Dirac oscillator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Dirac oscillator is a relativistic quantum system, characterized by its linearity in both position and momentum. Moreover, considering $(1{+}1)$ and $(2{+}1)$ dimensions, the system can be mapped onto the Jaynes-Cummings and anti-Jaynes-Cummings models, as illustrated in an exact manner by Bermudez \emph{et al.} [\href{ https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevA.76.041801}{Phys. Rev. A 76, 041801(R)}]. Using the optical counterparts of the Dirac oscillator, we analyze an extension of the model that incorporates a time-dependent frequency. We focus on the consequences of these time modulations on the angular momentum observables and spin-orbit entanglement. Noticeable changes in the \emph{Zitterbewegung} are found. We show that a specific choice of time dependence yields aperiodic evolution of the observables, whereas an alternative choice allows analytical solutions.</description>

Abstract: We show that two-dimensional billiard systems are Turing complete by encoding their dynamics within the framework of Topological Kleene Field Theory. Billiards serve as idealized models of particle motion with elastic reflections and arise naturally as limits of smooth Hamiltonian systems under steep confining potentials. Our results establish the existence of undecidable trajectories in physically natural billiard-type models, including billiard-type models arising in hard-sphere gases and in collision-chain limits of celestial mechanics.</description>

      <title>A critical threshold for the cosmological Euler-Poisson system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the gravitational Euler-Poisson system with a linear equation of state on an expanding cosmological model of the Universe. The expansion of the spatial sections introduces an additional dissipating effect in the Euler equation. We prescribe the expansion rate of space by a scale factor $a(t)=t^\alpha$ with $\alpha\in(0,1)$, which describes the growth of length scales over time. This model is regularly applied in cosmology to study classical fluids in an expanding Universe. We study the behaviour of solutions to this system arising from small, near-homogeneous initial data and discover a \emph{critical} change of behaviour near the expansion rate $\alpha=2/3$, which corresponds to the matter-dominated regime in cosmology. In particular, we prove that for $\alpha&gt;2/3$ the fluid variables are global in time and remain small provided they are sufficiently small in a suitable norm initially. In the complementary regime $\alpha\leq2/3$, we present numerical evidence for shock formation of solutions to the Euler equation for arbitrarily small initial data. In combination, this establishes the existence of a critical stability threshold for barotropic fluids in expanding domains. In contrast to our previous work on the corresponding relativistic system, the threshold in the classical system considered here is independent of the speed of sound of the fluid. This establishes that fluids in cosmology behave fundamentally different in the non-relativistic regime than in the relativistic one.</description>

      <title>New universal vertex algebras as glueings of the basic ones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There are three universal $2$-parameter vertex algebras $\mathcal{W}_{\infty}$, $\mathcal{W}^{\text{ev}}_{\infty}$, and $\mathcal{W}^{\mathfrak{sp}}_{\infty}$ which are freely generated of types $\mathcal{W}(2,3,4,\dots)$, $\mathcal{W}(2,4,6,\dots)$, and $\mathcal{W}(1^3, 2, 3^3, 4,\dots)$, respectively. They serve as classifying objects for vertex algebras with these generating types satisfying mild hypotheses. Their $1$-parameter quotients are expected to be the building blocks of all $\mathcal{W}$-algebras of classical Lie types. Furthermore, such $\mathcal{W}$-algebras are expected to be organized into families that are governed by new universal $2$-parameter vertex algebras, which are themselves glueings of copies of $\mathcal{W}_{\infty}$ in type $A$ (together with a Heisenberg algebra), and copies of $\mathcal{W}^{\text{ev}}_{\infty}$ and $\mathcal{W}^{\mathfrak{sp}}_{\infty}$ in types $B$, $C$, and $D$. We denote these universal objects by $\mathcal{W}^{X,S,M}_{\infty}$, where $X$ denotes the Lie type (either $A$, $C$, or $BD$ since types $B$ and $D$ can be treated uniformly), and $S$, $M$ are sets of positive integers that determine certain families of partitions. More precisely, for a partition $P = (n_0^{m_0}, n_1^{m_1},\dots, n_{t}^{m_t})$ of $N = \sum_{i=0}^t n_i m_i$ consisting of $m_i$ parts of size $n_i$, where $n_0&gt; n_1 &gt; \cdots &gt; n_t \geq 2$, $M = \{m_0,\dots, m_t\}$ is the set of multiplicities, and $S = \{d_1,\dots, d_t\}$ is the set of height differences $d_{i+1} = n_i - n_{i+1}$. After introducing this general conjectural picture, we will construct the first nontrivial example $\mathcal{W}^{\mathfrak{so}_2}_{\infty}:=\mathcal{W}^{BD, \emptyset, \{2\}}_{\infty}$, which is a glueing of two copies of $\mathcal{W}^{\text{ev}}_{\infty}$.</description>

      <title>The large deviation principle for the stochastic 3D primitive equations with transport noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the small-noise large deviation principle for the three-dimensional primitive equations with transport noise and turbulent pressure. Transport noise is important for geophysical fluid dynamics applications, as it takes into account the effect of small scales on the large scale dynamics. The main mathematical challenge is that we allow for the transport noise to act on the full horizontal velocity, therefore leading to a non-trivial turbulent pressure, which requires an involved analysis to obtain the necessary energy bounds. Both Stratonovich and It\^o noise are treated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a coupled atmosphere-ocean model including the mechanical and thermodynamical interaction between the two fluids for the mid-latitudes. The formulation combines a multilayer quasi-geostrophic dynamical framework with temperature equations incorporating long- and short-wave radiative forcing, as in energy balance models. Within a suitable functional framework, we establish the existence and uniqueness of solutions, and their continuous dependence on the radiation parameters. We also prove that the long-time dynamics are described by a finite-dimensional global attractor and, moreover, that the system possesses a finite set of determining modes that governs its asymptotic behaviour. In particular, we show that the long-term evolution of the ocean's temperature can be reconstructed solely from observations of the velocity fields across the model's layers.</description>

      <title>Universal BPS Structure of Scalar Kinks in Static Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a geometric extension of the Bogomolny-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) construction for scalar kinks in (1+1) dimensions embedded in static curved spacetimes. By introducing a nonminimal coupling between the scalar prepotential and the extrinsic curvature of the static foliation, the flat-space first-order Bogomolny equation remains exactly valid for arbitrary static backgrounds. As a consequence, the kink profile is unchanged, while the effective potential and vacuum structure acquire a controlled geometric dependence. We show that these curved-space BPS kinks are always linearly stable. However, the existence of the translational zero mode is not guaranteed: its normalizability depends on the competition between the intrinsic length scale of the kink and the asymptotic curvature scale of the geometry. When the geometric scale dominates, the zero mode is removed and the soliton becomes geometrically pinned, despite remaining an exact BPS solution. Explicit realizations in AdS2 demonstrate how different static slicings of the same spacetime lead to qualitatively distinct physical outcomes, ranging from preserved translational invariance to its complete removal by horizons. These results establish geometry as a precise mechanism for controlling solitonic moduli without compromising linear stability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In planar chiral magnets, the competition of the positive definite Heisenberg exchange and Zeeman energies with the indefinite Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) energy allows for the possibility of negative energy ground states, and leads to an intricate dependence of the ground states on the parameters of the theory. In this paper, we consider arbitrary spiralization tensors for the DMI interaction and arbitrary directions for the external magnetic field, and study the nature of the ground states in this parameter space, using a combination of analytical and numerical methods. Classifying ground states by their symmetry into ferromagnetic (invariant under under arbitrary translations in the plane), spiral (invariant under arbitrary translations in one direction) and skyrmion lattice ground states (invariant under a two dimensional lattice group), we give a complete description of the phase diagram of this class of theories.</description>

      <title>Topological Flux on a Context Manifold Generates Nonreciprocal Collective Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-reciprocal interactions, where the influence of agent $i$ on $j$ differs from that of $j$ on $i$, are fundamental in active and living matter. Yet, most models implement such asymmetry phenomenologically. Here we show that non-reciprocity can emerge from internal topology alone. Agents evolve on an internal ``context manifold'' coupled to a Chern-Simons gauge field. Because the gauge field is first order in time, it relaxes rapidly; eliminating it yields an effective transverse, antisymmetric interaction kernel that generically produces chiral waves, persistent vorticity, and irreversible state transitions. Numerical simulations reveal clear signatures of broken reciprocity: long-lived vortex cores, finite circulation, asymmetric information flow, and a nonzero reciprocity residual. The dynamics further exhibit pronounced hysteresis under parameter sweeps, demonstrating memory effects that cannot occur in reciprocal or potential-driven systems. These results identify Chern-Simons gauge fields as a minimal and universal source of directional influence and robust non-reciprocal collective behavior.</description>

Abstract: We construct a higher lattice gauge theory based on the representation of 2-groups described by a category of crossed modules on a lattice model described by path 2-groupoids. Using these lattice gauge representations, an exactly solvable Hamiltonian for topological phases in 3+1 dimensions is constructed.

      <title>Finite-gap potentials as a semiclassical limit of the thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the semiclassical limit of thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz equations naturally reconstructs the algebro-geometric spectra of finite-gap periodic potentials. This correspondence is illustrated using the traveling-wave (snoidal) solution of the defocusing modified Korteweg--de Vries equation. In this framework, the Bethe-root distribution of the associated quantum field theory yields an Abelian differential of the second kind on the elliptic Riemann surface specified by the spectral endpoints, a structure central to the algebro-geometric theory of solitons. The semiclassical parameter is identified with the large-rank limit of the internal symmetry group ($O(2N)$) of the underlying quantum field theory (the Gross-Neveu model with a chemical potential). Our analysis indicates that the analytic structure of the spectrum is dictated solely by the Dynkin diagram ($D_N$) and its large-rank limit ($D_\infty$), independently of the particular integrable model used to realize it.</description>

      <title>Extremizing Measures of Magic on Pure States by Clifford-stabilizer States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magic states are essential resources enabling universal, fault-tolerant quantum computation within the stabilizer framework. Their non-stabilizerness provides the additional resource required to overcome the constraints of stabilizer codes, as formalized by the Eastin-Knill theorem, while still permitting fault-tolerant distillation. Although numerous measures of magic have been introduced, not every state with nonzero magic has been shown to be distillable by a stabilizer code, and all currently known distillable states arise as special cases of Clifford-stabilizer states, defined as pure states uniquely stabilized by finite subgroups of the Clifford group. In this work, we develop a general framework for group-covariant functionals on the real manifold of Hermitian operators. We formalize the notions of $G$-stabilizer spaces, states, and codes for arbitrary finite subgroups $G \subset \mathrm{U}(\mathcal{H})$, and introduce analytic families of $G$-covariant functionals. Our main theorem shows that any $G$-invariant pure state is an extremal point of a broad class of derived functionals, including symmetric, max-type, and R\'enyi-type functionals, provided the underlying family is $G$-covariant. This extremality holds for variations restricted to directions orthogonal to the stabilized subspace while preserving purity. Specializing to the Pauli and Clifford groups, our framework unifies the extremality structure of several canonical magic measures, including mana, stabilizer R\'enyi entropies, and stabilizer fidelity. In particular, Clifford-stabilizer states extremize these measures. We classify such states for qubits, qutrits, ququints, and two-qubit systems, identifying new candidates for magic distillation protocols. We further propose an inefficient distillation protocol for a two-qubit magic state with stabilizer fidelity exceeding that of standard benchmark states.</description>

      <title>Pivotal Module Categories, Factorization Homology and Modular Invariant Modified Traces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The algebraic notion of a pivotal module category was developed by Schaumann and Shimizu and is central to the description of boundary conditions in conformal field theory according to a proposal by Fuchs and Schweigert. In this paper, we present a large class of examples of pivotal module categories of topological origin: For a unimodular finite ribbon category $\mathcal{A}$, we prove that the factorization homology $\int_\Sigma \mathcal{A}$ of a compact oriented surface $\Sigma$ with $n$ marked boundary intervals, at least one per connected component, comes with the structure of a pivotal module category over $\mathcal{A}^{\boxtimes n}$. This endows the internal skein algebras of Ben-Zvi-Brochier-Jordan, in particular the elliptic double, with a symmetric Frobenius structure. As application, we obtain, for each choice of $\mathcal{A}$, a family of full open conformal field theories, each of which comes with correlation functions for all surfaces with marked boundary intervals that are explicitly computable using factorization homology. As a further application, we explain how modified traces can be 'integrated' over surfaces: We show that the modified trace for $\mathcal{A}$ extends in a canonical way to the factorization homology of $\Sigma$. The resulting traces have the remarkable property of being modular invariant, i.e. fixed by the mapping class group action.</description>

Abstract: We present a formulation of classical statistical mechanics based on a Lagrangian description on the tangent bundle. In this approach, a Wick rotation from real time to imaginary time is employed as a technical device that facilitates the construction of a Hamiltonian structure expressed in velocity variables. The resulting dynamics preserves a natural measure induced by the associated symplectic form on the tangent bundle. This measure-preserving property enables the consistent definition of classical statistical ensembles directly in terms of Lagrangian variables.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we construct explicit formulas for the generators of the Cartan centralisers of complex semisimple Lie algebras $B_n,C_n$ and $D_n$, the case $A_n$ being already known \cite{campoamor2023algebraic}. The precise structures for the cases of rank-three simple Lie algebras ($B_3,C_3$ and $D_3$) are provided, and the inclusion relations between the corresponding polynomial Poisson algebras (finitely generated Poisson algebras over $\mathbb{C}[\mathfrak{h}^*]$) are illustrated. We develop the idea of constructing algebraic superintegrable systems and their integrals from the generators of these polynomial Poisson algebras. In particular, we explicitly present the algebraic superintegrable systems corresponding to the Cartan reduction chains $\mathfrak{h} \subset \mathfrak{so}(6,\mathbb{C})$, $\mathfrak{h} \subset \mathfrak{so}(7,\mathbb{C})$, and $\mathfrak{h} \subset \mathfrak{sp}(6,\mathbb{C})$.</description>

Abstract: The bifurcation of figure-eight choreography is analyzed by its symmetry group based on the variational principle of the action. The irreducible representations determine the symmetry and the dimension of the Lyapunov-Schmidt reduced action, which yields four types of bifurcations in the sequence of the bifurcation cascade. Type 1 bifurcation, represented by trivial representation, bifurcates two solutions. Type 2, by non-trivial one-dimensional representation, bifurcates two congruent solutions. Type 3 and 4, by two-dimensional irreducible representations, bifurcate two sets of three and six congruent solutions, respectively. We analyze numerical bifurcation solutions previously published and four new ones: non-symmetric choreographic solution of type 2, non-planar solution of type 2, $y$-axis symmetric solution of type 3, and non-symmetric solution of type 4.</description>

      <title>Adjoint-based optimization of the Rayleigh-B\'enard instability with melting boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23831v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we propose an adjoint-based optimization procedure to control the onset of the Rayleigh-B\'enard instability with a melting front. A novel cut cell method is used to solve the Navier-Stokes equations in the Boussinesq approximation and the convection-diffusion equation in the fluid layer, as well as the heat equation in the solid phase. To track the interface we use the level set method where its evolution is simply governed by an advection equation. An incomplete continuous adjoint problem is then derived by treating the velocity field obtained from the forward problem as a known variable in the adjoint convection-diffusion equation, thereby avoiding the need to solve a Navier-Stokes adjoint in the fluid phase. To the best of our knowledge, this provides the first adjoint-based optimization framework for Rayleigh-B\'enard instability with a melting boundary. Two optimization problems, together with a comparison against a derivative-free particle-swarm method, demonstrate that the proposed incomplete adjoint yields gradients accurate enough to control the front shape while reducing the number of expensive function evaluations by about an order of magnitude.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17177v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove normal typicality and dynamical typicality for a (centered) random block-band matrix model with block-dependent variances. A key feature of our model is that we achieve intermediate equilibration times, an aspect that has not been proven rigorously in any model before. Our proof builds on recently established concentration estimates for products of resolvents of Wigner type random matrices [arXiv:2403.10359] and an intricate analysis of the deterministic approximation.</description>

      <title>Jacobi-Haantjes manifolds, integrability and dissipative mechanical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11715v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The notion of Jacobi-Haantjes manifold, consisting of a Jacobi manifold endowed with an algebra of extended Haantjes operator fields, is proposed as a natural geometric framework which allows us to define the notion of integrability of both conservative and dissipative Hamiltonian systems, in a unified way. As a reduction, contact-Haantjes manifolds are defined. We prove that the integrability of a contact Hamiltonian system is equivalent to the existence of a suitable Abelian extended Haantjes algebra associated with the system. This result allows us to define a large class of new, completely integrable contact Hamiltonian systems from a given extended Haantjes algebra.
  Moreover, we propose a theory of separation of variables for dissipative systems. This result is achieved by lifting a dissipative system into a higher-dimensional manifold, obtained as the symplectization of the Jacobi-Haantjes structure associated with the system. This new manifold naturally acquires the structure of a symplectic-Haantjes manifold. We prove that the Darboux-Haantjes coordinates which separate the Hamilton-Jacobi equation of the higher-dimensional symplectic-Haantjes manifold are in fact separation variables for the Hamilton equations associated with the original dissipative system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04702v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the previous study (Ishida, 2025), the author proved the uniqueness of short-range potential functions using the Enss-Weder time-dependent method (Enss and Weder, 1995) for a two-body quantum system described by time-decaying harmonic oscillators. In this study, we extend the result of Ishida (2025) to the $N$-body case. We use the approaches developed in Enss and Weder (1995), Weder (1996), and Valencia and Weder (2012) to prove that the high-velocity limit of the scattering operator uniquely determines all the pairwise interaction potentials among the $N$ particles, focusing respectively on each fixed pair of particles.</description>

      <title>Splitting obstructions and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariants in time-reversal symmetric topological insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10444v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Fu-Kane-Mele $\mathbb{Z}_2$ index characterizes two-dimensional time-reversal symmetric topological phases of matter. We shed some light on some features of this index by investigating projection-valued maps endowed with a fermionic time-reversal symmetry.
  Our main contributions are threefold. First, we establish a decomposition theorem, proving that any such projection-valued map admits a splitting into two projection-valued maps that are related to each other via time-reversal symmetry. Second, we provide a complete homotopy classification theorem for these maps, thereby clarifying their topological structure. Third, by means of the previous analysis, we connect the Fu-Kane-Mele index to the Chern number of one of the factors in the previously-mentioned decomposition, which in turn allows to exhibit how the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-valued topological obstruction to constructing a periodic and smooth Bloch frame for the projection-valued map, measured by the Fu-Kane-Mele index, can be concentrated in a single pseudo-periodic Kramers pair.</description>

      <title>Sharp upper tail behavior of line ensembles via the tangent method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.08922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.08922v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a new probabilistic and geometric method to obtain several sharp results pertaining to the upper tail behavior of continuum Gibbs measures on infinite ensembles of random continuous curves, also known as line ensembles, satisfying some natural assumptions. The arguments make crucial use of Brownian resampling invariance properties and correlation inequalities admitted by such Gibbs measures. We obtain sharp one-point upper tail estimates showing that the probability of the value at zero being larger than $\theta$ is $\exp(-\frac{4}{3}\theta^{3/2}(1+o(1)))$. A key intermediate step is developing a precise understanding of the profile when conditioned on the value at zero equaling $\theta$. Our method further allows one to obtain multi-point asymptotics which were out of reach of previous approaches. As an example, we prove sharp explicit two-point upper tail estimates. This framework is then used to establish the corresponding results for the KPZ equation, which are all new. Even for the zero-temperature case of the Airy$_2$ process, our arguments yield new proofs for one-point estimates previously known due to its connections to random matrix theory, as well as new two-point asymptotics. To showcase the reach of the method, we obtain the same results in a purely non-integrable setting under only assumptions of stationarity and extremality in the class of Gibbs measures. Our method bears resemblance to the tangent method introduced by Colomo-Sportiello and mathematically realized by Aggarwal in the context of the six-vertex model.</description>

      <title>Brownian bridge limit of path measures in the upper tail of KPZ models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12009v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For models in the KPZ universality class, such as the zero temperature model of planar last passage-percolation (LPP) and the positive temperature model of directed polymers, its upper tail behavior has been a topic of recent interest, with particular focus on the associated path measures (i.e., geodesics or polymers). For Exponential LPP, diffusive fluctuation had been established in Basu-Ganguly. In the directed landscape, the continuum limit of LPP, the limiting Gaussianity at one point, as well as of related finite-dimensional distributions of the KPZ fixed point, were established, using exact formulas in Liu and Wang-Liu. It was further conjectured in these works that the limit of the corresponding geodesic should be a Brownian bridge. We prove it in both zero and positive temperatures; for the latter, neither the one-point limit nor the scale of fluctuations was previously known. Instead of relying on formulas (which are still missing in the positive temperature literature), our arguments are geometric and probabilistic, using the results on the shape of the weight and free energy profiles under the upper tail from Ganguly-Hegde as a starting point. Another key ingredient involves novel coalescence estimates, developed using the recently discovered shift-invariance Borodin-Gorin-Wheeler in these models. Finally, our proof also yields insight into the structure of the polymer measure under the upper tail conditioning, establishing a quenched localization exponent around a random backbone.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11366v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the large-time behavior of global energy class ($H^1$) solutions of the one-dimensional nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with a general localized potential term and a defocusing nonlinear term. By using a new type of interaction Morawetz estimate localized to an exterior region, we prove that these solutions decompose into a free wave and a weakly localized part which is asymptotically orthogonal to any fixed free wave. We further show that the $L^2$ norm of this weakly localized part is concentrated in the region $|x| \leq t^{1/2+}$, and that the energy ($\dot{H}^1$) norm is concentrated in $|x| \leq t^{1/3+}$. Our results hold for solutions with arbitrarily large initial data.</description>

      <title>A framework for the use of generative modelling in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11630v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss an approach to mathematically modelling systems made of objects that are coupled together, using generative models of the dependence relationships between states (or trajectories) of the things comprising such systems. This broad class includes open or non-equilibrium systems and is especially relevant to self-organising systems. The ensuing variational free energy principle (FEP) has certain advantages over using random dynamical systems explicitly, notably, by being more tractable and offering a parsimonious explanation of why the joint system evolves in the way that it does, based on the properties of the coupling between system components. The FEP is a method whose use allows us to build a model of the dynamics of an object as if it were a process of variational inference, because variational free energy (or surprisal) is a Lyapunov function for its dynamics. In short, we argue that using generative models to represent and track relations amongst subsystems leads us to a particular statistical theory of interacting systems. Conversely, this theory enables us to construct nested models that respect the known relations amongst subsystems. We point out that the fact that a physical object conforms to the FEP does not necessarily imply that this object performs inference in the literal sense; rather, it is a useful explanatory fiction which replaces the `explicit' dynamics of the object with an `implicit' flow on free energy gradients -- a fiction that may or may not be entertained by the object itself.</description>

      <title>Axiomatization of R\'enyi Entropy on Quantum Phase Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15976v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Phase-space versions of quantum mechanics -- from Wigner's original distribution to modern discrete-qudit constructions -- represent some states with negative quasi-probabilities. Conventional Shannon and R\'enyi entropies become complex-valued in this setting and lose their operational meaning. Building on the axiomatic treatments of R\'enyi (1961) and Dar\'oczy (1963), we develop a conservative extension that applies to signed finite phase spaces and identify a single admissible entropy family, which we call signed R\'enyi $\alpha$-entropy (for a free parameter $\alpha \ge 0$). The obvious signed Shannon candidate is ruled out because it violates extensivity. We prove four results that bolster the usefulness of the new measure. (i) It serves as a witness of the presence of cancellation, detecting the coexistence of positive and negative weight in a signed measure. (ii) For $\alpha &gt; 1$, it is Schur-concave, delivering the intuitive property that mixing increases entropy (iii) The same parametric family obeys a quantum H-theorem, namely, that under de-phasing dynamics entropy cannot decrease. (iv) The $2$-entropy is conserved under discrete Moyal-bracket dynamics, mirroring conservation of von Neumann entropy under unitary evolution on Hilbert space. We also comment on interpreting the R\'enyi order parameter as an inverse temperature. Overall, we believe that our investigation provides good evidence that our axiomatically derived signed R\'enyi entropy may be a useful addition to existing entropy measures employed in quantum information, foundations, and thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Graded supermanifolds and homogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00537v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of a homogeneity supermanifold, which is, roughly speaking, a supermanifold equipped with a privileged atlas whose coordinates carry prescribed (real) homogeneity degrees. This structure defines a sheaf of graded algebras on the supermanifold, regarded as an additional geometric structure. The guiding principle of this approach is that grading is ultimately related to homogeneity. Assigning homogeneity degrees to coordinates in a consistent way is equivalent to fixing a global vector field, the weight vector field. This approach is simple and substantially more general than most existing approaches to graded manifolds. In particular, the homogeneity degrees may be arbitrary real numbers, and the resulting category includes compact supermanifolds.
  We systematically study homogeneity submanifolds, homogeneity Lie supergroups, tangent and cotangent lifts of homogeneity structures, homogeneous distributions and codistributions, as well as related notions such as double homogeneity. The main achievements of this framework include proofs of the homogeneous Poincar\'e Lemma, the homogeneous Frobenius Theorem, and the homogeneous symplectic Darboux Theorem, results that are of independent interest even in the purely even case.</description>

      <title>Absence of nontrivial local conserved quantities in the spin-1 bilinear-biquadratic chain and its anisotropic extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04945v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a complete classification of the integrability and nonintegrability of the spin-1 bilinear-biquadratic model with a uniaxial anisotropic field, which includes the Heisenberg model and the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki model. It is rigorously shown that, within this class, the only integrable systems are those that have been solved by the Bethe ansatz method, and that all other systems are nonintegrable, in the sense that they do not have nontrivial local conserved quantities. Here, "nontrivial" excludes quantities like the Hamiltonian or the total magnetization, and "local" refers to sums of operators that act only on sites within a finite distance. This result establishes the nonintegrability of the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki model and, consequently, demonstrates that the quantum many-body scars observed in this model emerge independently of any conservation laws of local quantities. Furthermore, we extend the proof of nonintegrability to more general spin-1 models that encompass anisotropic extensions of the bilinear-biquadratic Hamiltonian and completely classify the integrability of generic Hamiltonians that possess translational symmetry, $U(1)$ symmetry, time-reversal symmetry, and spin-flip symmetry. Our result accomplishes a breakthrough in nonintegrability proofs by expanding their scope to spin-1 systems.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Coupling of Mass and Electromagnetic Fields: Entropic Origin of Parity Asymmetry and the Meissner Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16798v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a thermodynamic framework that couples mass dynamics, described by the Newton- Gibbs-van der Waals formalism, with electromagnetic fields beyond the scope of classical Maxwell theory. Classical Newtonian mechanics does not capture density evolution in the momentum balance, while the standard Maxwell equations neglect the contribution of the curl component of the electric field associated with moving charges. Building on an alternative understanding on entropy, we develop a generalized theory for electrodynamics governed by entropy-production constraints. The resulting framework yields a modified Maxwell stress tensor that incorporates the moving-charge contribution, leading to intrinsic parity asymmetry in electromagnetic forces. The theory naturally reproduces key features of superconductivity, including the Meissner effect, and reduces to the conventional Maxwell-Faraday and Maxwell-Ampere equations in an appropriate limit. This entropic formulation provides a unified thermodynamic basis for mass-field coupling and reveals new physical consequences arising from motion-induced electromagnetic effects.</description>

Under a geometric condition on the magnetic field, we show that every sequence of high energy eigenfunctions satisfies the quantum unique ergodicity property even if the Liouville measure is not ergodic for the underlying classical flow (the Euclidean geodesic flow on the 2-torus).</description>

Abstract: The optimal error exponents of binary composite i.i.d. state discrimination are trivially bounded by the worst-case pairwise exponents of discriminating individual elements of the sets representing the two hypotheses, and in the finite-dimensional classical case, these bounds in fact give exact single-copy expressions for the error exponents. In contrast, in the non-commutative case, the optimal exponents are only known to be expressible in terms of regularized divergences, resulting in formulas that, while conceptually relevant, are practically not very useful. In this paper, we develop further an approach initiated in [Mosonyi, Szil\'agyi, Weiner, IEEE Trans. Inf. Th. 68(2):1032--1067, 2022] to give improved single-copy bounds on the error exponents by comparing not only individual states from the two hypotheses, but also various unnormalized positive semi-definite operators associated to them. Here, we show a number of equivalent characterizations of such operators giving valid bounds, and show that in the commutative case, considering weighted geometric means of the states, and in the case of two states per hypothesis, considering weighted Kubo-Ando geometric means, are optimal for this approach. As a result, we give a new characterization of the weighted Kubo-Ando geometric means as the only $2$-variable operator geometric means that are block additive, tensor multiplicative, and satisfy the arithmetic-geometric mean inequality. We also extend our results to composite quantum channel discrimination, and show an analogous optimality property of the weighted Kubo-Ando geometric means of two quantum channels, a notion that seems to be new. We extend this concept to defining the notion of superoperator perspective function and establish some of its basic properties, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Sharp stability of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle: Second-Order and Curl-Free Field Cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02758v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using techniques from harmonic analysis, we derive several sharp stability estimates for the second order Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. We also present the explicit lower and upper bounds for the sharp stability constants and compute their exact limits when the dimension $N\rightarrow\infty$. Our proofs rely on spherical harmonics decomposition and Fourier analysis, differing significantly from existing approaches in the literature. Our results substantially improve the stability constants of the second order Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle recently obtained in [27]. As direct consequences of our main results, we also establish the sharp stability, with exact asymptotic behavior of the stability constants, of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle with curl-free vector fields and a sharp version of the second order Poincar\'{e} type inequality with Gaussian measure.</description>

      <title>Surface stability of a layered magnetoelastic half-space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10660v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We evaluate the conditions for surface stability of a layered magnetoelastic half-space subjected to large deformations and a magnetic field. After reviewing the fundamental measures of deformation and summarizing the magnetostatic equations in Eulerian and Lagrangian forms, we derive the constitutive relations from a total energy function dependent on the deformation gradient and Lagrangian magnetic induction. Energy principles yield the equilibrium equations, magnetic field equations, and boundary conditions. The second variation of the energy functional provides the incremental equations and conditions for stability analysis. Surface instability is studied by linearizing increments of deformation and magnetic induction about a finitely deformed state under a magnetic field normal to the surface. Four illustrative cases are considered: (i) a layered non-magnetizable half-space with varying stiffness contrast; (ii) the critical stretch of a magnetoelastic half-space as a function of magnetic induction; (iii) surface stability of a magneto-sensitive layer atop a non-magnetizable substrate; and (iv) bifurcation conditions in a two-layered magnetoelastic solid with different stiffness ratios. Graphical results are provided throughout.</description>

      <title>Tight Generalization of Robertson-Type Uncertainty Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19861v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish the tightest possible Robertson-type preparation uncertainty relation, which explicitly depends on the eigenvalues of the quantum state. The conventional constant $ \tfrac{1}{4} $ is replaced by a state-dependent coefficient $\frac{(\lambda_{\max} + \lambda_{\min})^2}{4(\lambda_{\max} - \lambda_{\min})^2}$, where $ \lambda_{\max} $ and $ \lambda_{\min}$ denote the largest and smallest eigenvalues of the density operator $\rho$, respectively. This coefficient is optimal among all Robertson-type generalizations and does not admit further improvement.Our relation becomes more pronounced as the quantum state becomes more mixed, capturing a trade-off in quantum uncertainty that the conventional Robertson's relation fails to detect. In addition, our result also provides a strict generalization of the Schr\"oedinger's uncertainty relation, showing that the uncertainty trade-off is governed by the sum of the covariance term and a state-dependent improvement over the Robertson bound. As applications, we also refine error-disturbance trade-offs by incorporating spectral information of both the system and the measuring apparatus,thereby generalizing the Arthurs--Goodman and Ozawa inequalities.</description>

      <title>Chimera states on m-directed hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12511v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chimera states are synchronization patterns in which coherent and incoherent regions coexist in systems of identical oscillators. This elusive phenomenon has attracted significant interest and has been widely analyzed, revealing several types of dynamical states. Most studies involve reciprocal pairwise couplings, where each oscillator exerts and receives the same interaction from neighboring ones, thus being modeled via symmetric networks. However, real-world systems often exhibit non-reciprocal, non-pairwise (many-body) interactions. Previous studies have shown that chimera states are more elusive in the presence of non-reciprocal pairwise interactions, while they are easier to observe when the interactions are reciprocal and higher-order (many-body). In this work, we investigate the emergence of chimera states on non-reciprocal higher-order structures, called mdirected hypergraphs, which we compare with their corresponding networks, and we observe that chimera state and specifically amplitude-mediated chimeras can emerge due to directionality, which had not been previously observed in the absence of directionality. We also compare the effect of non-reciprocal interactions between higher-order and pairwise couplings, and we find numerically that chimera states appear over a broader parameter range when considering higher-order interactions than in the corresponding network case, demonstrating the impact of directionality and the effect of higher-order interactions. Finally, the nature of phase chimeras has been further validated through phase reduction theory.</description>

      <title>Lack-of-fit reduction in the path-integral formalism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20242v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new formulation of the lack-of-fit reduction in non-equilibrium thermodynamics using the path-integral formalism. The formulation is based on the Onsager-Machlup variational principle, and it allows us to find reduced dynamical equations by minimizing information discrepancy with respect to the detailed evolution. The reduced evolution consists of a Hamiltonian vector field and a gradient flow. The reduction method is illustrated on the Kac-Zwanzig model, where we show how irreversibility emerges from purely Hamiltonian evolution by ignoring some degrees of freedom. We also show how to generalize the Fisher information matrix and Kullback-Leibler divergence between two probability distributions to the case when the two distributions are related by the principle of maximum entropy, even in the case when the entropy is not of Boltzmann-Gibbs type (for instance Tsallis-Havrda-Charvat entropy).</description>

      <title>A-Type Open ${\rm SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$ Spin Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09568v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For the noncompact open ${\rm SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$ spin chain, the eigenfunctions of the special matrix element of monodromy matrix are constructed. The key ingredients of the whole construction are local Yang-Baxter $\mathcal{R}$-operators, $Q$-operator and raising operators obtained by reduction from the $Q$-operator. The calculation of various scalar products and the proof of orthogonality are based on the properties of $Q$-operator and demonstrate its hidden role. The symmetry of eigenfunctions with respect to reflection of the spin variable $s \to 1-s$ is established. The Mellin-Barnes representation for eigenfunctions is derived and equivalence with initial coordinate representation is proved. The transformation from one representation to another is grounded on the application of $A$-type Gustafson integral generalized to the complex field.</description>

      <title>Optimal Qubit Purification and Unitary Schur Sampling via Random SWAP Tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05046v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The goal of qubit purification is to combine multiple noisy copies of an unknown pure quantum state to obtain one or more copies that are closer to the pure state. We show that a simple protocol based solely on random SWAP tests achieves the same fidelity as the Schur transform, which is optimal. This protocol relies only on elementary two-qubit SWAP tests, which project a pair of qubits onto the singlet or triplet subspaces, to identify and isolate singlet pairs, and then proceeds with the remaining qubits. For a system of $n$ qubits, we show that after approximately $T \approx n \ln n$ random SWAP tests, a sharp transition occurs: the probability of detecting any new singlet decreases exponentially with $T$. Similarly, the fidelity of each remaining qubit approaches the optimal value given by the Schur transform, up to an error that is exponentially small in $T$. More broadly, this protocol achieves what is known as weak Schur sampling and unitary Schur sampling with error $\epsilon$, after only $2n \ln(n \epsilon^{-1})$ SWAP tests. That is, it provides a lossless method for extracting any information invariant under permutations of qubits, making it a powerful subroutine for tasks such as quantum state tomography and metrology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12180v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct generalized symmetries in two-dimensional symmetric product orbifold CFTs $\text{Sym}^N(\mathcal{T}),$ for a generic seed CFT $\mathcal{T}$. These symmetries are more general than the universal and maximally symmetric ones previously constructed. We show that, up to one fine-tuned example when the number of copies $N$ equals four, the only symmetries that can be preserved under twisted sector marginal deformations are invertible and maximally symmetric. The results are obtained in two ways. First, using the mathematical machinery of $G$-equivariantization of fusion categories, and second, via the projector construction of topological defect lines. As an application, we classify all preserved symmetries in symmetric product orbifold CFTs with the seed CFT given by any $A$-series $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ minimal model. We comment on the implications of our results for holography.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02458v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the critical behavior of the one-dimensional Ising model with long-range interactions using the functional renormalization group in the local potential approximation (LPA), and compare our findings with Dyson's hierarchical model (DHM). While the DHM lacks translational invariance, it admits a field-theoretical description closely resembling the LPA, up to minor but nontrivial differences. After reviewing the real-space renormalization group approach to the DHM, we demonstrate a remarkable agreement in the critical exponent $\nu$ between the two methods across the entire range of power-law decays $1/2 &lt; \sigma &lt; 1$. We further benchmark our results against Monte Carlo simulations and analytical expansions near the upper boundary of the nontrivial regime, $\sigma \lesssim 1$.</description>

      <title>Carrollian Lie Algebroids: Taming Singular Carrollian Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03877v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Developments in Carrollian gravity and holography necessitate the use of singular Carroll vector fields, a feature that cannot be accommodated within standard Carrollian geometry. We introduce Carrollian Lie algebroids as a framework to study such singular Carrollian geometries. In this approach, we define the Carroll distribution as the image of the kernel of the degenerate metric under the anchor map. The Carroll distribution is, in general, a singular Stefan--Sussmann distribution that will fluctuate between rank-1 and rank-0, and so captures the notion of a singular Carroll vector field. As an example, we show that an invariant Carrollian structure on a principal bundle leads to a Carrollian structure on the associated Atiyah algebroid that will, in general, have a singular Carroll distribution. Mixed null-spacelike hypersurfaces, under some simplifying assumptions, also lead to examples of Carrollian Lie algebroids. Furthermore, we establish the existence of compatible connections on Carrollian Lie algebroids, and as a direct consequence, we conclude that Carrollian manifolds can always be equipped with compatible affine connections.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06395v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent work by Lawrie et al. [PRR 7, 023209 (2025)] introduced a non-diffracting resonant angular filter on a network of thin channels (modelled via quantum graph theory) that exhibits unit transmission of acoustic waves at a discrete, symmetry-paired set of incidence angles determined solely by the graph topology, while transmission at all other angles is strictly forbidden. In the present work, we study the same filtering geometry for waves governed by the magnetic Schr\"odinger equation rather than the classical wave equation. Using a phase shift induced by non-reciprocal wave propagation due to the presence of the magnetic potential and tuning $\delta$-type vertex boundary conditions, we make the previously topology-fixed discrete pass directions continuously tunable: both the transmission angle and the transmission coefficient become control parameters. The resulting flux-tunable angular filtering device replaces topology-constrained passbands with a programmable steering device, broadening the scope for wave-filter and beam-shaping applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07563v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In quantum systems with infinitely many degrees of freedom, states can be infinitely entangled across a pair of subsystems, but are there different forms of infinite entanglement? To understand entanglement in such systems, we use a framework in which subsystems are described by von Neumann algebras on the full system's Hilbert space. Although this approach has been known for over 50 years, an operational justification has been missing so far. We resolve this by deriving the von Neumann algebraic description of subsystems from operational axioms. This raises the question of how physical properties of the subsystem relate to algebraic properties. Our main result shows a surprisingly strong connection: The type classification of von Neumann algebras (types I, II, III, and their respective subtypes) is in one-to-one correspondence with a family of operational entanglement properties. For instance, Connes' classification of type III factors can be formulated in terms of the smallest achievable error when "embezzling" entanglement from the system. Our findings promote the type classification from algebraic bookkeeping to a classification of infinite quantum systems based on the kind of infinite entanglement that they support.</description>

      <title>Multiscale analysis of the conductivity in the Lorentz mirrors model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24091v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the mirrors model in $d$ dimensions on an infinite slab and with unit density. This is a deterministic dynamics in a random environment. We argue that the crossing probability of the slab goes like $\kappa/(\kappa+N)$ where $N$ is the width of the slab. We are able to compute $\kappa$ perturbatively by using a multiscale approach. The only small parameter involved in the expansion is the inverse of the size of the system. This approach rests on an inductive process and a closure assumption adapted to the mirrors model. For $d=3$, we propose the recursive relation for the conductivity $\kappa_n$ at scale $n$ : $\kappa_{n+1}=\kappa_n(1+\frac{\kappa_n}{2^{n}}\alpha)$, up to $o(1/2^n)$ terms and with $\alpha\simeq 0.0374$. This sequence has a finite limit.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02753v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we extend the notion of co-algebra, co-algebraic Wess-Zumino-Witten formulation of Lagrangian Field Theory and the Homotopy transfer theorem to many strings and particle systems. We discuss in detail the construction of higher dimensional co-algebras and the computational methods derived from them with a special interest regarding String Field Theory and Quantum Field Theory. As a result of this work we will be able to effortlessly extend some of the newly developed tools to study the algebraic structure, compute effective actions and compute scattering amplitudes of more complicated QFTs.</description>

      <title>Exact Stochastic Differential Equations for Quantum Reverse Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15919v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ensemble-averaged dynamics of open quantum systems are typically irreversible. We show that this irreversibility need not hold at the level of individually monitored quantum trajectories. Our main results are analytical stochastic differential equations for quantum reverse diffusion, along with corresponding stochastic master equations. These equations describe the exact and approximate stochastic reverse processes for continuously monitored Pauli channels, including time-dependent depolarizing noise. We show that the reverse processes generalize the forward dynamics by combining the noise effects of the forward processes with an additional non-Markovian stochastic drift that dynamically steers a quantum state back to its initial configuration. Consequently, the exact SDEs admit closed-form solutions that can be implemented in real-time without the need for variational techniques. Our findings establish an analytical framework for quantum state recovery, noise-resilient quantum gates, quantum generative modelling, quantum tomography via forward-reverse cycles, and potential paradigms for quantum error correction based on reverse diffusion.</description>

      <title>Ratio asymptotics and zero density for orthogonal polynomials with varying Verblunsky coefficients</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22507v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study asymptotic behavior of orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle with varying Verblunsky coefficients $\alpha_{n,N}$ when the ratio $n/N$ converges as $n,N\to\infty$.
  First, we give a streamlined proof of ratio asymptotics for orthogonal and paraorthogonal polynomials in the case of asymptotically constant and asymptotically periodic coefficients $\alpha_{n,N}$.
  Second, we determine the asymptotic zero distribution of paraorthogonal polynomials in the locally constant and locally periodic regimes. Analogous results are obtained for orthogonal polynomials under a mild additional condition on the varying coefficients.</description>

      <title>Generalizing fusion rules by shuffle: Symmetry-based classifications of nonlocal systems constructed from similarity transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02139v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study fusion rings, or symmetry topological field theories (SymTFTs), which lie outside the non-negative integer matrix representation (NIM-rep), by combining knowledge from generalized symmetry and that from pseudo-Hermitian systems. By applying the Galois shuffle operation to the SymTFTs, we reconstruct fusion rings that correspond to nonlocal CFTs constructed from the corresponding local nonunitary CFTs by applying the similarity transformations. The resultant SymTFTs are outside of NIM-rep, whereas they are ring isomorphic to the NIM-rep of the corresponding local nonunitary CFTs. We study the consequences of this correspondence between the nonlocal unitary model and local nonunitary models. We demonstrate the correspondence between their classifications of massive or massless renormalization group flows and the discrepancies between their boundary or domain wall phenomena. Our work reveals a new connection between ring isomorphism and similarity transformations, providing the fundamental implications of ring-theoretic ideas in the context of symmetry in physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03645v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The reduction of dynamical systems which are invariant under changes of global scale is well-understood, for classical theories of particles, and fields. The excision of the superfluous degree of freedom describing such a scale leads to a dynamically-equivalent theory, which is frictional in nature. In this article, we extend the formalism to physical models, of both particles and fields, described by singular Lagrangians. Our treatment of classical field theory is based on the manifestly covariant Hamilton De-Donder Weyl formalism, in which the Lagrangian density is introduced as a bundle morphism on the pre-multisymplectic velocity phase space $J^1E$. The results obtained are subsequently applied to a number of physically-motivated examples, as well as a discussion presented on the implications of our work for classical General Relativity.</description>

      <title>On the emergence of preferred structures in quantum theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07468v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We assess the possibilities offered by Hilbert space fundamentalism, an attitude towards quantum physics according to which all physical structures (e.g. subsystems, locality, spacetime, preferred observables) should emerge from minimal quantum ingredients (typically a Hilbert space, Hamiltonian, and state). As a case study, we first mainly focus on the specific question of whether the Hamiltonian can uniquely determine a tensor product structure, a crucial challenge in the growing field of quantum mereology. The present paper reviews, clarifies, and critically examines two apparently conflicting theorems by Cotler et al. and Stoica. We resolve the tension, show how the former has been widely misinterpreted and why the latter is correct only in some weaker version. We then propose a correct mathematical way to address the general problem of preferred structures in quantum theory, relative to the characterization of emergent objects by unitary-invariant properties. Finally, we apply this formalism in the particular case we started with, and show that a Hamiltonian and a state are enough structure to uniquely select a preferred tensor product structure.</description>

      <title>The equation of Binet in classical and relativistic orbital mechanics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07485v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Binet's equation provides a direct way to obtain the geometric shape of orbits in a central force field. It is well known that in Newtonian gravitation Binet's equation leads to all the conic curves as solutions for an inverse-square force. In this work, we show how Binet's equation arises from the horizontal and vertical infinitesimal displacements of a body in free fall and in inertial motion. This derivation uses elementary concepts of infinitesimal calculus. Second, we derive the relativistic version of Binet's equation for the Schwarzschild-(anti-)de Sitter metric. This derivation, which is novel, directly relates the coordinates involved in Binet's equation without the need to introduce potentials or the use of Killing vectors. Finally, we tackle some controversies related to the role of the cosmological constant in the trajectory of photons in a Schwarzschild-(anti-)de Sitter or even in Reissner-Nordstr\"om-(anti-)de Sitter spacetimes.</description>

      <title>About possible measures in Quantum Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09191v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Possible measures for Quantum Gravity are considered. Choices that are invariant under diffeomorphisms are analyzed, but the possibility of employing non invariant measures is also taken into account. The last possibility may be accepted if the anomaly in the measure is compensated by counter term redefinitions of the model under analysis. Particular attention is paid to some concrete examples of non covariant looking measures, which may be useful for generalizing the Veltmann identities when quantizing around curved space times. The results are specified for the Stelle gravity model [1]-[2], which is known to be renormalizable in flat space, although not known to be so in curved ones.</description>

      <title>The meaning of "Big Bang"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09950v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: What does ``Big Bang'' actually mean? What was the origin of these two words? It has often been said that the expression ``Big Bang'' began as an insult. Even if this were true, it would be just an irrelevant part of the whole issue. There are many more aspects hidden under this name, and which are seldom explained. They will be discussed in this work. In order to frame the analysis, help will be sought from the highly authoritative voices of two exceptional writers: William Shakespeare and Umberto Eco. Both Shakespeare and Eco have explored the tension existing between words and the realities they name. With the conclusion that names are, in general, just labels, simple stickers put to identify things. And this includes those given to great theorems or spectacular discoveries. Stigler's law of eponymy is recalled to further substantiate those statements. These points will be at the heart of the investigation carried out here, concerning the very important concept of ``Big Bang''. Everybody thinks to know what ``the Big Bang'' is, but only very few do know it, in fact. When Fred Hoyle first pronounced these two words together, on a BBC radio program, listeners were actually left with the false image that Hoyle was trying to destroy. That is, the tremendous explosion of Lema\^itre's primeval atom (or cosmic egg), which scattered all its enormous matter and energy content throughout the rest of the Universe. This image is absolutely wrong! As will be concluded, today the label ``Big Bang'' is used in several different contexts: (a) the Big Bang Singularity; (b) as the equivalent of cosmic inflation; (c) speaking of the Big Bang cosmological model; (d) to name a very popular TV program; and more.</description>

      <title>A random purification channel for arbitrary symmetries with applications to fermions and bosons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15690v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The random purification channel maps n copies of any mixed quantum state to n copies of a random purification of the state. We generalize this construction to arbitrary symmetries: for any group G of unitaries, we construct a quantum channel that maps states contained in the algebra generated by G to random purifications obtained by twirling over G. In addition to giving a surprisingly concise proof of the original random purification theorem, our result implies the existence of fermionic and bosonic Gaussian purification channels. As applications, we obtain the first tomography protocol for fermionic Gaussian states that scales optimally with the number of modes and the error, as well as an improved property test for this class of states.</description>

      <title>Subsystems (in)dependence in GIE proposals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17024v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent proposals suggest that detecting entanglement between two spatially superposed masses would establish the quantum nature of gravity. However, these gravitationally induced entanglement (GIE) experiments rely on assumptions about subsystem independence. We sharpen the theoretical underpinnings of such proposals by examining them through the lens of algebraic quantum field theory (AQFT), distinguishing distinct operational and algebraic notions of independence. We argue that state and measurement independence of subsystems, essential to the experimental logic, is nontrivial in the presence of gauge constraints and gravitational dressing. Using gravitationally dressed fields, we recall that commutation relations between spacelike separated observables are nontrivial, undermining strict Hilbert space factorization. We further explore the implications for entanglement witnesses, investigating the Tsirelson bound when subsystem algebras fail to commute, and showing that the Tsirelson bound persists for a suitably symmetrized CHSH observable even though the operational status of such "joint" observables becomes delicate when commensurability fails. Our analysis highlights how even within linearized covariant quantum gravity, violations of microcausality may affect both the interpretation, modelling, and design of proposed laboratory tests of quantum gravity, despite remaining negligible for current experimental regimes. Although we consider GIE-style protocols as a concrete case study, the subsystem-independence issues we highlight are generic to low-energy (perturbative) quantum gravity. Finally, we derive estimates for dressing-induced microcausality violations, which suggest a complementary avenue to current proposals: in principle, bounding dressing-induced microcausality violations themselves as a probe of the quantum nature of gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17068v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study discrete torsion for the $n$--torus with finite symmetry group $G$ from the Dijkgraaf--Witten viewpoint. A class in $H^n(G,U(1))$ assigns a phase to each flat $G$--bundle, equivalently to each commuting $n$--tuple in $G$ up to conjugation. We introduce the subgroup $\Br^n(G)\subseteq H^n(G,U(1))$ of \emph{untwisted} classes, those whose Dijkgraaf--Witten phases are trivial on all commuting tuples, and derive a universal coefficient exact sequence involving this invariant. In degree $2$ this recovers the Bogomolov multiplier / unramified Brauer group. We implement algorithms for computing $\Br^n(G)$ and corresponding torus partition functions, and report on computations for families of finite subgroups of $\SU(4)$.</description>
