      <title>Homophily Within and Across Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional social network analysis often models homophily--the tendency of similar individuals to form connections--using a single parameter, overlooking finer biases within and across groups. We present an exponential family model that integrates both local and global homophily, distinguishing between strong homophily within tightly knit cliques and weak homophily spanning broader community interactions. By modeling these forms of homophily through a maximum entropy approach and deriving the network behavior under percolation, we show how higher-order assortative mixing influences network dynamics. Our framework is useful for decomposing homophily into finer levels and studying the spread of information and diseases, influence dynamics, and innovation diffusion. We demonstrate that the interaction between different levels of homophily results in complex percolation thresholds. We tested our model on various datasets with distinct homophily patterns, showcasing its applicability. These homophilic connections significantly affect the effectiveness of intervention and mitigation strategies. Hence, our findings have important implications for improving public health measures, understanding information dissemination on social media, and optimizing intervention strategies.</description>

      <title>Suspense and surprise in the book of technology: Understanding innovation dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We envision future technologies through science fiction, strategic planning, or academic research. Yet, our expectations do not always match with what actually unfolds, much like navigating a story where some events align with expectations while others surprise us. This gap indicates the inherent uncertainty of innovation-how technologies emerge and evolve in unpredictable ways. Here, we elaborate on this inherent uncertainty of innovation in the way technologies emerge and evolve. We define suspense captures accumulated uncertainty and describing events anticipated before their realization, while surprise represents a dramatic shift in understanding when an event occurs unexpectedly. We identify those connections in U.S. patents and show that suspenseful innovations tend to integrate more smoothly into society, achieving higher citations and market value. In contrast, surprising innovations, though often disruptive and groundbreaking, face challenges in adoption due to their extreme novelty. We further show that these categories allow us to identify distinct stages of technology life cycles, suggesting a way to identify the systematic trajectory of technologies and anticipate their future paths.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Cognitive Neural Networks: Assessing Confidence and Uncertainty with Human Decision-Making Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern machine learning (ML) systems excel in recognising and classifying images with remarkable accuracy. However, like many computer software systems, they can fail by generating confusing or erroneous outputs or by deferring to human operators to interpret the results and make final decisions. In this paper, we employ the recently proposed quantum-tunnelling neural networks (QT-NNs), inspired by human brain processes, alongside quantum cognition theory, to classify image datasets while emulating human perception and judgment. Our findings suggest that the QT-NN model provides compelling evidence of its potential to replicate human-like decision-making and outperform traditional ML algorithms.</description>

      <title>Majority voting is not good for heaven or hell, with mirrored performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00592</link>

Abstract: Within the ViSE (Voting in Stochastic Environment) model, we study the effectiveness of majority voting in various environments. By the pit of losses paradox, majority decisions in apparently hostile environments systematically reduce the capital of society. In such cases, the simple social decision rule of ``rejecting all proposals without voting'' outperforms majority. In this paper, we identify another pit of losses appearing in favorable environments. Here, the simple social decision rule of ``accepting all proposals without voting'' is superior to majority. We prove that under a version of simple majority called symmetrized majority and the antisymmetry of the voting body, the second pit of losses is a mirror image of the pit of losses in hostile environments and explain this phenomenon. Technically, we consider a voting society consisting of individualists whose strategy is supporting all proposals that increase their capital and a group (groups) whose members vote to increase the total group capital. According to the main result, the expected capital gain of each agent in the environment whose generator $X$ has mean $\mu&gt;0$ exceeds by $\mu$ their expected capital gain under generator $-X$. This result extends to location families of generators with distributions symmetric about their mean. The mentioned result determines the symmetry of the difference between the expected capital gain under the symmetrized majority and that under the ``basic'' social decision rule that rejects/accepts all proposals in unfavorable/favorable environments.</description>

      <title>Self-Propelled Agents and Group Social Force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09840v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Brownian motion have long been studied on a diversity of fields, not only in physics of statistical mechanics, but also in biological models, finance and economic process, and social systems. In the past twenty years, there has been a growing interest in studying the model in self-propelled feature and interaction force such that the model also fits into study of social phenomenon of many individuals. This article will continue with this research trend and especially investigate the model in paradigms for a quantitative description of social and economic process. We mainly discuss a class of collective decision process of Brownian agent/particles, where the stochastic process does not exist in the fluctuation in the traditional Brownian motion, but in selection among several discrete choices. Their decisions interacts with each other in a given social topology. To simply our discussion the binary choice problem is particularly discussed where each agent only takes an alternative of two choices. Mathematically, we introduce a set of arrays to describe social relationship of agents in a quantitative manner, and the arrays deduce the group social force and opinion dynamics, which are useful to study complex social movement and self-organization phenomena including discrete-choice activities, social groups and de-individualization effect. Such agent-based simulation symbolizes a variety of collective activities in human society, especially in the field of economics and social science.</description>

      <title>q-neighbor Ising model on a polarized network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.19233v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the interplay between the lobby size $q$ in the $q$-neighbor Ising model of opinion formation (Phys. Rev. E 92, 052105) and the level of overlap $v$ of two fully connected graphs. Results suggest that for each lobby size $q \ge 3$, a specific level of overlap $v^*$ exists, which destroys initially polarized clusters of opinions. By performing Monte-Carlo simulations, backed by an analytical approach, we show that the dependence of the $v^*$ on the lobby size $q$ is far from trivial in the absence of temperature, showing consecutive maximum and minimum, that additionally depends on the parity of $q$. The temperature is, in general, a destructive factor; its increase leads to the collapse of polarized clusters for smaller values of $v$ and additionally brings a substantial decrease in the level of polarization. However, we show that this behavior is counter-intuitively inverted for specific lobby sizes and temperature ranges.</description>
