      <title>Point-proton density distributions of stable nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Point-proton density distributions are deduced for 130 stable nuclei from $^{7}\mathrm{Li}$ to $^{232}\mathrm{Th}$ from nuclear charge densities determined in elastic electron scattering. There are 171 cases are presented in model-dependent forms, including the modified Harmonic-oscillator function, two-parameter Femi function (2pF), three-parameter Femi function, three-parameter Gaussian function, and 97 in Fourier-Bessel series model-independent forms. Independent of density functions, the point-proton root-mean-square (rms) radii of the derived point-proton density show excellent agreement with each other. We identify cases where the tabulated data of charge densities and charge radii are inconsistent, and the deduced point-proton density distributions are inaccurate due to insufficient experimental momentum transfer coverage or inconsistent scattering experiments. For the widely used 2pF distribution, it is found that the surface diffuseness parameters can be empirically calculated from those of charge density, while the half-density radius parameters follow the $A^{1/3}$ rule. The derived point-proton density distributions can be used as input in nuclear reaction studies and compared with nuclear model predictions.</description>

      <title>The candidates of 2$\alpha$ condensate around the 16O nucleus studied by the real-time evolution method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Searching for alpha condensation around a core nucleus, a new class of nuclear clustering, is an interesting topic. Previous theoretical studies predicted 16O + 2$\alpha$ condensed states. However, in those studies, the strong mixing with non-resonant states made the identification of true resonant states non-trivial. Purpose: To address this issue, we aim to provide a more robust theoretical verification of the 16O + 2$\alpha$ condensation. Our goal is to clearly identify the resonant states and predict their properties, such as decay widths. Method: We employ the real-time evolution method (REM), which generates physically important basis states using the equation of motion, minimizing contamination from the continuum. The analytical continuation in the coupling constant (ACCC) was used to estimate the $\alpha$-decay widths. Results: The present calculations show much better convergence of eigenstates, and the $0^+_3$ and $0^+_4$ states showed remarkable isoscalar monopole transition strengths, which were in good agreement with the predictions of Ichikawa et al. The small alpha-decay widths for these states suggest that experimental observation appears feasible. Conclusion: The present results show the reasonable agreement with a previous work, firmly establishing the $0^+_3$ and $0^+_4$ states approximately 5 and 1 MeV below the 16O + 2$\alpha$ threshold as candidates for the 2$\alpha$ condensation around the core nucleus 16O. The REM proved effective in identifying these states.</description>

      <title>Insights into Neutron Star Matter: EoS Models and Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The equation of state (EoS) for neutron stars is a crucial topic in astrophysics, nuclear physics, and quantum chromodynamics (QCD), influencing their structure, stability, and observable properties. This review classifies EoS models into hadronic matter, hybrid, and quark matter models, analyzing their assumptions, predictions, and constraints. While hadronic models characterize nucleonic matter, potentially including contributions from hyperons or mesons, hybrid models introduce phase transitions to quark matter, and quark models hypothesize the presence of deconfined quark matter cores or entirely quark-composed stars. By synthesizing results from recent theoretical and observational studies, this review aims to offer a comprehensive understanding of the methodologies used in constructing neutron star EoS, their implications, and future directions.</description>

      <title>Manifest Gauge Invariance for Structure Dependent Radiative Corrections to Processes Involving Atoms and Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiative corrections to reactions involving atoms or nuclei can become sensitive to the structure of the bound state. Generically, one encounters correlation functions of multiple currents which must satisfy Ward identities. At intermediate steps, however the Ward identities are obscured, and often violated by physically motivated approximation schemes. In this paper we outline a method to construct a representation of the aforementioned correlators that manifests gauge invariance in the limit of a heavy target (i.e., when recoil energy can be neglected). This representation then enables manifestly gauge invariant approximation schemes. Furthermore, the proposed representation naturally separates the largest contributions that dominate scattering amplitudes in the limit of a heavy constituent (e.g., proton) mass. We analyze elastic electron scattering from nuclei in detail, and also discuss radiative corrections to processes mediated by the weak interaction.</description>

      <title>Comparison of integral equations used to study $T_{cc}^+$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a detailed comparison between three formalisms used in recent studies of $DD^*$ scattering, which aim to understand the properties of the doubly-charmed tetraquark, $T_{cc}^+(3875)$. These methods are the three-particle relativistic field theory (RFT) formalism, the two-body Lippmann-Schwinger (LS) equation with chiral effective field theory potentials, and the two-particle relativistic framework proposed by Baiao Raposo and Hansen (BRH approach). In a simplified single-channel setting, we derive the conditions under which the infinite-volume integral equations from the RFT and BRH approaches reduce to the LS form. We present numerical examples showing that differences between these methods can be largely removed by adjusting short-range couplings. We also address a number of technical issues in the RFT approach.</description>

      <title>Directed flow from parton spin-orbit coupling in $pp$ and $pA$ collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We point out a novel mechanism to generate $\cos \phi$ two-particle azimuthal correlation (`directed flow') in unpolarized proton-proton and proton-nucleus collisions in the forward rapidity region of the projectile proton. This is a direct consequence of the recently discovered strong spin-orbit coupling in gluons at small-$x$. The observable simultaneously serves as a unique probe into the double helicity parton distribution functions of the proton.</description>

      <title>Theoretical characterisation of the Barium II and Radium II ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent experimental advances, including the ongoing development of an optical atomic clock in singly ionised radium, we perform a detailed theoretical characterisation of Ra+ and its lighter analogue, Ba+. Both ions are of interest for precision studies, including for atomic parity violation and searches for new physics beyond the standard model. Using the all-orders correlation potential method, including Breit and radiative quantum electrodynamics corrections, we perform high-accuracy calculations of electric-dipole (E1), electric-quadrupole (E2), and magnetic-dipole (M1) transition matrix elements between the low-lying s, p, and d states of these ions, as well as the excited-state lifetimes, polarizabilities, magic wavelengths, and magnetic dipole (A) hyperfine structure constants. By combining lifetime measurements with precise theoretical ratios, we extract high-accuracy determinations of the s-d_1/2 and s-d_3/2 E2 matrix elements. By combining hyperfine measurements with atomic theory, we extract parameters of the nuclear magnetisation distribution (the Bohr-Weisskopf effect) for 135-, 137-Ba and 223-, 225-Ra. These results provide theoretical input for ongoing and future experimental programs in fundamental physics and precision metrology.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional femtoscopy for proton pairs in heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Femtoscopy, a technique of measuring the size and the dynamics of the system created in heavy-ion collisions is used extensively in experiments at RHIC, LHC, SPS, and the FAIR/GSI. Analysis for pairs of pions is most common, due to their large abundance in the collisions, as well as well-understood theoretical formalism and advanced experimental methodology. It is usually performed in three dimensions in longitudinally co-moving reference frame of the pair, to maximize the amount of information obtained about the source. Similar three-dimensional analysis has also been performed for charged and neutral kaons. In contrast analyses for all other pair types -- either for pairs of identical protons, or for pairs of non-identical particles are only one-dimensional. The abundance of heavier particles is lower than for pions, while the theoretical formalism for such correlations, as well as practical experimental methodology is limited to one-dimensional case up to now. This work identifies specific challenges arising in the analysis of three-dimensional proton-proton femtoscopy and proposes a theoretical formalism to analyze them, as well as specific experimental methods to extract and fit correlations. A test and validation of these methods is performed on correlations simulated in the LHyquid+Therminator2 model, and demonstrates the feasibility of such analysis. The caveats in the theoretical interpretation of the results are discussed, by comparing the fitted values of femtscopic radii with the true characteristics of the source extracted directly from the model.</description>

      <title>Theoretical modeling of approximate universality of tidally deformed neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasi-universal relations are known to exist among various neutron star observables that do not depend sensitively on the underlying nuclear matter equations of state. For example, some of these relations imply that the tidally induced multipole moments are approximately characterized by the electric-type quadrupolar tidal deformability. Such relations can be used to reduce the number of independent tidal parameters in gravitational-waveform modeling, thereby allowing us to infer extreme nuclear matter properties more accurately and test General Relativity in an insensitive manner to uncertainties in nuclear physics. We present a comprehensive theoretical investigation into approximate universality of neutron stars. Our approach employs a semi-analytic relativistic stellar interior model, which extends the Tolman VII solution, thereby enabling a refined exploration of the tidal properties of nonrotating stars within a semi-analytic framework. The derived power-law relations among various tidal deformabilities -- referred to as the universal Love relations -- agree well with expressions in previous work found empirically. We elucidate how the equation-of-state dependence is suppressed in a particular combination of macroscopic physical parameters induced by perturbations and demonstrate that the relation between the moment of inertia and electric-type quadrupolar tidal deformability (I-Love relation) rests on the same underlying mechanism. Our findings indicate that the approximate universality of neutron stars can be attributed to low compressibility, consistent with some of the previous studies on the possible origin of the universality.</description>

      <title>Primordial black-hole formation and heavy r-process element synthesis from the cosmological QCD transition. Two aspects of an inhomogeneous early Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review the role of primordial black holes (PBHs) for illuminating the dark ages of the cosmological evolution and as dark matter candidates. We elucidate the role of phase transitions for primordial black hole formation in the early Universe and focus our attention to the cosmological QCD phase transition within a recent microscopical model. We explore the impact of physics beyond the Standard Model on the cosmic equation of state and the probability distribution for the formation of primordial black holes which serve as dark matter (DM) candidates. We argue that besides primordial black holes also droplet-like quark-gluon plasma inhomogeneities may become gravitationally stabilized for a sufficiently long epoch to distill baryon number and form nuclear matter droplets which upon their evaporation may enrich the cosmos locally with heavy $r$-process elements already in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Estimating theoretical uncertainties of the two-nucleon observables by using backpropagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06304v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel approach to calculating theoretical uncertainties in few-nucleon calculations, making use of automatic differentiation via backpropagation, which is particularly efficient when there are many input variables but only a few outputs. The methods described in this paper constitute tools that can be used to investigate the properties of scalar functions used to define nuclear potentials and quantify their contribution to the uncertainty of few nucleon calculations. We demonstrate these methods in deuteron bound state and nucleon - nucleon scattering calculations. Backpropagation, implemented in the Python pytorch library, is used to calculate the gradients with respect to model parameters and propagate errors from these parameters to the deuteron binding energy and selected phase-shift parameters. The uncertainty values obtained using this approach are validated by directly sampling from the potential parameters. We find very good agreement between two ways of estimating that uncertainty.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08740v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The standard formula, due to Spiegel, for the smoothing of temperature fluctuations by radiative transfer is unstable in relativity. This is due to the fact that Spiegel neglected the transit time of light, thereby allowing the transport coefficients to move outside the convex geometry compatible with causality (the "hydrohedron"). Here, we fix this pathology. First, we prove that the linearized radiative transfer equations are causal and covariantly stable by construction. Then, we repeat Spiegel's calculation accounting for the finite speed of photons. We find that the full transfer problem can be solved analytically. All the infinite (exact) transport coefficients arising from it fall inside the hydrohedron. Our analysis also accounts for isotropic scattering.</description>

      <title>Delayed Thermal Relaxation of Rapidly Cooling Neutron Stars: Nucleon Superfluidity and Non-nucleon Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14059v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The thermal relaxation time of neutron stars, typically defined by a sudden drop in surface temperature, is usually on the order of 10 to 100 years. In this study, we investigate neutron star thermal relaxation by incorporating nucleon superfluidity and non-nucleonic particles, specifically considering hyperons as a representative case. We find that rapidly cooling neutron stars driven by neutron superfluidity and direct Urca processes demonstrate delayed thermal relaxation under specific physical conditions. The former acquires that the neutron $^3P_2$ critical temperature is small enough, whereas the latter depends on the presence of a small core that permits direct Urca processes. To explore these scenarios, we propose simple theoretical frameworks to describe these delayed thermal relaxation behaviors and discuss how an recently-established enhanced modified Urca rate influences the relaxation time. By confronting the theoretical results with the observation of Cassiopeia A, we can effectively constrain the maximum neutron $^3P_2$ critical temperature.</description>

      <title>Electroweak form factors of baryons in dense nuclear matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15660v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is evidence that the properties of hadrons are modified in a nuclear medium. Information about the medium modifications of the internal structure of hadrons is fundamental for the study of dense nuclear matter and high-energy processes, including heavy-ion and nucleus--nucleus collisions. At the moment, however, empirical information about medium modifications of hadrons is limited; therefore, theoretical studies are essential for progress in the field. In the present work, we review theoretical studies of the electromagnetic and axial form factors of octet baryons in symmetric nuclear matter. The calculations are based on a model that takes into account the degrees of freedom revealed in experimental studies of low and intermediate square transfer momentum $q^2=-Q^2$: valence quarks and meson cloud excitations of baryon cores. The formalism combines a covariant constituent quark model, developed for a free space (vacuum) with the quark--meson coupling model for extension to the nuclear medium. We conclude that the nuclear medium modifies the baryon properties differently according to the flavor content of the baryons and the medium density. The effects of the medium increase with density and are stronger (quenched or enhanced) for light baryons than for heavy baryons. In particular, the in-medium neutrino--nucleon and antineutrino--nucleon cross-sections are reduced compared to the values in free space. The proposed formalism can be extended to densities above the normal nuclear density and applied to neutrino--hyperon and antineutrino--hyperon scattering in dense nuclear matter.</description>

Abstract: This work introduces a method for determining the energy spectrum of lattice quantum chromodynamics (LQCD) by applying the Lanczos algorithm to the transfer matrix and using a bootstrap generalization of the Cullum-Willoughby method to filter out spurious eigenvalues. Proof-of-principle analyses of the simple harmonic oscillator and the LQCD proton mass demonstrate that this method provides faster ground-state convergence than the "effective mass," which is related to the power-iteration algorithm. Lanczos provides more accurate energy estimates than multi-state fits to correlation functions with small imaginary times while achieving comparable statistical precision. Two-sided error bounds are computed for Lanczos results and guarantee that excited-state effects cannot shift Lanczos results far outside their statistical uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Quantum decoherence from complex saddle points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16627v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum decoherence is the effect that bridges quantum physics to well-understood classical physics. As such, it plays a crucial role in understanding the mysterious nature of quantum physics. Quantum decoherence is also a source of quantum noise that has to be well under control in quantum computing and in various experiments based on quantum technologies. Here we point out that quantum decoherence can be captured by $\textit{complex}$ saddle points in the Feynman path integral in much the same way as quantum tunneling can be captured by instantons. In particular, we present some first-principle calculations in the Caldeira-Leggett model, which reproduce the predicted scaling behavior of quantum decoherence with respect to the parameters of the environment, such as the temperature and the coupling to the system of interest. We also discuss how to extend our approach to general models by Monte Carlo calculations using a recently developed method to overcome the sign problem.</description>

      <title>Valence quark-stopping and gluon junction-stopping scenarios in electron-nucleus collisions at the forthcoming Electron-Ion Collider: Which one is correct?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02819v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the current literature, two stopping scenarios are being discussed in the context of high-energy collisions: the valence quark scenario and the gluon or baryon junction scenario. In the valence quark-stopping scenario, three valence quarks each contribute one-third of the baryon number within a baryon. Conversely, in the gluon junction-stopping scenario, the gluon junction is responsible for carrying the entire baryon number. At present, there is no consensus regarding which type of stopping scenario is correct. Based on a multi-source thermal model, our investigation indicates that experimental data analyzed in previous and present studies suggest that the valence quark-stopping scenario is indeed accurate. It is anticipated that this scenario can be further validated through electron-nucleus ($eA$) collisions at the forthcoming Electron-Ion Collider (EIC).</description>

      <title>Unified exact WKB framework for resonance -- Zel'dovich/complex-scaling regularization and rigged Hilbert space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02301v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a unified framework for analyzing quantum mechanical resonances using the exact WKB method. The non-perturbative formulation based on the exact WKB method works for incorporating the Zel'dovich regularization, the complex scaling method, and the rigged Hilbert space. While previous studies have demonstrated the exact WKB analysis in bound state problems, our work extends its application to quasi-stationary states. By examining the inverted Rosen--Morse potential, we illustrate how the exact WKB analysis captures resonant phenomena in a rigorous manner. We explore the equivalence and complementarity of different well-established regularizations \`a la Zel'dovich and complex scaling within this framework. Also, we find the most essential regulator of functional analyticity and construct a modified Hilbert space of the exact WKB framework for resonance, which is called the rigged Hilbert space. This offers a deeper understanding of resonant states and their analytic structures. Our results provide a concrete demonstration of the non-perturbative accuracy of exact WKB methods in unstable quantum systems.</description>
