      <title>Marginal Treatment Effects and Monotonicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How robust are analyses based on marginal treatment effects (MTE) to violations of Imbens and Angrist (1994) monotonicity? In this note, I present weaker forms of monotonicity under which popular MTE-based estimands still identify the parameters of interest.</description>

      <title>Early warning systems for financial markets of emerging economies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop and apply a new online early warning system (EWS) for what is known in machine learning as concept drift, in economics as a regime shift and in statistics as a change point. The system goes beyond linearity assumed in many conventional methods, and is robust to heavy tails and tail-dependence in the data, making it particularly suitable for emerging markets. The key component is an effective change-point detection mechanism for conditional entropy of the data, rather than for a particular indicator of interest. Combined with recent advances in machine learning methods for high-dimensional random forests, the mechanism is capable of finding significant shifts in information transfer between interdependent time series when traditional methods fail. We explore when this happens using simulations and we provide illustrations by applying the method to Uzbekistan's commodity and equity markets as well as to Russia's equity market in 2021-2023.</description>

      <title>Estimating overidentified linear models with heteroskedasticity and outliers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.17615v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Overidentified two-stage least square (TSLS) is commonly adopted by applied economists to address endogeneity. Though it potentially gives more efficient or informative estimate, overidentification comes with a cost. The bias of TSLS is severe when the number of instruments is large. Hence, Jackknife Instrumental Variable Estimator (JIVE) has been proposed to reduce bias of overidentified TSLS. A conventional heuristic rule to assess the performance of TSLS and JIVE is approximate bias. This paper formalizes this concept and applies the new definition of approximate bias to three classes of estimators that bridge between OLS, TSLS and a variant of JIVE, namely, JIVE1. Three new approximately unbiased estimators are proposed. They are called AUK, TSJI1 and UOJIVE. Interestingly, a previously proposed approximately unbiased estimator UIJIVE can be viewed as a special case of UOJIVE. While UIJIVE is approximately unbiased asymptotically, UOJIVE is approximately unbiased even in finite sample. Moreover, UOJIVE estimates parameters for both endogenous and control variables whereas UIJIVE only estimates the parameter of the endogenous variables. TSJI1 and UOJIVE are consistent and asymptotically normal under fixed number of instruments. They are also consistent under many-instrument asymptotics. This paper characterizes a series of moment existence conditions to establish all asymptotic results. In addition, the new estimators demonstrate good performances with simulated and empirical datasets.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous Autoregressions in Short T Panel Data Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.05299v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers a first-order autoregressive panel data model with individual-specific effects and heterogeneous autoregressive coefficients defined on the interval (-1,1], thus allowing for some of the individual processes to have unit roots. It proposes estimators for the moments of the cross-sectional distribution of the autoregressive (AR) coefficients, assuming a random coefficient model for the autoregressive coefficients without imposing any restrictions on the fixed effects. It is shown the standard generalized method of moments estimators obtained under homogeneous slopes are biased. Small sample properties of the proposed estimators are investigated by Monte Carlo experiments and compared with a number of alternatives, both under homogeneous and heterogeneous slopes. It is found that a simple moment estimator of the mean of heterogeneous AR coefficients performs very well even for moderate sample sizes, but to reliably estimate the variance of AR coefficients much larger samples are required. It is also required that the true value of this variance is not too close to zero. The utility of the heterogeneous approach is illustrated in the case of earnings dynamics.</description>

      <title>High-dimensional forecasting with known knowns and known unknowns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14582v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Forecasts play a central role in decision making under uncertainty. After a brief review of the general issues, this paper considers ways of using high-dimensional data in forecasting. We consider selecting variables from a known active set, known knowns, using Lasso and OCMT, and approximating unobserved latent factors, known unknowns, by various means. This combines both sparse and dense approaches. We demonstrate the various issues involved in variable selection in a high-dimensional setting with an application to forecasting UK inflation at different horizons over the period 2020q1-2023q1. This application shows both the power of parsimonious models and the importance of allowing for global variables.</description>
