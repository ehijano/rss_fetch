      <title>Bulge+disc decomposition of HFF and CANDELS galaxies: UVJ diagrams and stellar mass-size relations of galaxy components at $0.2 \leq z \leq 1.5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using deep imaging from the CANDELS and HFF surveys, we present bulge+disc decompositions with GalfitM for $\sim$17,000 galaxies over $0.2 \leq z\leq 1.5$. We use various model parameters to select reliable samples of discs and bulges, and derive their stellar masses using an empirically calibrated relation between mass-to-light ratio and colour. Across our entire redshift range, we show that discs follow stellar mass-size relations that are consistent with those of star-forming galaxies, suggesting that discs primarily evolve via star formation. In contrast, the stellar mass-size relations of bulges are mass-independent. Our novel dataset further enables us to separate components into star-forming and quiescent based on their specific star formation rates. We find that both star-forming discs and star-forming bulges lie on stellar mass-size relations that are similar to those of star-forming galaxies, while quiescent discs are typically smaller than star-forming discs and lie on steeper relations, implying distinct evolutionary mechanisms. Similar to quiescent galaxies, quiescent bulges show a flattening in the stellar mass-size relation at $\sim$10$^{10}$M$_\odot$, below which they show little mass dependence. However, their best-fitting relations have lower normalisations, indicating that at a given mass, bulges are smaller than quiescent galaxies. Finally, we obtain rest-frame colours for individual components, showing that bulges typically have redder colours than discs, as expected. We visually derive UVJ criteria to separate star-forming and quiescent components and show that this separation agrees well with component colour. HFF bulge+disc decomposition catalogues used for these analyses are publicly released with this paper.</description>

      <title>The earliest phases of CNO enrichment in galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. The recent detection of nitrogen-enhanced, metal-poor galaxies at high redshift by the James Webb Space Telescope has sparked renewed interest in exploring the chemical evolution of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen (the CNO elements) at early times, prompting fresh inquiries into their origins. Aims. The main goal of this paper is to shed light onto the early evolution of the main CNO isotopes in our Galaxy and in young distant systems, such as GN-z11 at z=10.6. Methods. To this aim, we incorporate a stochastic star-formation component into a chemical evolution model calibrated with high-quality Milky Way (MW) data, focusing on the contribution of Population III (Pop III) stars to the early chemical enrichment. Results. By comparing the model predictions with CNO abundance measurements from high-resolution spectroscopy of an homogeneous sample of Galactic halo stars, we first demonstrate that the scatter observed in the metallicity range -4.5 &lt; [Fe/H] &lt;-1.5 can be explained by pre-enrichment from Pop III stars that explode as supernovae (SNe) with different initial masses and energies. Then, by exploiting the chemical evolution model, we provide testable predictions for log(C/N), log(N/O), and log(C/O) vs. log(O/H)+12 in MW-like galaxies observed at different cosmic epochs/redshifts. Finally, by calibrating the chemical evolution model to replicate the observed properties of GN-z11, we provide an alternative interpretation of its log(N/O) abundance ratio, demonstrating that its high N content can be reproduced through enrichment from high-mass faint Pop III SNe. Conclusions. Stochastic chemical enrichment from primordial stars explains both the observed scatter in CNO abundances in MW halo stars and the exceptionally high N/O ratios in some distant galaxies. These findings emphasize the critical role of Pop III stars in shaping early chemical evolution.</description>

      <title>A Stellar Dynamical Mass Measurement of the Supermassive Black Hole in NGC 3258</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a stellar dynamical mass measurement of the supermassive black hole in the elliptical (E1) galaxy NGC 3258. Our findings are based on Integral Field Unit spectroscopy from the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer observations in Narrow Field Mode with adaptive optics and in the MUSE Wide Field Mode, from which we extract kinematic information by fitting the Ca II and Mg $b$ triplets, respectively. Using axisymmetric, three-integral Schwarzschild orbit-library models, we fit the observed line-of-sight velocity distributions to infer the supermassive black hole mass, the $H$-band mass-to-light ratio, the asymptotic circular velocity, and the dark matter halo scale radius of the galaxy. We report a black hole mass of $(2.2 \pm 0.2)\times10^9 \ \rm M_{\scriptscriptstyle\odot}$ at an assumed distance of $31.9 \ \rm Mpc$. This value is in close agreement with a previous measurement from ALMA CO observations. The consistency between these two measurements provides strong support for both the gas dynamical and stellar dynamical methods.</description>

      <title>Growth of high redshift supermassive black holes from heavy seeds in the BRAHMA cosmological simulations: Implications of overmassive black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: JWST has recently revealed a large population of accreting black holes (BHs) in the early Universe. Even after accounting for possible systematic biases, the high-z $M_*-M_{\rm \rm bh}$ relation derived from these objects by Pacucci et al. (2023 P23 relation) is above the local scaling relation by $&gt;3\sigma$. To understand the implications of potentially overmassive high-z BH populations, we study the BH growth at $z\sim4-7$ using the $[18~\mathrm{Mpc}]^3$ BRAHMA suite of cosmological simulations with systematic variations of heavy seed models that emulate direct collapse black hole (DCBH) formation. In our least restrictive seed model, we place $\sim10^5~M_{\odot}$ seeds in halos with sufficient dense and metal-poor gas. To model conditions for direct collapse, we impose additional criteria based on a minimum Lyman Werner flux (LW flux $=10~J_{21}$), maximum gas spin, and an environmental richness criterion. The high-z BH growth in our simulations is merger dominated, with a relatively small contribution from gas accretion. For the most restrictive simulation that includes all the above seeding criteria for DCBH formation, the high-z $M_*-M_{\rm bh}$ relation falls significantly below the P23 relation (by factor of $\sim10$ at $z\sim4$). Only by excluding the spin and environment based criteria, and by assuming $\lesssim750~\mathrm{Myr}$ delay times between host galaxy mergers and subsequent BH mergers, are we able to reproduce the P23 relation. Overall, our results suggest that if high-z BHs are indeed systematically overmassive, assembling them would require more efficient heavy seeding channels, higher initial seed masses, additional contributions from lighter seeds to BH mergers, and / or more efficient modes for BH accretion.</description>

      <title>Modelling the evolution of the Galactic disc scale height traced by open clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. The scale height of the spatial distribution of open clusters (OCs) in the Milky Way exhibits a well known increase with age which is usually interpreted as evidence for dynamical heating of the disc or of the disc having been thicker in the past.
  Aims. We address the increase of the scale height with age of the OC population from a different angle. We propose that the apparent thickening of the disc can be largely explained as a consequence of a stronger disruption of OCs near the Galactic plane by disc phenomena, namely encounters with giant molecular clouds (GMCs).
  Methods. We present a computational model that forms OCs with different initial masses and follows their orbits while subjecting them to different disruption mechanisms. To setup the model and infer its parameters, we use and analyse a Gaia-based OC catalogue (Dias et al. 2021). We investigate both the spatial and age distributions of the OC population and discuss the completeness of the sample. The simulation results are then compared to the observations.
  Results. Consistent with previous studies, the observations reveal that the SH of the spatial distribution of OCs increases with age. We find that it is very likely that the OC sample is incomplete even for the solar neighbourhood. The model simulations successfully reproduce the SH increase with age and the total number of OCs that survive with age up to 1 Gyr. For older OCs, the predicted SH from the model starts deviating from the observations, although remaining within the uncertainties of the observations. This can be related with effects of incompleteness and/or simplifications in the model.
  Conclusions. A selective disruption of OCs near the galactic plane through GMC encounters is able to explain the SH evolution of the OC population.</description>

      <title>MagMar III -- Resisting the Pressure, Is the Magnetic Field Overwhelmed in NGC6334I?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on ALMA observations of polarized dust emission at 1.2 mm from NGC6334I, a source known for its significant flux outbursts. Between five months, our data show no substantial change in total intensity and a modest 8\% variation in linear polarization, suggesting a phase of stability or the conclusion of the outburst. The magnetic field, inferred from this polarized emission, displays a predominantly radial pattern from North-West to South-East with intricate disturbances across major cores, hinting at spiral structures. Energy analysis of CS$(J=5 \rightarrow 4)$ emission yields an outflow energy of approximately $3.5\times10^{45}$ ergs, aligning with previous interferometric studies. Utilizing the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi method, we determined magnetic field strengths ranging from 1 to 11 mG, averaging at 1.9 mG. This average increases to 4 $\pm 1$ mG when incorporating Zeeman measurements. Comparative analyses using gravitational, thermal, and kinetic energy maps reveal that magnetic energy is significantly weaker, possibly explaining the observed field morphology.
  We also find that the energy in the outflows and the expanding cometary {\HII} region is also larger than the magnetic energy, suggesting that protostellar feedback maybe the dominant driver behind the injection of turbulence in NGC6334I at the scales sampled by our data. The gas in NGC6334I predominantly exhibits supersonic and trans-Alfvenic conditions, transitioning towards a super-Alfvenic regime, underscoring a diminished influence of the magnetic field with increasing gas density. These observations are in agreement with prior polarization studies at 220 GHz, enriching our understanding of the dynamic processes in high-mass star-forming regions.</description>

      <title>Galaxy evolution in compact groups II. Witnessing the influence of major structures in their evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compact groups (CGs) of galaxies are extreme environments for morphological transformations and the cessation of star formation. Our objective is to understand the dynamics of CGs and how their surrounding environment impacts galaxy properties. We selected a sample of 340 CGs in the Stripe 82 region, totaling 1083 galaxies, and a control sample of 2281 field galaxies. We find that at least 27\% of our sample of CGs are part of major structures, i.e. non-isolated CGs. We find a bimodality in the effective radius ($R_e$)-S\'ersic index ($n$) plane for all transition galaxies (those with $(u-r) &gt; 2.3$ and $n&lt;2.5$) in CGs. Additionally, transition galaxies in isolated CGs populate more densely the $R_e-n$ plane for $n &lt; 1.75$. In contrast, transition galaxies in non-isolated CGs have smoothly increasing $n$ values, suggesting these galaxies have already suffered morphological transformation, and primarily contribute to the distribution of more compact galaxies in the $R_e-n$ plane for all transition galaxies in CGs. We also find significant differences in the specific star-formation rate (sSFR) distribution between the late-type galaxies (LTGs) ($(u-r)&lt;2.3$ and $n&lt; 2.5$) in non-isolated CGs and the same type of galaxies in the control sample, suggesting that the evolution of LTGs differs in non-isolated CGs. Early-type galaxies ($(u-r)&gt;2.3$ and $n&gt;2.5$) and transition galaxies in non-isolated CGs have lower sSFR values and a higher fraction of quenched galaxies, compared to those in isolated CGs. Based on our results, we propose an evolutionary scenario where the major structures in which the CGs are embedded accelerate the morphological transformations of their members. Our findings highlight the importance of considering the larger structures in which CGs may be located, when analysing the properties of their galaxy, as this can significantly affect the evolution of CGs and their galaxies.</description>

      <title>Faraday tomography of LoTSS-DR2 data: III. Revealing the Local Bubble and the complex of local interstellar clouds in the high-latitude inner Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a new mosaic created with the second release of LOFAR Two-Metre Sky Survey data (LoTSS-DR2), which probes polarised synchrotron emission in the high-latitude inner Galaxy. Our objective is to characterise the observed emission through multi-tracer analysis to better understand the volume and the structures that may be observed with LOFAR. Furthermore, we exploit Faraday depth as a unique tool to probe the diffuse magnetised structure in the local ISM. We produced a mosaic Faraday cube of LoTSS-DR2 data by applying a rotation measure synthesis algorithm. From the cube, we constructed Faraday moment maps to characterise the nature of spectra. Additionally, we quantified the linear depolarisation canals using the Rolling Hough transform and used them to search for alignment with other data sets. Utilising LoTSS-DR2 observations alongside complementary data sets including Planck polarisation data, HI emission maps, and starlight polarisation measurements, we estimated the distance to the Faraday structures. The Faraday cube reveals an ordered structure across two-thirds of the observed area, whose orientation aligns well with that of both the HI filaments and the magnetic field. We estimate the minimum distance to the Faraday structures to be between 40 and 80 pc, which puts them in the vicinity of the Local Bubble wall. The emission is organised in a large gradient in Faraday depth whose origin we associate with the curved wall of the Local Bubble. Comparing our data with a model of the Local Bubble wall, we conclude that we might be probing a contribution of the medium inside the Local Bubble cavity as well, corresponding to the complex of local interstellar clouds. Moreover, we propose a toy model incorporating an ionised front of finite thickness into the Local Bubble wall, as a curved, cold neutral shell alone is insufficient to produce the observed gradient.</description>

Abstract: Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope will revolutionize our understanding of the Galactic Bulge with its Galactic Bulge Time Domain survey. At the same time, Rubin Observatories's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will monitor billions of stars in the Milky Way. The proposed Roman survey of the Galactic Plane, with its NIR passbands and exquisite spacial resolution, promises groundbreaking insights for a wide range of time-domain galactic astrophysics. In this white paper, we describe the scientific returns possible from the combination of the Roman Galactic Plane Survey with the data from LSST.</description>

      <title>Finding dusty AGNs from the JWST CEERS survey with mid-infrared photometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nature of the interaction between active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and their host galaxies remains an unsolved question. Therefore, conducting an AGN census is valuable to AGN research. Nevertheless, a significant fraction of AGNs are obscured by their environment, which blocks UV and optical emissions due to the dusty torus surrounding the central supermassive black hole (SMBH). To overcome this challenge, mid-infrared (IR) surveys have emerged as a valuable tool for identifying obscured AGNs, as the obscured light is re-emitted in this range. With its high sensitivity, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) uncovered more fainter objects than previous telescopes. By applying the SED fitting, this work investigates AGN candidates in JWST Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science (CEERS) fields. We identified 42 candidates, 30 of them are classified as composites ($0.2\leq f_{\rm AGN, IR}&lt; 0.5$), and 12 of them are AGNs ($f_{\rm AGN, IR}\geq 0.5$). We report the AGN luminosity contributions and AGN number fractions as a function of redshift and total infrared luminosity, showing that previously reported increasing relations are not apparent in our sample due to the sample size. We also extend the previous results on ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs, $L_{\rm TIR}\geq 10^{12} L_{\odot}$) to less luminous AGNs, highlighting the power of JWST.</description>

      <title>J0011+3217: A peculiar radio galaxy with one-sided secondary lobe and misaligned giant primary lobes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From the LOFAR Two-meter Sky Survey second data release (LoTSS DR2) at 144 MHz, we identified a peculiar radio galaxy, J0011+3217. It has a large, one-sided diffuse secondary wing that stretches up to 0.85 Mpc (roughly 85\% of the primary lobe). The linear size of the primary lobe of the galaxy is 0.99 Mpc. This peculiar source is a giant radio galaxy with a misaligned primary lobe. An optical galaxy resides at 16 kpc (7 arcsec) linear distance from the host active galactic nucleus (AGN) of J0011+3217. J0011+3217 has a radio luminosity of $1.65\times 10^{26}$ W Hz$^{-1}$ at 144 MHz with a spectral index of $-0.80$ between 144 and 607 MHz. J0011+3217 is located 1.2 Mpc away from the center of the Abell 7 cluster. The Abell 7 cluster has a redshift of 0.104 and a mass ($M_{500}$) of 3.71 $\times 10^{14}$ M$_\odot$. The cluster is associated with strong X-ray emission. To study the X-ray emission around the cluster and from the region surrounding J0011+3217, we present an XMM-Newton image of J0011+3217, and we analyse the velocity structure and spatial distribution of galaxies in the cluster, showing that J0011+3217 inhabits an offset group of galaxies that are moving with respect to Abell 7. The off-axis distortion or bending of the primary lobe of J0011+3217 in the outer edges has a strong effect on the relative motion of the surrounding medium that causes the bending of the jets in the opposite direction of the cluster (like WAT sources). The current paper suggests that the morphology of J0011+3217 is influenced by ram pressure created due to the Abell 7 cluster, highlighting the complex interactions between the source and the surrounding cluster environment.</description>

      <title>Advancing Galaxy Analysis: AI-Powered Detection and Segmentation of Edge-On Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Edge-on galaxies have many important applications in galactic astrophysics, but they can be difficult to identify in vast amounts of astronomical data. To facilitate the search for them, we have developed a deep learning algorithm designed to identify and extract edge-on galaxies from astronomical images. We utilised a sample of edge-on spiral galaxies from the Galaxy Zoo database, retrieving the corresponding images from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Our dataset comprises approximately $16,000$ galaxies, which we used to train the YOLOv5 algorithm for detection purposes. To isolate galaxies from their backgrounds, we trained the SCSS-Net neural network to generate segmentation masks. As a result, our algorithm detected $8,000$ edge-on galaxies, for which we compiled a catalogue including their parameters obtained from the SDSS database. We describe the basic properties of our sample, finding that most galaxies have redshifts $0.02&lt;z&lt;0.10$, have low values of $b/a$ and are mostly red, which is expected from edge-on galaxies and is consistent with our training sample, as well as other literature. The cutouts of the detected galaxies can be used for future studies and the algorithm can be applied to data from future surveys as well.</description>

      <title>Elucidating Galaxy Population Properties Using a Model-Free Analysis of Quadruply Imaged Quasar Lenses From Large Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The population of strong lensing galaxies is a sub-set of intermediate-redshift massive galaxies, whose population-level properties are not yet well understood. In the near future, thousands of multiply imaged systems are expected to be discovered by wide-field surveys like Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) and Euclid. With the soon-to-be robust population of quadruply lensed quasars, or quads, in mind, we introduce a novel technique to elucidate the empirical distribution of the galaxy population properties. Our re-imagining of the prevailing strong lensing analysis does not fit mass models to individual lenses, but instead starts with parametric models of many galaxy populations, which include generally ignored mass distribution complexities and exclude external shear for now. We construct many mock galaxy populations with different properties and obtain populations of quads from each of them. The mock `observed' population of quads is then compared to those from the mocks using a model-free analysis based on a 3D sub-space of directly observable quad image properties. The distance between two quad populations in the space of image properties is measured by a metric $\eta$, and the distance between their parent galaxy populations in the space of galaxy properties is measured by $\zeta$. We find a well defined relation between $\eta$ and $\zeta$. The discovered relation between the space of image properties and the space of galaxy properties allows for the observed galaxy population properties to be estimated from the properties of their quads, which will be conducted in a future paper.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When a structure displays dependence on distance and azimuthal angle from a center (for example the spiral arms of galaxies or the diffraction spikes of stars), projecting the pixels to polar coordinates greatly simplifies their study. This projection from one pixel grid to another is known as a "polar plot". For this purpose, a new option has been added to the GNU Astronomy Utilities (Gnuastro) in version 0.23 to "astscript-radial-profile" script, which we describe in this research note. The figures of this research note are reproducible with Maneage, on the Git commit 5d34243.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Lyman-$\alpha$ emissions from reionization fronts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During reionization, intergalactic ionization fronts (I-fronts) are sources of Ly$\alpha$ line radiation produced by collisional excitation of hydrogen atoms within the fronts. In principle, detecting this emission could provide direct evidence for a reionizing intergalactic medium (IGM). In this paper, we use a suite of high-resolution one-dimensional radiative transfer simulations run on cosmological density fields to quantify the parameter space of I-front Ly$\alpha$ emission. We find that the Ly$\alpha$ production efficiency -- the ratio of emitted Ly$\alpha$ flux to incident ionizing flux driving the front -- depends mainly on the I-front speed and the spectral index of the ionizing radiation. IGM density fluctuations on scales smaller than the typical I-front width produce scatter in the efficiency, but they do not significantly boost its mean value. The Ly$\alpha$ flux emitted by an I-front is largest if 3 conditions are met simultaneously: (1) the incident ionizing flux is large; (2) the incident spectrum is hard, consisting of more energetic photons; (3) the I-front is traveling through a cosmological over-density, which causes it to propagate more slowly. We present a convenient parameterization of the efficiency in terms of I-front speed and incident spectral index. We make these results publicly available as an interpolation table and we provide a simple fitting function for a representative ionizing background spectrum. Our results can be applied as a sub-grid model for I-front Ly$\alpha$ emissions in reionization simulations with spatial and/or temporal resolutions too coarse to resolve I-front structure. In a companion paper, we use our results to explore the possibility of directly imaging Ly$\alpha$ emission around neutral islands during the last phases of reionization.</description>

      <title>Imaging reionization's last phases with I-front Lyman-$\alpha$ emissions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long troughs observed in the $z &gt; 5.5$ Ly$\alpha$ and Ly$\beta$ forests are thought to be caused by the last remaining neutral patches during the end phases of reionization -- termed neutral islands. If this is true, then the longest troughs mark locations where we are most likely to observe the reionizing intergalactic medium (IGM). A key feature of the neutral islands is that they are bounded by ionization fronts (I-fronts) which emit Lyman series lines. In this paper, we explore the possibility of directly imaging the outline of neutral islands with a narrowband survey targeting Ly$\alpha$. In a companion paper, we quantified the intensity of I-front Ly$\alpha$ emissions during reionization and its dependence on the spectrum of incident ionizing radiation and I-front speed. Here we apply those results to reionization simulations to model the emissions from neutral islands. We find that neutral islands would appear as diffuse structures that are tens of comoving Mpc across, with surface brightnesses in the range $\approx 1 - 5\times 10^{-21}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ arcsec$^{-2}$. The islands are brighter if the spectrum of ionizing radiation driving the I-fronts is harder, and/or if the I-fronts are moving faster. We develop mock observations for current and futuristic observatories and find that, while extremely challenging, detecting neutral islands is potentially within reach of an ambitious observing program with wide-field narrowband imaging. Our results demonstrate the potentially high impact of low-surface brightness observations for studying reionization.</description>

Abstract: The chemical makeup of our solar system is a reflection of Galactic chemical evolution in the local interstellar medium (ISM) over the past ~9 Ga before the formation of the solar system. Although the incorporated ISM dust was mostly destroyed during the solar system formation, a small fraction of the ISM dust, known as presolar grains, is preserved in pristine extraterrestrial materials and identified through their exotic isotopic compositions, pointing to their formation in gas outflows or explosions of ancient stars. Since their stellar birth at more than 4.6 Ga, presolar grains have borne witness to a diverse array of astrophysical and cosmochemical processes. In this chapter, I will review recent progress in utilizing the isotopic and structural compositions of presolar grains to constrain physical mixing processes and dust formation in stars, stellar nucleosynthesis, ISM processes, and the origin and evolution of the solar system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The high luminosity of massive, early-type stars drives strong stellar winds through line scattering of the stars continuum radiation. Their momenta contribute substantially to the dynamics and energetics of the ambient interstellar medium in galaxies. The detailed multi-wavelength study of massive O-type and Wolf-Rayet binaries is essential to explore the hydrodynamics of the shocks formed in the stellar outflows and wind structure. Further, deep analysis of some of the interesting phenomena like particle acceleration and dust formation associated with hot stars winds provides a global view of stellar outflows. In this context, a few massive binaries have been explored using photometric and spectroscopic measurements in different wavebands. This paper highlights important insights gained from investigating massive binaries with several ground and space-based facilities.</description>

      <title>The importance of stochasticity in determining galaxy emissivities and UV LFs during cosmic dawn and reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stochastic nature of star formation and photon propagation in high-redshift galaxies can result in sizable galaxy-to-galaxy scatter in their properties. Ignoring this scatter by assuming mean quantities can bias estimates of their emissivity and corresponding observables. We construct a flexible, semi-empirical model, sampling scatter around the following mean relations: (i) the conditional halo mass function (CHMF); (ii) the stellar-to-halo mass relation (SHMR); (iii) galaxy star formation main sequence (SFMS); (iv) fundamental metallicity relation (FMR); (v) conditional intrinsic luminosity; and (vi) photon escape fraction. In our fiducial model, ignoring scatter in these galaxy properties overestimates the duration of the EoR, delaying its completion by up to $\Delta z$ ~ 2. We quantify the relative importance of each of the above sources of scatter in determining the ionizing, soft-band X-ray and Lyman Werner (LW) emissivities as a function of scale and redshift. We find that scatter around the SFMS is important for all bands, especially at the highest redshifts where the emissivity is dominated by the faintest, most "bursty" galaxies. Ignoring this scatter would underestimate the mean emissivity and its standard deviation computed over 5 cMpc regions by factors of up to $\sim$2-10 at $5&lt; z &lt; 15$. Scatter around the X-ray luminosity to star formation rate relation is important for determining X-ray emissivity, accounting for roughly half of its mean and standard deviation. The importance of scatter in the ionizing escape fraction depends on its functional form, while scatter around the SHMR contributes at the level of ~10-20%. Although scatter does flatten the UV luminosity functions, shifting the bright end by 1-2 magnitudes, the level of scatter in our fiducial model is insufficient to fully explain recent estimates from JWST photometry (consistent with previous studies).</description>

      <title>Search and Study of the Brightest Stars in the Galaxy IC 342</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have selected candidate massive stars in the galaxy IC 342 based on archival images from the Hubble Space Telescope and images from the 2 m telescope at the Natioal Astronomical Observatory Rozhen, Bulgaria. Spectral observations of 24 out of 27 selected stars are carried out with the 6 m BTA telescope at the SAO RAS and with the 3.5 m Apache Point Observatory telescope (USA) as part of the program for searching bright massive stars in galaxies outside the Local Group. Our analysis reveals that 12 objects have spectra lacking prominent features, except for the emission lines of the surrounding nebulae and are identified as single supergiants of classes O9 to F5 or spatially unresolved young compact clusters. One source with an absorption spectrum probably belongs to our Galaxy. The spectra of seven other objects show features typical of Wolf-Rayet stars or compact clusters containing Wolf-Rayet stars. Another source is a compact supernova remnant. Two other objects are tentatively classified as cold LBV candidates, and one object is classified as a B[e]-supergiant candidate.</description>

Abstract: The Dragonfly Spectral Line Mapper (DSLM) is a semi-autonomous, distributed-aperture based telescope design, featuring a modular setup of 120 Canon telephoto lenses, and equal numbers of ultra-narrowband filters, detectors, and other peripherals. Here we introduce the observatory software stack for this highly-distributed system. Its core is the Dragonfly Communication Protocol (DCP), a pure-Python hardware communication framework for standardized hardware interaction. On top of this are 120 REST-ful FastAPI web servers, hosted on Raspberry Pis attached to each unit, orchestrating command translation to the hardware and providing diagnostic feedback to a central control system running the global instrument control software. We discuss key features of this software suite, including docker containerization for environment management, class composition as a flexible framework for array commands, and a state machine algorithm which controls the telescope during autonomous observations.</description>

      <title>ALMA Lensing Cluster Survey: Deep 1.2 mm Number Counts and Infrared Luminosity Functions at $z\simeq1-8$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.01658v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a statistical study of 180 dust continuum sources identified in 33 massive cluster fields by the ALMA Lensing Cluster Survey (ALCS) over a total of 133 arcmin$^{2}$ area, homogeneously observed at 1.2 mm. ALCS enables us to detect extremely faint mm sources by lensing magnification, including near-infrared (NIR) dark objects showing no counterparts in existing {\it Hubble Space Telescope} and {\it Spitzer} images. The dust continuum sources belong to a blind sample ($N=141$) with S/N $\gtrsim$ 5.0 (a purity of $&gt;$ 0.99) or a secondary sample ($N=39$) with S/N= $4.0-5.0$ screened by priors. With the blind sample, we securely derive 1.2-mm number counts down to $\sim7$ $\mu$Jy, and find that the total integrated 1.2mm flux is 20.7$^{+8.5}_{-6.5}$ Jy deg$^{-2}$, resolving $\simeq$ 80 % of the cosmic infrared background light. The resolved fraction varies by a factor of $0.6-1.1$ due to the completeness correction depending on the spatial size of the mm emission. We also derive infrared (IR) luminosity functions (LFs) at $z=0.6-7.5$ with the $1/V_{\rm max}$ method, finding the redshift evolution of IR LFs characterized by positive luminosity and negative density evolution. The total (=UV+IR) cosmic star-formation rate density (SFRD) at $z&gt;4$ is estimated to be $161^{+25}_{-21}$ % of the established measurements, which were almost exclusively based on optical$-$NIR surveys. Although our general understanding of the cosmic SFRD is unlikely to change beyond a factor of 2, these results add to the weight of evidence for an additional ($\approx 60$ %) SFRD component contributed by the faint-mm population, including NIR dark objects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.07376v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have measured the mass of metals in the molecular gas in 13 submillimetre galaxies at z~4 in which the gas, based on previous observations, lies in a cold rotating disk. We measured the metal masses using either the submillimetre line or continuum emission from three tracers of the overall metal content - carbon atoms, carbon monoxide molecules and dust grains - using the first simultaneous calibration of all three tracers (Dunne et al. 2022). We obtain very similar mass estimates from the different tracers, which are similar to the entire metal content of a present-day massive early-type galaxy. We used the dynamical masses of these galaxies to set an upper limit on the mass of the molecular gas in each galaxy, allowing us to set a lower limit on the metal abundance in the gas, finding values for many of the galaxies well above the solar value. We use chemical evolution models to show that such high metal masses and abundances are what is expected shortly after the formation of a galaxy for a top-heavy IMF. We suggest a scenario for galaxy evolution in which massive galaxies reach a high metal abundance during their formation phase, which is then gradually reduced by dry mergers with lower mass galaxies. We use the chemical-evolution models to show that the metals in the outflows from massive early-type galaxies in their formation phase can quantitatively explain the long-standing puzzle that approximately 75% of the metals in clusters of galaxies is in the intracluster gas rather than in the galaxies.</description>

      <title>A Full Accounting of the Visible Mass in SDSS MaNGA Disk Galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.11422v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a study of the ratio of visible mass to total mass in spiral galaxies to better understand the relative amount of dark matter present in galaxies of different masses and evolutionary stages. Using the velocities of the H-alpha emission line measured in spectroscopic observations from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) MaNGA Data Release 17 (DR17), we evaluate the rotational velocity of over 5500 disk galaxies at their 90% elliptical Petrosian radii, R90. We compare this to the velocity expected from the total visible mass, which we compute from the stellar, HI, molecular hydrogen, and heavy metals and dust masses. Molecular hydrogen mass measurements are available for only a small subset of galaxies observed in SDSS MaNGA DR17, so we derive a parameterization of the molecular hydrogen mass as a function of absolute magnitude in the r band using galaxies observed as part of SDSS DR7. With these parameterizations, we calculate the fraction of visible mass within R90 that corresponds to the observed velocity. Based on statistically analyzing the likelihood of this fraction, we conclude that the null hypothesis (no dark matter) cannot be excluded at a confidence level better than 95% within the visible extent of the disk galaxies. We also find that when all mass components are included, the ratio of visible-to-total mass within the visible extent of star-forming disk galaxies increases with galaxy luminosity.</description>

      <title>Astrophysical and relativistic modeling of the recoiling black-hole candidate in quasar 3C 186</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08740v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The compact object in quasar 3C 186 is one of the most promising recoiling black-hole candidates, exhibiting both an astrometric displacement between the quasar and the host galaxy as well as a spectroscopic shift between broad and narrow lines. 3C 186 also presents a radio jet which, when projected onto the plane of the sky, appears to be perpendicular to the quasar/galaxy displacement. Assuming a gravitational-wave kick is indeed responsible for the properties of 3C 186 and using state-of-the-art relativistic modeling, we show that current observations allow for exquisite modeling of the recoiling black hole. Most notably, we find that the kick velocity, the black-hole spin, and the line of sight are almost collinear and the former appear perpendicular to each other only because of a strong projection effect. The targeted configuration requires substantial fine-tuning: while there exists a region in the black-hole binary parameter space that is compatible with 3C 186, the observed system appears to be a rare occurrence. Using archival radio observations, we explore different strategies that could potentially confirm or rule out our interpretation. In particular, we develop two observational tests that rely on the brightness ratio between the approaching and receding jet as well as the asymmetry of the jet lobes. While the available radio data provide loose constraints, deeper observations have the unique potential of unveiling the nature of 3C 186.</description>

Abstract: Observed evolution of the total mass distribution with redshift is crucial to testing galaxy evolution theories. To measure the total mass distribution, strong gravitational lenses complement the resolved dynamical observations currently limited to $z \lesssim 0.5$. Here we present the lens models for a pilot sample of seven galaxy-scale lenses from the ASTRO3D Galaxy Evolution with Lenses (AGEL) survey. The AGEL lenses, modeled using HST/WFC3-F140W images with Gravitational Lens Efficient Explorer (GLEE) software, have deflector redshifts between $0.3 &lt; z_{\rm defl} &lt; 0.9$. Assuming a power-law density profile with slope $\gamma$, we measure the total density profile for the deflector galaxies via lens modeling. We also measure the stellar velocity dispersions ($\sigma_{\rm obs}$) for four lenses and obtain $\sigma_{\rm obs}$ from SDSS-BOSS for the remaining lenses to test our lens models by comparing observed and model-predicted velocity dispersions. For the seven AGEL lenses, we measure an average density profile slope of $-1.95 \pm 0.09$ and a $\gamma$--$z$ relation that does not evolve with redshift at $z&lt;1$. Although our result is consistent with some observations and simulations, it differs from other studies at $z&lt;1$ that suggest the $\gamma$--$z$ relation evolves with redshift. The apparent conflicts among observations and simulations may be due to a combination of 1) systematics in the lensing and dynamical modeling; 2) challenges in comparing observations with simulations; and 3) assuming a simple power-law for the total mass distribution. By providing more lenses at $z_{\rm defl} &gt; 0.5$, the AGEL survey will provide stronger constraints on whether the mass profiles evolve with redshift as predicted by current theoretical models.</description>

      <title>A new scale in the quasi-static limit of Aether Scalar Tensor Theory</title>

Abstract: One of the aims of Aether Scalar Tensor Theory (AeST) is to reproduce the successes of Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) on galactic scales. Indeed, the quasi-static limit of AeST achieves precisely this, assuming that the vector field $\vec{A}$ vanishes and that the so-called ghost condensate can be neglected. The effects of the ghost condensate were investigated in detail in previous studies. Here, we focus on the assumption of a vanishing vector field. We argue that this assumption is not always justified and show how to correctly take into account the vector field, finding that the quasi-static limit depends on a model parameter $m_\times$. In the limit $m_\times \to 0$, one recovers the quasi-static limit with a vanishing vector field. In particular, one finds a two-field version of MOND. In the opposite limit, $m_\times \to \infty$, one finds a single-field version of MOND. We show that, in practice, much of the phenomenology of the quasi-static limit depends only very little on the value of $m_\times$. Still, for some observational tests, such as those involving wide binaries, $m_\times$ has percent-level effects that may be important.</description>

      <title>The Santa Barbara Binary-Disk Code Comparison</title>

Abstract: We have performed numerical calculations of a binary interacting with a gas disk, using eleven different numerical methods and a standard binary-disk setup. The goal of this study is to determine whether all codes agree on a numerically converged solution, and to determine the necessary resolution for convergence and the number of binary orbits that must be computed to reach an agreed-upon relaxed state of the binary-disk system. We find that all codes can agree on a converged solution (depending on the diagnostic being measured). The zone spacing required for most codes to reach a converged measurement of the torques applied to the binary by the disk is roughly 1% of the binary separation in the vicinity of the binary components. For our disk model to reach a relaxed state, codes must be run for at least 200 binary orbits, corresponding to about a viscous time for our parameters, $0.2 (a^2 \Omega_B /\nu)$ binary orbits, where $\nu$ is the kinematic viscosity. We did not investigate dependence on binary mass ratio, eccentricity, disk temperature, or disk viscosity; therefore, these benchmarks may act as guides towards expanding converged solutions to the wider parameter space but might need to be updated in a future study that investigates dependence on system parameters. We find the most major discrepancies between codes resulted from the dimensionality of the setup (3D vs 2D disks). Beyond this, we find good agreement in the total torque on the binary between codes, although the partition of this torque between the gravitational torque, orbital accretion torque, and spin accretion torque depends sensitively on the sink prescriptions employed. In agreement with previous studies, we find a modest difference in torques and accretion variability between 2D and 3D disk models. We find cavity precession rates to be appreciably faster in 3D than in 2D.</description>
