      <title>Tensor Train Completion from Fiberwise Observations Along a Single Mode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tensor completion is an extension of matrix completion aimed at recovering a multiway data tensor by leveraging a given subset of its entries (observations) and the pattern of observation. The low-rank assumption is key in establishing a relationship between the observed and unobserved entries of the tensor. The low-rank tensor completion problem is typically solved using numerical optimization techniques, where the rank information is used either implicitly (in the rank minimization approach) or explicitly (in the error minimization approach). Current theories concerning these techniques often study probabilistic recovery guarantees under conditions such as random uniform observations and incoherence requirements. However, if an observation pattern exhibits some low-rank structure that can be exploited, more efficient algorithms with deterministic recovery guarantees can be designed by leveraging this structure. This work shows how to use only standard linear algebra operations to compute the tensor train decomposition of a specific type of ``fiber-wise" observed tensor, where some of the fibers of a tensor (along a single specific mode) are either fully observed or entirely missing, unlike the usual entry-wise observations. From an application viewpoint, this setting is relevant when it is easier to sample or collect a multiway data tensor along a specific mode (e.g., temporal). The proposed completion method is fast and is guaranteed to work under reasonable deterministic conditions on the observation pattern. Through numerical experiments, we showcase interesting applications and use cases that illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>A mixed formulation for the fractional Poisson problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mixed formulation of the classical Poisson problem introduces the flux as an additional variable, leading to a system of coupled equations. Using fractional calculus identities, in this work we explore a mixed formulation of the fractional Poisson problem and establish its well-posedness. Since a direct discretization of this problem appears to be out of reach, we adapt a stabilized approach by Hughes and Masud, which yields a coercive and well-posed formulation. The coercivity ensures the stability of any conforming finite element discretization. We further prove the convergence of this discretization, derive convergence rates, and discuss implementation aspects. Finally, we present numerical experiments that highlight both the importance of stabilization and the accuracy of our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>ff-bifbox: A scalable, open-source toolbox for bifurcation analysis of nonlinear PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear PDEs give rise to complex dynamics that are often difficult to analyze in state space due to their relatively large numbers of degrees of freedom, ill-conditioned operators, and changing spatial and parameter resolution requirements. This work introduces ff-bifbox: a new open-source toolbox for performing numerical branch tracing, stability/bifurcation analysis, resolvent analysis, and time integration of large, time-dependent nonlinear PDEs discretized on adaptively refined meshes in two and three spatial dimensions. Spatial discretization is handled using finite elements in FreeFEM, with the discretized operators manipulated in a distributed framework via PETSc. Following a summary of the underlying theory and numerics, results from three examples are presented to validate the implementation and demonstrate its capabilities. The considered examples, which are provided with runnable ff-bifbox code, include: a 3-D Brusselator system, a 3-D plate buckling system, and a 2-D compressible Navier--Stokes system. In addition to reproducing results from prior studies, novel results are presented for each system.</description>

      <title>A new cross approximation for Tucker tensors and its application in Tucker-Anderson Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes two new algorithms related to the Tucker tensor format. The first method is a new cross approximation for Tucker tensors, which we call Cross$^2$-DEIM. Cross$^2$-DEIM is an iterative method that uses a fiber sampling strategy, sampling $O(r)$ fibers in each mode, where $r$ denotes the target rank. The fibers are selected based on the discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM). Cross$^2$-DEIM resemblances the Fiber Sampling Tucker Decomposition (FSTD)2 approximation, and has favorable computational scaling compared to existing methods in the literature. We demonstrate good performance of Cross$^2$-DEIM in terms of iteration count and intermediate memory. First we design a fast direct Poisson solver based on Cross$^2$-DEIM and the fast Fourier transform. This solver can be used as a stand alone or as a preconditioner for low-rank solvers for elliptic problems.
  The second method is a low-rank solver for nonlinear tensor equation in Tucker format by Anderson acceleration (AA), which we call Tucker-AA. Tucker-AA is an extension of low-rank AA (lrAA) proposed in our prior work for low-rank solution to nonlinear matrix equation. We apply Cross$^2$-DEIM with warm-start in Tucker-AA to deal with the nonlinearity in the equation. We apply low-rank operations in AA, and by an appropriate rank truncation strategy, we are able to control the intermediate rank growth. We demonstrated the performance for Tucker-AA for approximate solutions nonlinear PDEs in 3D.</description>

      <title>Skew Gradient Embedding for Thermodynamically Consistent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel Skew Gradient Embedding (SGE) framework for systematically reformulating thermodynamically consistent partial differential equation (PDE) models-capturing both reversible and irreversible processes-as generalized gradient flows. These models include a wide spectrum of models in classical electrodynamics, fluid mechanics, quantum mechanics, rheology of complex fluids, solid mechanics, and statistical physics. Exploiting the intrinsic structure of generalized gradient flow models, especially, the skew symmetric component expressed by the exterior 2-form, we develop a unified stabilization strategy for constructing numerical schemes that either preserve the energy dissipation rate or ensure discrete energy stability. This stabilization strategy enables the design of both first- and second-order schemes, highlighting the flexibility and generality of the SGE approach in algorithm development. A key strength of SGE is its flexible treatment of skew-gradient (zero-energy-contribution) terms arising from reversible dynamics either implicitly or explicitly. While treated explicitly, it often leads to a natural decoupling of the governing equations in multiphysics systems, thereby improving computational efficiency without compromising stability or accuracy. Numerical experiments confirm the robustness, accuracy, and performance advantages of the proposed schemes.</description>

      <title>Optimality of quasi-Monte Carlo methods and suboptimality of the sparse-grid Gauss--Hermite rule in Gaussian Sobolev spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimality of several quasi-Monte Carlo methods and suboptimality of the sparse-grid quadrature based on the univariate Gauss--Hermite rule is proved in the Sobolev spaces of mixed dominating smoothness of order $\alpha$, where the optimality is in the sense of worst-case convergence rate. For sparse-grid Gauss--Hermite quadrature, lower and upper bounds are established, with rates coinciding up to a logarithmic factor. The dominant rate is found to be only $N^{-\alpha/2}$ with $N$ function evaluations, although the optimal rate is known to be $N^{-\alpha}(\ln N)^{(d-1)/2}$. The lower bound is obtained by exploiting the structure of the Gauss--Hermite nodes and is independent of the quadrature weights; consequently, no modification of the weights can improve the rate $N^{-\alpha/2}$. In contrast, several quasi-Monte Carlo methods with a change of variables are shown to achieve the optimal rate, some up to, and one including, the logarithmic factor.</description>

      <title>Novel Adaptive Schemes for Hyperbolic Conservation Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce new adaptive schemes for the one- and two-dimensional hyperbolic systems of conservation laws. Our schemes are based on an adaption strategy recently introduced in [{\sc S. Chu, A. Kurganov, and I. Menshov}, Appl. Numer. Math., 209 (2025)]. As there, we use a smoothness indicator (SI) to automatically detect ``rough'' parts of the solution and employ in those areas the second-order finite-volume low-dissipation central-upwind scheme with an overcompressive limiter, which helps to sharply resolve nonlinear shock waves and linearly degenerate contact discontinuities. In smooth parts, we replace the limited second-order scheme with a quasi-linear fifth-order (in space and third-order in time) finite-difference scheme, recently proposed in [{\sc V. A. Kolotilov, V. V. Ostapenko, and N. A. Khandeeva}, Comput. Math. Math. Phys., 65 (2025)]. However, direct application of this scheme may generate spurious oscillations near ``rough'' parts, while excessive use of the overcompressive limiter may cause staircase-like nonphysical structures in smooth areas. To address these issues, we employ the same SI to distinguish contact discontinuities, treated with the overcompressive limiter, from other ``rough'' regions, where we switch to the dissipative Minmod2 limiter. Advantage of the resulting adaptive schemes are clearly demonstrated on a number of challenging numerical examples.</description>

      <title>A Divergence-free Preserving Mixed Finite Element Method for Thermally Driven Active Fluid Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this report, we propose a divergence-free preserving mixed finite element method (FEM) for the system of nonlinear fourth-order thermally driven active fluid equations. By introducing two auxiliary variables, we lower the complexity of the model and enhance the robustness of the algorithm. The auxiliary variable $w = \Delta u$ is used to convert the original fourth-order system to an equivalent system of second-order equations, thereby easing the regularity constraints imposed on standard $H^2$-conforming finite element space. The second variable $\eta$, analogous to the pressure, helps the scheme preserve the divergence-free condition arising from the model. The two-step Dahlquist-Liniger-Nevanlinna (DLN) time integrator, unconditionally non-linear stable and second-order accurate under non-uniform time grids, is combined with the mixed FEM for fully discrete approximation. Due to the fine properties of the DLN scheme, we prove the boundedness of model energy and the associated error estimates under suitable regularity assumptions and mild time restrictions. Additionally, an adaptive time-stepping strategy based on a minimum-dissipation criterion is to balance computational costs and time efficiency. Several numerical experiments validate the theoretical findings and demonstrate the method's effectiveness and accuracy in simulating complex active fluid dynamics.</description>

      <title>Regularity estimate and sparse approximation of pathwise robust Duncan-Mortensen-Zakai equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish an \textit{a priori} estimate for arbitrary-order derivatives of the solution to the pathwise robust Duncan-Mortensen-Zakai (DMZ) equation within the framework of weighted Sobolev spaces. The weight function, which vanishes on the physical boundary, is crucial for the \textit{a priori} estimate, but introduces a loss of regularity near the boundary. Therefore, we employ the Sobolev inequalities and their weighted analogues to sharpen the regularity bound, providing improvements in both classical Sobolev spaces and H{\"o}lder continuity estimates. The refined regularity estimate reinforces the plausibility of the quantized tensor train (QTT) method in [S. Li, Z. Wang, S. S.-T. Yau, and Z. Zhang, IEEE Trans. Automat. Control, 68 (2023), pp. 4405--4412] and provides convergence guarantees of the method. To further enhance the capacity of the method to solve the nonlinear filtering problem in a real-time manner, we reduce the complexity of the method under the assumption of a functional polyadic state drift $f$ and observation $h$. Finally, we perform numerical simulations to reaffirm our theory. For high-dimensional cubic sensor problems, our method demonstrates superior efficiency and accuracy in comparison to the particle filter (PF) and the extended Kalman filter (EKF). Beyond this, for multi-mode problems, while the PF exhibits a lack of precision due to its stochastic nature and the EKF is constrained by its Gaussian assumption, the enhanced method provides an accurate reconstruction of the multi-mode conditional density function.</description>

      <title>A noise-robust Monte Carlo method for electric field calculations in EMC3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the main codes to analyze and optimize stellarator configurations is the EMC3 code, which implements a state-of-the-art 3D Monte Carlo plasma edge transport code. However, so far, a self-consistent treatment of the E x B drift is absent. This plasma drift is known to significantly impact the particle and heat distribution in the plasma edge. It is desirable to incorporate this drift into EMC3 to improve the predictive capabilities of the code. The calculation of the E x B drift requires the approximation of the electric field E, which is proportional to the gradient of the electric potential $ \varphi $. In previous work, the gradient was calculated with a least squares method based on a finite difference approximation of the electric potential. However, due to the stochastic nature of EMC3, the output plasma fields computed by the code are inherently noisy. The finite difference method further amplifies the noise, with the amplification growing as the grid size decreases. We continue from, which introduced a new noise-robust method for 1D derivatives. We extend the noise-robust method to 2D and apply it to the electric potential. We show that a PDE can be derived that describes the evolution of the electric field in case of a uniform diffusion coefficient. This PDE allows us to approximate the electric field directly with a Monte Carlo simulation, thus avoiding the need for a finite difference approximation. We illustrate the accuracy of the method and the noise robustness with a test case.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of a potential parameter in time-fractional diffusion problems via a Kohn--Vogelius type functional: Theoretical aspects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Of concern is the problem of reconstructing a space-dependent potential from boundary observations in the Caputo time-fractional diffusion equation, utilizing a stable and robust recovery method. We develop an algorithm to minimize the Kohn-Vogelius (KV) cost function, which measures the difference between the solutions of two excitations. The inverse potential problem is recast into an optimization problem, where the objective is to minimize a Kohn-Vogelius-type functional within a set of admissible potentials. We establish the well-posedness of this optimization problem by proving the existence and uniqueness of a minimizer and demonstrating its stability with respect to perturbations in the boundary data. Furthermore, we analyze the Fr\'echet differentiability of the KV functional and prove the Lipschitz continuity of its gradient. These theoretical results enable the development of a convergent conjugate gradient algorithm for numerical reconstruction. The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method are confirmed through several numerical examples in both one and two dimensions, including cases with noisy data.</description>

      <title>RGDBEK: Randomized Greedy Double Block Extended Kaczmarz Algorithm with Hybrid Parallel Implementation and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kaczmarz is one of the most prominent iterative solvers for linear systems of equations. Despite substantial research progress in recent years, the state-of-the-art Kaczmarz algorithms have not fully resolved the seesaw effect, a major impediment to convergence stability. Furthermore, while there have been advances in parallelizing the inherently sequential Kaczmarz method, no existing architecture effectively supports initialization-independent parallelism that fully leverages both CPU and GPU resources. This paper proposes the Randomized Greedy Double Block Extended Kaczmarz (RGDBEK) algorithm, a novel Kaczmarz approach designed for efficient large-scale linear system solutions. RGDBEK employs a randomized selection strategy for column and row blocks based on residual-derived probability distributions, thereby mitigating the traditional seesaw effect and enhancing convergence robustness. Theoretical analysis establishes linear convergence of the method under standard assumptions. Extensive numerical experiments on synthetic random matrices and real-world sparse matrices from the SuiteSparse collection demonstrate that RGDBEK outperforms existing Kaczmarz variants, including GRK, FDBK, FGBK, and GDBEK, in both iteration counts and computational time. In addition, a hybrid parallel CPU-GPU implementation utilizing optimized sparse matrix-vector multiplications via the state-of-the-art storage format improves scalability and performance on large sparse problems. Applications in finite element discretizations, image deblurring, and noisy population modeling demonstrate the algorithm's versatility and effectiveness. Future work will explore extending RGDBEK to tensor systems, optimizing parallel parameter selection, and reducing communication overhead to further enhance efficiency and applicability.</description>

      <title>Variational PINNs with tree-based integration and boundary element data in the modeling of multi-phase architected materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The current contribution develops a Variational Physics-Informed Neural Network (VPINN)-based framework for the analysis and design of multiphase architected solids. The elaborated VPINN methodology is based on the Petrov-Galerkin approach, with a deep neural network acting as trial function and local polynomials as test functions. For the analysis, a Galerkin Boundary Element Method (GBEM) scheme is developed to generate the mechanical field data, employing solely domain boundary information. The VPINN methodology is complemented by an adaptive, tree-based integration scheme for the evaluation of the weak-form integrals. Different double-phase material architectures are considered, with the VPINNs demonstrating their ability to capture the deformation fields with considerable accuracy. Moreover, the performance enhancement by the incorporation of additional semi-analytical information at auxiliary internal points is analyzed. Tree-based integration schemes are shown to be capable of robustly capturing inner material discontinuities upon substantial computational cost reductions. The results suggest that the proposed VPINN formulation offers comparative advantages in the modeling of multiphase architected materials compared to classical PINN formulations. The analysis paves the way for the development of variational physics-informed computational models for the mechanical analysis of complex architected multiphase materials and structures.</description>

      <title>On the uniqueness of the discrete Calderon problem on multi-dimensional lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the discrete Calder\'{o}n problem on grid graphs of dimension three or higher, formed by hypercubic structures. The discrete Calder\'{o}n problem is concerned with determining whether the discrete Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DtN) operator, which links boundary potentials to boundary current responses, can uniquely identify the conductivity values on the graph edges. We provide an affirmative answer to the question, thereby extending the classical uniqueness result of Curtis and Morrow for two-dimensional square lattices. The proof employs a novel slicing technique that decomposes the problem into lower-dimensional components. Additionally, we support the theoretical finding with numerical experiments that illustrate the effectiveness of the approach.</description>

      <title>Fast Linear Solvers via AI-Tuned Markov Chain Monte Carlo-based Matrix Inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large, sparse linear systems are pervasive in modern science and engineering, and Krylov subspace solvers are an established means of solving them. Yet convergence can be slow for ill-conditioned matrices, so practical deployments usually require preconditioners. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)-based matrix inversion can generate such preconditioners and accelerate Krylov iterations, but its effectiveness depends on parameters whose optima vary across matrices; manual or grid search is costly. We present an AI-driven framework recommending MCMC parameters for a given linear system. A graph neural surrogate predicts preconditioning speed from $A$ and MCMC parameters. A Bayesian acquisition function then chooses the parameter sets most likely to minimise iterations. On a previously unseen ill-conditioned system, the framework achieves better preconditioning with 50\% of the search budget of conventional methods, yielding about a 10\% reduction in iterations to convergence. These results suggest a route for incorporating MCMC-based preconditioners into large-scale systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This tutorial paper introduces quantum approaches to Monte Carlo computation with applications in computational finance. We outline the basics of quantum computing using Grover's algorithm for unstructured search to build intuition. We then move slowly to amplitude estimation problems and applications to counting and Monte Carlo integration, again using Grover-type iterations. A hands-on Python/Qiskit implementation illustrates these concepts applied to finance. The paper concludes with a discussion on current challenges in scaling quantum simulation techniques.</description>

      <title>3D Blocking for Matrix-free Smoothers in 2D Variable-Viscosity Stokes Equations with Applications to Geodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the design, implementation, and evaluation of optimized matrix-free stencil kernels for multigrid smoothing in the incompressible Stokes equations with variable viscosity, motivated by geophysical flow problems. We investigate five smoother variants derived from different optimisation strategies: Red-Black Gauss-Seidel, Jacobi, fused Jacobi, blocked fused Jacobi, and a novel Jacobi smoother with RAS-type temporal blocking, a strategy that applies local iterations on overlapping tiles to improve cache reuse. To ensure correctness, we introduce an energy-based residual norm that balances velocity and pressure contributions, and validate all implementations using a high-contrast sinker benchmark representative of realistic geodynamic numerical models. Our performance study on NVIDIA GH200 Grace Hopper nodes of the ALPS supercomputer demonstrates that all smoothers scale well within a single NUMA domain, but the RAS-Jacobi smoother consistently achieves the best performance at higher core counts. It sustains over 90% weak-scaling efficiency up to 64 cores and delivers up to a threefold speedup compared to the C++ Jacobi baseline, owing to improved cache reuse and reduced memory traffic. These results show that temporal blocking, already employed in distributed-memory solvers to reduce communication, can also provide substantial benefits at the socket and NUMA level. This work highlights the importance of cache-aware stencil design for harnessing modern heterogeneous architectures and lays the groundwork for extending RAS-type temporal blocking strategies to three-dimensional problems and GPU accelerators.</description>

      <title>Analysis and systematic discretization of a Fokker-Planck equation with Lorentz force</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.01937v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The propagation of charged particles through a scattering medium in the presence of a magnetic field can be described by a Fokker-Planck equation with Lorentz force. This model is studied both, from a theoretical and a numerical point of view. A particular trace estimate is derived for the relevant function spaces to clarify the meaning of boundary values. Existence of a weak solution is then proven by the Rothe method. In the second step of our investigations, a fully practical discretization scheme is proposed based on an implicit Euler method for the energy variable and a spherical-harmonics finite-element discretization with respect to the remaining variables. A complete error analysis of the resulting scheme is given and numerical test are presented to illustrate the theoretical results and the performance of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>High-order finite element methods for three-dimensional multicomponent convection-diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17390v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive and analyze a broad class of finite element methods for numerically simulating the stationary, low Reynolds number flow of concentrated mixtures of several distinct chemical species in a common thermodynamic phase. The underlying partial differential equations that we discretize are the Stokes$\unicode{x2013}$Onsager$\unicode{x2013}$Stefan$\unicode{x2013}$Maxwell (SOSM) equations, which model bulk momentum transport and multicomponent diffusion within ideal and non-ideal mixtures. Unlike previous approaches, the methods are straightforward to implement in two and three spatial dimensions, and allow for high-order finite element spaces to be employed. The key idea in deriving the discretization is to suitably reformulate the SOSM equations in terms of the species mass fluxes and chemical potentials, and discretize these unknown fields using stable $H(\textrm{div}) \unicode{x2013} L^2$ finite element pairs. We prove that the methods are convergent and yield a symmetric linear system for a Picard linearization of the SOSM equations, which staggers the updates for concentrations and chemical potentials. We also discuss how the proposed approach can be extended to the Newton linearization of the SOSM equations, which requires the simultaneous solution of mole fractions, chemical potentials, and other variables. Our theoretical results are supported by numerical experiments and we present an example of a physical application involving the microfluidic non-ideal mixing of hydrocarbons.</description>

      <title>Spectrally accurate fully discrete schemes for some nonlocal and nonlinear integrable PDEs via explicit formulas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13480v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct fully-discrete schemes for the Benjamin-Ono, Calogero-Sutherland DNLS, and cubic Szeg\H{o} equations on the torus, which are $\textit{exact in time}$ with $\textit{spectral accuracy}$ in space. We prove spectral convergence for the first two equations, of order $K^{-s+1}$ in $L^2$ norm for initial data in $H^s(\mathbb T)$, $s&gt;1$, with an error constant depending $\textit{linearly}$ on the final time instead of exponentially. These schemes are based on $\textit{explicit formulas}$, which have recently emerged in the theory of nonlinear integrable equations. Numerical simulations show the strength of the newly designed methods both at short and long time scales, thanks to the remarkable fact that the computational cost of the method is independent of the final time. These schemes open doors for the understanding of the long-time dynamics of integrable equations.</description>

      <title>Speeding up an unsteady flow simulation by adaptive BDDC and Krylov subspace recycling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17543v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We deal with accelerating the solution of a sequence of large linear systems solved by preconditioned conjugate gradient method (PCG). The sequence originates from time-stepping within a simulation of an unsteady incompressible flow. We apply a pressure correction scheme, and we focus on the solution of the Poisson problem for the pressure corrector. Its scalable solution presents the main computational challenge in many applications. The right-hand side of the problem changes in each time step, while the system matrix is constant and symmetric positive definite. The acceleration techniques are studied on a representative problem of flow around a unit sphere. Our baseline approach is based on a parallel solution of each problem in the sequence by nonoverlapping domain decomposition method. The interface problem is solved by PCG with the three-level BDDC preconditioner. As a preliminary step, an appropriate stopping criterion for the PCG iterations is chosen. Next, two techniques for accelerating the solution are gradually added to the baseline approach. Deflation is used within PCG with several approaches to Krylov subspace recycling. Finally, we add the adaptive selection of the coarse space within the three-level BDDC method. The paper is rich in experiments with careful measurements of computational times on a parallel supercomputer. The combination of the acceleration techniques eventually leads to saving more than 40% of the computational time.</description>

      <title>Distributed Hybrid Sketching for $\ell_2$-Embeddings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20301v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Linear algebraic operations are ubiquitous in engineering applications, and arise often in a variety of fields including statistical signal processing and machine learning. With contemporary large datasets, to perform linear algebraic methods and regression tasks, it is necessary to resort to both distributed computations as well as data compression. In this paper, we study \textit{distributed} $\ell_2$-subspace embeddings, a common technique used to efficiently perform linear regression. In our setting, data is distributed across multiple computing nodes and a goal is to minimize communication between the nodes and the coordinator in the distributed centralized network, while maintaining the geometry of the dataset. Furthermore, there is also the concern of keeping the data private and secure from potential adversaries. In this work, we address these issues through randomized sketching, where the key idea is to apply distinct sketching matrices on the local datasets. A novelty of this work is that we also consider \textit{hybrid sketching}, \textit{i.e.} a second sketch is applied on the aggregated locally sketched datasets, for enhanced embedding results. One of the main takeaways of this work is that by hybrid sketching, we can interpolate between the trade-offs that arise in off-the-shelf sketching matrices. That is, we can obtain gains in terms of embedding dimension or multiplication time. Our embedding arguments are also justified numerically.</description>

Abstract: We present an extension of local sensitivity analysis, also referred to as the perturbation approach for uncertainty quantification, to Bayesian inverse problems. More precisely, we show how moments of random variables with respect to the posterior distribution can be approximated efficiently by asymptotic expansions. This is under the assumption that the measurement operators and prediction functions are sufficiently smooth and their corresponding stochastic moments with respect to the prior distribution exist. Numerical experiments are presented to the illustrate the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>On the choice of optimization norm for Anderson acceleration of the Picard iteration for Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07650v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While the most recent Anderson acceleration (AA) convergence theory [Pollock et al, {\it IMA Num. An.}, 2021] requires that the AA optimization norm match the Hilbert space norm associated with the fixed point operator, in implementations the $\ell^2$ norm is perhaps the most common choice. Unfortunately, so far there is little research done regarding this discrepancy which might reveal when it is fine to use $\ell^2$. To address this issue, we consider AA applied to the Picard iteration for the Navier-Stokes equations (NSE) with varying choices of the AA optimization norm. We first prove a sharpened and generalized convergence estimate for depth $m$ AA-Picard for the NSE with the $H^1_0$ AA optimization norm by using a problem-specific analysis, utilizing a sharper treatment of the nonlinear terms than previous AA-Picard convergence studies, removing a small data assumption, and developing new AA term identities in the NSE nonlinear term estimates. Next, we prove a convergence result for when $L^2$ is used as the AA optimization norm, and this estimate is found to be very similar to that of the $H^1_0$ case. While no analogous theory seems possible for the $\ell^2$ norm, several numerical tests were run to compare AA-Picard convergence with varying choices of AA optimization norm. These tests revealed that convergence behavior was always similar for $L^2$ and $H^1_0$ and {\it usually but not always} similar for $\ell^2$: on a test problem for channel flow past a cylinder with coarser meshes, convergence of AA-Picard using $\ell^2$ performs significantly worse than using $L^2$ and $H^1_0$.</description>

      <title>A scaling and recovering algorithm for the matrix $\varphi$-functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01193v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new scaling and recovering algorithm is proposed for simultaneously computing the matrix $\varphi$-functions that arise in exponential integrator methods for the numerical solution of certain first-order systems of ordinary differential equations. The algorithm initially scales the input matrix down by a nonnegative integer power of two, and then evaluates the $[m/m]$ diagonal Pad\'e approximant to $\varphi_p$, where $p$ is the largest index of interest. The remaining $[m+p{-}j/m]$ Pad\'e approximants to $\varphi_j$, $0 \le j &lt; p$, are obtained implicitly via a recurrence relation. The effect of scaling is subsequently recovered using the double-argument formula. A rigorous backward error analysis, based on the $[m+p/m]$ Pad\'e approximant to the exponential, enables sharp bounds on the relative backward errors. These bounds are expressed in terms of the sequence $\|A^k\|^{1/k}$, which can be much smaller than $\|A\|$ for nonnormal matrices. The scaling parameter and the degrees of the Pad\'e approximants are selected to minimize the overall computational cost, which benefits from the sharp bounds and the optimal evaluation schemes for diagonal Pad\'e approximants. Furthermore, if the input matrix is (quasi-)triangular, the algorithm exploits its structure in the recovering phase. Numerical experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm over existing alternatives in both accuracy and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Explicit Monotone Stable Super-Time-Stepping Methods for Finite Time Singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17062v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore a novel way to numerically resolve the scaling behavior of finite-time singularities in solutions of nonlinear parabolic PDEs. The Runge--Kutta--Legendre (RKL) and Runge--Kutta--Gegenbauer (RKG) super-time-stepping methods were originally developed for nonlinear complex physics problems with diffusion. These are multi-stage single step second-order, forward-in-time methods with no implicit solves. The advantage is that the timestep size for stability scales with stage number $s$ as $\mathcal{O}(s^2)$. Many interesting nonlinear PDEs have finite-time singularities, and the presence of diffusion often limits one to using implicit or semi-implicit timestep methods for stability constraints. Finite-time singularities are particularly challenging due to the large range of scales that one desires to resolve, often with adaptive spatial grids and adaptive timesteps. Here we show two examples of nonlinear PDEs for which the self-similar singularity structure has time and space scales that are resolvable using the RKL and RKG methods, without forcing even smaller timesteps. Compared to commonly-used implicit numerical methods, we achieve significantly smaller run time while maintaining comparable accuracy. We also prove numerical monotonicity for both the RKL and RKG methods under their linear stability conditions for the constant coefficient heat equation, in the case of infinite domain and periodic boundary condition, leading to a theoretical guarantee of the superiority of the RKL and RKG methods over traditional super-time-stepping methods, such as the Runge-Kutta-Chebyshev (RKC) and the orthogonal Runge-Kutta-Chebyshev (ROCK) methods.

Abstract: It is significant and challenging to solve eigenvalue problems of partial differential operators when many highly accurate eigenpair approximations are required. The adaptive finite element discretization based parallel orbital-updating method, which can significantly reduce the computational cost and enhance the parallel scalability, has been shown to be efficient in electronic structure calculations. However, there is no any mathematical justification for this method in literature. In this paper, we will show the convergence of the method for clustered eigenvalue problems of linear partial differential operators.</description>

Abstract: We present projection-based mixed finite element methods for the solution of the unsteady Brinkman equations for incompressible single-phase flow with fixed in space porous solid inclusions. At each time step the method requires the solution of a predictor and a projection problem. The predictor problem, which uses a stress-velocity mixed formulation, accounts for the momentum balance, while the projection problem, which is based on a velocity-pressure mixed formulation, accounts for the incompressibility. The spatial discretization is $H$(div)-conforming and the velocity computed at the end of each time step is pointwise divergence-free. Unconditional stability of the fully-discrete scheme and first order in time accuracy are established. Due to the $H$(div)-conformity of the formulation, the methods are robust in both the Stokes and the Darcy regimes. In the specific code implementation, we discretize the computational domain using the Raviart--Thomas space $RT_1$ in two and three dimensions, applying a second-order accurate multipoint flux mixed finite element scheme with a quadrature rule that samples the flux degrees of freedom. In the predictor problem this allows for a local elimination of the viscous stress and results in element-based symmetric and positive definite systems for each velocity component with $\left(d+1\right)$ degrees of freedom per simplex (where $d$ is the dimension of the problem). In a similar way, we locally eliminate the corrected velocity in the projection problem and solve an element-based system for the pressure. Numerical experiments are presented to verify the convergence of the proposed scheme and illustrate its performance for several challenging applications, including one-domain modeling of coupled free fluid and porous media flows and heterogeneous porous media with strong discontinuity of the porosity and permeability values.</description>

      <title>Entropy conservative discretization of compressible Euler equations with an arbitrary equation of state</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01235v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study proposes a novel spatial discretization procedure for the compressible Euler equations which guarantees entropy conservation at a discrete level when an arbitrary equation of state is assumed. The proposed method, based on a locally-conservative discretization, guarantees also the spatial conservation of mass, momentum, and total energy and is kinetic energy-preserving. In order to achieve the entropy-conservation property for an arbitrary non-ideal gas, a general strategy is adopted based on the manipulation of discrete balance equations through the imposition of global entropy conservation and the use of a summation by parts rule. The procedure, which is extended to an arbitrary order of accuracy, conducts to a general form of the internal-energy numerical flux which results in a nonlinear function of thermodynamic and dynamic variables and still admits the mass flux as a residual degree of freedom. The effectiveness of the novel entropy-conservative formulation is demonstrated through numerical tests making use of some of the most popular cubic equations of state.</description>

      <title>Finite-difference compatible entropy-conserving schemes for the compressible Euler equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16621v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a family of entropy-conserving finite-difference discretizations for the compressible flow equations. In addition to conserving the primary quantities of mass, momentum, and total energy, the methods also preserve kinetic energy and pressure equilibrium. The schemes are based on finite-difference (FD) representations of the logarithmic mean, establishing and leveraging a broader link between linear and nonlinear two-point averages and FD forms. The schemes are locally conservative due to the summation-by-parts property and therefore admit a local flux form, making them applicable also in finite-volume and finite-element settings. The effectiveness of these schemes is validated through various test cases (1D Sod shock tube, 1D density wave, 2D isentropic vortex, 3D Taylor-Green vortex) that demonstrate exact conservation of entropy along with conservation of the primary quantities and preservation of pressure equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Comparison of lubrication theory and Stokes flow models in step bearings with flow separation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18575v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Reynolds equation from lubrication theory and the Stokes equations for low Reynolds number flows are distinct models for an incompressible fluid with negligible inertia. Here we investigate the sensitivity of the Reynolds equation to large gradients in the surface geometry. We present an analytic solution to the Reynolds equation in a piecewise-linear domain alongside a more general finite difference solution. For the Stokes equations, we use a finite difference solution for the biharmonic stream-velocity formulation. We compare the fluid velocity, pressure, and resistance for various step bearing geometries in the lubrication and Stokes limits. We find that the solutions to the Reynolds equation do not capture flow separation resulting from large cross-film pressure gradients. Flow separation and corner flow recirculation in step bearings are explored further; we consider the effect of smoothing large gradients in the surface geometry in order to recover limits under which the lubrication and Stokes approximations converge.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Low-Rank Compression of Neural Networks with Robustness under Adversarial Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08022v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deployment of neural networks on resource-constrained devices demands models that are both compact and robust to adversarial inputs. However, compression and adversarial robustness often conflict. In this work, we introduce a dynamical low-rank training scheme enhanced with a novel spectral regularizer that controls the condition number of the low-rank core in each layer. This approach mitigates the sensitivity of compressed models to adversarial perturbations without sacrificing accuracy on clean data. The method is model- and data-agnostic, computationally efficient, and supports rank adaptivity to automatically compress the network at hand. Extensive experiments across standard architectures, datasets, and adversarial attacks show the regularized networks can achieve over 94% compression while recovering or improving adversarial accuracy relative to uncompressed baselines.</description>

      <title>Meshless projection model-order reduction via reference spaces for smoothed-particle hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07830v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work proposes a model-order reduction framework for the meshless weakly compressible smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method. The proposed framework introduces the concept of modal reference spaces to overcome the challenges of discovering low-dimensional subspaces from unstructured, dynamic, and mixing numerical topology that is often seen in SPH simulations. The proposed modal reference spaces enable a low-dimensional representation of the SPH field equations while maintaining their inherent meshless qualities. Modal reference spaces are constructed by projecting SPH snapshot data onto a reference space where low-dimensionality of field quantities can be discovered via traditional modal decomposition techniques (e.g., the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD)). Modal quantities are mapped back to the meshless SPH space via scattered data interpolation during the online predictive stage. The proposed model-order reduction framework is cast into the \emph{meshless} Galerkin POD (GPOD) and the Adjoint Petrov--Galerkin (APG) projection model-order reduction (PMOR) formulation. The PMORs are tested on three numerical experiments: 1) the Taylor--Green vortex; 2) lid-driven cavity; and 3) flow past an open cavity. Results show good agreement in reconstructed and predictive velocity fields, which showcase the ability of the proposed framework to evolve the unstructured, dynamic, and mixing SPH field equations in a low-dimensional subspace. Results also show that the pressure field is sensitive to the projection error due to the stiff weakly-compressible assumption made in the current SPH framework, but can be alleviated through nonlinear approximations, such as the APG approach. Ultimately, the presented meshless model-order reduction framework marks a step toward enabling drastic cost savings of SPH simulations.</description>
