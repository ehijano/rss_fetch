      <title>Solid-State Reactions at Niobium-Germanium Interfaces in Hybrid Superconductor-Semiconductor Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid Superconductor-Semiconductor (S-Sm) materials systems are promising candidates for quantum computing applications. Their integration into superconducting electronics has enabled on-demand voltage tunability at millikelvin temperatures. Ge quantum wells (Ge QWs) have been among the semiconducting platforms interfaced with superconducting Al to realize voltage tunable Josephson junctions. Here, we explore Nb as a superconducting material in direct contact with Ge channels by focusing on the solid-state reactions at the Nb/Ge interfaces. We employ Nb evaporation at cryogenic temperatures (100 K) to establish a baseline structure with atomically and chemically abrupt Nb/Ge interfaces. By conducting systematic photoelectron spectroscopy and transport measurements on Nb/Ge samples across varying annealing temperatures, we elucidated the influence of Ge out-diffusion on the ultimate performance of superconducting electronics. This study underlines the need for low-temperature growth to minimize chemical intermixing and band bending at the Nb/Ge interfaces.</description>

      <title>Terahertz emission from mutually synchronized standalone Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x intrinsic-Josephson-junction stacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suitably patterned single crystals made of the cuprate superconductor Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$ (BSCCO), intrinsically forming a stack of Josephson junctions, can generate electromagnetic radiation in the lower terahertz regime. Due to Joule heating the emission power of single stacks seems to be limited to values below 100 $\mu$W. To increase the radiation power, mutually synchronized arrays situated on the same BSCCO base crystal have been studied. Mutual electromagnetic interactions via a connecting BSCCO base crystal have been considered essential for synchronization, but the approach still suffers from Joule heating, preventing the synchronization of more than three stacks. In the present paper we show, on the basis of two emitting stacks, that mutual synchronization can also be achieved by stand-alone stacks contacted by gold layers and sharing only a common gold layer. Compared to BSCCO base crystals, the gold layers have a much higher thermal conductivity and their patterning is not very problematic. We analyze our results in detail, showing that the two oscillators exhibit phase correlations over a range of $\pm$0.4 GHz relative to their center frequencies, which we mainly studied between 745 GHz and 765 GHz. However, we also find that strong phase gradients in the beams radiated from both the mutually locked stacks and the unlocked ones play an important role and, presumably, diminish the detected emission power due to destructive interference. We speculate that the effect arises from higher-order cavity modes which are excited in the individual stacks. Our main message is that the mutual interaction provided by a common gold layer may open new possibilities for relaxing the Joule-heating-problem, allowing the synchronization of a higher number of stacks. Our findings may boost attempts to substantially increase the output power levels of the BSCCO terahertz oscillators.</description>

      <title>Josephson junctions, superconducting circuits, and qubit for quantum technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the realm of physics, a pivotal moment occurred six decades ago when Brian Josephson made a groundbreaking prediction, setting in motion a series of events that would eventually earn him the prestigious Nobel Prize eleven years later. This prediction centered around what is now known as the Josephson effect, a phenomenon with far-reaching implications. At the heart of this effect lies the Josephson junction (JJ), a device that has become a linchpin in various scientific applications. This chapter delves into the foundational principles of the Josephson effect and the remarkable properties of JJs. From their role in metrology to their application in radiation detectors, these junctions have ushered in a new era of electronics. Exploiting the unique features of superconductive devices, such as high speed, low dissipation, and dispersion, JJs find today practical implementation in the development of superconductive qubits and nanotechnology applications.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of 0-pi transition in Josephson junctions containing unbalanced synthetic antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Josephson junctions containing ferromagnetic (F) materials have been the subject of intense study over the past two decades. The ground state of such junctions oscillates between 0 and pi as the thickness of the ferromagnetic layer increases. For some applications, it might be beneficial to replace a very thin F layer with an unbalanced synthetic antiferromagnet (SAF) consisting of two F layers of different thicknesses whose magnetizations are coupled antiparallel to each other. According to theory, such a system should behave similarly to a single F layer whose thickness is equal to the difference of the two F-layer thicknesses in the SAF. We test that theoretical prediction with Josephson junctions containing unbalanced Ni/Ru/Ni SAFs, keeping the thickness of one layer fixed at 2.0 nm and varying the thickness of the other layer between 2.0 and 5.0 nm. We observe the first 0-pi transition at a thickness difference of 0.86 nm, which closely matches the position of the transition observed previously using single Ni layers.</description>

      <title>An Ultra-High Vacuum Scanning Tunneling Microscope with Pulse Tube and Joule-Thomson cooling operating at sub-pm z-noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe a compact ultra-high vacuum (UHV) scanning tunneling microscope (STM) system that does not need any external supply of cooling liquids. It achieves temperatures down to 1.5 K and a z-noise down to 300 fmRMS for the frequency range of 0.1 Hz - 5 kHz (feedback loop off). It employs a pulse tube cryocooler (PTC) and a Joule-Thomson (JT) stage inducing only small temperature oscillations at the STM with amplitude below 1 mK. The challenge to combine an effective vibrational decoupling from the PTC with sufficient thermal conduction is tackled by a multipartite approach. We realize a minimal stiffness of the UHV bellows that connect the PTC and the STM chamber. Fine Copper wires mechanically decouple the PTC stages from cooling plates that carry the thermal shields, the JT stage and the STM. Soft springs decouple the STM from the JT stage. Finally, the STM body has an optimized conical shape and is made of the light and stiff material Shapal Hi MSoft such that a strong reduction of low frequency vibrations results for the tunnel junction. The voltage noise in the tunnel junction is 0.12 mV and an RF antenna close to the tunnel junction provides radio frequency excitations up to 40 GHz with amplitudes up to 10 mV.</description>

      <title>Pattern-based quantum functional testing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the growing number of qubits of quantum information processing devices, the task of fully characterizing these processors becomes increasingly unfeasible. From a practical perspective, one wants to find possible errors in the functioning of the device as quickly as possible, or otherwise establish its correct functioning with high confidence. In response to these challenges, we propose a pattern-based approach inspired by classical memory testing algorithms to evaluate the functionality of a quantum memory, based on plausible failure mechanisms. We demonstrate the method's capability to extract pattern dependencies of important qubit characteristics, such as $T_1$ and $T_2$ times, and to identify and analyze interactions between adjacent qubits. Additionally, our approach enables the detection of different types of crosstalk effects and of signatures indicating non-Markovian dynamics in individual qubits.</description>

      <title>Andreev bound states at nonmagnetic impurities in superconductor/antiferromagnet heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02512v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Andreev bound states can occur at single impurities in superconductors if the impurities suppress superconductivity for a given system. In particular, well-known Yu-Shiba-Rusinov states occur at magnetic impurities in conventional s-wave superconductors. Here we demonstrate that nonmagnetic impurities in S/AF heterostructures with conventional intraband s-wave pairing also produce Andreev bound states. Analogously to the Yu-Shiba-Rusinov bound states the bound states in S/AF bilayers are spin split, but the spin of a particular bound state is determined by the sublattice to which the impurity belongs. The standard decay of the bound state LDOS is superimposed by atomic oscillations related to the staggered character of the exchange field in the host material and by another oscillating pattern produced by finite-momentum Neel triplet pairing generated at the impurity.</description>

      <title>Topological signatures of a p-wave superconducting wire through light</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14501v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show how the $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ topological index of a one-dimensional topological p-wave superconductor can be revealed when driving with a classical vector potential i.e. an electromagnetic wave, through the quasiparticles inter-band transition rates. As a function of driving frequency $\omega$, it is possible to obtain a measure of this topological invariant from the resonance envelope classifying the two distinct topological phases of the short-range Kitaev wire. We also propose to probe the topological phase transition in the model through the responses of the global capacitance in the presence of the light field and also through the Josephson current between the wire and the proximity coupled bulk superconductor. The system may also be implemented on the Bloch sphere allowing alternative ways to measure the $\mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariants through circuit or cavity quantum electrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Growth and Structure of alpha-Ta films for Quantum Circuit Integration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07388v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tantalum films incorporated into superconducting circuits have exhibited low surface losses, resulting in long-lived qubit states. Remaining loss pathways originate in microscopic defects which manifest as two level systems (TLS) at low temperature. These defects limit performance, so careful attention to tantalum film structures is critical for optimal use in quantum devices. In this work, we investigate the growth of tantalum using magnetron sputtering on sapphire, Si, and photoresist substrates. In the case of sapphire, we present procedures for growth of fully-oriented films with alpha-Ta [1 1 1] // Al2O3 [0 0 1] and alpha-Ta [1 -1 0] // Al2O3 [1 0 0] orientational relationships, and having residual resistivity ratios (RRR) ~ 60 for 220 nm thick films. On Si, we find a complex grain texturing with Ta [1 1 0] normal to the substrate and RRR ~ 30. We further demonstrate airbridge fabrication using Nb to nucleate alpha-Ta on photoresist surfaces. Superconducting resonators patterned from films on sapphire show TLS-limited quality factors of 1.4 +/- 0.3 x 10^6 at 10 mK. Structural characterization using scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, low temperature transport, secondary ion mass spectrometry, and transmission electron microscopy reveal the dependence of residual impurities and screw dislocation density on processing conditions. The results provide practical insights for fabrication of high-performing technological devices including qubit arrays, and guide future work on crystallographically deterministic qubit fabrication.</description>
