      <title>Recognition of Schrodinger cat state based on CNN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We applied convolutional neural networks to the classification of cat states and coherent states. Initially, we generated datasets of Schrodinger cat states and coherent states from nonlinear processes and preprocessed these datasets. Subsequently, we constructed both LeNet and ResNet network architectures, adjusting parameters such as convolution kernels and strides to optimal values. We then trained both LeNet and ResNet on the training sets. The loss function values indicated that ResNet performs better in classifying cat states and coherent states. Finally, we evaluated the trained models on the test sets, achieving an accuracy of 97.5% for LeNet and 100% for ResNet. We evaluated cat states and coherent states with different {\alpha}, demonstrating a certain degree of generalization capability. The results show that LeNet may mistakenly recognize coherent states as cat states without coherent features, while ResNet provides a feasible solution to the problem of mistakenly recognizing cat states and coherent states by traditional neural networks.</description>

      <title>Note on Dirac monopole theory and Berry geometric phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the intrinsic relations between Dirac monopole theory and Berry geometric phases. We demonstrate that the existence of Dirac strings with endpoints brings non-integrable phase factors in the parameters space. We choose one of the simplest two-mode Hamilton model to visualize Dirac string and its endpoint of a wave function, based on its eigenstates. The geometric phase variation around an arbitrary circle can be calculated explicitly according to Dirac's picture, where the well-known Berry connection and curvature can be derived directly by performing Dirac monopole theory in the parameters space. The correspondence between the endpoints of Dirac strings and the accident degenerated points of eigenvalues are clearly shown for the Hermitian systems. These results suggest that Berry phase can be seen as the non-integrable phase factor induced by Dirac strings with endpoints in the parameters space, and would motivate more studies on geometric phase by performing or extending Dirac monopole theory.</description>

      <title>First- and second-order quantum phase transitions in the long-range unfrustrated antiferromagnetic Ising chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the ground-state phase diagram of an unfrustrated antiferromagnetic Ising chain with longitudinal and transverse fields in the full range of interactions: from all-to-all to nearest-neighbors. First, we solve the model analytically in the strong long-range regime, confirming in the process that a mean-field treatment is exact for this model. We compute the order parameter and the correlations and show that the model exhibits a tricritical point where the phase transition changes from first to second order. This is in contrast with the nearest-neighbor limit where the phase transition is known to be second order. To understand how the order of the phase transition changes from one limit to the other, we tackle the analytically-intractable interaction ranges numerically, using a variational quantum Monte Carlo method with a neural-network-based ansatz, the visual transformer. We show how the first-order phase transition shrinks with decreasing interaction range and establish approximate boundaries in the interaction range for which the first-order phase transition is present. Finally, we establish that the key ingredient to stabilize a first-order phase transition and a tricritical point is the presence of ferromagnetic interactions between spins of the same sublattice on top of antiferromagnetic interactions between spins of different sublattices. Tunable-range unfrustrated antiferromagnetic interactions are just one way to implement such staggered interactions.</description>

      <title>Entanglement dynamics in monitored Kitaev circuits: loop models, symmetry classification, and quantum Lifshitz scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum circuits offer a versatile platform for simulating digital quantum dynamics and uncovering novel states of non-equilibrium quantum matter. One principal example are measurement-induced phase transitions arising from non-unitary dynamics in monitored circuits, which employ mid-circuit measurements as an essential building block next to standard unitary gates. Although a comprehensive understanding of dynamics in generic circuits is still evolving, we contend that monitored quantum circuits yield robust phases of dynamic matter, which -- akin to Hamiltonian ground state phases -- can be categorized based on symmetries and spatial dimensionality. To illustrate this concept, we focus on quantum circuits within symmetry classes BDI and D, which are measurement-only adaptations of the paradigmatic Kitaev and Yao-Kivelson models, embodying particle-hole-symmetric Majorana fermions with or without time-reversal. We establish a general framework -- Majorana loop models -- for both symmetry classes to provide access to the phenomenology of the entanglement dynamics in these circuits, displaying both an area-law phase of localized Majorana loops and a delocalized, highly entangled Majorana liquid phase. The two phases are separated by a continuous transition displaying quantum Lifshitz scaling, albeit with critical exponents of two distinct universality classes. The loop model framework provides not only analytical understanding of these universality classes in terms of non-linear sigma models, but also allows for highly efficient numerical techniques capable of simulating excessively large circuits with up to $10^8$ qubits. We utilize this framework to accurately determine universal probes that distinguish both the entangled phases and the critical points of the two symmetry classes. Our work thereby further solidifies the concept of emergent circuit phases and their phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Effective Distance of Higher Dimensional HGPs and Weight-Reduced Quantum LDPC Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum error correction plays a prominent role in the realization of quantum computation, and quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes are believed to be practically useful stabilizer codes. While qLDPC codes are defined to have constant weight parity-checks, the weight of these parity checks could be large constants that make implementing these codes challenging. Large constants can also result in long syndrome extraction times and bad error propagation that can impact error correction performance. Hastings recently introduced weight reduction techniques for qLDPC codes that reduce the weight of the parity checks as well as the maximum number of checks that acts on any data qubit. However, the fault tolerance of these techniques remains an open question. In this paper, we analyze the effective distance of the weight-reduced code when single-ancilla syndrome extraction circuits are considered for error correction. We prove that there exists single-ancilla syndrome extraction circuits that largely preserve the effective distance of the weight-reduced qLDPC codes. In addition, we also show that the distance balancing technique introduced by Evra et al. preserves effective distance. As a corollary, our result shows that higher-dimensional hypergraph product (HGP) codes, also known as homological product codes corresponding to the product of 1-complexes, have no troublesome hook errors when using any single-ancilla syndrome extraction circuit.</description>

      <title>Universally-Charging Protocols for Quantum Batteries: A No-Go Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effectiveness of a quantum battery relies on a robust charging process, yet these are often sensitive to initial state of the battery. We introduce the concept of a universally-charging (UC) protocol, defined as one that either increases or maintains the average battery energy for all initial states, without ever decreasing it. We show that UC protocols are impossible for closed quantum batteries, thus necessitating interactions with auxilliary quantum systems. To that end, we prove a no-go theorem which prohibits UC protocols for closed quantum batteries with finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. Leveraging a no-go theorem for topological quantum walks, we argue that even for infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, while unitary UC operators exist, they cannot be generated by physically reasonable Hamiltonian protocols. However, regardless of the dimension, non-unitary UC protocols can be achieved in open quantum batteries. To illustrate this, we present a general model with a control qubit, whose state interpolates between universal-charging and universal-discharging protocols.</description>

      <title>Microwave-free imaging magnetometry with nitrogen-vacancy centers in nanodiamonds at near-zero field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetometry using Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) color centers in diamond predominantly relies on microwave spectroscopy. However, microwaves may hinder certain studies involving biological systems or thin conductive samples. This work demonstrates a wide-field, microwave-free imaging magnetometer utilizing NV centers in nanodiamonds by exploiting the cross-relaxation feature near zero magnetic fields under ambient conditions without applying microwaves. For this purpose, we measure the center shift, contrast, and linewidth of the zero-field cross-relaxation in 140 nm nanodiamonds drop-cast on a current-carrying conductive pattern while scanning a background magnetic field, achieving a sensitivity of 4.5 $\mathrm{\mu T/\sqrt{Hz}}$. Our work allows for applying the NV zero-field feature in nanodiamonds for magnetic field sensing in the zero and low-field regimes and highlights the potential for microwave-free all-optical wide-field magnetometry based on nanodiamonds.</description>

      <title>Quantum Neural Network Extraction Attack via Split Co-Teaching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs), now offered as QNN-as-a-Service (QNNaaS), have become key targets for model extraction attacks. State-of-the-art methods use ensemble learning to train accurate substitute QNNs, but our analysis reveals significant limitations in real-world NISQ environments, where noise and cost constraints undermine their effectiveness. In this work, we introduce a novel attack, \textit{split co-teaching}, which leverages label variations to \textit{split} queried data by noise sensitivity and employs \textit{co-teaching} schemes to enhance extraction accuracy. Experiments on NISQ processors demonstrate that our approach outperforms classical extraction attacks by 6.5\%$\sim$9.5\% and existing QNN extraction methods by 0.1\%$\sim$3.7\% across various tasks.</description>

      <title>LSTM-QGAN: Scalable NISQ Generative Adversarial Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current quantum generative adversarial networks (QGANs) still struggle with practical-sized data. First, many QGANs use principal component analysis (PCA) for dimension reduction, which, as our studies reveal, can diminish the QGAN's effectiveness. Second, methods that segment inputs into smaller patches processed by multiple generators face scalability issues. In this work, we propose LSTM-QGAN, a QGAN architecture that eliminates PCA preprocessing and integrates quantum long short-term memory (QLSTM) to ensure scalable performance. Our experiments show that LSTM-QGAN significantly enhances both performance and scalability over state-of-the-art QGAN models, with visual data improvements, reduced Frechet Inception Distance scores, and reductions of 5x in qubit counts, 5x in single-qubit gates, and 12x in two-qubit gates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum dynamics of a single particle in a discrete two-dimensional tilted lattice is analyzed from the perspective of the classical-quantum correspondence. Utilizing the fact that tilting the lattice results in oscillatory dynamics, we show how the parameters of the lattice and the initial state of the particle can be tuned so that during evolution the probability distribution does not change its shape while its center follows the trajectory known in classical mechanics as Lissajous curves.</description>

      <title>Laser cooling a centimeter-scale torsion pendulum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We laser cool a centimeter-scale torsion pendulum to a temperature of 10 mK (average occupancy of 6000 phonons) starting from room temperature (equivalent to $2\times 10^8$ phonons). This is achieved by optical radiation pressure forces conditioned on a quantum-noise-limited optical measurement of the pendulum's angular displacement with an imprecision 13 dB below that at the standard quantum limit (SQL). The measurement sensitivity is the result of a novel `mirrored' optical lever that passively rejects extraneous spatial-mode noise by 60 dB. The high mechanical quality ($10^7$) and quantum-noise-limited sub-SQL measurement imprecision demonstrate the necessary ingredients for realizing the quantum ground state of torsional motion -- a pre-requisite for mechanical tests of gravity's alleged quantum nature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an observational analysis of the Delayed-Choice Quantum Eraser experiment through the framework of quantum mechanics. The Delayed-Choice Quantum Eraser, a variation of the classic double-slit experiment, demonstrates the intricate relationship between quantum measurement, wave-particle duality, and the temporal ordering of observations. By utilizing the principles of quantum superposition, entanglement, and the non-local collapse of the wave function, we seek to rationalize the counterintuitive outcomes observed in the experiment. Specifically, we explore how the act of measurement retroactively influences the observed behavior of particles, depending on whether or not the which-path information is available. Our analysis underscores the significance of the quantum mechanical concept of wave function collapse across spacetime, providing a deeper understanding of how quantum mechanics reconciles the delayed-choice paradox.</description>

      <title>Bundled matrix product states represent low-energy excitations faithfully</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a set of density matrices. All of which are written in the same orbital basis, but the orbital basis size is less than the total Hilbert space size. We ask how each density matrix is related to each of the others by establishing a norm between density matrices based on the truncation error in a partial trace for a small set of orbitals. We find that states with large energy differences must have large differences in their density matrices. Small energy differences are divided into two groups, one where two density matrices have small differences and another where they are very different, as is the case of symmetry. We extend these ideas to a bundle of matrix product states and show that bond dimension of the wavefunction ansatz for two states with large energy differences are larger. Meanwhile, low energy differences can have nearly the same bond dimensions for similar states.</description>

      <title>Generation of Scalable Genuine Multipartite Gaussian Entanglement with a Parametric Amplifier Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Genuine multipartite entanglement is a valuable resource in quantum information science, as it exhibits stronger non-locality compared to bipartite entanglement. This non-locality can be exploited in various quantum information protocols, such as teleportation, dense coding, and quantum interferometry. Here, we propose a scheme to generate scalable genuine multipartite continuous-variable entangled states of light using a parametric amplifier network. We verify the presence of genuine quadripartite, hexapartite, and octapartite entanglement through a violation of the positive partial transpose (PPT) criteria. Additionally, we use $\alpha$-entanglement of formation to demonstrate the scalability of our approach to an arbitrary number of $2N$ genuinely entangled parties by taking advantage of the symmetries present in our scheme.</description>

      <title>Certifying Quantum Temporal Correlation via Randomized Measurements: Theory and Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the certification of temporal quantum correlations using the pseudo-density matrix (PDM), an extension of the density matrix to the time domain, where negative eigenvalues are key indicators of temporal correlations. Conventional methods for detecting these correlations rely on PDM tomography, which often involves excessive redundant information and requires exponential resources. In this work, we develop an efficient protocol for temporal correlation detection by virtually preparing the PDM within a single time slice and estimating its second-order moments using randomized measurements. Through sample complexity analysis, we demonstrate that our protocol requires only a constant number of measurement bases, making it particularly advantageous for systems utilizing ensemble average measurements, as it maintains constant runtime complexity regardless of the number of qubits. We experimentally validate our protocol on a nuclear magnetic resonance platform, a typical thermodynamic quantum system, where the experimental results closely align with theoretical predictions, confirming the effectiveness of our protocol.</description>

      <title>Geometry of temporal chiral structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In non-relativistic physics the concepts of geometry and topology are usually applied to characterise spatial structures, or structures in momentum space. We introduce the concept of temporal geometry, which encompasses the geometric and topological properties of temporal shapes, i.e. trajectories traced by a tip of a time-dependent vector in vector space. We apply it to vectors of ultrafast electron current or induced polarization in chiral molecules. The central concepts of temporal geometry - curvature and connection - emerge as ubiquitous features of photoexcited, non-equilibrium, chiral electron dynamics. We demonstrate that curvature and connection (i) rely on the interplay of molecular chirality and the polarization properties of light pulses, (ii) can be introduced for multiphoton processes, and (iii) control enantio-sensitive geometric observables via non-equilibrium electronic dynamics excited by tailored laser fields. Our findings may open a way to ultrafast, topologically non-trivial, and enantio-sensitive chemical dynamics.</description>

      <title>Reduction of Finite Sampling Error in Quantum Krylov Subspace Diagonalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the realm of early fault-tolerant quantum computing (EFTQC), quantum Krylov subspace diagonalization (QKSD) has recently emerged as a promising quantum algorithm for the approximate Hamiltonian diagonalization through projection onto the quantum Krylov subspace. However, the application of this algorithm often entails solving an ill-conditioned generalized eigenvalue problem (GEVP) associated with an erroneous matrix pair, which can cause significant distortion to the solution. Because EFTQC assumes error correction albeit on a small scale, errors in the matrices are predominant due to finite sampling error. This work focuses on quantifying the sampling error within the measurement of matrix element of projected Hamiltonian by considering two measurement approaches based on the Hamiltonian decompositions: linear combination of unitaries and diagonalizable fragments. Furthermore, we propose two measurement strategies to minimize the sampling error with a given budget for quantum circuit repetitions: the shifting technique and coefficient splitting. The shifting technique removes redundant parts from the Hamiltonian that annihilate one of the bra or ket states. The coefficient splitting method optimizes the allocation of each common term that can be measured in different circuits. Numerical experiments with electronic structures of small molecules demonstrate the effectiveness of these strategies, showing a reduction in sampling costs by a factor of 20-500.</description>

      <title>The exact lower bound of CNOT-complexity for fault-tolerant quantum Fourier transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum Fourier transform (QFT) is a crucial subroutine in many quantum algorithms. In this paper, we study the exact lower bound problem of CNOT gate complexity for fault-tolerant QFT. First, we consider approximating the ancilla-free controlled-$R_k$ in the QFT logical circuit with a standard set of universal gates, aiming to minimize the number of T gates. Various single-qubit gates are generated in addition to CNOT gates when the controlled-$R_k$ is decomposed in different ways, we propose an algorithm that combines numerical and analytical methods to exactly compute the minimum T gate count for approximating any single-qubit gate with any given accuracy. Afterwards, we prove that the exact lower bound problem of T gate complexity for the QFT is NP-complete. Furthermore, we provide the transversal implementation of universal quantum gates and prove that it has the minimum number of CNOT gates and analyze the minimum CNOT count for transversally implementing the T gate. We then exactly compute the exact lower bound of CNOT gate complexity for fault-tolerant QFT with the current maximum fault-tolerant accuracy 10^{-2}. Our work can provide a reference for designing algorithms based on active defense in a quantum setting.</description>

      <title>Distributed Quantum Computation via Entanglement Forging and Teleportation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed quantum computation is a practical method for large-scale quantum computation on quantum processors with limited size. It can be realized by direct quantum channels in flying qubits. Moreover, the pre-established quantum entanglements can also play the role of quantum channels with local operations and classical channels. However, without quantum correlations like quantum channels and entanglements, the entanglement forging technique allows us to classically forge the entangled states with local operations and classical channels only. In this paper, we demonstrate the methods to implement a nonlocal quantum circuit on two quantum processors without any quantum correlations, which is based on the fact that teleportation with classically forged Bell states is equivalent to quantum state tomography. In compensation, the overhead of single-shot measurement will increase, and several auxiliary qubits are required. Our results extend the possibility of integrating quantum processors. We expect that our methods will complement the toolbox of distributed quantum computation, and facilitate the extension of the scale of quantum computations.</description>

      <title>Consequences of the single-pair measurement of the Bell parameter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bell inequalities represent a milestone for contemporary Physics, both for quantum foundations investigation and technological applications (e.g., quantum communication and entanglement certification). Although loophole-free tests have been recently performed, a strong debate is still ongoing on the actual meaning of Bell inequality tests, for example on the possible additional hypotheses (end eventual loopholes) to be included in Bell's theorem, as well as on the implications for certain interpretations of quantum mechanics. A recent work [S. Virz\`i et al., Quantum Sci. Technol. 9, 045027 (2024)] challenges some of the statements appeared in this debate, achieving for the first time an experimental estimation of the entire Bell-CHSH parameter from a single entangled pair thanks to a weak-interaction-based measurement approach. Here we analyse the implications of this result for quantum mechanics foundations investigation, illustrating how it can tackle some of the aforementioned interpretations of Bell inequality tests and, more in general, of quantum mechanics itself.</description>

      <title>Shedding Light on the Future: Exploring Quantum Neural Networks through Optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At the dynamic nexus of artificial intelligence and quantum technology, quantum neural networks (QNNs) play an important role as an emerging technology in the rapidly developing field of quantum machine learning. This development is set to revolutionize the applications of quantum computing. This article reviews the concept of QNNs and their physical realizations, particularly implementations based on quantum optics . We first examine the integration of quantum principles with classical neural network architectures to create QNNs. Some specific examples, such as the quantum perceptron, quantum convolutional neural networks, and quantum Boltzmann machines are discussed. Subsequently, we analyze the feasibility of implementing QNNs through photonics. The key challenge here lies in achieving the required non-linear gates, and measurement-induced approaches, among others, seem promising. To unlock the computational potential of QNNs, addressing the challenge of scaling their complexity through quantum optics is crucial. Progress in controlling quantum states of light is continuously advancing the field. Additionally, we have discovered that different QNN architectures can be unified through non-Gaussian operations. This insight will aid in better understanding and developing more complex QNN circuits.</description>

      <title>Low-characteristic-impedance superconducting tadpole resonators in the sub-gigahertz regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a simple and versatile resonator design based on a short strip of a typical coplanar waveguide shorted at one end to the ground and shunted at the other end with a large parallel-plate capacitor. Due to the shape of the structure, we coin it the tadpole resonator. The design allows tailoring the characteristic impedance of the resonator to especially suit applications requiring low values. We demonstrate characteristic impedances ranging from $Z_c = 2\,{\Omega}$ to $10\,{\Omega}$ and a frequency range from $f_0 = 290\,\mathrm{MHz}$ to $1.1\,\mathrm{GHz}$ while reaching internal quality factors of order $Q_{\mathrm{int}} = 8.5\times 10^3$ translating into a loss tangent of $\tan({\delta}) = 1.2\times 10^{-4}$ for the aluminium oxide used as the dielectric in the parallel plate capacitor. We conclude that these tadpole resonators are well suited for applications requiring low frequency and low charactersitic impedance while maintaining a small footprint on chip. The low characteristic impedance of the tadpole resonator renders it a promising candidate for achieving strong inductive coupling to other microwave components.</description>

      <title>Thermal density functional theory approach to quantum thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the thermodynamic properties of many-body quantum systems and their emergence from microscopic laws is a topic of great significance due to its profound fundamental implications and extensive practical applications. Recent advances in experimental techniques for controlling and preparing these systems have increased interest in this area, as they have the potential to drive the development of quantum technologies. In this study, we present a density-functional theory approach to extract detailed information about the statistics of work and the irreversible entropy associated with quantum quenches at finite temperature. Specifically, we demonstrate that these quantities can be expressed as functionals of thermal and out-of-equilibrium densities, which may serve as fundamental variables for understanding finite-temperature many-body processes. We, then, apply our method to the case of the inhomogeneous Hubbard model, showing that our density functional theory based approach can be usefully employed to unveil the distinctive roles of interaction and external potential on the thermodynamic properties of such a system.</description>

      <title>Practical techniques for high precision measurements on near-term quantum hardware: a Case Study in Molecular Energy Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving high-precision measurements on near-term quantum devices is critical for advancing quantum computing applications. In this paper, we explore several practical techniques to enhance measurement accuracy using randomized measurements, focusing on minimizing shot overhead, circuit overhead, measurement noise, and time-dependent measurement noise. Our approach leverages locally biased random measurements to reduce shot overhead, in addition to repeated settings and parallel quantum detector tomography to reduce circuit overhead and mitigate measurement noise. Additionally, we employ a blended scheduling technique to mitigate time-dependent measurement noise. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these techniques through a case study on the molecular energy estimation of the BODIPY molecule using the Hartree-Fock state on an IBM Eagle r3 computer, showcasing significant improvements in measurement precision. These strategies pave the way for more reliable and accurate quantum computations, particularly in applications requiring precise molecular energy calculations.</description>

      <title>Discrete-modulated continuous-variable quantum key distribution secure against general attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, discrete-modulated continuous-variable quantum key distribution (DM-CV-QKD) has gained traction due to its practical advantages: cost-effectiveness, simple state preparation, and compatibility with existing communication technologies. This work presents a security analysis of DM-CV-QKD against general sequential attacks, including finite-size effects. Remarkably, our proof considers attacks that are neither independent nor identical, and makes no assumptions about the Hilbert space dimension of the receiver. To analyse the security, we leverage the recent generalised entropy accumulation theorem and the numerical methods based on quasi-relative entropy. We also develop a novel dimension reduction technique which is compatible with the entropy accumulation framework. While our analysis reveals significant finite-size corrections to the key rate, the protocol might still offer advantages in specific scenarios due to its practical merits. Our work also offers some insights on how future security proofs can improve the security bounds derived in this work.</description>

      <title>Ground state of the gauge invariant Dicke model: condensation of the photons in non-classical states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the ground state of two physically motivated modifications of the Dicke model. The first modification corresponds to particles whose phase space contains only two states, for example, particles with spin 1/2 or artificially created qubits. The second modification describes two-level systems that arise as a result of truncating the full Hilbert space of atoms to two levels that are in resonance with the electromagnetic field and are described by the gauge-invariant Dicke model. We demonstrate that the behavior of these systems is qualitatively distinct in both cases. In particular, in the first scenario, a phase transition into the state with a non-zero amplitude of the classical field is possible, while in the second case, the so-called order parameter $\eta = \braket{\hat{a}}$ of the field's phase transition into a coherent state with photon condensation is zero. At the same time, the average number of photons $\bar{n} = \braket{\hat{a}^\dagger \hat{a}} \neq 0$, and the collective excitation in the system manifests a non-classical "squeezed" state of the field. We analyze the observable characteristics of both systems in a wide range of variation of their parameters.</description>

      <title>Search and state transfer between hubs by quantum walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Search and state transfer between hubs, i.e. fully connected vertices, on otherwise arbitrary connected graph is investigated. Motivated by a recent result of Razzoli et al. (J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 55, 265303 (2022)) on universality of hubs in continuous-time quantum walks and spatial search, we extend the investigation to state transfer and also to the discrete-time case. We show that the continuous-time quantum walk allows for perfect state transfer between multiple hubs if the numbers of senders and receivers are close. Turning to the discrete-time case, we show that the search for hubs is successful provided that the initial state is locally modified to account for a degree of each individual vertex. Concerning state transfer using discrete-time quantum walk, it is shown that between a single sender and a single receiver one can transfer two orthogonal states in the same run-time. Hence, it is possible to transfer an arbitrary quantum state of a qubit between two hubs. In addition, if the sender and the receiver know each other location, another linearly independent state can be transferred, allowing for exchange of a qutrit state. Finally, we consider the case of transfer between multiple senders and receivers. In this case we cannot transfer specific quantum states. Nevertheless, quantum walker can be transferred with high probability in two regimes - either when there is a similar number of senders and receivers, which is the same as for the continuous-time quantum walk, or when the number of receivers is considerably larger than the number of senders. Our investigation is based on dimensional reduction utilizing the invariant subspaces of the respective evolutions and the fact that for the appropriate choice of the loop weights the problem can be reduced to the complete graph with loops.</description>

      <title>Federated Quantum-Train with Batched Parameter Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce the Federated Quantum-Train (QT) framework, which integrates the QT model into federated learning to leverage quantum computing for distributed learning systems. Quantum client nodes employ Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) and a mapping model to generate local target model parameters, which are updated and aggregated at a central node. Testing with a VGG-like convolutional neural network on the CIFAR-10 dataset, our approach significantly reduces qubit usage from 19 to as low as 8 qubits while reducing generalization error. The QT method mitigates overfitting observed in classical models, aligning training and testing accuracy and improving performance in highly compressed models. Notably, the Federated QT framework does not require a quantum computer during inference, enhancing practicality given current quantum hardware limitations. This work highlights the potential of integrating quantum techniques into federated learning, paving the way for advancements in quantum machine learning and distributed learning systems.</description>

      <title>Hong-Ou-Mandel Interference in a temporal-average-inversion-symmetric chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how to implement tunable beam splitter and Hong-Ou-Mandel interference in the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain by manipulating the topological edge states adiabatically. The boson initially injected in the one end of the chain can be transferred to the two-end with a tunable proportion depends on the dynamical phases accumulated during the adiabatic evolution. We also observe Hong-Ou-Mandel interference via the tunable beam splitter ($50:50$) and achieve a spatially entangled two-particle NOON state. We demonstrate the robustness of our proposal under chiral- and time-reversal-symmetry-preserving disorder. However, the chiral symmetry is scarce for realist system. Therefore, we demonstrate Hong-Ou-Mandel interference are robust to inversion symmetric disorder breaking the chiral symmetry, highlighting the protection of inversion symmetry. More importantly, the inversion symmetry violated by static disorder can be restored for more common situations where disorder becomes time dependent, giving rise to the temporal-average-inversion-symmetry protected Hong-Ou-Mandel interference. Our approach opens a new way to study quantum effects in topological matter with potential applications.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report temperature measurements using a transmon qubit by detecting the population of the first three levels of it, after employing a sequence of $\pi$-pulses and performing projective dispersive readout. We measure the effective temperature of the qubit and characterize its relaxation and coherence times $\tau_{1,2}$ for three devices in the temperature range 20-300 mK. Signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio of the temperature measurement depends strongly on $\tau_{1}$, which drops at higher temperatures due to quasiparticle excitations, adversely affecting the measurements and setting an upper bound of the dynamic temperature range of the thermometer. The measurement relies on coherent dynamics of the qubit during the $\pi$-pulses. The effective qubit temperature follows closely that of the cryostat in the range 100-250 mK. We present a numerical model of the qubit population distribution and compare it favorably with the experimental results.</description>

Abstract: We propose an efficient method to numerically simulate the dissipative dynamics of large numbers of quantum emitters in ordered arrays in the presence of long-range dipole-dipole interactions mediated by the vacuum electromagnetic field. Using the spatial symmetries of the system, we rewrite the equations of motion in a collective spin basis and subsequently apply a higher-order cumulant expansion for the collective operators. By truncating the subradiant collective modes with a heavily suppressed decay rate and keeping only the effect from the radiating collective modes, we reduce the numerical complexity significantly. This allows to efficiently compute the dissipative dynamics of the observables of interest for a linear, ring-shaped and planar arrays of quantum emitters. In particular, we characterize the excited population, the total photon emission rate and the second order intensity correlation function $g^{(2)}(\tau =0)$, which are challenging to compute for large systems with traditional cumulant expansion methods based on the individual spins.</description>

      <title>Efficient Simulation of 1D Long-Range Interacting Systems at Any Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a method that ensures efficient computation of one-dimensional quantum systems with long-range interactions across all temperatures. Our algorithm operates within a quasi-polynomial runtime for inverse temperatures up to $\beta={\rm poly}(\ln(n))$. At the core of our approach is the Density Matrix Renormalization Group algorithm, which typically does not guarantee efficiency. We have created a new truncation scheme for the matrix product operator of the quantum Gibbs states, which allows us to control the error analytically. Additionally, our method is applied to simulate the time evolution of systems with long-range interactions, achieving significantly better precision than that offered by the Lieb-Robinson bound.</description>

      <title>Subspace-thermal discrete time crystals from phase transitions between different n-tuple discrete time crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new Floquet time crystal model that responds in arbitrary multiples of the driving period. Such an n-tuple discrete time crystal is theoretically constructed by permuting spins in a disordered chain and is well suited for experiment implementations. Transitions between these time crystals with different periods give rise to a novel phase of matter that we call subspace-thermal discrete time crystals, where states within subspaces are fully thermalized at an early time. However, the whole system still robustly responds to the periodic driving subharmonically, with a period being the greatest common divisor of the original two periods. Existing theoretical analysis from many-body localization fails to understand the rigidity of such subspace-thermal time crystal phases. To resolve this, we develop a new theoretical framework from the perspective of the robust $2\pi/n$ quasi-energy gap. Its robustness is analytically proved, under a reasonable conjecture, by a new perturbation theory for unitary operators. The proof applies beyond the models considered here to other existing discrete time crystals realized by kicking disordered systems, thus offering a systematic way to construct new discrete time crystal models. We also introduce the notion of DTC-charges that allow us to probe the observables that spontaneously break the time-translation symmetry in both the regular discrete time crystals and subspace-thermal discrete time crystals. Moreover, our discrete time crystal models can be generalized to higher spin magnitudes or qudits, as well as higher spatial dimensions.</description>

      <title>Physically constrained quantum clock-driven dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal machines are physical systems specifically designed to make thermal energy available for practical use through state transformations in a cyclic process. This concept relies on the presence of an additional element equipped with a clock, controlling which interaction Hamiltonian between the system and the reservoirs must act at a certain time and that remains unaffected during this process. In the domain of quantum dynamics, there is substantial evidence to suggest that fulfilling this final condition is, in fact, impossible, except in ideal and far-from-reality cases. In this study we start from one such idealized condition and proceed to relax the primary approximations to make the model more realistic and less ideal. The main result is a fully quantum description of the engine-clock dynamics within a realistic quantum framework. Furthermore, this approach offers the possibility to address the deeper and more fundamental challenge of defining meaningful time operators in the realm of quantum mechanics from a different standpoint.</description>

      <title>Blochnium-Based Josephson Junction Parametric Amplifiers: Superior Tunability and Linearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The weak quantum signal amplification is an essential task in quantum computing. In this study, a recently introduced structure of Josephson junctions array called Blochnium (N series Quarton structure) is utilized as a parametric amplifier. We begin by theoretical deriving the system's Lagrangian, quantum Hamiltonian, and then analyze the dynamics using the quantum Langevin equation. By transforming these equations into the Fourier domain and employing the input-output formalism, leading metric indicators of the parametric amplifier become calculated. The new proposed design offers significant advantages over traditional designs due to its ability to manipulate nonlinearity. This premier feature enhances the compression point (P1dB) of the amplifier dramatically, and also provides its tunability across a broad band. The enhanced linearity, essential for quantum applications, is achieved through effective nonlinearity management, which is theoretically derived. Also, the ability to sweep the C-band without significant spectral overlap is crucial for frequency multiplexing in scalable quantum systems. Simulation results show that Blochnium parametric amplifiers can reach to a signal gain around 25 dB with a compression point better than of -92 dBm. Therefore, our proposed parametric amplifier, with its superior degree of freedom, surpasses traditional designs like arrays of Josephson junctions, making it a highly promising candidate for advanced quantum computing applications.</description>

      <title>Pseudospectral method for solving PDEs using Matrix Product States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research focuses on solving time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs), in particular the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation, using matrix product states (MPS). We propose an extension of Hermite Distributed Approximating Functionals (HDAF) to MPS, a highly accurate pseudospectral method for approximating functions of derivatives. Integrating HDAF into an MPS finite precision algebra, we test four types of quantum-inspired algorithms for time evolution: explicit Runge-Kutta methods, Crank-Nicolson method, explicitly restarted Arnoli iteration and split-step. The benchmark problem is the expansion of a particle in a quantum quench, characterized by a rapid increase in space requirements, where HDAF surpasses traditional finite difference methods in accuracy with a comparable cost. Moreover, the efficient HDAF approximation to the free propagator avoids the need for Fourier transforms in split-step methods, significantly enhancing their performance with an improved balance in cost and accuracy. Both approaches exhibit similar error scaling and run times compared to FFT vector methods; however, MPS offer an exponential advantage in memory, overcoming vector limitations to enable larger discretizations and expansions. Finally, the MPS HDAF split-step method successfully reproduces the physical behavior of a particle expansion in a double-well potential, demonstrating viability for actual research scenarios.</description>

      <title>Learning Density Functionals from Noisy Quantum Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search for useful applications of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices in quantum simulation has been hindered by their intrinsic noise and the high costs associated with achieving high accuracy. A promising approach to finding utility despite these challenges involves using quantum devices to generate training data for classical machine learning (ML) models. In this study, we explore the use of noisy data generated by quantum algorithms in training an ML model to learn a density functional for the Fermi-Hubbard model. We benchmark various ML models against exact solutions, demonstrating that a neural-network ML model can successfully generalize from small datasets subject to noise typical of NISQ algorithms. The learning procedure can effectively filter out unbiased sampling noise, resulting in a trained model that outperforms any individual training data point. Conversely, when trained on data with expressibility and optimization error typical of the variational quantum eigensolver, the model replicates the biases present in the training data. The trained models can be applied to solving new problem instances in a Kohn-Sham-like density optimization scheme, benefiting from automatic differentiability and achieving reasonably accurate solutions on most problem instances. Our findings suggest a promising pathway for leveraging NISQ devices in practical quantum simulations, highlighting both the potential benefits and the challenges that need to be addressed for successful integration of quantum computing and ML techniques.</description>

      <title>Efficiently preparing chiral states via fermionic cooling on bosonic quantum hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an efficient protocol for preparing low energy states of arbitrary fermionic Hamiltonians on a noisy bosonic quantum simulator. This procedure involves performing adiabatic cooling by coupling the target system with a simulated bath. The bath is periodically monitored in order to extract entropy from the system. By fermionizing the simulated target system and the bath together, we allow individual fermionic excitations of the system to coherently hop to the bath sites. In this way, we achieve a cooling rate linearly proportional to the density of these excitations, despite the fact that they are non-local in terms of the bosonic degrees of freedom of the hardware. In particular, we show that certain topological phases, such as the chiral (non-Abelian) phase of the Kitaev honeycomb model can be prepared efficiently using our protocol. We find that our protocol performs favorably in the presence of noise, making it suitable for execution on near-term quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic properties of the macroscopically degenerate tetramer-dimer phase of the spin-1/2 Heisenberg model on the diamond-decorated square lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spin-1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the diamond-decorated square lattice in the presence of a magnetic field displays various quantum phases including the Lieb-Mattis ferrimagnetic, dimer-tetramer, monomer-dimer, and spin-canted phases, in addition to the trivial fully saturated state. Thermodynamic properties of this model are investigated using several complementary analytical and numerical methods such as exact diagonalization up to the systems of 40 spins, an effective monomer-dimer description, sign-problem-free quantum Monte Carlo simulations for up to 180 spins, and a decoupling approximation. Our particular attention is focused on the parameter region favoring the dimer-tetramer phase. This ground state can be represented by a classical hard-dimer model on the square lattice and retains a macroscopic degeneracy even under a magnetic field. However, the description of the low-temperature thermodynamics close to the boundary between the macroscopically degenerate dimer-tetramer and the non-degenerate monomer-dimer phases requires an extended classical monomer-dimer lattice-gas model. Anomalous thermodynamic properties emerging in the vicinity of the dimer-tetramer phase are studied in detail. Under the adiabatic demagnetization we detect an enhanced magnetocaloric effect promoting an efficient cooling to absolute zero temperature, provided that the system reaches the dimer-tetramer ground state at zero field.</description>

      <title>State Dependent Spread Complexity Dynamics in Many-Body Localization Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We characterize the Many-Body Localization (MBL) phase transition using the dynamics of spread complexity and inverse participation ratio in the Krylov space starting from different initial states. Our analysis of the disordered Heisenberg spin-1/2 chain unravels that the ergodic-to-MBL transition can be determined from the transition of the pre-saturation peak in the thermofield double state (TFD) spread complexity. On the other hand, if an initially ordered state or a superposition of a small number of such states is chosen, then the saturation value of spread complexity and Krylov inverse participation ratio (KIPR) can distinguish the ergodic phase from the integrable phases, with no sharp difference between the integrable phases. Interestingly, the distinction between the disorder-free integrable and the MBL integrable phase is established by the spread complexity study of random states chosen from unitary and orthogonal Haar ensembles. We also study the complexity dynamics by coupling the system to a bath, which shows distinctive profiles in different phases. A stretched exponential decay of KIPR is observed when the MBL system is connected to the bath, with the decay starting at an earlier time for a greater value of environmental dephasing. Our work sheds light on the efficacy of Krylov space dynamics in understanding phase transitions in quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Late-time ensembles of quantum states in quantum chaotic systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum states undergoing quantum chaotic dynamics are expected to evolve into featureless states at late times. While this expectation holds true on an average, coarse-grained level, it is unclear if this expectation applies to higher statistical moments, as symmetries typically present in physical systems constrain the exploration of phase space. Here we study the universal structure of late-time ensembles obtained from unitary dynamics in quantum chaotic systems with symmetries, such as charge or energy conservation. We identify two limiting universal regimes depending on the initial condition. When the initial state is typical -- all the moments of the symmetry operators are equal to those of pure random states -- then the late-time ensemble is indistinguishable from the Haar ensemble in the thermodynamic limit and at the level of higher statistical moments. Otherwise, atypical initial states evolve into non-universal ensembles which can be distinguished from the Haar ensemble from simple measurements or subsystem properties. Interestingly, such atypical initial conditions are not rare, even when considering product state initial conditions, and can be found in the middle of the spectrum of Hamiltonians known to be `maximally' chaotic. In the limiting case of initial states with negligible variance of the symmetry operator (e.g., states with fixed particle number or states with negligible energy variance), the late-time ensemble has universal behavior captured by constrained RMT ensembles. Our work shows that even though midspectrum states do not explore ergodically all of phase space at late times, the late-time ensemble typically -- but not always -- exhibits the same average and sample-to-sample fluctuations as the Haar ensemble.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well established that the optimal spin squeezing under a one-axis-twisting Hamiltonian follows a scaling law of $J^{-2/3}$ for $J$ interacting atoms after a quench dynamics. Here we prove analytically and numerically that the spin squeezing of the ground state of the one-axis-twisting Hamiltonian actually reaches the Heisenberg limit $J^{-1}$. By constructing a bilinear Bogoliubov Hamiltonian with the raising and lowering spin operators, we exactly diagonalize the spin Bogoliubov Hamiltonian, which includes the one-axis twisting Hamiltonian as a limiting case. The ground state of the spin Bogoliubov Hamiltonian exhibits wonderful spin squeezing, which approaches to the Heisenberg limit in the case of the one-axis twisting Hamiltonian. It is possible to realize experimentally the spin squeezed ground state of the one-axis-twisting Hamiltonian in dipolar spinor condensates, ultracold atoms in optical lattices, spins in a cavity, or alkali atoms in a vapor cell.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent approach to the dynamics of excitation energy transfer in multichromophoric systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computationally tractable and reliable, albeit approximate, methods for studying exciton transport in molecular aggregates immersed in structured bosonic environments have been actively developed. Going beyond the lowest-order (Born) approximation for the memory kernel of the generalized quantum master equation typically results in complicated and possibly divergent expressions. Starting from the memory kernel in the Born approximation, and recognizing the quantum master equation as the Dyson equation of the Green's functions theory, we formulate the self-consistent Born approximation to resum the memory-kernel perturbation series in powers of the exciton-environment interaction. Our formulation is in the Liouville space and frequency domain, and handles arbitrary exciton-environment spectral densities. In a molecular dimer coupled to an overdamped oscillator environment, we conclude that the self-consistent cycle significantly improves the Born-approximation energy-transfer dynamics. The dynamics in the self-consistent Born approximation agree well with solutions of hierarchical equations of motion over a wide range of parameters, including the most challenging regimes of strong exciton-environment interactions, slow environments, and low temperatures. This is rationalized by analytical considerations of coherence-dephasing dynamics in the pure-dephasing model. We find that the self-consistent Born approximation is good (poor) at describing energy transfer modulated by an underdamped vibration resonant (off-resonant) with the exciton energy gap. Nevertheless, it reasonably describes exciton dynamics in the seven-site model of the Fenna-Matthews-Olson complex in a realistic environment comprising both an overdamped continuum and underdamped vibrations.</description>

      <title>Electrical control of topological 3Q state in an intercalated van der Waals antiferromagnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Van der Waals (vdW) magnets have opened a new avenue of novel opportunities covering various interesting phases. Co1/3TaS2-an intercalated metallic vdW antiferromagnet-is one of the latest important additions to the growing list of materials due to its unique triple-Q (3Q) ground state possessing topological characteristics. Careful bulk characterisations have shown the ground state of CoxTaS2 to be a rare 3Q tetrahedral structure for x less than 1/3. The uniqueness of this ground state arises from the dense real-space Berry curvature due to scalar spin chirality, giving rise to a noticeable anomalous Hall effect. In this work, we demonstrate that we can control this topological phase via gating. Using three kinds of CoxTaS2 devices with different Co compositions, we have established that we can cover the whole 3Q topological phase with ionic gating. This work reports a rare demonstration of electrical gating control of layered antiferromagnetic metal. More importantly, our work constitutes one of the first examples of the electrical control of the scalar spin chirality using antiferromagnetic metal.</description>

      <title>A Non-Invertible Symmetry-Resolved Affleck-Ludwig-Cardy Formula and Entanglement Entropy from the Boundary Tube Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a refined version of the Affleck-Ludwig-Cardy formula for a 1+1d conformal field theory, which controls the asymptotic density of high energy states on an interval transforming under a given representation of a non-invertible global symmetry. We use this to determine the universal leading and sub-leading contributions to the non-invertible symmetry-resolved entanglement entropy of a single interval. As a concrete example, we show that the ground state entanglement Hamiltonian for a single interval in the critical double Ising model enjoys a Kac-Paljutkin $H_8$ Hopf algebra symmetry when the boundary conditions at the entanglement cuts are chosen to preserve the product of two Kramers-Wannier symmetries, and we present the corresponding symmetry-resolved entanglement entropies. Our analysis utilizes recent developments in symmetry topological field theories (SymTFTs).</description>

      <title>Vacuum Radiation Pressure Fluctuations on Electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is a continuation of a study of the properties and applications of quantum stress tensor fluctuations. Here we treat the vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic energy-momentum flux operator which as been averaged in space and time. The probability distribution of these fluctuations depends upon the details of this averaging and may allow fluctuations very large compared to the variance. The possibility of detecting their effects on electrons will be considered. The averaging of the flux operator will arise from the interaction of an electron with a wave packet containing real photons, The vacuum radiation pressure fluctuations can exert a force on the electron in any direction, in contrast to the effect of scattering by real photons. Some numerical estimates of the effect will be given.</description>

      <title>Optimal non-classical correlations of light with a levitated nano-sphere</title>

      <description>arXiv:2006.15050v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonclassical correlations provide a resource for many applications in quantum technology as well as providing strong evidence that a system is indeed operating in the quantum regime. Optomechanical systems can be arranged to generate nonclassical correlations (such as quantum entanglement) between the mechanical mode and a mode of travelling light. Here we propose automated optimization of the production of quantum correlations in such a system, beyond what can be achieved through analytical methods, by applying Bayesian optimization to the control parameters. A two-mode optomechanical squeezing experiment is simulated using a detailed theoretical model of the system and the measurable outputs fed to the Bayesian optimization process. This then modifies the controllable parameters in order to maximize the non-classical two-mode squeezing and its detection, independently of the inner workings of the model. We focus on a levitated nano-sphere system, but the techniques described are broadly applicable in optomechanical experiments, and also more widely, especially where no detailed theoretical treatment is available. We find that in the experimentally relevant thermal regimes, the ability to vary and optimize a broad array of control parameters provides access to large values of two-mode squeezing that would otherwise be difficult or intractable to discover via analytical or trial and error methods. In particular we observe that modulation of the driving frequency around the resonant sideband allows for stronger nonclassical correlations. We also observe that our optimization approach finds parameters that allow significant squeezing in the high temperature regime. This extends the range of experimental setups in which non-classical correlations could be generated beyond the region of high quantum cooperativity.</description>

      <title>Automatic Test Pattern Generation for Robust Quantum Circuit Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.10697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.10697v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum circuit testing is essential for detecting potential faults in realistic quantum devices, while the testing process itself also suffers from the inexactness and unreliability of quantum operations. This paper alleviates the issue by proposing a novel framework of automatic test pattern generation (ATPG) for robust testing of logical quantum circuits. We introduce the stabilizer projector decomposition (SPD) for representing the quantum test pattern, and construct the test application (i.e., state preparation and measurement) using Clifford-only circuits, which are rather robust and efficient as evidenced in the fault-tolerant quantum computation. However, it is generally hard to generate SPDs due to the exponentially growing number of the stabilizer projectors. To circumvent this difficulty, we develop an SPD generation algorithm, as well as several acceleration techniques which can exploit both locality and sparsity in generating SPDs. The effectiveness of our algorithms are validated by 1) theoretical guarantees under reasonable conditions, 2) experimental results on commonly used benchmark circuits, such as Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT), Quantum Volume (QV) and Bernstein-Vazirani (BV) in IBM Qiskit.</description>

      <title>Semiquantum private comparison based on Bell states without quantum measurements from the classical user</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.04927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.04927v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel semiquantum private comparison (SQPC) protocol based on Bell states, which enables one quantum user and one classical user to compare the equality of their private inputs with the help of a semi-honest quantum third party (TP). TP is assumed to be semi-honest in the sense that she may take all possible attacks to steal users' private inputs except conspiring with anyone. The security analysis validates that our protocol can resist not only the attacks from internal participants but also the attacks from an external eavesdropper. Besides, our protocol only asks TP to perform Bell basis measurements but doesn't need quantum entanglement swapping; and it releases the classical user from conducting quantum measurements and having a quantum memory. Moreover, our protocol can take advantage over previous SQPC protocols based on Bell states in qubit efficiency. Finally, our protocol can be generalized into its counterpart of the collective-dephasing noise quantum channel.</description>

      <title>Simulating quantum computation: how many "bits" for "it"?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.17287v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A recently introduced classical simulation method for universal quantum computation with magic states operates by repeated sampling from probability functions [M. Zurel et al. PRL 260404 (2020)]. This method is closely related to sampling algorithms based on Wigner functions, with the important distinction that Wigner functions can take negative values obstructing the sampling. Indeed, negativity in Wigner functions has been identified as a precondition for a quantum speed-up. However, in the present method of classical simulation, negativity of quasiprobability functions never arises. This model remains probabilistic for all quantum computations. In this paper, we analyze the amount of classical data that the simulation procedure must track. We find that this amount is small. Specifically, for any number $n$ of magic states, the number of bits that describe the quantum system at any given time is $2n^2+O(n)$.</description>

      <title>Efficient Classical Shadow Tomography through Many-body Localization Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.01258v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classical shadow tomography serves as a potent tool for extracting numerous properties from quantum many-body systems with minimal measurements. Nevertheless, prevailing methods yielding optimal performance for few-body operators necessitate the application of random two-qubit gates, a task that can prove challenging on specific quantum simulators such as ultracold atomic gases. In this work, we introduce an alternative approach founded on the dynamics of many-body localization, a phenomenon extensively demonstrated in optical lattices. Through an exploration of the shadow norm -- both analytically, employing a phenomenological model, and numerically, utilizing the TEBD algorithm -- we demonstrate that our scheme achieves remarkable efficiency comparable to shallow circuits or measurement-induced criticality, resulting in a significant improvement in the exponential exponent compared to the previous classical shadow protocol. Our findings are corroborated through direct numerical simulations encompassing the entire sampling and reconstruction processes. Consequently, our results present a compelling methodology for analyzing the output states of quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the Inter-Core Qubit Traffic in Large-Scale Quantum Modular Architectures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.01921v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modular quantum processor architectures are envisioned as a promising solution for the scalability of quantum computing systems beyond the Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices era. Based upon interconnecting tens to hundreds of quantum cores via a quantum intranet, this approach unravels the pressing limitations of densely qubit-packed monolithic processors, mainly by mitigating the requirements of qubit control and enhancing qubit isolation, and therefore enables executing large-scale algorithms on quantum computers. In order to optimize such architectures, it is crucial to analyze the quantum state transfers occurring via inter-core communication networks, referred to as inter-core qubit traffic. This would also provide insights to improve the software and hardware stack for multi-core quantum computers. To this aim, we present a pioneering characterization of the spatio-temporal inter-core qubit traffic in large-scale circuits. The programs are executed on an all-to-all connected multi-core architecture that supports up to around 1000 qubits. We characterize the qubit traffic based on multiple performance metrics to assess the computational process and the communication overhead. Based on the showcased results, we conclude on the scalability of the presented algorithms, provide a set of guidelines to improve mapping quantum circuits to multi-core processors, and lay the foundations of benchmarking large-scale multi-core architectures.</description>

      <title>Quantum Hamiltonian Algorithms for Maximum Independent Sets</title>

Abstract: With qubits encoded into atomic ground and Rydberg states and situated on the vertexes of a graph, the conditional quantum dynamics of Rydberg blockade, which inhibits simultaneous excitation of nearby atoms, has been employed recently to find maximum independent sets following an adiabatic evolution algorithm hereafter denoted by HV [Science 376, 1209 (2022)]. An alternative algorithm, short named the PK algorithm, reveals that the independent sets diffuse over a media graph governed by a non-abelian gauge matrix of an emergent PXP model. This work shows the above two algorithms are mathematically equivalent, despite of their seemingly different physical implementations. More importantly, we demonstrated that although the two are mathematically equivalent, the PK algorithm exhibits more efficient and resource-saving performance. Within the same range of experimental parameters, our numerical studies suggest that the PK algorithm performs at least 25% better on average and saves at least $6\times10^6$ measurements ($\sim 900$ hours of continuous operation) for each graph when compared to the HV algorithm. We further consider the measurement error and point out that this may cause the oscillations in the performance of the HV's optimization process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18225v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Precise measurement of magnetic fields is essential for various applications, such as fundamental physics, space exploration, and biophysics. Although recent progress in quantum engineering has assisted in creating advanced quantum magnetometers, there are still ongoing challenges in improving their efficiency and noise resistance. This study focuses on using symmetric graph state resources for quantum magnetometry to enhance measurement precision by analyzing the estimation theory under time-homogeneous and time-inhomogeneous noise models. The results show a significant improvement in estimating both single and multiple Larmor frequencies. In single Larmor frequency estimation, the quantum Fisher information spans a spectrum from the standard quantum limit to the Heisenberg limit within a periodic range of the Larmor frequency, and in the case of multiple Larmor frequencies, it can exceed the standard quantum limit for both noisy cases. This study highlights the potential of graph state-based methods for improving magnetic field measurements under noisy environments.</description>

      <title>Upper limit on the acceleration of a quantum evolution in projective Hilbert space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18470v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is remarkable that Heisenberg's position-momentum uncertainty relation leads to the existence of a maximal acceleration for a physical particle in the context of a geometric reformulation of quantum mechanics. It is also known that the maximal acceleration of a quantum particle is related to the magnitude of the speed of transportation in projective Hilbert space. In this paper, inspired by the study of geometric aspects of quantum evolution by means of the notions of curvature and torsion, we derive an upper bound for the rate of change of the speed of transportation in an arbitrary finite-dimensional projective Hilbert space. The evolution of the physical system being in a pure quantum state is assumed to be governed by an arbitrary time-varying Hermitian Hamiltonian operator. Our derivation, in analogy to the inequalities obtained by L. D. Landau in the theory of fluctuations by means of general commutation relations of quantum-mechanical origin, relies upon a generalization of Heisenberg's uncertainty relation. We show that the acceleration squared of a quantum evolution in projective space is upper bounded by the variance of the temporal rate of change of the Hamiltonian operator. Moreover, focusing for illustrative purposes on the lower-dimensional case of a single spin qubit immersed in an arbitrarily time-varying magnetic field, we discuss the optimal geometric configuration of the magnetic field that yields maximal acceleration along with vanishing curvature and unit geodesic efficiency in projective Hilbert space. Finally, we comment on the consequences that our upper bound imposes on the limit at which one can perform fast manipulations of quantum systems to mitigate dissipative effects and/or obtain a target state in a shorter time.</description>

Abstract: We propose an approach based on stochastic differential equations to describe superfluorescence in compact ensembles of multi-level emitters in the presence of various incoherent processes. This approach has a numerical complexity that does not depend on the number of emitters. The stochastic differential equations are derived directly from the quantum master equation. In this study, we present a series of numerical examples, comparing our solution to exact calculations and discussing the limits of applicability. For many relevant cases, the proposed stochastic differential equations provide accurate results and correctly capture quantum many-body correlation effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10216v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Emerging quantum technologies hold the promise of unraveling difficult problems ranging from condensed matter to high energy physics, while at the same time motivating the search for unprecedented phenomena in their setting. Here we utilize a custom-built superconducting qubit ladder to realize non-thermalizing states with rich entanglement structures in the middle of the energy spectrum. Despite effectively forming an "infinite" temperature ensemble, these states robustly encode quantum information far from equilibrium, as we demonstrate by measuring the fidelity and entanglement entropy in the quench dynamics of the ladder. Our approach harnesses the recently proposed type of non-ergodic behavior known as "rainbow scar", which allows us to obtain analytically exact eigenfunctions whose ergodicity-breaking properties can be conveniently controlled by randomizing the couplings of the model, without affecting their energy. The on-demand tunability of quantum correlations via disorder allows for in situ control over ergodicity breaking and it provides a knob for designing exotic many-body states that defy thermalization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00526v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given the recent advances in quantum technology, the complexity of quantum states is an important notion. The idea of the Krylov spread complexity has come into focus recently with the goal of capturing this in a quantitative way. The present paper sheds new light on the Krylov complexity measure by exploring it in the context of continuous-time quantum-walks on graphs. A close relationship between Krylov spread complexity and the concept of limiting-distributions for quantum-walks is established. Moreover, using a graph optimization algorithm, quantum-walk graphs are constructed that have minimal and maximal long-time average Krylov $\bar C$-complexity. This reveals an empirical upper bound for the $\bar C$-complexity as a function of Hilbert space dimension and an exact lower bound.</description>

      <title>The polygon relation and subadditivity of entropic measures for discrete and continuous multipartite entanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02066v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a recent work [Ge {\it et al.}, arXiv: 2312. 17496 (2023)], we have derived the polygon relation of bipartite entanglement measures that is useful to reveal the entanglement properties of discrete, continuous, and even hybrid multipartite quantum systems. In this work, with the information-theoretical measures of R\'enyi and Tsallis entropies, we study the relationship between the polygon relation and the subadditivity of entropy. In particular, the entropy-polygon relations are derived for pure multi-qubit states and generalized to multi-mode Gaussian states, by utilizing the known results from the quantum marginal problem. Moreover, the equivalence between the polygon relation and subadditivity is established, in the sense that for all discrete or continuous multipartite states, the polygon relation holds if and only if the underlying entropy is subadditive. As byproduct, the subadditivity of R\'enyi and Tsallis entropies is proven for all bipartite Gaussian states. Finally, the difference between polygon relations and monogamy relations is clarified, and generalizations of our results are discussed. Our work provides a better understanding of the rich structure of multipartite states, and hence is expected to be helpful for the study of multipartite entanglement.</description>

Abstract: We investigate quantum characteristics around Schwarzschild black hole, exploring various quantum resources and their interplay in curved space-time. Our analysis reveals intriguing behaviors of quantum coherence, global and genuine multipartite entanglement, first-order coherence, and mutual information in different scenarios. Initially, we consider three particles shared among Alice, Bob, and Charlie in a Minkowski space far from the event horizon, where these particles are correlated via GHZ-type correlation. While Alice's particle remains in Minkowski space, Bob and Charlie accelerate towards the event horizon, experiencing black hole evaporation and generating antiparticles correlated via the Hawking effect. We employ the Kruskal basis formulation to derive a penta-partite pure state shared among particles inside and outside the event horizon. Investigating different scenarios among particles both inside and outside the event horizon, we observe how quantum resources evolve and distribute among consideration of different particles with Hawking temperature and mode frequency. The trade-off relationship between first-order coherence and concurrence fill persists, indicating the intricate interplay between coherence and entanglement. Notably, the mutual information between external observers and particles inside the black hole becomes non-zero, deepening our understanding of quantum effects in curved space-time and shedding light on the quantum nature of the black hole. We believe that these findings will pave the way for future investigations into the fundamental quantum mechanical aspects of gravity under extreme environments.</description>

      <title>Exceptional points and quantum phase transition in a fermionic extension of the Swanson oscillator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17189v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the structure of the Swanson oscillator which is a well-known example of a non-Hermitian quantum system consisting of a general representation of a quadratic Hamiltonian, we propose a fermionic extension of such a scheme which incorporates two fermionic oscillators together with bilinear-coupling terms that do not conserve particle number. We determine the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and expose the appearance of exceptional points where two of the eigenstates coalesce with the corresponding eigenvectors exhibiting self-orthogonality with respect to the bi-orthogonal inner product. The model admits a quantum phase transition - we discuss the two phases and also demonstrate that the ground-state entanglement entropy exhibits a discontinuous jump indicating the transition between the two phases.</description>

      <title>Performance of entanglement purification including maximally entangled mixed states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04226v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entanglement between distant quantum systems is a critical resource for implementing quantum communication. This property is affected by external agents and can be restored by employing efficient entanglement purification protocols. In this work, we propose an entanglement purification protocol based on two entangling two-qubit operations that replace the usual controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate. These operations arise from a generalized quantum measurement and can be understood as measurement operators in a positive operator-valued measure (POVM). Furthermore, two variants of the core protocol are introduced and shown to be more practical in certain scenarios. The performance of the protocols is studied in terms of the overall success probability of reaching a Bell state and the number of purifiable states. Based on rank-two states, we can obtain analytical expressions for the success probability that we extend and refine using numerical calculations to the case of maximally entangled states (MEMS). We also consider more general rank-three states to show that our procedure is in general more convenient compared to purification protocols based on Bell diagonal states. Finally, we test the protocols using initial random states. In all cases, we find a larger performance and larger amount of purifiable states using our schemes compared to the CNOT-based purification protocol.</description>

      <title>Quantum Backtracking in Qrisp Applied to Sudoku Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10060v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum backtracking algorithm proposed by Ashley Montanaro raised considerable interest, as it provides a quantum speed-up for a large class of classical optimization algorithms. It does not suffer from Barren-Plateaus and transfers well into the fault-tolerant era, as it requires only a limited number of arbitrary angle gates. Despite its potential, the algorithm has seen limited implementation efforts, presumably due to its abstract formulation. In this work, we provide a detailed instruction on implementing the quantum step operator for arbitrary backtracking instances. For a single controlled diffuser of a binary backtracking tree with depth n, our implementation requires only $6n+14$ CX gates. We detail the process of constructing accept and reject oracles for Sudoku problems using our interface to quantum backtracking. The presented code is written using Qrisp, a high-level quantum programming language, making it executable on most current physical backends and simulators. Subsequently, we perform several simulator based experiments and demonstrate solving 4x4 Sudoku instances with up to 9 empty fields. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first instance of a compilable implementation of this generality, marking a significant and exciting step forward in quantum software engineering.</description>

      <title>Realisation of a Coherent and Efficient One-Dimensional Atom</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12568v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A quantum emitter interacting with photons in a single optical-mode constitutes a one-dimensional atom. A coherent and efficiently coupled one-dimensional atom provides a large nonlinearity, enabling photonic quantum gates. Achieving a high coupling efficiency ($\beta$-factor) and low dephasing is challenging. Here, we use a semiconductor quantum dot in an open microcavity as an implementation of a one-dimensional atom. With a weak laser input, we achieve an extinction of $99.2\%$ in transmission and a concomitant bunching in the photon statistics of $g^{(2)}(0) = 587$, showcasing the reflection of the single-photon component and the transmission of the multi-photon components of the coherent input. The tunable nature of the microcavity allows $\beta$ to be adjusted and gives control over the photon statistics -- from strong bunching to anti-bunching -- and the phase of the transmitted photons. We obtain excellent agreement between experiment and theory by going beyond the single-mode Jaynes-Cummings model. Our results pave the way towards the creation of exotic photonic states and two-photon phase gates.</description>

      <title>Computing exact moments of local random quantum circuits via tensor networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01706v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A basic primitive in quantum information is the computation of the moments $\mathbb{E}_U[{\rm Tr}[U\rho U^\dagger O]^t]$. These describe the distribution of expectation values obtained by sending a state $\rho$ through a random unitary $U$, sampled from some distribution, and measuring the observable $O$. While the exact calculation of these moments is generally hard, if $U$ is composed of local random gates, one can estimate $\mathbb{E}_U[{\rm Tr}[U\rho U^\dagger O]^t]$ by performing Monte Carlo simulations of a Markov chain-like process. However, this approach can require a prohibitively large number of samples, or suffer from the sign problem. In this work, we instead propose to estimate the moments via tensor networks, where the local gates moment operators are mapped to small dimensional tensors acting on their local commutant bases. By leveraging representation theoretical tools, we study the local tensor dimension and we provide bounds for the bond dimension of the matrix product states arising from deep circuits. We compare our techniques against Monte Carlo simulations, showing that we can significantly out-perform them. Then, we showcase how tensor networks can exactly compute the second moment when $U$ is a quantum neural network acting on thousands of qubits and having thousands of gates. To finish, we numerically study the anticoncentration phenomena of circuits with orthogonal random gates, a task which cannot be studied via Monte Carlo due to sign problems.</description>

      <title>Active robustness against the detuning-error for Rydberg quantum gates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11860v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Error suppression to the experimental imperfections is a central challenge for useful quantum computing. Recent studies have shown the advantages of using single-modulated pulses based on optimal control which can realize high-fidelity two-qubit gates in neutral-atom arrays. However, typical optimization only minimizes the ideal gate error in the absence of any decay, which allows the gate to be passively influenced by all error sources leading to an exponential increase of sensitivity when the error becomes larger. In the present work, we propose the realization of two-qubit CZ gates with active robustness against two-photon detuning errors. Our method depends on a modified cost function in numerical optimization for shaping gate pulses, which can minimize, not only the ideal gate error but also the fluctuations of gate infidelity over a wide error range. We introduce a family of Rydberg blockade gates with active robustness towards the impacts of versatile noise sources such as Doppler dephasing and ac Stark shifts. The resulting gates with robust pulses can significantly increase the insensitivity to any type of errors acting on the two-photon detuning, benefiting from a relaxed requirement of colder atomic temperatures or more stable lasers for current experimental technology.</description>

      <title>Nonlinearity of the Fidelity in Open Qudit Systems: Gate and Noise Dependence in High-dimensional Quantum Computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15141v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-dimensional quantum computing has generated significant interest due to its potential to address scalability and error correction challenges faced by traditional qubit-based systems. This paper investigates the Average Gate Fidelity (AGF) of single qudit systems under Markovian noise in the Lindblad formalism, extending previous work by developing a comprehensive theoretical framework for the calculation of higher-order correction terms. We derive general expressions for the perturbative expansion of the Average Gate Infidelity (AGI) in terms of the environmental coupling coefficient and validate these with extensive numerical simulations, emphasizing the transition from linear to nonlinear behaviour in the strong coupling regime. Our findings highlight the dependence of AGI on qudit dimensionality, quantum gate choice, and noise strength, providing critical insights for optimising quantum gate design and error correction protocols. Additionally, we utilise our framework to identify universal bounds for the AGI in the strong coupling regime and explore the practical implications for enhancing the performance of near-term qudit architectures. This study offers a robust foundation for future research and development in high-dimensional quantum computing, contributing to the advancement of robust, high-fidelity quantum operations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02024v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Parametric coupling between harmonic oscillators has enabled exquisite measurement precision and control of linear resonators, being extensively studied, for example, in cavity optomechanics. This level of control has been made possible by using strong sideband drives, enhancing the coupling rate while also linearizing the interaction. In this article, we demonstrate a new paradigm of parametrically coupled microwave circuits replacing one linear microwave cavity with a superconducting transmon qubit. Our system utilizes photon-pressure coupling between the transmon qubit and a highly linear microwave resonator, a microwave analog of the radiation-pressure interaction. Applying a strong sideband drive results in an on-demand, non-linear Jaynes-Cummings interaction with the linear resonator. We also observe a single-photon coupling rate an order of magnitude larger than all decay rates, placing the device in the single-photon strong coupling regime. This demonstration of photon-pressure Jaynes-Cummings interactions paves the way for developing novel photon-pressure quantum information processing hardware and will enable exotic tests of quantum gravity in the future by interfacing this new platform with mechanical resonators.</description>

      <title>A Quantum Approximate Optimization Method For Finding Hadamard Matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07964v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Finding a Hadamard matrix of a specific order using a quantum computer can lead to a demonstration of practical quantum advantage. Earlier efforts using a quantum annealer were impeded by the limitations of the present quantum resource and its capability to implement high order interaction terms, which for an $M$-order matrix will grow by O(M^2). In this paper, we propose a novel qubit-efficient method by implementing the Hadamard matrix searching algorithm on a universal quantum computer. We achieve this by employing the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). Since high order interaction terms that are implemented on a gate-based quantum computer do not need ancillary qubits, the proposed method reduces the required number of qubits into O(M). We present the formulation of the method, construction of corresponding quantum circuits, and experiment results in both a quantum simulator and a real gate-based quantum computer. The experiments successfully found the Baumert-Hall type Hadamard matrices up to 132. These results motivate further efforts to discover previously unknown Hadamard matrices and a prospect to ultimately demonstrate practical quantum advantages</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11893v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Third quantization is used in open quantum systems to construct a superoperator basis in which quadratic Lindbladians can be turned into a normal form. From it follows the spectral properties of the Lindbladian, including eigenvalues and eigenvectors. However, the connection between third quantization and the semiclassical representations usually employed to obtain the dynamics of open quantum systems remains opaque. We introduce a new basis for third quantization that bridges this gap between third quantization and the $Q$ representation by projecting the master equation onto a superoperator coherent state basis. The equation of motion reduces to a multidimensional complex Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.00482v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rydberg atom arrays have emerged as a powerful platform to simulate a number of exotic quantum ground states and phase transitions. To verify these capabilities numerically, we develop a versatile quantum Monte Carlo sampling technique which operates in the reduced Hilbert space generated by enforcing the constraint of a Rydberg blockade. We use the framework of stochastic series expansion and show that in the restricted space, the configuration space of operator strings can be understood as a hard rod gas in $d+1$ dimensions. We use this mapping to develop cluster algorithms which can be visualized as various non-local movements of rods. We study the efficiency of each of our updates individually and collectively. To elucidate the utility of the algorithm, we show that it can efficiently generate the phase diagram of a Rydberg atom array, to temperatures much smaller than all energy scales involved, on a Kagom\'e link lattice. This is of broad interest as the presence of a $Z_2$ spin liquid has been hypothesized recently.</description>

      <title>Projected Stochastic Gradient Descent with Quantum Annealed Binary Gradients</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15128v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present, QP-SBGD, a novel layer-wise stochastic optimiser tailored towards training neural networks with binary weights, known as binary neural networks (BNNs), on quantum hardware. BNNs reduce the computational requirements and energy consumption of deep learning models with minimal loss in accuracy. However, training them in practice remains to be an open challenge. Most known BNN-optimisers either rely on projected updates or binarise weights post-training. Instead, QP-SBGD approximately maps the gradient onto binary variables, by solving a quadratic constrained binary optimisation. Under practically reasonable assumptions, we show that this update rule converges with a rate of $\mathcal{O}(1 / \sqrt{T})$. Moreover, we show how the $\mathcal{NP}$-hard projection can be effectively executed on an adiabatic quantum annealer, harnessing recent advancements in quantum computation. We also introduce a projected version of this update rule and prove that if a fixed point exists in the binary variable space, the modified updates will converge to it. Last but not least, our algorithm is implemented layer-wise, making it suitable to train larger networks on resource-limited quantum hardware. Through extensive evaluations, we show that QP-SBGD outperforms or is on par with competitive and well-established baselines such as BinaryConnect, signSGD and ProxQuant when optimising the Rosenbrock function, training BNNs as well as binary graph neural networks.</description>

Abstract: Among the variational wave functions for Fermionic Hamiltonians, neural network backflow (NNBF) and hidden fermion determinant states (HFDS) are two prominent classes to provide accurate approximations to the ground state. Here we develop a unifying view of fermionic neural quantum states casting them all in the framework of NNBF. NNBF wave-functions have configuration-dependent single-particle orbitals (SPO) which are parameterized by a neural network. We show that HFDS with $r$ hidden fermions can be written as a NNBF with an $r \times r$ determinant Jastrow and a restricted low-rank $r$ additive correction to the SPO. Furthermore, we show that in NNBF wave-functions, such determinant Jastrow's can generically be removed at the cost of further complicating the additive SPO correction increasing its rank by $r$. We numerically and analytically compare additive SPO corrections generated by the product of two matrices with inner dimension $r$. We find that larger $r$ wave-functions span a larger space and give evidence that simpler and more direct updates to the SPO's tend to be more expressive and better energetically. These suggest the standard NNBF approach is preferred amongst other related choices. Finally, we uncover that the row-selection used to select single-particle orbitals allows significant sign and amplitude modulation between nearby configurations and is partially responsible for the quality of NNBF and HFDS wave-functions.</description>

      <title>Q-Seg: Quantum Annealing-Based Unsupervised Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12912v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present Q-Seg, a novel unsupervised image segmentation method based on quantum annealing, tailored for existing quantum hardware. We formulate the pixel-wise segmentation problem, which assimilates spectral and spatial information of the image, as a graph-cut optimization task. Our method efficiently leverages the interconnected qubit topology of the D-Wave Advantage device, offering superior scalability over existing quantum approaches and outperforming several tested state-of-the-art classical methods. Empirical evaluations on synthetic datasets have shown that Q-Seg has better runtime performance than the state-of-the-art classical optimizer Gurobi. The method has also been tested on earth observation image segmentation, a critical area with noisy and unreliable annotations. In the era of noisy intermediate-scale quantum, Q-Seg emerges as a reliable contender for real-world applications in comparison to advanced techniques like Segment Anything. Consequently, Q-Seg offers a promising solution using available quantum hardware, especially in situations constrained by limited labeled data and the need for efficient computational runtime.</description>

      <title>Entangled states from arborescent knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12222v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we discuss how to use arborescent knots to construct entangled multi-qubit states. We show that Bell-states, GHZ-states and cluster states can be constructed from such knots. The latter are particularly interesting since they form a base for the measurement-based quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Understanding the puzzle of angular momentum conservation in beta decay and related processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15011v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We ask the question of how angular momentum is conserved in electroweak interaction processes. To introduce the problem with a minimum of mathematics, we first raise the same issue in elastic scattering of a circularly polarized photon by an atom, where the scattered photon has a different spin direction than the original photon, and note its presence in scattering of a fully relativistic spin-1/2 particle by a central potential. We then consider inverse beta decay in which an electron is emitted following the capture of a neutrino on a nucleus. While both the incident neutrino and final electron spins are antiparallel to their momenta, the final spin is in a different direction than that of the neutrino -- an apparent change of angular momentum. However, prior to measurement of the final particle, in all these cases angular momentum is indeed conserved, The apparent non-conservation of angular momentum arises in the quantum measurement process in which the measuring apparatus does not have an initially well-defined angular momentum, but is localized in the outside world. We generalize the discussion to massive neutrinos and electrons, and examine nuclear beta decay and electron-positron annihilation processes through the same lens, enabling physically transparent derivations of angular and helicity distributions in these reactions.</description>

      <title>Mpemba effects in open nonequilibrium quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03521v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We generalize the classical thermal Mpemba effect (where an initially hot system relaxes faster to the final equilibrium state than a cold one) to open quantum systems coupled to several reservoirs. We show that, in general, two different types of quantum Mpemba effects are possible. They may be distinguished by quantum state tomography. However, the existence of a quantum Mpemba effect (without determining the type) can already be established by measuring simpler observables such as currents or energies. We illustrate our general results for the experimentally feasible case of an interacting two-site Kitaev model coupled to two metallic leads.</description>

      <title>On the Hamiltonian for the Hilbert-P\'olya Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15135v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a recent manuscript~[J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 57 235204 (2024)], a candidate Hamiltonian for the Hilbert-P\'olya Conjecture was introduced. Here, we elegantly demonstrate that the corresponding eigenfunctions are square-integrable and, crucially, that the eigenvalues are real. The latter represents a significant step toward proving the Riemann Hypothesis.</description>
