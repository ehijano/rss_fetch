      <title>CK-MPM: A Compact-Kernel Material Point Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Material Point Method (MPM) has become a cornerstone of physics-based simulation, widely used in geomechanics and computer graphics for modeling phenomena such as granular flows, viscoelasticity, fracture mechanics, etc. Despite its versatility, the original MPM suffers from cell-crossing instabilities caused by discontinuities in particle-grid transfer kernels. Existing solutions mitigate these issues by adopting smoother shape functions, but at the cost of increased computational overhead due to larger kernel support. In this paper, we propose a novel $C^2$-continuous compact kernel for MPM that achieves a unique balance between stability and computational efficiency. Our method integrates seamlessly with Affine Particle-In-Cell (APIC) and Moving Least Squares (MLS) MPM, while only doubling the number of grid nodes associated with each particle compared to linear kernels. At its core is an innovative dual-grid framework, which associates particles with grid nodes exclusively within the cells they occupy on two staggered grids, ensuring consistent and stable force computations. To further accelerate performance, we present a GPU-optimized implementation inspired by state-of-the-art massively parallel MPM techniques, achieving an additional $2\times$ speedup in G2P2G transfers over quadratic B-spline MPM. Comprehensive validation through unit tests, comparative studies, and stress tests demonstrates the efficacy of our approach in conserving both linear and angular momentum, handling stiff materials, and scaling efficiently for large-scale simulations. Our results highlight the transformative potential of compact, high-order kernels in advancing MPM's capabilities for stable, high-performance simulations, paving the way for more computationally efficient applications in computer graphics and beyond.</description>

      <title>Novel 3D Binary Indexed Tree for Volume Computation of 3D Reconstructed Models from Volumetric Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the burgeoning field of medical imaging, precise computation of 3D volume holds a significant importance for subsequent qualitative analysis of 3D reconstructed objects. Combining multivariate calculus, marching cube algorithm, and binary indexed tree data structure, we developed an algorithm for efficient computation of intrinsic volume of any volumetric data recovered from computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance (MR). We proposed the 30 configurations of volume values based on the polygonal mesh generation method. Our algorithm processes the data in scan-line order simultaneously with reconstruction algorithm to create a Fenwick tree, ensuring query time much faster and assisting users' edition of slicing or transforming model. We tested the algorithm's accuracy on simple 3D objects (e.g., sphere, cylinder) to complicated structures (e.g., lungs, cardiac chambers). The result deviated within $\pm 0.004 \text{cm}^3$ and there is still room for further improvement.</description>

      <title>CAP: Evaluation of Persuasive and Creative Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the task of advertisement image generation and introduce three evaluation metrics to assess Creativity, prompt Alignment, and Persuasiveness (CAP) in generated advertisement images. Despite recent advancements in Text-to-Image (T2I) generation and their performance in generating high-quality images for explicit descriptions, evaluating these models remains challenging. Existing evaluation methods focus largely on assessing alignment with explicit, detailed descriptions, but evaluating alignment with visually implicit prompts remains an open problem. Additionally, creativity and persuasiveness are essential qualities that enhance the effectiveness of advertisement images, yet are seldom measured. To address this, we propose three novel metrics for evaluating the creativity, alignment, and persuasiveness of generated images. Our findings reveal that current T2I models struggle with creativity, persuasiveness, and alignment when the input text is implicit messages. We further introduce a simple yet effective approach to enhance T2I models' capabilities in producing images that are better aligned, more creative, and more persuasive.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Cross-Domain Regression for Fine-grained 3D Game Character Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rise of the ``metaverse'' and the rapid development of games, it has become more and more critical to reconstruct characters in the virtual world faithfully. The immersive experience is one of the most central themes of the ``metaverse'', while the reducibility of the avatar is the crucial point. Meanwhile, the game is the carrier of the metaverse, in which players can freely edit the facial appearance of the game character. In this paper, we propose a simple but powerful cross-domain framework that can reconstruct fine-grained 3D game characters from single-view images in an end-to-end manner. Different from the previous methods, which do not resolve the cross-domain gap, we propose an effective regressor that can greatly reduce the discrepancy between the real-world domain and the game domain. To figure out the drawbacks of no ground truth, our unsupervised framework has accomplished the knowledge transfer of the target domain. Additionally, an innovative contrastive loss is proposed to solve the instance-wise disparity, which keeps the person-specific details of the reconstructed character. In contrast, an auxiliary 3D identity-aware extractor is activated to make the results of our model more impeccable. Then a large set of physically meaningful facial parameters is generated robustly and exquisitely. Experiments demonstrate that our method yields state-of-the-art performance in 3D game character reconstruction.</description>

      <title>SVGFusion: Scalable Text-to-SVG Generation via Vector Space Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The generation of Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) assets from textual data remains a significant challenge, largely due to the scarcity of high-quality vector datasets and the limitations in scalable vector representations required for modeling intricate graphic distributions. This work introduces SVGFusion, a Text-to-SVG model capable of scaling to real-world SVG data without reliance on a text-based discrete language model or prolonged SDS optimization. The essence of SVGFusion is to learn a continuous latent space for vector graphics with a popular Text-to-Image framework. Specifically, SVGFusion consists of two modules: a Vector-Pixel Fusion Variational Autoencoder (VP-VAE) and a Vector Space Diffusion Transformer (VS-DiT). VP-VAE takes both the SVGs and corresponding rasterizations as inputs and learns a continuous latent space, whereas VS-DiT learns to generate a latent code within this space based on the text prompt. Based on VP-VAE, a novel rendering sequence modeling strategy is proposed to enable the latent space to embed the knowledge of construction logics in SVGs. This empowers the model to achieve human-like design capabilities in vector graphics, while systematically preventing occlusion in complex graphic compositions. Moreover, our SVGFusion's ability can be continuously improved by leveraging the scalability of the VS-DiT by adding more VS-DiT blocks. A large-scale SVG dataset is collected to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method. Extensive experimentation has confirmed the superiority of our SVGFusion over existing SVG generation methods, achieving enhanced quality and generalizability, thereby establishing a novel framework for SVG content creation. Code, model, and data will be released at: \href{https://ximinng.github.io/SVGFusionProject/}{https://ximinng.github.io/SVGFusionProject/}</description>

      <title>Motion Generation Review: Exploring Deep Learning for Lifelike Animation with Manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human motion generation involves creating natural sequences of human body poses, widely used in gaming, virtual reality, and human-computer interaction. It aims to produce lifelike virtual characters with realistic movements, enhancing virtual agents and immersive experiences. While previous work has focused on motion generation based on signals like movement, music, text, or scene background, the complexity of human motion and its relationships with these signals often results in unsatisfactory outputs. Manifold learning offers a solution by reducing data dimensionality and capturing subspaces of effective motion. In this review, we present a comprehensive overview of manifold applications in human motion generation, one of the first in this domain. We explore methods for extracting manifolds from unstructured data, their application in motion generation, and discuss their advantages and future directions. This survey aims to provide a broad perspective on the field and stimulate new approaches to ongoing challenges.</description>

      <title>SVGBuilder: Component-Based Colored SVG Generation with Text-Guided Autoregressive Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) are essential XML-based formats for versatile graphics, offering resolution independence and scalability. Unlike raster images, SVGs use geometric shapes and support interactivity, animation, and manipulation via CSS and JavaScript. Current SVG generation methods face challenges related to high computational costs and complexity. In contrast, human designers use component-based tools for efficient SVG creation. Inspired by this, SVGBuilder introduces a component-based, autoregressive model for generating high-quality colored SVGs from textual input. It significantly reduces computational overhead and improves efficiency compared to traditional methods. Our model generates SVGs up to 604 times faster than optimization-based approaches. To address the limitations of existing SVG datasets and support our research, we introduce ColorSVG-100K, the first large-scale dataset of colored SVGs, comprising 100,000 graphics. This dataset fills the gap in color information for SVG generation models and enhances diversity in model training. Evaluation against state-of-the-art models demonstrates SVGBuilder's superior performance in practical applications, highlighting its efficiency and quality in generating complex SVG graphics.</description>

      <title>A Pioneering Neural Network Method for Efficient and Robust Fuel Sloshing Simulation in Aircraft</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulating fuel sloshing within aircraft tanks during flight is crucial for aircraft safety research. Traditional methods based on Navier-Stokes equations are computationally expensive. In this paper, we treat fluid motion as point cloud transformation and propose the first neural network method specifically designed for simulating fuel sloshing in aircraft. This model is also the deep learning model that is the first to be capable of stably modeling fluid particle dynamics in such complex scenarios. Our triangle feature fusion design achieves an optimal balance among fluid dynamics modeling, momentum conservation constraints, and global stability control. Additionally, we constructed the Fueltank dataset, the first dataset for aircraft fuel surface sloshing. It comprises 320,000 frames across four typical tank types and covers a wide range of flight maneuvers, including multi-directional rotations. We conducted comprehensive experiments on both our dataset and the take-off scenario of the aircraft. Compared to existing neural network-based fluid simulation algorithms, we significantly enhanced accuracy while maintaining high computational speed. Compared to traditional SPH methods, our speed improved approximately 10 times. Furthermore, compared to traditional fluid simulation software such as Flow3D, our computation speed increased by more than 300 times.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconstructing meshes from point clouds is an important task in fields such as robotics, autonomous systems, and medical imaging. This survey examines state-of-the-art learning-based approaches to mesh reconstruction, categorizing them into five paradigms: PointNet family, autoencoder architectures, deformation-based methods, point-move techniques, and primitive-based approaches. Each paradigm is explored in depth, detailing the primary approaches and their underlying methodologies. By comparing these techniques, our study serves as a comprehensive guide, and equips researchers and practitioners with the knowledge to navigate the landscape of learning-based mesh reconstruction techniques. The findings underscore the transformative potential of these methods, which often surpass traditional techniques in allowing detailed and efficient reconstructions.</description>

      <title>GenLit: Reformulating Single-Image Relighting as Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Manipulating the illumination within a single image represents a fundamental challenge in computer vision and graphics. This problem has been traditionally addressed using inverse rendering techniques, which require explicit 3D asset reconstruction and costly ray tracing simulations. Meanwhile, recent advancements in visual foundation models suggest that a new paradigm could soon be practical and possible -- one that replaces explicit physical models with networks that are trained on massive amounts of image and video data. In this paper, we explore the potential of exploiting video diffusion models, and in particular Stable Video Diffusion (SVD), in understanding the physical world to perform relighting tasks given a single image. Specifically, we introduce GenLit, a framework that distills the ability of a graphics engine to perform light manipulation into a video generation model, enabling users to directly insert and manipulate a point light in the 3D world within a given image and generate the results directly as a video sequence. We find that a model fine-tuned on only a small synthetic dataset (270 objects) is able to generalize to real images, enabling single-image relighting with realistic ray tracing effects and cast shadows. These results reveal the ability of video foundation models to capture rich information about lighting, material, and shape. Our findings suggest that such models, with minimal training, can be used for physically-based rendering without explicit physically asset reconstruction and complex ray tracing. This further suggests the potential of such models for controllable and physically accurate image synthesis tasks.</description>

      <title>VividFace: A Diffusion-Based Hybrid Framework for High-Fidelity Video Face Swapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Video face swapping is becoming increasingly popular across various applications, yet existing methods primarily focus on static images and struggle with video face swapping because of temporal consistency and complex scenarios. In this paper, we present the first diffusion-based framework specifically designed for video face swapping. Our approach introduces a novel image-video hybrid training framework that leverages both abundant static image data and temporal video sequences, addressing the inherent limitations of video-only training. The framework incorporates a specially designed diffusion model coupled with a VidFaceVAE that effectively processes both types of data to better maintain temporal coherence of the generated videos. To further disentangle identity and pose features, we construct the Attribute-Identity Disentanglement Triplet (AIDT) Dataset, where each triplet has three face images, with two images sharing the same pose and two sharing the same identity. Enhanced with a comprehensive occlusion augmentation, this dataset also improves robustness against occlusions. Additionally, we integrate 3D reconstruction techniques as input conditioning to our network for handling large pose variations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves superior performance in identity preservation, temporal consistency, and visual quality compared to existing methods, while requiring fewer inference steps. Our approach effectively mitigates key challenges in video face swapping, including temporal flickering, identity preservation, and robustness to occlusions and pose variations.</description>

      <title>MeshArt: Generating Articulated Meshes with Structure-guided Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Articulated 3D object generation is fundamental for creating realistic, functional, and interactable virtual assets which are not simply static. We introduce MeshArt, a hierarchical transformer-based approach to generate articulated 3D meshes with clean, compact geometry, reminiscent of human-crafted 3D models. We approach articulated mesh generation in a part-by-part fashion across two stages. First, we generate a high-level articulation-aware object structure; then, based on this structural information, we synthesize each part's mesh faces. Key to our approach is modeling both articulation structures and part meshes as sequences of quantized triangle embeddings, leading to a unified hierarchical framework with transformers for autoregressive generation. Object part structures are first generated as their bounding primitives and articulation modes; a second transformer, guided by these articulation structures, then generates each part's mesh triangles. To ensure coherency among generated parts, we introduce structure-guided conditioning that also incorporates local part mesh connectivity. MeshArt shows significant improvements over state of the art, with 57.1% improvement in structure coverage and a 209-point improvement in mesh generation FID.</description>

      <title>Deformable Radial Kernel Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, Gaussian splatting has emerged as a robust technique for representing 3D scenes, enabling real-time rasterization and high-fidelity rendering. However, Gaussians' inherent radial symmetry and smoothness constraints limit their ability to represent complex shapes, often requiring thousands of primitives to approximate detailed geometry. We introduce Deformable Radial Kernel (DRK), which extends Gaussian splatting into a more general and flexible framework. Through learnable radial bases with adjustable angles and scales, DRK efficiently models diverse shape primitives while enabling precise control over edge sharpness and boundary curvature. iven DRK's planar nature, we further develop accurate ray-primitive intersection computation for depth sorting and introduce efficient kernel culling strategies for improved rasterization efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DRK outperforms existing methods in both representation efficiency and rendering quality, achieving state-of-the-art performance while dramatically reducing primitive count.</description>

      <title>GS-ProCams: Gaussian Splatting-based Projector-Camera Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present GS-ProCams, the first Gaussian Splatting-based framework for projector-camera systems (ProCams). GS-ProCams significantly enhances the efficiency of projection mapping (PM) that requires establishing geometric and radiometric mappings between the projector and the camera. Previous CNN-based ProCams are constrained to a specific viewpoint, limiting their applicability to novel perspectives. In contrast, NeRF-based ProCams support view-agnostic projection mapping, however, they require an additional colocated light source and demand significant computational and memory resources. To address this issue, we propose GS-ProCams that employs 2D Gaussian for scene representations, and enables efficient view-agnostic ProCams applications. In particular, we explicitly model the complex geometric and photometric mappings of ProCams using projector responses, the target surface's geometry and materials represented by Gaussians, and global illumination component. Then, we employ differentiable physically-based rendering to jointly estimate them from captured multi-view projections. Compared to state-of-the-art NeRF-based methods, our GS-ProCams eliminates the need for additional devices, achieving superior ProCams simulation quality. It is also 600 times faster and uses only 1/10 of the GPU memory.</description>

      <title>GSDiff: Synthesizing Vector Floorplans via Geometry-enhanced Structural Graph Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16258</link>

Abstract: Automating architectural floorplan design is vital for housing and interior design, offering a faster, cost-effective alternative to manual sketches by architects. However, existing methods, including rule-based and learning-based approaches, face challenges in design complexity and constrained generation with extensive post-processing, and tend to obvious geometric inconsistencies such as misalignment, overlap, and gaps. In this work, we propose a novel generative framework for vector floorplan design via structural graph generation, called GSDiff, focusing on wall junction generation and wall segment prediction to capture both geometric and semantic aspects of structural graphs. To improve the geometric rationality of generated structural graphs, we propose two innovative geometry enhancement methods. In wall junction generation, we propose a novel alignment loss function to improve geometric consistency. In wall segment prediction, we propose a random self-supervision method to enhance the model's perception of the overall geometric structure, thereby promoting the generation of reasonable geometric structures. Employing the diffusion model and the Transformer model, as well as the geometry enhancement strategies, our framework can generate wall junctions, wall segments and room polygons with structural and semantic information, resulting in structural graphs that accurately represent floorplans. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method surpasses existing techniques, enabling free generation and constrained generation, marking a shift towards structure generation in architectural design.

      <title>Perm: A Parametric Representation for Multi-Style 3D Hair Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19451v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present Perm, a learned parametric representation of human 3D hair designed to facilitate various hair-related applications. Unlike previous work that jointly models the global hair structure and local curl patterns, we propose to disentangle them using a PCA-based strand representation in the frequency domain, thereby allowing more precise editing and output control. Specifically, we leverage our strand representation to fit and decompose hair geometry textures into low- to high-frequency hair structures, termed guide textures and residual textures, respectively. These decomposed textures are later parameterized with different generative models, emulating common stages in the hair grooming process. We conduct extensive experiments to validate the architecture design of Perm, and finally deploy the trained model as a generic prior to solve task-agnostic problems, further showcasing its flexibility and superiority in tasks such as single-view hair reconstruction, hairstyle editing, and hair-conditioned image generation.

      <title>Exploiting ray tracing technology through OptiX to compute particle interactions with cutoff in a 3D environment on GPU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14247v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computing on graphics processing units (GPUs) has become standard in scientific computing, allowing for incredible performance gains over classical CPUs for many computational methods. As GPUs were originally designed for 3D rendering, they still have several features for that purpose that are not used in scientific computing. Among them, ray tracing is a powerful technology used to render 3D scenes. In this paper, we propose exploiting ray tracing technology to compute particle interactions with a cutoff distance in a 3D environment. We describe algorithmic tricks and geometric patterns to find the interaction lists for each particle. This approach allows us to compute interactions with quasi-linear complexity in the number of particles without building a grid of cells or an explicit kd-tree. We compare the performance of our approach with a classical approach based on a grid of cells and show that, currently, ours is slower in most cases but could pave the way for future methods.</description>
