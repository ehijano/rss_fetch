      <title>A novel Gapless Quantum Spin Liquid in the S = 1 4d4-honeycomb material Cu3LiRu2O6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a novel gapless quantum spin liquid in the S=1 honeycomb system Cu3LiRu2O6 with Ru4+ (4d4) where moments remain dynamic down to 50 mK. Heat capacity measurements show no sign of magnetic ordering down to 60 mK in spite of a Curie-Weiss temperature = -222 K indicating a strong antiferromagnetic interaction. In zero field, magnetic heat capacity shows a linear T-dependence with Sommerfeld coefficient = 107 mJ/mol K2 is much larger than that found in typical Fermi liquids. Our local probe 7Li nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements find a significant temperature-independent 7Li NMR shift (and hence a non-zero spin susceptibility) at low-T and a linear T-variation of the 7Li NMR spin-lattice relaxation rate 1/T1 at low-T reminiscent of fermionic excitations. Muon spin relaxation measurements detect neither long-range ordering nor spin freezing down to 50 mK and the temperature variation of the muon depolarization rate shows a gradual increase with decreasing temperature and a leveling off below about 1 K evincing a persistent spin dynamics common to several spin liquid candidates. Our results provide strong signatures of a quantum spin liquid in the titled honeycomb material.</description>

      <title>Singularity and universality from von Neumann to R\'enyi entanglement entropy and disorder operator in Motzkin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The R\'enyi entanglement entropy is widely used in studying quantum entanglement properties in strongly correlated systems, whose analytic continuation as $n \to 1$ is often believed to give rise to the celebrated von Neumann entanglement entropy. However, this process for the colored Motzkin spin chain exhibits a singularity that yields different scaling behaviors of $\sim \sqrt{l}$ and $\sim \log{l}$ for the von Neumann and R\'enyi entropies, respectively. It can be understood by the exponential increasing desity of states in its entanglement spectrum. We have also employed disorder operators under various symmetries to study such a system. The analytical and numerical results reveal that the scaling of disorder operators is also $\log{l}$ in the leading term, the same as the R\'enyi entanglement entropy. We propose that the coefficient of the term $\log{l}$ $l$ is a universal constant, both in R\'enyi entropies and disorder operators, which could be used to identify the constraint physics of Motzkin walks.</description>

      <title>Spin-forbidden excitations in the magneto-optical spectra of CrI$_3$ tuned by covalency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-forbidden ($\Delta S \neq 0$) multiplet excitations and their coupling to magnetic properties are of increasing importance for magneto-optical studies of correlated materials. Nonetheless, the mechanisms for optically brightening these transitions and their generality remain poorly understood. Here, we report magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) spectroscopy on the van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnet (FM) CrI$_3$. Previously unreported spin-forbidden ($\Delta S = 1$) ${}^4A_{2\mathrm{g}} \to{}^2E_\mathrm{g}/{}^2T_{1\mathrm{g}}$ Cr${}^{3+}$ $dd$ excitations are observed near the ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) excitation threshold. The assignment of these excitations and their Cr$^{3+}$ multiplet character is established through complementary Cr $L_3$-edge resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) measurements along with charge transfer multiplet (CTM) calculations and chemical trends in the chromium trihalide series (CrX$_3$, X = Cl, Br, I). We utilize the high sensitivity of MCD spectroscopy to study the thickness dependent optical response. The spin-forbidden excitations remain robust down to the monolayer limit and exhibit a significant magnetic field tunability across the antiferromagnetic to FM transition in few-layer samples. This behavior is associated to changes in the metal-ligand covalency with magnetic state, as supported by our CTM analysis. Our results clarify the magneto-optical response of CrI$_3$ and identify covalency as a central mechanism for the brightening and field-tunability of spin-forbidden multiplet excitations.</description>

      <title>Diagonal superexchange in a simple square CuO$_2$ lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many microscopic models with interaction between the next-nearest neighbours as a key parameter to cuprate physics inspired us to study here the diagonal superexchange interaction in the CuO$_2$ layer. Our investigation shows the models with extended hopping give a correct representation of magnetic interactions only in a hypothetical square CuO$_2$ layer, where the diagonal superexchange interaction with the next-nearest neighbours neighbors always has the AFM nature. The conclusions are based on the presence of a symmetry prohibition on the FM contribution to the total diagonal superexchange between the next-nearest neighbors for a simple square CuO$_2$ layer, but not for the real CuO$_2$ layer. We actually confirm also there are justified reasons to consider magnetic frustrations and high sensitivity of spin nanoinhomogeneity to a breaking square symmetry.</description>

      <title>Magnetic metastability driven Anomalous Hall Effect in Fe$_{x}$TaS$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have investigated the magnetic and transport properties of Fe-intercalated TaS$2$ single crystals. The material exhibits ferromagnetic order with very high anisotropy, with the $c$-axis as the easy axis. The magnetic moments of the compound become arrested during field cooling in magnetic fields above 500 Oe. As a result, it retains thermoremanent magnetization (TRM) up to the transition temperature ($T_C$). Fe$_{x}$TaS$_2$ displays a large anomalous Hall effect (AHE) with a pronounced hysteresis loop, similar to the isothermal magnetization. Our key observation suggests that the presence of TRM breaks the time-reversal symmetry below $T_C$, producing an AHE in zero applied field with the same value as that obtained from typical field variation. Scaling analysis indicates that skew scattering is the primary mechanism for the observed AHE.</description>

      <title>Quasi-two-dimensional Fermi surfaces of the antiferromagnet U$_2$RhIn$_8$ revealed by de Haas-van Alphen measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report temperature-dependent Hall effect and low-temperature de Haas-van Alphen (dHvA) effect measurements of the antiferromagnetic heavy-fermion compound U$_2$RhIn$_8$. Temperature dependence of the Hall resistivity suggests a considerable reduction of the carrier density in the antiferromagnetic phase. The observed angular dependence of the dHvA frequencies suggests the existence of three almost ideally two-dimensional Fermi surfaces one of which is quite large. The measured effective masses range from 2$m_0$ to 14$m_0$ for the field applied along the $c$ axis. Local density approximation band-structure calculations performed for the paramagnetic ground state reveal more three-dimensional Fermi surfaces than those observed in the experiment. On the other hand, Fermi surfaces obtained for the antiferromagnetic ground state by band folding are more two dimensional. These calculations account reasonably well for the experimental results assuming a slight modification of the calculated Fermi surfaces.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Phase Diagram of YbRh$_{2}$Si$_{2}$: the Influence of Hyperfine Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the determination of the magnetic phase diagram of the heavy fermion metal YbRh\textsubscript{2}Si\textsubscript{2} in magnetic fields up to 70\,mT applied perpendicular to the crystallographic c-axis. By a combination of heat capacity, magneto-caloric, and magneto-resistance measurements we map two antiferromagnetic phases: the electronic AFM1 below 70\,mK and electro-nuclear AFM2 below 1.5\,mK. The measurements extend into the microkelvin regime to explore the quantum phase transitions in this system. We demonstrate how the hyperfine interaction significantly modifies the phase diagram and the putative field-tuned quantum critical point. The determination of the rich magnetic properties of YbRh\textsubscript{2}Si\textsubscript{2} is essential to understanding the interplay of the two magnetic orders and superconductivity in this compound.</description>

      <title>Universal transport at Lifshitz metal-insulator transitions in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the charge transport across a band-tuned metal-insulator transition in two dimensions. For high temperatures $T$ and chemical potentials $\mu$ far from the transition point, conduction is ballistic and the resistance $R(T)$ verifies a simple one-parameter scaling relation. Here, we explore the limits of this semi-classical behaviour and study the quantum regime beyond, where scaling breaks down. We derive an analytical formula for the simplest Feynman diagram of the linear-response conductivity $\sigma=1/R$ of a parabolic band endowed with a finite lifetime. Our formula shows excellent agreement for experiments for a field-tuned MoTe$_2$/WSe$_2$ moir\'e bilayer, and can capture the quantum effects responsible for breaking the one-parameter scaling. We go on to discuss a fascinating prediction of our model: The resistance at the quantum-critical band-tuned Lifshitz point ($\mu=T=0$) has the universal value, $R_L=(2 \pi h)/e^2$, per degree of freedom and this value is found to be compatible with experiment. Furthermore, we investigate whether two dimensional metal-insulator transitions driven by strong electron correlations or disorder can also be classified by their quantum-critical resistance and find that $R_L$ may be useful in identifying predominantly interaction driven transitions.</description>

      <title>Single crystal growth and physical characterization to fine tune YbIn1-xTxCu4 (T = Au, Ag) towards the critical endpoint of the valence transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pure as well as Ag- and Au-substituted YbInCu$_4$ single crystals were structurally and chemically characterized and investigated by means of heat capacity, magnetization, resistivity and ultrasonic measurements. We studied the influence of different compositions of the initial melt as well as of Au and Ag substitutions on the valence change and investigated whether this change occurs via a first-order phase transition or via crossover. We constructed a phase diagram of YbInCu$_4$ as a function of various substitutions and show that the position of the critical endpoint of the valence transition depends on the substituent and on the conditions under which the samples were grown. Multiple thermal cycles through the first-order transition lead to a significant modification of the physical properties which clearly demonstrated the influence of defects in substituted YbInCu$_4$.</description>

      <title>Electrically driven resonant magnetization, spin-pumping and charge-to-spin conversion from chiral-spin modes at THz frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chiral-spin modes are collective excitations of a spin-orbit (SO) coupled system that lead to resonances in many observables. Here we identify resonances in "cross-response", i.e., electric-field induced magnetization and magnetic-field induced electric currents, known also as the Edelstein effect and its inverse, respectively. We show that the chiral-spin modes resonantly enhance the electrically induced magnetization. As specific examples, we consider a single-valley two-dimensional electron gas with Rashba or Dresselhaus SO coupling and a two-valley Dirac system with proximity-induced Rashba and valley-Zeeman SO couplings. We suggest an architecture for a spin-pumping experiment based on THz excitation of chiral-spin modes, which would demonstrate a resonant enhancement of charge-to-spin conversion.</description>

      <title>Phonon-mediated electron attraction in SrTiO$_3$ via the generalized Fr\"ohlich and deformation potential mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconductivity in doped SrTiO$_3$ was discovered in 1964, the first superconducting transition observed in a doped semiconductor. However, the mechanism behind electron pairing in SrTiO$_3$ remains a subject of debate. By developing a theoretical framework to incorporate dynamical lattice screening in the electronic Coulomb interactions of semiconductors and insulators, we demonstrate analytically that long-range electron-phonon interactions described by a generalized multi-phonon Fr\"ohlich mechanism result in phonon-mediated electron-electron attraction in SrTiO$_3$. Moreover, by combining our theory with first-principles calculations, we reveal an additional attractive interaction between electrons in SrTiO$_3$ due to the deformation potential mechanism, arising from the mixed ionic-covalent character of the Ti-O bond. Our results may have implications for the emergence of phonon-mediated electron attraction and superconductivity in a broader range of materials.</description>

      <title>System-environmental entanglement in critical spin systems under $ZZ$-decoherence and its relation to strong and weak symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Open quantum many-body system exhibits nontrivial behavior under decoherence. In particular, system-environmental entanglement is one of quantities to characterize mixed state properties under decoherence. In this study, we investigate the behavior of the system-environmental entanglement for critical spin chains under nearest-neighbor $ZZ$ -decoherence. We numerically find that the system-environmental entanglement exhibits a specific scaling law including a system-independent universal term ("$g$-function"). For the critical XXZ model, transition to strong-to-weak spontaneously symmetry breaking mixed state takes place. In that case, the $g$-function changes its value at decoherent transition point and gets double the value of system under single-site $Z$-decoherence, which was recently studied by conformal field theory. By studying Shannon entropy, we clarify origin of this $g$-function behavior.</description>

      <title>Entanglement-informed Construction of Variational Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) is a promising tool for simulating ground states of quantum many-body systems on noisy quantum computers. Its effectiveness relies heavily on the ansatz, which must be both hardware-efficient for implementation on noisy hardware and problem-specific to avoid local minima and convergence problems. In this article, we explore entanglement-informed ansatz schemes that naturally emerge from specific models, aiming to balance accuracy with minimal use of two-qubit entangling gates, allowing for efficient use of techniques such as quantum circuit cutting. We focus on three models of quasi-1D Hamiltonians: (i) systems with impurities acting as entanglement barriers, (ii) systems with competing long-range and short-range interactions transitioning from a long-range singlet to a quantum critical state, and (iii) random quantum critical systems. For the first model, we observe a plateau in the ansatz accuracy, controlled by the number of entangling gates between subsystems. This behavior is explained by iterative capture of eigenvalues in the entanglement spectrum. In the second model, combining long-range and short-range entanglement schemes yields the best overall accuracy, leading to global convergence in the entanglement spectrum. For the third model, we use an renormalization group approach to build the short- and long-range entanglement structure of the ansatz. Our comprehensive analysis provides a new perspective on the design of ans\"atze based on the expected entanglement structure of the approximated state.</description>

      <title>Bulk superconductivity in pressurized trilayer nickelate Pr4Ni3O10 single crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of superconductivity in pressurized bilayer and trilayer nickelates have generated significant interest. However, their superconducting properties are often dependent on sample quality and pressure conditions, complicating the interpretation of the underlying physics. Finding new systems with optimized bulk superconducting properties is therefore important for advancing our understanding of these materials. Unlike cupates, where trilayer compounds typically exhibit the highest transition temperature (Tc), the bilayer nickelate La3Ni2O7 has thus far outperformed the trilayer La4Ni3O10 in reported Tc. Whether the trilayer nickelates have achieved the optimal Tc remains unclear, with various scenarios suggesting different possibilities. Here, we report the discovery of bulk superconductivity in pressurized Pr4Ni3O10 single crystals, achieving a maximum onset Tc of 40.5 K at 80.1 GPa, significantly exceeding the 30 K observed in La4Ni3O10. The bulk nature of superconductivity is confirmed by zero resistance and a strong diamagnetic response bellow Tc with a superconducting volume fraction exceeding 80%. These findings establish trilayer nickelates as genuine bulk high-temperature superconductors, provide new insights into the mechanisms driving superconductivity, and point to a promising route toward further enhancing superconducting properties in nickelates.</description>

      <title>Quantum oscillations in a dipolar excitonic insulator</title>

Abstract: Quantum oscillations in magnetization or resistivity are a defining feature of metals subject to an external magnetic field. The phenomenon is generally not expected in insulators without a Fermi surface. The observations of quantum oscillations in Kondo insulating materials have provided a rare counterexample and attracted much theoretical interest. However, the magnetic oscillations in correlated insulators remain poorly understood. Here we report the observations of resistivity quantum oscillations in an excitonic insulator realized in Coulomb-coupled electron-hole double layers with gate-tunability that allows the phenomenon to be explored in a more controllable fashion than in bulk materials. When the cyclotron energy of the electrons or holes is tuned to be comparable to or larger than the exciton binding energy, recurring transitions between excitonic insulators and electron-hole decoupled quantum Hall states are observed. Compressibility measurements show an oscillatory exciton binding energy as a function of magnetic field and electron-hole pair density. Coulomb drag measurements further reveal the formation of excitons with finite angular momentum. Our results are qualitatively captured by mean-field theory calculations. The study demonstrates a new platform for studying quantum oscillations in correlated insulators.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Symmetry Instability induced by Topological Phase Transitions</title>

Abstract: The symmetry-topology interplay dictates how to define order parameters and classify material ordered phases. However, current understanding of this interplay has been predominately approached from a one-sided perspective, with topological states being classified within the constraints imposed by specific fixed symmetries. Here we complete this full circle by demonstrating spontaneous symmetry breaking that results from a periodic alteration of topological phases induced by light in a centrosymmetric Dirac material ZrTe$_5$. The distinguishing feature is the observation of robust correlation and striking anomalies in the fluence and temperature dependence of key transport parameters.First, both shift current $J_{\text{s}}$ and displacement current $J_{\text{d}}$, arising from interband transition and infrared phonon driving, respectively, along with charge carrier pumping, exhibit similar behaviors. Second, they all peak at similar low pump fluence, followed by a subsequent reduction as the fluence further increases. This behavior cannot be explained by conventional energetically allowed, direct excitations. Third, all the three observables exhibit anomalies when they approach the topological phase transition temperature. These results highlight the unique low-energy pumping behaviors in ZrTe$_5$, characterized by reversible fluence dependence and a 'hinge-like' interaction that connects various electronic and lattice observables, including phonons, charge carriers, and currents. Our findings, supported by model analysis, provide key insights into the fragility of crystalline (inversion) and time-reversal symmetries during the dynamics of topological phase transitions. This fragility drives spontaneous symmetry breaking, evidenced by the synchronized emergence of off-resonant infrared phonons and broken-symmetry photocurrents.</description>

      <title>Effects of Co substitution on the structural and magnetic properties of Sr(Ni$_{1-x}$Co$_x$)$_2$P$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.01805v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although SrNi$_2$P$_2$ adopts the common ThCr$_2$Si$_2$ structure for $T\geq 325$ K, being in an uncollapsed tetragonal state, on cooling below 325 K it adopts a one-third collapsed orthorhombic phase where one out of every three P rows bond across the Sr layers. On the other hand, SrCo$_2$P$_2$ only exhibits the uncollapsed ThCr$_2$Si$_2$ structure from room temperature down to 1.8 K. Neither SrNi$_2$P$_2$ nor SrCo$_2$P$_2$ manifests magnetic transitions down to 50 mK and 2 K, respectively. In this work we report the effects of Co substitution in Sr(Ni$_{1-x}$Co$_x$)$_2$P$_2$, which allows for tuning the transition between the one-third collapsed and the uncollapsed structure. We find a rapid decrease of the one-third collapsed structural transition temperature with increasing Co fraction, until reaching full suppression for $x \geq 0.1$. Substitution levels in the range $0.11\leq x\leq 0.58$ show no signs of any transition down to 1.8 K in the magnetization or resistance measurements in the range $1.8\ \text{K}\leq T\leq 300\ \text{K}$. However, different magnetically ordered states emerge for $x\geq 0.65$, and disappear for $x\geq 0.99$, recovering the known paramagnetic properties of the parent compound SrCo$_2$P$_2$. These results are summarized in a phase diagram, built upon the characterization done on single crystals with different Co fraction. Both the magnetic and structural properties are compared to other systems with ThCr$_2$Si$_2$ structure that exhibit magnetic ordering and collapsed tetragonal transitions. The magnetic ordering and moment formation are well described by Takahashi's spin fluctuation theory of itinerant electron magnetism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.00147v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Kitaev honeycomb model supports gapless and gapped quantum spin liquid phases. Its exact solvability relies on extensively many locally conserved quantities. Any real-world manifestation of these phases would include imperfections in the form of disorder and interactions that break integrability. We show that the latter qualitatively alters the properties of vacancies in the gapless Kitaev spin liquid: (i) Isolated vacancies carry a magnetic moment, which is absent in the exactly solvable case. (ii) Pairs of vacancies on even/opposite sublattices gap each other with distinct power laws that reveal the presence of emergent gauge flux.</description>

      <title>Field-orientation-dependent magnetic phases in GdRu$_2$Si$_2$ probed with muon-spin spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09431v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Centrosymmetric GdRu$_2$Si$_2$ exhibits a variety of multi-Q magnetic states as a function of temperature and applied magnetic field, including a square skyrmion-lattice phase. The material's behavior is strongly dependent on the direction of the applied field, with different phase diagrams resulting for fields applied parallel or perpendicular to the crystallographic $c$ axis. Here, we present the results of muon-spin relaxation ($\mu^+$SR) measurements on single crystals of GdRu$_2$Si$_2$. Our analysis is based on the computation of muon stopping sites and consideration of zero-point motion effects, allowing direct comparison with the underlying spin textures in the material. The muon site is confirmed experimentally, using angle-dependent measurements of the muon Knight shift. Using transverse-field $\mu^+$SR with fields applied along either the [001] or [100] crystallographic directions, we distinguish between the magnetic phases in this system via their distinct muon response, providing additional evidence for the skyrmion and meron-lattice phases, while also suggesting the existence of RKKY-driven muon hyperfine coupling. Zero-field $\mu^+$SR provides clear evidence for a transition between two distinct magnetically-ordered phases at 39 K.</description>

      <title>Structure and dynamics of electron-phonon coupled systems using neural quantum states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08701v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we use neural quantum states (NQS) to describe the high-dimensional wave functions of electron-phonon coupled systems. We demonstrate that NQS can accurately and systematically learn the underlying physics of such problems through a variational Monte Carlo optimization of the energy with minimal incorporation of physical information even in highly challenging cases. We assess the ability of our approach across various lattice model examples featuring different types of couplings. The flexibility of our NQS formulation is demonstrated via application to ab initio models parametrized by density functional perturbation theory consisting of electron or hole bands coupled linearly to dispersive phonons. We compute accurate real-frequency spectral properties of electron-phonon systems via a novel formalism based on NQS. Our work establishes a general framework for exploring diverse ground state and dynamical phenomena arising in electron-phonon systems, including the non-perturbative interplay of correlated electronic and electron-phonon effects in systems ranging from simple lattice models to realistic models of materials parametrized by ab initio calculations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10613v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As of now, the phenomenological classical Landau-Lifshitz (LL) damping of magnetic order is not conceptually linked to the quantum theory of dissipation of the Lindbladian formalism which is unsatisfactory for the booming research on magnetic dynamics. Here, it is shown that LL dynamics can be systematically derived from Lindbladian dynamics in a local mean-field theory for weak external fields. The derivation also extends the LL dynamics beyond the orientation $\vec{m}/|\vec{m}|$ to the length $|\vec{m}|$ of the magnetization. A key assumption is that the Lindbladian dissipation adapts to the non-equilibrium $H(t)$ instantaneously to lower its expectation value.</description>

      <title>Insights from the exact analytical solution of periodically driven transverse field Ising chain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08830v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive an exact analytical expression at stroboscopic intervals for the time-dependent wave function of a class of integrable quantum many-body systems, driven by the periodic delta-kick protocol. To investigate long-time dynamics, we use the wave function to obtain an exact analytical expression for the expectation values of the defect density, magnetization, residual energy, fidelity, and the correlation function after the $n$th drive cycle. Periodically driven integrable closed quantum systems absorb energy, and the long-time universal dynamics are described by the periodic generalized Gibbs ensemble (GGE). We demonstrate that the expectation values of all observables are divided into two parts: one highly oscillatory term that depends on the drive cycle n, and the rest of the terms are independent of it. Typically, the $n$-independent part constitutes the saturation at large n and periodic GGE. The contribution from the highly oscillatory term vanishes in large $n$. We also generalize our formalism to include square pulse and sinusoidal driving protocols.</description>

      <title>Noninvertible operators in one, two, and three dimensions via gauging spatially modulated symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16744v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spatially modulated symmetries have emerged since the discovery of fractons, which characterize unconventional topological phases with mobility-constrained quasiparticle excitations. On the other hand, non-invertible duality defects have attracted substantial attention in communities of high energy and condensed matter physics due to their deep insight into quantum anomalies and exotic phases of matter. However, the connection between these exotic symmetries and defects has not been fully explored. In this paper, we construct concrete lattice models with non-invertible duality defects via gauging spatially modulated symmetries and investigate their exotic fusion rules. Specifically, we construct spin models with subsystem symmetries or dipole symmetries on one, two, and three-dimensional lattices. Gauging subsystem symmetries leads to non-invertible duality defects whose fusion rules involve $0$-form subsystem charges in two dimensions and higher-form operators that correspond to ``lineon'' excitations (excitations which are mobile along one-dimensional line) in three dimensions. Gauging dipole symmetries leads to non-invertible duality defects with dipole algebras that describe a hierarchical structure between global and dipole charges. Notably, the hierarchical structure of the dual dipole charges is inverted compared with the original ones. Our work provides a unified and systematic analytical framework for constructing exotic duality defects by gauging relevant symmetries.</description>

Abstract: The spiral spin liquid (SSL) is a highly degenerate state characterized by a continuous contour or surface in reciprocal space spanned by a spiral propagation vector. Although the SSL state has been predicted in a number of various theoretical models, very few materials are so far experimentally identified to host such a state. Via combined single-crystal wide-angle and small-angle neutron scattering, we report observation of the SSL in the quasi-two-dimensional delafossite AgCrSe$_2$. We show that it is a very close realization of the ideal Heisenberg $J_1$--$J_2$--$J_3$ frustrated model on the triangular lattice. By supplementing our experimental results with microscopic spin-dynamics simulations, we demonstrate how such exotic magnetic states are driven by thermal fluctuations and exchange frustration.</description>

      <title>Static and Dynamical Spin Correlations in the Kitaev Model at Finite Temperatures via Green's Function Equation of Motion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01875v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Kitaev model, renowned for its exact solvability and potential to host non-Abelian anyons, remains a focal point in the study of quantum spin liquids and topological phases. While much of the existing literature has employed Majorana fermion techniques to analyze the model, particularly at zero temperature, its finite-temperature behavior has been less thoroughly explored via alternative approaches. In this paper, we investigate the finite-temperature properties of the Kitaev model using the spin Green's function formalism. This approach enables the computation of key physical quantities such as spin correlations, magnetic susceptibility, and the dynamical spin structure factor, offering crucial insights into the system's thermal dynamics. In solving the equation of motion for the spin Green's function, we truncate the hierarchy of multi-spin Green's functions using a decoupling approximation, which proves to be particularly accurate at high temperatures. Our results show several similarities with Majorana-based numerical simulations, though notable differences emerge. Specifically, both static and dynamical spin-spin correlation functions capture not only $\mathbb{Z}_2$ flux excitations but also simple spin-flip excitations, with the latter overshadowing the former. Interestingly, without explicitly assuming fractionalization, our results for the spin susceptibility and spin relaxation rate still suggest the presence of fermionic degrees of freedom at low temperatures. This study provides a complementary approach to understanding the thermal properties of the Kitaev model, which could be relevant for future experiments and theoretical investigations.</description>

      <title>Orbital-Selective Diffuse Magnetic Fluctuations in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$: a Unified Theoretical Picture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14735v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quasi-two-dimensional material Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ is a paradigmatic example of a correlated system that exhibits unconventional superconductivity and intriguing magnetic properties. The interplay between these two effects and the resulting strength and nature of spin fluctuations and their role for the properties of the compound have sparked significant debates. Here, elaborating a theory that self-consistently incorporates spatial magnetic fluctuations into a realistic many-body description, we show that these fluctuations significantly reduce many-body correlations in the system, thereby preventing magnetic ordering in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$, in agreement with experimental observations. Our conclusion is supported by a theoretical calculation of the spin susceptibility that closely matches the experimental results. We obtain finite peaks at the incommensurate wave vectors, a broad dome-shaped structure centered around the $\Gamma$ point and a diminished magnetic response at the edges of the BZ. We identify the orbital character of the unusual dome structure as resulting predominantly from the 2D-like $xy$-orbital, which is believed to be responsible for the superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Almost Strong Zero Modes at Finite Temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11121v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interacting fermionic chains exhibit extended regions of topological degeneracy of their ground states as a result of the presence of Majorana or parafermionic zero modes localized at the edges. In the opposite limit of infinite temperature, the corresponding non-integrable spin chains, obtained via generalized Jordan-Wigner mapping, are known to host so-called Almost Strong Zero Modes, which are long-lived with respect to any bulk excitations. Here, we study the fairly unexplored territory that bridges these two extreme cases of zero and infinite temperature. We blend two established techniques for states, the Lanczos series expansion and a tensor network ansatz, uplifting them to the level of operator algebra. This allows us to efficiently simulate large system sizes for arbitrarily long timescales and to extract the temperature-dependent decay rates. We observe that for the Kitaev-Hubbard model, the decay rate of the edge mode depends exponentially on the inverse temperature $\beta$, and on an effective energy scale $\Delta_{\rm eff}$ that is greater than the thermodynamic gap of the system $\Delta$.</description>

      <title>The foot, the fan, and the cuprate phase diagram: Fermi-volume-changing quantum phase transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16417v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Fermi liquid with a `large' Fermi surface (FL) can have a quantum phase transition to a spin density wave state (SDW) with reconstructed `small' Fermi pockets. Both FL and SDW phases obey the Luttinger constraints on the volume enclosed by the Fermi surfaces. The critical spin fluctuations lead to spin-singlet $d$-wave pairing, as observed in the cuprates. Studies of the influence of spatial disorder on the SDW-FL quantum phase transition predict an extended quantum-critical Griffiths-type phase at low temperatures on the large Fermi surface side. These computations agree with the `foot' seen in transport, and recent low temperature neutron scattering observations on La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$.
  However, this theory cannot explain the higher temperature pseudogap and the `fan' of strange metal of the hole-doped cuprates. Here we need to consider underlying Fermi-volume-changing quantum phase transitions without symmetry breaking. Then the small Fermi surface phase does not obey the Luttinger constraint, and is instead a `fractionalized Fermi liquid' (FL*). A theory of FL* in single band models describes photoemission observations in the pseudogap phase. The FL*-FL quantum phase transition, and the influence of spatial disorder, is described by an analysis inspired by the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model. This theory successfully describes linear-in-temperature resistivity, optical conductivity and thermopower observations.
  The crossovers connecting these lower and higher temperature descriptions are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Krylov complexity and Trotter transitions in unitary circuit dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.03851v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate many-body dynamics where the evolution is governed by unitary circuits through the lens of `Krylov complexity', a recently proposed measure of complexity and quantum chaos. We extend the formalism of Krylov complexity to unitary circuit dynamics and focus on Floquet circuits arising as the Trotter decomposition of Hamiltonian dynamics. For short Trotter steps the results from Hamiltonian dynamics are recovered, whereas a large Trotter step results in different universal behavior characterized by the existence of local maximally ergodic operators: operators with vanishing autocorrelation functions, as exemplified in dual-unitary circuits. These operators exhibit maximal complexity growth, act as a memoryless bath for the dynamics, and can be directly probed in current quantum computing setups. These two regimes are separated by a crossover in chaotic systems. Conversely, we find that free integrable systems exhibit a nonanalytic transition between these different regimes, where maximally ergodic operators appear at a critical Trotter step.</description>

      <title>Bosonized Momentum Distribution of a Fermi Gas via Friedrichs Diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11945v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, Benedikter and the author proved an approximate formula for the momentum distribution of a 3d fermionic gas interacting by a short-range pair potential in the mean-field regime, within a trial state close to the ground state. Here, we derive an exact formula for the momentum distribution in this trial state, using a diagrammatic formalism due to Friedrichs. We further demonstrate how the formula of Benedikter and the author arises from a restriction of the contributing diagrams to those corresponding to a bosonization approximation.</description>

      <title>Strain activation of localized states in WSe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11128v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Single-photon emission centers generated by controlled atomic force microscopy (AFM) indentation in monolayer WSe\(_2\) on a flexible polymer substrate are explored for applications in quantum technologies. Here, we study the response of these emitters to the polymer substrate's strain state, which is controlled by selecting the indentation force and by gradually thermally annealing the samples. In the indented areas, we observe sharp new photoluminescence (PL) peaks in the regions 1.62--1.68 eV and 1.70--1.73 eV, characterized by sublinear power dependence and spectral wandering. We find that these peaks arise only when the indentation force exceeds a few \(\mu\)N and generally redshift as the applied force increases. Conversely, after thermal annealing (\(T &lt; 60^{\circ}\)C), WSe\(_2\) experiences strain relaxation, leading to a blueshift of the peaks' spectral position and their ultimate disappearance. Our analysis of the peaks' positions vs. strain allows us to draw several conclusions about the nature of these emission. Specifically, we elucidate the roles of excitonic confinement and hybridization between free excitons and defect-related states, a process activated by the strain level. Overall, our approach suggests that the energy of localized emitters may be controlled via strain engineering.</description>

      <title>Beyond CCSD(T) accuracy at lower scaling with auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02885v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a black-box auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) approach to perform highly accurate electronic structure calculations using configuration interaction singles and doubles (CISD) trial states. This method consistently provides more accurate energy estimates than coupled cluster singles and doubles with perturbative triples (CCSD(T)), often regarded as the gold standard in quantum chemistry. This level of precision is achieved at a lower asymptotic computational cost, scaling as $O(N^6)$ compared to the $O(N^7)$ scaling of CCSD(T). We provide numerical evidence supporting these findings through results for challenging main group and transition metal-containing molecules.</description>

      <title>Topological Quantum Spin Hall Semimetals with Light</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07304v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a quantum spin Hall semimetal or Fermi liquid characterized with a Z2 topological invariant, measurable through circularly polarized light. We propose its engineering through two topological metallic band structures in crystals on the honeycomb lattice, with spin-orbit interaction, realizable through the interplay of a charge or spin density wave substrate and Zeeman effects, in between a quantum spin Hall and a quantum anomalous Hall insulator. These systems show topologically protected helical edge or photo-induced currents.</description>

      <title>Optimizing the Critical Temperature and Superfluid Density of a Metal-Superconductor Bilayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15428v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A promising path to realizing higher superconducting transition temperatures $T_c$ is the strategic engineering of artificial heterostructures. For example, quantum materials exhibiting some but not all of the characteristics necessary for a robust superconducting state could, in principle, be coupled with other materials in a way that alleviates their intrinsic shortcomings. In this work, we add numerical support to the hypothesis that a strongly interacting superconductor weakened by phase fluctuations can boost its $T_c$ by hybridizing the system with a metal. Using determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC), we simulate a two-dimensional bilayer composed of an attractive Hubbard model and a metallic layer in two regimes of the interaction strength $-|U|$. In the strongly interacting regime, we find that increasing the interlayer hybridization $t_\perp$ results in a nonmonotonic enhancement of $T_c$, with an optimal value comparable to the maximum $T_c$ observed in the single-layer attractive Hubbard model, confirming trends inferred from other approaches. In the intermediate coupling regime, when $-|U|$ is close to the value associated with the maximum $T_c$ of the single-layer model, increasing $t_\perp$ tends to decrease $T_c$, implying that the correlated layer was already optimally tuned. Importantly, we demonstrate that the mechanism behind these trends is related to enhancement in the superfluid stiffness, as was initially proposed by Kivelson [Physica B: Condensed Matter 318, 61 (2002)].</description>
