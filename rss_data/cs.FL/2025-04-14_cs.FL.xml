      <title>Nondeterminism makes unary 1-limited automata concise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the descriptional complexity of different variants of 1-limited automata (1-las), an extension of two-way finite automata (2nfas) characterizing regular languages. In particular, we consider 2nfas with common-guess (2nfas+cg), which are 2nfas equipped with a new kind of nondeterminism that allows the device to initially annotate each input symbol, before performing a read-only computation over the resulting annotated word. Their deterministic counterparts, namely two-way deterministic finite automata with common-guess (2dfas+cg), still have a nondeterministic annotation phase and can be considered as a restriction of 1-las. We prove exponential lower bounds for the simulations of 2dfas+cg (and thus of 1-las) by deterministic 1-las and by 2nfas. These results are derived from a doubly exponential lower bound for the simulation of 2dfas+cg by one-way deterministic finite automata (1dfas). Our lower bounds are witnessed by unary languages, namely languages defined over a singleton alphabet. As a consequence, we close a question left open in [Pighizzini and Prigioniero. Limited automata and unary languages. Inf. Comput., 266:60-74], about the existence of a double exponential gap between 1-las and 1dfas in the unary case. Lastly, we prove an exponential lower bound for complementing unary 2dfas+cg (and thus unary 1-las).</description>

      <title>Prophecies all the Way: Game-based Model-Checking for HyperQPTL beyond $\forall^*\exists^*$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08575v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model-checking HyperLTL, a temporal logic expressing properties of sets of traces with applications to information-flow based security and privacy, has a decidable, but TOWER-complete, model-checking problem. In the classical algorithm, the complexity manifests itself with a need for the complementation of automata over infinite words. To overcome this aforementioned need, a game-based alternative for the $\forall^*\exists^*$-fragment was recently presented.
  Here, we employ imperfect information-games to extend the game-based approach to full HyperQPTL, i.e., we allow arbitrary quantifier prefixes and quantification over propositions, which allows us to express every $\omega$-regular hyperproperty. As a byproduct of our game-based algorithm, we obtain finite-state implementations of Skolem functions via transducers with lookahead that explain satisfaction or violation of HyperQPTL properties.</description>

      <title>The Big-O Problem for Max-Plus Automata is Decidable (PSPACE-Complete)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.05229v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the big-O problem for max-plus automata is decidable and PSPACE-complete. The big-O (or affine domination) problem asks whether, given two max-plus automata computing functions f and g, there exists a constant c such that f &lt; cg+ c. This is a relaxation of the containment problem asking whether f &lt; g, which is undecidable. Our decidability result uses Simon's forest factorisation theorem, and relies on detecting specific elements, that we call witnesses, in a finite semigroup closed under two special operations: stabilisation and flattening.</description>

      <title>Active Learning of Deterministic Transducers with Outputs in Arbitrary Monoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01590v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study monoidal transducers, transition systems arising as deterministic automata whose transitions also produce outputs in an arbitrary monoid, for instance allowing outputs to commute or to cancel out. We use the categorical framework for minimization and learning of Colcombet, Petri\c{s}an and Stabile to recover the notion of minimal transducer recognizing a language, and give necessary and sufficient conditions on the output monoid for this minimal transducer to exist and be unique (up to isomorphism). The categorical framework then provides an abstract algorithm for learning it using membership and equivalence queries, and we discuss practical aspects of this algorithm's implementation.</description>

      <title>Learning Verified Monitors for Hidden Markov Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05963v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Runtime monitors assess whether a system is in an unsafe state based on a stream of observations. We study the problem where the system is subject to probabilistic uncertainty and described by a hidden Markov model. A stream of observations is then unsafe if the probability of being in an unsafe state is above a threshold. A correct monitor recognizes the set of unsafe observations. The key contribution of this paper is the first correct-by-construction synthesis method for such monitors, represented as finite automata. The contribution combines four ingredients: First, we establish the coNP-hardness of checking whether an automaton is a correct monitor, i.e., a monitor without misclassifications. Second, we provide a reduction that reformulates the search for misclassifications into a standard probabilistic system synthesis problem. Third, we integrate the verification routine into an active automata learning routine to synthesize correct monitors. Fourth, we provide a prototypical implementation that shows the feasibility and limitations of the approach on a series of benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Online Monitoring of Metric Temporal Logic using Sequential Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.00175</link>
      <description>arXiv:1901.00175v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) is a popular formalism to specify temporal patterns with timing constraints over the behavior of cyber-physical systems with application areas ranging in property-based testing, robotics, optimization, and learning. This paper focuses on the unified construction of sequential networks from MTL specifications over discrete and dense time behaviors to provide an efficient and scalable online monitoring framework. Our core technique, future temporal marking, utilizes interval-based symbolic representations of future discrete and dense timelines. Building upon this, we develop efficient update and output functions for sequential network nodes for timed temporal operations. Finally, we extensively test and compare our proposed technique with existing approaches and runtime verification tools. Results highlight the performance and scalability advantages of our monitoring approach and sequential networks.</description>

      <title>Generalized Hofstadter functions $G, H$ and beyond: numeration systems and discrepancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12615v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hofstadter's $G$ function is recursively defined via $G(0)=0$ and then $G(n)=n-G(G(n-1))$. Following Hofstadter, a family $(F_k)$ of similar functions is obtained by varying the number $k$ of nested recursive calls in this equation. We study here some Fibonacci-like sequences that are deeply connected with these functions $F_k$. In particular, the Zeckendorf theorem can be adapted to provide digital expansions via sums of terms of these sequences. On these digital expansions, the functions $F_k$ are acting as right shifts of the digits. These Fibonacci-like sequences can be expressed in terms of zeros of the polynomial $X^k{-}X^{k-1}{-}1$. Considering now the discrepancy of each function $F_k$, i.e., the maximal distance between $F_k$ and its linear equivalent, we retrieve the fact that this discrepancy is finite exactly when $k \le 4$. Thanks to that, we solve two twenty-year-old OEIS conjectures stating how close the functions $F_3$ and $F_4$ are from the integer parts of their linear equivalents. Moreover we establish that $F_k$ can coincide exactly with such an integer part only when $k\le 2$, while $F_k$ is almost additive exactly when $k \le 4$. Finally, a nice fractal shape a la Rauzy has been encountered when investigating the discrepancy of $F_3$. Almost all this article has been formalized and verified in the Coq/Rocq proof assistant.</description>
