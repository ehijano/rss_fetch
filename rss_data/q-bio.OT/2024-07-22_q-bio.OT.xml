Abstract: Background/Objective: Vitamin D deficiency (serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentration &lt;50 nmol/L) is prevalent among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in Australia. Alternative to sun exposure (the primary source of vitamin D), vitamin D can also be obtained from food (e.g., fish, eggs, and meat) and supplements. However, vitamin D intake among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples is currently unknown. We aimed to provide the first quantification of vitamin D intake using nationally representative data from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. Methods: We used food consumption data collected in the 2012-2013 National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Nutrition and Physical Activity Survey (n = 4,109) and vitamin D food composition data to quantify mean absolute vitamin D intake by sex, age group, and remoteness of location. Differences in mean vitamin D intake between sexes and between remoteness of location were assessed using the 95% confidence interval (95% CI). Results: The mean (standard deviation (SD)) vitamin D intake among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples was 2.9 (3.0) {\mu}g/day. Males had a statistically significantly higher mean (SD) [95% CI] vitamin D intake (3.2 (3.1) [3.0-3.4] {\mu}g/day) than females (2.6 (2.7) [2.4-2.7] {\mu}g/day). There were no statistically significant differences between mean (SD) [95% CI] vitamin D intake in non-remote (2.9 (2.2) [2.7-3.1] {\mu}g/day) and remote areas (2.8 (4.8) [2.6-3.0] {\mu}g/day). Conclusions: Vitamin D intake among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples is low. Food-based public health strategies could be developed to promote higher vitamin D intake among this population.</description>
