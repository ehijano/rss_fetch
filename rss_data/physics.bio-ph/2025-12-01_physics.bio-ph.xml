      <title>Nature of frontier quasi-particle states in nitrogen-base systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.23171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding photophysical properties of DNA is important: It can help us elucidate and probe the impact of charges and free radicals in the cellular environment. For example, a photoemission at a given nucleobase means that we both charge it and place an electron right next to a neighboring part of the genetic code. Inverse photoemission means that we trap a free electron (at some empty state or resonance), and instead emit a low-energy photon. This may reduce the damage if it happens at an already charged base, but it can cause extra damage if it arises somewhere else. Predicting the nature of sudden optically-driven excitations, termed quasi-particles (QPs), help us detail interactions and possibly control the damage that might follow. Also, these QPs contain information on the larger DNA assembly because they reflect the fingerprints of nucleobase polarity, the hydrogen bonding in Watson-Crick pairs, and the van der Waals (vdW) interactions in the Watson-Crick-pair stacking that makes up the genome. In this study, we utilize the recently developed (optimally tuned) range-separated hybrid vdW density functional, AHBR-mRSH* [JPCM 37, 211501 (2025)] to analyze the electron-attached and ionized QP states of these DNA components, with a particular focus on dipole- and multipole-trapped empty states (bound or resonances). We also evaluate critical properties such as dipole and quadrupole moments, QP HOMO-LUMO energy gaps, and transition-dipole moments. Finally, we classify the Watson-Crick stacked dimers based on their QP nature. This classification provides the foundation for proposing a model of DNA reactivity and photo-physical activity.</description>

      <title>Phytoscale Transport Physics: Insights into Xylem Flow Homeostasis and Drought Stress</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the flow dynamics of nutrient solution through the xylem vessels of Brassica juncea under drought stress. To this end, we perform experiments to obtain morphological traits of xylem vessels under drought-stressed conditions, and develop a mathematical framework to model the underlying flow through the xylem, considering several features relevant to the plant system. Performing experiments using state of the art instruments, we measure the morphology of xylem vessels, physicochemical and mechanical properties of xylem walls under drought stressed conditions. Our experimental results unveil that drought reduces both xylem diameter and pit aperture size, implicating hydraulic adaptations of plants to drought stress. We find that the reduced cellulose content in drought stressed xylem vessels lowers the zeta potential and decreases elasticity of the vascular region. Additionally, drought stress alters metabolite activity, increases reactive oxygen species, reduces chlorophyll content, and limits the uptake of essential metallic nutrients. Besides, we perform three-dimensional numerical simulations to evaluate local flow field, mechanical stress, hydraulic conductivity, and radial transport efficiency of xylem vessels under drought stressed conditions. Simulated results reveal that under drought conditions, resistance to axial flow through xylem vessels increases significantly, which in turn, promotes radial transport of nutrients, allowing plants to survive even in drought stress. We show that the radial flow efficiency of xylem vessels becomes notably higher under drought stress than in well-watered control plants. Overall, results of this endeavor provide new insights into how geometric adaptations of xylem vessels modify flow behavior under water deficient conditions, enhancing the plants ability to survive environmental stress.</description>

      <title>Microscopic Variability Alters Macroscopic Rotation Speed in Stochastic Spiral Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a general theory for noise-induced corrections to the angular velocity of spiral waves. Stochasticity produces two second-order effects: an instantaneous term from heterogeneity that always slows rotation, and an orbital-drift term from temporal fluctuations that can either accelerate or decelerate it. For our parameters, orbital drift is weaker, producing a net slowdown. Analytical predictions match Barkley-model simulations with temporal noise. Examination of additional noise types in silico confirms angular velocity slowing. This mechanism provides a robust route by which stochasticity reshapes spiral dynamics in excitable media, with direct implications for arrhythmias and neural wave propagation.</description>

      <title>Active flow-driven DNA remodeling generates millimeter-scale mechanical oscillations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In living systems, DNA undergoes continuous and rhythmic mechanical remodeling through condensation, looping, and disentangling to regulate gene expression, segregate chromosomes, and guide morphogenesis. Here, we demonstrate a purely mechanical route to rhythmic DNA reorganization in a minimal active composite of microtubules, kinesin motors, and DNA. We embed a DNA polymer in an active turbulent microtubule-kinesin fluid, creating a self-morphing material. The active flows stretch and entangle the DNA, forming a self-organized viscoelastic network that resists active stresses and affects flow over large length scales. This mechanical feedback loop progressively amplifies velocity correlations and drives a nonequilibrium phase transition tuned by DNA contour length: from disordered flow to synchronized, millimeter-scale oscillations with vortices. We rationalize the phase transition with an active-gel model that predicts a growing length scale and an oscillatory instability emerging from the interplay between activity, orientational order, and self-generated viscoelasticity, rather than chemical signaling. The dependence of the oscillation frequency on system size and activity quantitatively agrees with experiment. Thus, flow-driven DNA remodeling provides a minimal physical route to autonomous, system-spanning oscillations in three dimensions and suggests design principles for programmable soft matter that coordinates, actuates, and reshapes itself.</description>

      <title>The Biologically Effective Particle Number Ratio (BPNR): a new framework to quantify the therapeutic window in SFRT and other modalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatially Fractionated Radiation Therapy (SFRT) produces highly heterogeneous dose distributions, for which conventional metrics such as peak, valley, or average dose can yield ambiguous or inconsistent estimates of therapeutic window changes. These dose descriptors are not uniquely linked to biological outcome, complicating comparisons between modalities. We introduce the Biologically Effective Particle Number Ratio (BPNR), a model-independent and outcome-based framework that quantifies therapeutic window changes using directly measurable delivery quantities rather than spatial dose metrics. BPNR is defined as the ratio of total particle numbers (proportional to monitor units, MU) required to reach specified levels of tumor control probability (TCP) and normal tissue complication probability (NTCP). The relative BPNR (RBPNR) compares therapeutic windows across modalities and avoids ambiguities of spatial dose averaging by relying solely on biological endpoints. As an illustration, we apply the framework to preclinical proton minibeam radiotherapy (pMBRT) versus conventional proton therapy. The absence of normal tissue complications at the highest tested MU in the pMBRT arm yields an RBPNR &gt; 1.4, indicating a widened therapeutic window. The BPNR/RBPNR methodology provides a concise, experimentally grounded, and modality-agnostic way to quantify therapeutic window changes, with potential applications across SFRT, FLASH, high-LET radiation, and combination therapies.</description>

      <title>Quantifying surfactant adsorption at fluid interfaces by combining X-ray reflection and simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adsorption of surfactants to fluid interfaces occurs in daily-life and technological contexts like dish washing and oil spill remediation. The surfactant surface coverage $\Gamma$ governs interface characteristics like tension $\gamma$, viscoelastic properties, and the stability of thin foam films. Directly measuring $\Gamma$ as a function of the bulk concentration $c$ is highly desirable but challenging, particularly for non-ionic surfactants that lack easily detectable labels. Here, we propose a generic approach to deduce the adsorption isotherm $\Gamma(c)$: As a first step, we use atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of surfactant-loaded air/water interfaces with known $\Gamma$ to obtain interfacial electron density profiles. From these profiles, we then compute theoretical X-ray reflectivity curves, which we compare with experimental measurements to find the matching $c$. We focus on two non-ionic surfactants (C$_{12}$EO$_6$} and $\beta$-C$_{12}$G$_2$}) with previously verified force fields to demonstrate how this combined approach of experiments and simulations can determine the adsorption isotherm. By using the equation of state $\gamma(\Gamma)$ from simulations, our results replicate the measured surface tension isotherms $\gamma(c)$.</description>

      <title>A theory for coexistence and selection of branched actin networks in a shared and finite pool of monomers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cellular actin structures are continuously turned over while keeping similar sizes. Since they all compete for a shared pool of actin monomers, the question arises how they can coexist in these dynamic steady states. Recently, the coexistence of branched actin networks with different densities growing in a shared and finite pool of purified proteins has been demonstrated in a biomimetic bead assay. However, theoretical work in the context of organelle size regulation has mainly been focused on linear architectures, such as single filaments and bundles, and thus is not able to explain this observation. Here we show theoretically that the local depletion of actin monomers caused by the growth of a branched network naturally gives rise to a negative feedback loop between network density and growth rate, and that this competition is captured by one central equation. A comprehensive bifurcation analysis shows that the theory leads to well-defined steady states even in the case of multiple networks sharing the same pool of monomers, without any need for specific molecular processes. Under increasing competition strength, coexistence is replaced by selection. We also show that our theory is in excellent agreement with spatiotemporal simulations implemented in a finite element framework. In summary, our work suggests that local monomer depletion is the decisive and universal factor controlling growth of branched actin networks.</description>

      <title>Non-reciprocal interactions between condensates in chemically active mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the behaviour of catalytically active droplets in multi-component conserved mixtures affected by noise. Working in the thin interface limit, we analytically determine the state diagram of the system, characterized by multiple dynamical regimes, and verify our findings using numerical simulations. In particular, we show the emergence of a non-reciprocal, chemically-mediated interaction between the droplets, which leads to the formation of (meta-)stable clusters of droplets of different species. We find that the clusters can display self-propulsion in a large part of the parameter space, including regions where the non-reciprocal interactions between the droplets are purely attractive. This surprising feature arises from the non-local nature of the chemical interactions, and points to locality violations as a general mechanism for energy dissipation and emergence of out-of-equilibrium steady states in active matter.</description>

      <title>Self-organized homogenization of flow networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19089v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: From the vasculature of animals to the porous media making up batteries, the core task of flow networks is to transport solutes and perfuse all cells or media equally with resources. Yet, living flow networks have a key advantage over porous media: they are adaptive and self-organize their geometry for homogeneous perfusion throughout the network. Here, we show that also artificial flow networks can self-organize toward homogeneous perfusion by the versatile adaption of controlled erosion. Flowing a pulse of cleaving enzyme through a network patterned into an erodible hydrogel, with initial channels disparate in width, we observe a homogenization in channel resistances. Experimental observations are matched with numerical simulations of the diffusion-advection-sorption dynamics of an eroding enzyme within a network. Analyzing transport dynamics theoretically, we show that homogenization only occurs if the pulse of the eroding enzyme lasts longer than the time it takes any channel to equilibrate to the pulse concentration. The equilibration time scale derived analytically is in agreement with simulations. Lastly, we show both numerically and experimentally that erosion leads to the homogenization of complex networks containing loops. Erosion being an omnipresent reaction, our results pave the way for a very versatile self-organized increase in the performance of porous media.</description>

      <title>Bayesian tit-for-tat fosters cooperation in evolutionary stochastic games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00363v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learning from experience is a key feature of decision-making in cognitively complex organisms. Strategic interactions involving Bayesian inferential strategies can enable us to better understand how evolving individual choices to be altruistic or selfish can affect collective outcomes in social dilemmas. Bayesian strategies are distinguished, from their reactive opponents, in their ability to modulate their actions in the light of new evidence. We investigate whether such strategies can be resilient against reactive strategies when actions not only determine the immediate payoff but can affect future payoffs by changing the state of the environment. We use stochastic games to mimic the change in environment in a manner that is conditioned on the players' actions. By considering three distinct rules governing transitions between a resource-rich and a resource-poor states, we ascertain the conditions under which Bayesian tit-for-tat strategy can resist being invaded by reactive strategies. We find that the Bayesian strategy is resilient against a large class of reactive strategies and is more effective in fostering cooperation leading to sustenance of the resource-rich state. However, the extent of success of the Bayesian strategies depends on the other strategies in the pool and the rule governing transition between the two different resource states.</description>

      <title>Introduction to modelling radical pair quantum spin dynamics with tensor networks</title>

Abstract: Radical pairs (also known as spin qubit pairs, electron-hole pairs) are transient reaction intermediates that are found and utilised in all areas of science. Radical pair spin dynamics simulations including all nuclear spins have been a computational barrier due to exponential scaling memory requirements. We address this issue with a tensor network method for accurately simulating the full open quantum dynamics of radical pair systems, explicitly accounting for hyperfine interactions with up to 30 nuclear spins with additional benchmarking including 60 nuclei. By employing the matrix product state (MPS) and matrix product density operator (MPDO) representations, we mitigate the exponential scaling of Hilbert and Liouville spaces typically encountered in full quantum non-Markovian treatments. We demonstrate the power of these methods with biologically relevant flavin-tryptophan radical pair systems, where we investigate electron hopping processes between multiple radical pairs using Lindblad jump operators. These simulations precisely capture anisotropic spin dynamics, clearly identifying orientational dependence of the magnetic field, which enhances or diminishes the spin-selective product yield. These directional sensitivities highlight the critical dependence of the nuclear environment and underscore the necessity of fully quantum treatments in spin biophysics, offering critical insights into avian magnetoreception mechanisms. This work provides a robust computational framework applicable to a broad range of scientific realms, which include spin chemistry, quantum biology, and spintronics.</description>

      <title>Investigating time- and orientation-dependent transverse relaxation from magnetic susceptibility of white matter microstructure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26267v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transverse relaxation in MRI is modulated by magnetic field variations arising from tissue microstructure, offering a potential window into the underlying chemical composition and structural organization at the cellular scale. However, the transverse relaxation rate in white matter depends on both echo time and the orientation of axons relative to the external field. Such anisotropy complicates the interpretation of transverse relaxation in general and as a biomarker for neurodegenerative disease. Understanding this anisotropy is therefore crucial for accurately analyzing MRI signals. While previous modeling studies have investigated these effects, they often relied on simplified or idealized tissue geometries. In this study, we investigate magnetic field variance and intra-axonal transverse relaxation using realistic axonal microstructure extracted from 3D electron microscopy, incorporating myelinated axons with embedded spherical susceptibility sources. We derive how transverse relaxation depends on the angle between axons and the external magnetic field. Simulations show that the time-dependent power-law signature arising from white matter structural disorder is weak and may be difficult to detect at currently achievable noise levels, echo times, and field strengths. This is because the power-law curvature over a typical range of echo times deviates only slightly from a linear trend. Our findings highlight the influence of axonal geometry on intra-axonal transverse relaxation and suggest that accounting for both time and orientation dependence may facilitate the development of more precise neuroimaging biomarkers.</description>
