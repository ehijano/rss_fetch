      <title>Nanoscale sensing of spatial correlations in nonequilibrium current noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nitrogen-vacancy centers are spatially resolved probes of current noise. So far, current noise sensing with NV centers has primarily been used as a way to probe equilibrium transport coefficients. We develop a framework for computing the spatiotemporal correlations of nonequilibrium current noise in the Boltzmann regime, and apply it to two-dimensional metals in current-biased steady states. We argue that the spatial structure of the noise reveals the nonequilibrium nature of the electron distribution function, and more generally reveals the nature and lifetimes of the excitations responsible for transport. We estimate the visibility of these signatures in near-term experiments.</description>

      <title>Thermal boundary conductance and thermal conductivity strongly depend on nearby environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At the nanoscale, the thermal boundary conductance (TBC) and thermal conductivity are not intrinsic properties of interfaces or materials but depend on the nearby environment. In this study, we demonstrate how the TBC of an interface is affected by the existence of a second interface, as well as how the thermal conductivity of a material is affected by the nearby materials. Using Si and Ge modeled by classical molecular dynamics simulations, the following phenomena are discovered. (1) The existence of a nearby interface can significantly change the TBC of the original interface. For example, by adding an interface after Si/Ge, the TBC can be increased from 400 to 700 MW/m2K. This is because the nearby interface serves as a filter of phonon modes, which selectively allows particular modes to pass through and affect the TBC of the original interfaces. This impact will disappear at the diffusive limit when the distance between interfaces is much longer than the phonon mean free path so that phonon modes recover equilibrium statistics before arriving at the second interface. (2) The thermal conductivity of a material can be significantly changed by the existence of neighboring materials. For example, a standalone 30-nm-thick Si's thermal conductivity can be increased from 50 to 280 W/mK, a more than 4-fold increase, beating the bulk thermal conductivity of Si, after being sandwiched between two Ge slabs. This is because the Ge slabs on the two sides serve as filters that only allow low-frequency phonons to transport heat in Si, which carry more heat than optical phonons. This work opens a new area of successive interface thermal transport and is expected to be important for nanoscale thermal characterization and thermal management.</description>

      <title>Helical trilayer graphene in magnetic field: Chern mosaic and higher Chern number ideal flat bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Helical trilayer graphene (hTG) exhibits a supermoir\'e pattern with large domains centered around stacking points ABA and BAB, where two well-separated low-energy bands appear with different total Chern numbers at each valley, forming a Chern mosaic pattern. In the chiral limit, the low-energy bands become exactly flat at zero energy for magic-angle twists. Here we investigate these zero-energy flat bands and their topological properties in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field. We show that hTG retains the precise flatness of the zero-energy bands, even at finite magnetic fields. We find topological phase transitions at fields corresponding to unit and half magnetic flux leading to an emergence of higher Chern number flat bands. Consequently the Chern mosaic gets modified for finite magnetic fields. We further find the analytical forms of zero-energy wave functions and identify a set of hidden wave functions, which gives crucial insights into both the topological transitions and enhancement of Chern numbers across them. We also find topological transitions away from the chiral limit with finite corrugations and at different magic angles.</description>

      <title>Path integral approach to bosonisation and nonlinearities in exciton-polariton systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large exciton-polariton optical nonlinearities present a key mechanism for photonics-based communication, ultimately in the quantum regime. Enhanced nonlinear response from various materials hosting excitons and allowing for their strong coupling with light is therefore the topic of intense studies, both in theoretical and experimental domains. Reports on the scattering rates arising due to various system's nonlinearities, such as the exciton-exciton Coulomb interaction and the Pauli blocking that leads to the saturation of the exciton oscillator strength, however, are contradictory. In this work, we develop a formalism allowing to track the exciton nonlinearities appearing in the regime of strong coupling with photons, that includes finite temperatures, mixing of the exciton excited states, and the dark exciton contributions to saturation self-consistently. The equilibrium path integration approach employed here to address the polariton composite nature, leads to a transparent hierarchy of various contributions to nonlinearity. At the same time, by taking the simplest limit of zero temperature and so-called "rigid" excitons, through our framework we retrieve the expressions derived in conventional approaches for exciton interaction constants. In particular, our theory allows to clearly show that such interaction constants cannot be used as fitting parameters tunable in a wide range of values, as they are strictly defined by the material properties, and that other explanations are due for large optical nonlinearities recently reported.</description>

      <title>Twisted MoSe2 Homobilayer Behaving as a Heterobilayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heterostructures (HSs) formed by the transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) materials have shown great promise in next-generation opto/electronic and photonic applications. An artificially twisted HS, allows us to manipulate the optical, and electronic properties. With this work, we introduce the understanding of the complex energy transfer (ET) process governed by the dipolar interaction in a twisted molybdenum diselenide (MoSe2) homobilayer without any charge-blocking interlayer. We fabricated an unconventional homobilayer (i.e., HS) with a large twist angle by combining the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and mechanical exfoliation (Exf.) techniques to fully exploit the lattice parameters mismatch and indirect/direct (CVD/Exf.) bandgap nature. This effectively weaken the charge transfer (CT) process and allows the ET process to take over the carrier recombination channels. We utilize a series of optical and electron spectroscopy techniques complementing by the density functional theory calculations, to describe a massive photoluminescence enhancement from the HS area due to an efficient ET process. Our results show that the electronically decoupled MoSe2 homobilayer is coupled by the ET process, mimicking a 'true' heterobilayer nature.</description>

      <title>Magnetic ordering and dynamics in monolayers and bilayers of chromium trihalides: atomistic simulations approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze magnetic properties of monolayers and bilayers of chromium trihalides, CrI$_3$, in two different stacking configurations: AA and rhombohedral ones. Our main focus is on the corresponding Curie temperatures, hysteresis curves, equilibrium spin structures, and spin wave excitations. To obtain all these magnetic characteristic, we employ the atomistic spin dynamics and Monte Carlo simulation techniques. The model Hamiltonian includes isotropic exchange coupling, magnetic anisotropy, and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. Though the latter is relatively weak in CrI$_3$, we consider a more general case assuming also an enhancement of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction in the corresponding Janus structures and by external electric fields. An important issue of the analysis is the correlation between hysteresis curves and spin configurations in the system, as well as formation of the skyrmion textures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In superconductors that lack inversion symmetry, a supercurrent flow can lead to nondissipative magnetoelectric effects. We offer a straightforward formalism to obtain a supercurrent-induced magnetization in superconductors with broken inversion symmetry, which may have orbital, layer, sublattice, or valley degrees of freedom\textemdash multiband noncentrosymmetric superconductors. The nondissipative magnetoelectric effect may find applications in fabricating quantum computation platforms or efficient superconducting spintronic devices. We explore how the current-induced magnetization can be employed to create and manipulate Majorana zero modes in a simple hybrid structure.</description>

      <title>Magnetic flux-induced topological superconductivity in magnetic atomic rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There have been numerous studies on topological superconductivity in magnetic atomic chains deposited on s-wave superconductors. Most of these investigations have focused on spin-orbit interactions or helical spin orders. In this paper, we propose a new model for achieving one-dimensional topological superconductivity in a magnetic atomic ring. This model utilizes a magnetic field and an antiferromagnetic/ferromagnetic order, under the condition that the magnetic field is perpendicular to the moments of the magnetic order. On a quasi-one-dimensional substrate surface, where the half-filled ring favors an antiferromagnetic configuration, we demonstrate that either the magnetic field itself or a Rashba spin-orbit coupling guarantees the perpendicularity. On a two-dimensional surface, where the ring favors ferromagnetic orders, the perpendicularity is achieved by introducing a minor Rashba spin-orbit coupling.</description>

      <title>Neural network-based recognition of multiple nanobubbles in graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a machine learning method for swiftly identifying nanobubbles in graphene, crucial for understanding electronic transport in graphene-based devices. Nanobubbles cause local strain, impacting graphene's transport properties. Traditional techniques like optical imaging are slow and limited for characterizing multiple nanobubbles. Our approach uses neural networks to analyze graphene's density of states, enabling rapid detection and characterization of nanobubbles from electronic transport data. This method swiftly enumerates nanobubbles and surpasses conventional imaging methods in efficiency and speed. It enhances quality assessment and optimization of graphene nanodevices, marking a significant advance in condensed matter physics and materials science. Our technique offers an efficient solution for probing the interplay between nanoscale features and electronic properties in two-dimensional materials.</description>

      <title>Features and Peculiarities of Gate-Voltage Modulation of Spin-Orbit Interaction in FeCoB Nanomagnets: Insights into the Physical Origins of the VCMA Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper investigates the systematic dependencies of the anisotropy field and the strength of spin-orbit (SO) interaction on gate voltage in Ta/FeB/MgO nanomagnets. Our findings reveal an intriguing opposite polarity in the gate-voltage dependencies of the anisotropy field and the coefficient of SO interaction across all studied nanomagnets. This opposite polarity signifies that both the strength of spin-orbit interaction and the demagnetization field are effectively modulated by the gate voltage, exhibiting an increase with higher gate voltages. This finding indicates that the gate voltage modulation of spin-orbit interaction and the demagnetization field are two major contributions to the Voltage-Controlled Magnetic Anisotropy (VCMA) effect in FeB nanomagnets. Due to the opposite polarities of these contributions, they effectively counterbalance each other, resulting in a reduction of the VCMA effect. Optimizing the balance between these contributions could potentially lead to a substantial enhancement of the VCMA effect. Our measurements did not detect any modulation of in-plane component of spin accumulation by the gate voltage.</description>

      <title>Tunneling chirality Hall effect in type-I Weyl semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a tilt-assisted chirality Hall effect in the normal metal-superconductor (NS) junctions based on the time-reversal broken type-I Weyl semimetals. It is found that the chirality-contrasting skew reflection occurs at the NS interface due to the tilt of the Weyl cones, which is responsible for the nonzero transverse chirality Hall currents. Distinct from the Hall effect induced by the Berry curvature, we further illustrate that the transverse chirality current here is determined by the symmetry of the tilt. Specifically, both the transverse chirality Hall current and the transverse charge Hall current may occur when the tilt breaks the mirror symmetry ($\mathcal{M}$). However, a pure transverse chirality Hall current with zero net charge is present when the tilt breaks $\mathcal{M}$ symmetry but preserves the combined $\mathcal{MC}$ symmetry, where $\mathcal{C}$ represents the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ exchange symmetry.</description>

      <title>Flat bands in chiral multilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the formation and properties of perfectly-flat zero energy bands in a multi-layer graphene systems in the chiral limit. Employing the degrees of freedoms of the multi-layer system, such as relative twist-angle and relative shifts, in a way that preserves a set of symmetries, we define a two-dimensional parameter plane that hosts lines of two and four flat bands. This plane enables adiabatic continuation of multi-layer chiral systems to weakly coupled bi- and tri-layer systems, and through that mapping provides tools for calculating the Chern numbers of the flat bands. We show that a flat band of Chern number $C$ can be spanned by $C$ effective Landau levels, all experiencing an effective flux of $1/C$ flux quantum per unit cell, and each carrying its own intra-unit-cell wave function. The flat bands do not disperse under the effect of a perpendicular magnetic field, and the gap to the dispersive bands closes when the externally applied flux cancels the $1/C$ effective flux.</description>

      <title>Measurement of enhanced spin-orbit coupling strength for donor-bound electron spins in silicon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While traditionally considered a deleterious effect in quantum dot spin qubits, the spin-orbit interaction is recently being revisited as it allows for rapid coherent control by on-chip AC electric fields. For electrons in bulk silicon, SOC is intrinsically weak, however, it can be enhanced at surfaces and interfaces, or through atomic placement. Here we show that the strength of the spin-orbit coupling can be locally enhanced by more than two orders of magnitude in the manybody wave functions of multi-donor quantum dots compared to a single donor, reaching strengths so far only reported for holes or two-donor system with certain symmetry. Our findings may provide a pathway towards all-electrical control of donor-bound spins in silicon using electric dipole spin resonance (EDSR).</description>

      <title>Bimeron Traveling on the Magnetic Domain Wall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic domain wall bimerons (DWBMs) are topological spin textures residing within the magnetic domain walls of in-plane magnets. In this study, we employ both numerical and analytical methods to explore the stabilization of N\'eel-type DWBMs in a ferromagnet (FM)/heavy metal (HM) bilayer, facilitated by interfacial Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya interaction (DMI), and their dynamics when excited by damping-like spin-orbit torque. Our findings reveal two unique and intriguing dynamic mechanisms, which depend on the polarization direction of the spin current: In the first scenario, the magnetic domain wall serves as a track that confines the motion of the bimeron and effectively suppresses the skyrmion Hall effect. In the second scenario, pushing the magnetic domain wall triggers a rapid sliding of the bimeron along the wall. This process significantly enhances the dynamics of the DWBM, resulting in a velocity increase of approximately 40 times compared to other topological solitons, including skyrmions and bimeron solitons. The damping effect plays a varied role in these mechanisms. Our results highlight the potential advantages of the skyrmion Hall effect in developing energy-efficient spintronic devices based on domain wall bimerons.</description>

      <title>Entropic signature of resonant thermal transport: Ordered form of heat conduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal transport in crystals is influenced by chemistry, boundaries, and nanostructure. The phonon band structure extracted from molecular-dynamics simulations provides an illuminating view of both the type and extent of prevalence of wavelike mechanisms underlying the transport, yet falls short of elucidating the nature of thermal evolution for different phonon regimes. Here we present an analysis framework for the characterization of the entropic signature of the mechanisms induced by the existence of boundaries and nanostructure, using both equilibrium and nonequilibrium atomistic simulations. Specifically, we examine the effects of phonon confinement, Bragg scattering, and local resonances on the configurational phase space in room-temperature nanostructured silicon, and quantify how each modifies the rate of entropy production and thermal relaxation. We reveal that the presence of phonon local resonances spanning the full spectrum enables a highly ordered regime of heat conduction, where irreversible evolution and entropy maximization are severely hindered by extensive mode hybridizations caused by the resonances. This unique regime of transport paves the way for ultra-precise phonon control for a wide range of applications in condensed matter physics.</description>

      <title>On-liquid-gallium surface synthesis of ultra-smooth conductive metal-organic framework thin films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conductive metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are emerging electroactive materials for (opto-)electronics. However, it remains a great challenge to achieve reliable MOF-based devices via the existing synthesis methods that are compatible with the complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor technology, as the surface roughness of thus-far synthetic MOF films or pellets is rather high for efficient electrode contact. Here, we develop an on-liquid-gallium surface synthesis (OLGSS) strategy under chemical vapor deposition (CVD) conditions for the controlled growth of two-dimensional conjugated MOF (2D c-MOF) thin films with ten-fold improvement of surface flatness (surface roughness can reach as low as ~2 {\AA}) compared with MOF films grown by the traditional methods. Supported by theoretical modeling, we unveil a layer-by-layer CVD growth mode for constructing flattening surfaces, that is triggered by the high adhesion energy between gallium (Ga) and planar aromatic ligands. We further demonstrate the generality of the as-proposed OLGSS strategy by reproducing such a flat surface over nine different 2D c-MOF films with variable thicknesses (~2 to 208 nm) and large lateral sizes (over 1 cm2). The resultant ultra-smooth 2D c-MOF films enable the formation of high-quality electrical contacts with gold (Au) electrodes, leading to a reduction of contact resistance by over ten orders of magnitude compared to the traditional uneven MOF films. Furthermore, due to the efficient interfacial interaction benifited from the high-quality contacts, the prepared van der Waals heterostructure (vdWH) of OLGSS c-MOF and MoS2 exhibits intriguing photoluminescence (PL) enhancement, PL peak shift and large work function modulation. The establishment of the reliable OLGSS method provides the chances to push the development of MOF electronics and the construction of multicomponent MOF-based heterostructure materials.</description>

      <title>Entanglement in Quantum Dots: Insights from Dynamic Susceptibility and Quantum Fisher Information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the entanglement properties of quantum dots (QDs) under a universal Hamiltonian where the Coulomb interaction between particles (electrons or holes) decouples into a charging energy and an exchange coupling term. While this formalism typically decouples the charge and spin components, the confinement-induced energy splitting can induce unexpected entanglement in the system. By analyzing the dynamic susceptibility and quantum Fisher information (QFI), we uncover intriguing behaviors influenced by exchange constants, temperature variations, and confinement effects. In Ising QDs, far below the Stoner instability point where the QD is in a disordered paramagnetic phase, temperature reductions unexpectedly lead to decreased entanglement, challenging conventional expectations. Conversely, anisotropic Heisenberg models exhibit enhanced entanglement near isotropic points. Our findings highlight the intricate interplay between exchange interactions and entanglement in QDs, laying the groundwork for future studies on topological entanglement and the influence of entanglement on material properties. Overall, this work contributes to advancing our understanding of entanglement in QDs and its potential applications in quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Temperature dependent spin-phonon coupling of boron-vacancy centers in hexagonal boron nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The negatively charged boron-vacancy center ($\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{B}}^-$) in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has recently emerged as a highly promising quantum sensor. Compared to the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond, the change with temperature of the spin transition energy of $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{B}}^-$ is more than an order of magnitude larger, making it a potential nanoscale thermometer with superior sensitivity. However, the underlying mechanism of the observed large temperature dependence remains an open question. In this work, using isotopically purified $\mathrm{h}{}^{10}\mathrm{B}{}^{15}\mathrm{N}$, we systematically characterize the zero-field splitting, hyperfine interaction, and spin relaxation time of $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{B}}^-$ from 10 to 350$~$K. We carry out first-principle calculations of the $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{B}}^-$ spin-phonon interaction and show that a second-order effect from finite-temperature phonon excitations is responsible for the observed changes in experiments. By fitting our experimental results to a physically motivated model, we extract the dominant phonon mode which agrees well with our simulations. Finally, we investigate the dynamic nuclear spin polarization process at cryogenic temperatures. Our results provide key insights in $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{B}}^-$ centers and their utilization as nanoscale thermometers and phonon sensors.</description>

      <title>Fractional quantum Hall effect of partons and the nature of the 8/17 state in the zeroth Landau level of bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) at the filling factor $8/17$, where signatures of incompressibility have been observed in the zeroth Landau level of bilayer graphene. We propose an Abelian state described by the "$\overline{(8/3)}\bar{2}1^{3}$" parton wave function, where a parton itself forms an FQHE state. This state is topologically distinct from the $8/17$ Levin-Halperin state, a daughter state of the Moore-Read state. We carry out extensive numerical exact diagonalization of the Coulomb interaction at 8/17 in the zeroth Landau level of bilayer graphene but find that our results cannot conclusively determine the topological order of the underlying ground state. We work out the low-energy effective theory of the $\overline{(8/3)}\bar{2}1^{3}$ edge and make predictions for experimentally measurable properties of the state which can tell it apart from the 8/17 Levin-Halperin state.</description>

      <title>Massive Higher-Spin Fields in the Fractional Quantum Hall Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Incompressibility plays a key role in the geometric description of fractional quantum Hall fluids. It is naturally related to quantum area-preserving diffeomorphisms and the underlying Girvin-MacDonald-Plazman algebra, which gives rise to an emergent non-relativistic massive spin-2 mode propagating in the bulk. The corresponding metric tensor can be identified with a nematic order parameter for the bulk states. In the linearised regime with a flat background, it has been shown that this mode can be described by a spin-2 Schroedinger action. However, quantum area-preserving diffeomorphisms also suggest the existence of higher-spin modes that cannot be described through nematic fractional quantum Hall states. Here, we consider p-atic Hall phases, in which the corresponding p-atic order parameters are related to higher-rank symmetric tensors. We then show that in this framework, non-relativistic massive chiral higher-spin fields naturally emerge and that their dynamics is described by higher-spin Schroedinger actions. We finally show that these effective actions can be derived from relativistic massive higher-spin theories in 2+1 dimensions after taking a non-relativistic limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A spin-photon interface based on the luminescence of a singly charged quantum dot in a micropillar cavity allows for the creation of photonic entangled states. Current devices suffer from cavity birefringence, which limits the generation of spin-photon entanglement. In this paper, we theoretically study the light absorption and emission by the interface with an anisotropic cavity and derive the maximal excitation and spin-photon entanglement conditions. We show that the concurrence of the spin-photon state equal to one and complete quantum dot population inversion can be reached for a micropillar cavity with any degree of birefringence by tuning the quantum dot resonance strictly between the cavity modes. This sweet spot is also valid for generating a multiphoton cluster state, as we demonstrate by calculating the three-tangle and fidelity with the maximally entangled state.</description>

Abstract: We propose an effective lattice model for the moir\'e structure of the twisted bilayer dice lattice. In the chiral limit, we find that there are flat bands at the zero-energy level at any twist angle besides the magic ones and these flat bands are broadened by small perturbation away from the chiral limit. The flat bands contain both bands with zero Chern number which originate from the destructive interference of the states on the dice lattice and the topological nontrivial bands at the magic angle. The existence of the flat bands can be detected from the peak-splitting structure of the optical conductance at all angles, while the transition peaks do not split and only occur at magic angles in twisted bilayer graphene.</description>

      <title>Crossed Andreev Reflection in altermagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08263v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Crossed Andreev reflection (CAR) is a scattering phenomenon occurring in a superconductor (SC) connected to two metallic leads, where an incident electron on one side of the SC emerges on the opposite side as a hole. Despite its significance, CAR detection is often impeded by the prevalent electron tunneling (ET), wherein the incident electron exits on the opposing side as an electron. One approach to augment CAR over ET involves employing two antiparallel ferromagnets across the SC. However, this method is constrained by the low polarization in ferromagnets and necessitates the application of a magnetic field. Altermagnets (AMs) present a promising avenue for detecting and enhancing CAR due to their distinct Fermi surfaces for the two spins. Here, we propose a configuration utilizing two AMs rotated by $90^{\circ}$ with respect to each other on either side of an SC to enhance CAR. We calculate local and nonlocal conductivities across the AM-SC-AM junction using the Landauer-B\"uttiker scattering approach. Our findings reveal that in the strong phase of AMs, CAR overwhelmingly dominates nonlocal transport. In the weak phase, CAR can exhibit significant enhancement for larger values of the altermagnetic parameter compared to the scenario where AMs are in the normal metallic phase. As a function of the length of the SC, the conductivities exhibit oscillations reminiscent of Fabry-P\'erot interference.</description>

      <title>The Map between Symmetries and Orbital Rules to Realize Tunable Band Gap in Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect Material</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16500v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish the map between symmetries and orbital rules to realize tunable band gap in quantum anomalous Hall effect material. This band gap is determined by the SOC between local orbitals associated with band crossing, which is constrained by at least one of lattice symmetries. The band gap could be turned on/off by breaking or keeping corresponding lattice symmetry through rotation of magnetization direction. The components of local orbital related to band crossing is required to match the symmetry, and to produce non-zero SOC when symmetry is broken. Following this map, the TiSb monolayer is predicted to be a quantum anomalous Hall effect material with a band gap adjusted in the range of 0 to 209 meV through magnetization direction rotation.</description>

      <title>Control of proton transport and hydrogenation in double-gated graphene</title>

Abstract: Graphene's basal plane can function as a perfectly selective barrier permeable to protons but impermeable to all ions and gases, stimulating its use in applications such as membranes, catalysis and isotope separation. Protons can also chemically adsorb on graphene and hydrogenate it, inducing a conductor-insulator transition intensely explored in graphene electronic devices. However, both processes face energy barriers that in the case of proton transport motivate strategies to accelerate it, such as introducing vacancies, incorporating catalytic metals or chemically functionalising the lattice, but these can compromise other properties like ion selectivity or mechanical stability. Here we show that independent control of the electric field E~V nm-1 and charge carrier density n~10^14 cm-2 in double gated graphene allows decoupling proton transport from lattice hydrogenation and can accelerate proton transport such that it approaches the limiting electrolyte current in our devices. Proton transport and hydrogenation can be driven selectively with precision and robustness that enables proton-based logic-and-memory graphene devices with orders-of-magnitude on-off ratios. Our results show that field effects can accelerate and decouple electrochemical processes in double-gated 2D crystals and demonstrate the possibility of mapping such processes as a function of E and n - a fundamentally different technique to study 2D electrode-electrolyte interfaces.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Response and Neutral Excitations in Integer and Fractional Quantum Anomalous Hall States Emerging from Correlated Flat Bands</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15246v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Integer and fractional Chern insulators have been extensively explored in correlated flat band models. Recently, the prediction and experimental observation of fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) states with spontaneous time-reversal-symmetry breaking have garnered attention. While the thermodynamics of integer quantum anomalous Hall (IQAH) states have been systematically studied, our theoretical knowledge on thermodynamic properties of FQAH states has been severely limited. Here, we delve into the general thermodynamic response and collective excitations of both IQAH and FQAH states within the paradigmatic flat Chern-band model with remote band considered. Our key findings include: i) In both $\nu$ = 1 IQAH and $\nu$ = 1/3 FQAH states, even without spin fluctuations, the charge-neutral collective excitations would lower the onset temperature of these topological states, to a value significantly smaller than the charge gap, due to band-mixing and multi-particle scattering; ii) By employing large-scale thermodynamic simulations in FQAH states in the presence of strong inter-band mixing between C = $\pm1$ bands, we find that the lowest collective excitations manifest as the zero-momentum excitons in the IQAH state, whereas in the FQAH state, they take the form of magneto-rotons with finite momentum; iii) The unique charge oscillations in FQAH states are exhibited with distinct experimental signatures, which we propose to detect in future experiments.</description>

      <title>Near-field radiative heat transfer between shifted graphene gratings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14357v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the near-field radiative heat transfer between finite-thickness planar fused silica slabs covered with graphene gratings, through the utilization of the Fourier modal method augmented with local basis functions (FMM-LBF), with focus on the lateral shift effect. To do so, we propose and validate a minor modification of the FMM-LBF theory to account for the lateral shift. This approach goes far beyond the effective medium approximation because this latter cannot account for the lateral shift. We show that the heat flux can exhibit significant oscillations with the lateral shift and, at short separation, it can experience up to a 60%-70% reduction compared to the aligned case. Such a lateral shift effect is found to be sensitive to the geometric factor $d/D$ (separation distance to grating period ratio). When $d/D&gt;1$ (realized through large separation or small grating period), the two graphene gratings see each other as an effective whole rather than in detail, and thus the lateral shift effect on heat transfer becomes less important. Therefore, we can clearly distinguish two asymptotic regimes for radiative heat transfer: the LSE (Lateral Shift Effect) regime, where a significant lateral shift effect is observed, and the non-LSE regime, where this effect is negligible. Furthermore, regardless of the lateral shift, the radiative heat flux shows a non-monotonic dependence on the graphene chemical potential. That is, we can get an optimal radiative heat flux (peaking at about 0.3eV chemical potential) by $\textit{in situ}$ modulating the chemical potential. This work has the potential to unveil new avenues for harnessing the lateral shift effect on radiative heat transfer in graphene-based nanodevices.</description>

Abstract: Majorana fermions are spin-1/2 neutral particles that are their own antiparticles and were initially predicted by Ettore Majorana in particle physics but their observation still remains elusive. The concept of Majorana fermions has been borrowed into condensed matter physics, where, unlike particle physics, Majorana fermions emerge as zero-energy quasiparticles that can be engineered by combining electrons and holes and have therefore been coined Majorana zero modes. In this review, we provide a pedagogical explanation of the basic properties of Majorana zero modes in unconventional superconductors and their consequences in experimental observables, putting a special emphasis on the initial theoretical discoveries. In particular, we first show that Majorana zero modes are self-conjugated and emerge as a special type of zero energy surface Andreev bound states at the boundary of unconventional superconductors. We then explore Majorana zero modes in one-dimensional spin-polarized $p$-wave superconductors, where we address the formation of topological superconductivity and the physical realization in superconductor-semiconductor hybrids. In this part we highlight that Majorana quasiparticles appear as zero-energy edge states, exhibiting charge neutrality, spin-polarized, and spatial nonlocality as unique properties that can be already seen from their energies and wavefunctions. Next, we discuss analytically obtained Green's functions of $p$-wave superconductors and demonstrate that the emergence of Majorana zero modes is always accompanied by the formation of odd-frequency spin-triplet pairing as a unique result of the self-conjugate nature of Majorana zero modes. We finally address the signatures of Majorana zero modes in tunneling spectroscopy, including the anomalous proximity effect, and the phase-biased Josephson effect.</description>

Abstract: The photoinduced topological phase transitions and thermal Hall conductivity of a kagome magnet with Heisenberg, Kitaev, and DM interactions under an external magnetic field aligned along the [111] directions is investigated in this study. In the presence of a strong magnetic field perpendicular to the lattice plane in the [111] direction, the system exhibits a fully polarized paramagnetic phase and the magnon band carries an asymmetric Chern number across the phase diagram region. Utilizing magnetic Floquet-Bloch theory, we demonstrate that periodically driven intrinsic topological magnetic materials can be manipulated into different topological phases with varying Berry curvature, Chern numbers and thermal Hall conductivities signatures by adjusting light intensity throughout the phase diagram region.</description>

      <title>Direct transition from a fractional quantum anomalous Hall state to a smectic state with the same Hall conductance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06745v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent developments in twisted MoTe_2 and rhombohedral multilayer graphene have generated widespread attention to the general features of fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) states, including their possible coexistence with and transition to various symmetry breaking charge ordered states. These attentions are pushing forward our knowledge of the relation between the topological order in FQAH states and the Landau-type of symmetry breaking order such as the 1D smectic electronic liquid crystal and 2D charge-density-wave (CDW) solid. Although the transitions from topological states to symmetry breaking states with trivial topology have been discussed, the road from one topological ordered state to another with the same Hall conductance and broken translational symmetry has not been found. Here we show the intriguing evidence that the FQAH to FQAH Smectic (FQAHS) transition is robustly realizable in the archetypal correlated flat Chern-band model at filling $\nu$ = 2/3. This transition is novel in that: i) the FQAHS acquires the same fractional Hall conductance as FQAH, which cannot be explained by mean-field band folding. The formation of smectic order can be viewed as perturbation around the transition point, and thus, do not destroy or change the original topology; ii) the charge excitation remains gapped across the transition although the neutral gap is closed at transition point; and iii) the transition is triggered by the softening of roton mode with the same wave vector as the smectic order. Our discovery opens countless new possibilities, both theoretical and experimental, in the fast-growing field of robust fractional Chern insulators.</description>

Abstract: We extend the scattering theory of the Josephson effect to include a coupling of the Josephson junction to a gapless electron reservoir in the normal state. By opening up the system with a quasiparticle escape rate $1/\tau$, the supercurrent carried at zero temperature by an Andreev level at energy $\varepsilon_{\rm A}$ is reduced by a factor $(2/\pi)\arctan(2\varepsilon_{\rm A}\tau/\hbar)$ . We make contact with recent work on "non-Hermitian Josephson junctions", by comparing this result to different proposed generalizations of the Josephson effect to non-Hermitian Hamiltonians.</description>
