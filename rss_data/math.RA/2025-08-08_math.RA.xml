      <title>Lagrange-like interpolation in unitary rings, Boolean algebras and Boolean posets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that every function with a finite support over a given field can be interpolated by means of the Lagrangian polynomial. The question is if a similar interpolation is possible if one considers a unitary ring or a Boolean algebra instead of a field. We get a positive answer to this question provided the similarity type of the algebra in question is enriched with one more unary operation, the so-called Baaz delta. We get an explicit construction of this interpolation polynomial in both the cases. When going to Boolean posets, we have a lack of operations but these can be substituted by the operators Min U and Max L. Hence, we generalize also the Baaz delta for posets as an operator and then we can derive an explicit interpolation term constructed by means of these operators also for Boolean posets.</description>

      <title>Rings as unions of proper ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we define and investigate $\textit{ideal covering numbers}$ of associative rings (not assumed to be commutative or unital): three invariants defined as the minimal number of proper left, right, or two-sided ideals whose union equals the ring. For every prime $p$, we construct four infinite families of rings without identity that attain the sharp lower bound $p + 1$ for ideal covering numbers, each exhibiting distinct behavior with respect to left, right, and two-sided ideal coverings. As a consequence of a result by Lucchini and Mar\'{o}ti, we also characterize all rings with ideal covering numbers three. Finally, we make several observations and propose open questions related to these invariants and the structure of rings admitting such ideal coverings.</description>

      <title>Polynomial identities and Azumaya loci for rational quantum spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a number of structure and isomorphism results concerning the non-commutative Natsume-Olsen spheres $\mathbb{S}^{2n-1}_{\theta}$ deformed along a skew-symmetric matrix $\theta\in \mathbb{R}$. These include (a) the fact that two $C^*$-algebras of the form $\mathbb{S}^{3}_{\theta}\otimes M_n$ are isomorphic precisely in the obvious cases; (b) the fact that $m$ and $n$ are recoverable from the isomorphism class of $C(\mathbb{S}^{2m-1}_{\theta})\otimes M_n$; (c) the PI character, PI degree and Azumaya loci of $C(\mathbb{S}^{2m-1}_{\theta})$ for rational $\theta$, along with a realization of their centers as (function algebras of) branched cover of $\mathbb{S}^{2n-1}$ and (d) for rational $\theta$ again, the topological finite generation of $C(\mathbb{S}^{2m-1}_{\theta})$ over their centers, with algebraic finite generation equivalent to being classical (equivalently, Azumaya).</description>

      <title>Computing Invariant Spaces via Global Cluster Analysis and Representation Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Singer algebraic transfer is a fundamental homomorphism in algebraic topology, providing a bridge between the homology of classifying spaces and the cohomology of the Steenrod algebra $\mathcal{A}$, which forms the $E_2$-term of the Adams spectral sequence. The domain of its dual is isomorphic to the space of $GL_k(\mathbb{F}_2)$-invariants in the quotient of the polynomial algebra, $(\mathcal{QP_k})^{GL_k(\mathbb{F}_2)}$, where $\mathcal{P}_k$ is regarded as a module over $\mathcal{A}$. A direct computation of this invariant space and its dual (i.e., the domain of the Singer transfer) remains a challenging problem.
  In this paper, we construct a new algorithm to compute $(\mathcal{QP_k})^{GL_k(\mathbb{F}_2)}$, which differs from the method presented in our recent work [15]. We refer to this new approach as the Global Cluster Analysis algorithm. It builds a \emph{weight interaction graph} to identify clusters of interacting weight spaces that form closed $\Sigma_k$-submodules (where $\Sigma_k \subset GL_k(\mathbb{F}_2)$). By performing invariance analysis on these larger clusters, our algorithm enables a complete and accurate computation of the global $\Sigma_k$-invariants, which are then used to determine the final $GL_k(\mathbb F_2)$-invariants.
  We also introduce an algorithm to directly compute the domain of the Singer transfer for ranks $k \leq 3$ in certain generic degrees, based entirely on Boardman's modular representation theory framework [2].</description>

      <title>An extension of the linearized double shuffle Lie algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The linearized double shuffle Lie algebra $\mathfrak{ls}$ is a well-studied Lie algebra, which reflects the depth-graded structure of multiple zeta values. We introduce a generalization $\mathfrak{lq}$, which is motivated from the $\mathbb{Q}$-algebraic structure of multiple q-zeta values and multiple Eisenstein series. Precisely, we show that $\mathfrak{lq}$ is a Lie algebra, where the Lie bracket is related to Ecalle's ari bracket on bimoulds, and give an embedding of $\mathfrak{ls}$ into $\mathfrak{lq}$.</description>

      <title>Mackey's obstruction map for discrete graded algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.14585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.14585v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: G.W. Mackey's celebrated obstruction theory for projective representations of locally compact groups was remarkably generalized by J. M. G. Fell and R. S. Doran to the wide area of saturated Banach *-algebraic bundles.
  Analogous obstruction is suggested here for discrete group graded algebras which are not necessarily saturated, i.e. strongly graded in the discrete context. The obstruction is a map assigning a certain second cohomology class to every equivariance class of absolutely simple graded modules.
  The set of equivariance classes of such modules is equipped with an appropriate multiplication, namely a graded product, such that the obstruction map is a homomorphism of abelian monoids. Graded products, essentially arising as pull-backs of bundles, admit many nice properties, including a way to twist graded algebras and their graded modules.
  The obstruction class turns out to determine the fine part that appears in the Bahturin-Zaicev-Sehgal decomposition, i.e. the graded Artin-Wedderburn theorem for graded simple algebras which are graded Artinian, in case where the base algebras (i.e. the unit fiber algebras) are finite-dimensional over algebraically closed fields.</description>

      <title>Topology and geometry of the general composition of formal power series -- towards Fr\'echet-Lie group-like formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09853v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we study the properties of the autonomous superposition operator on the space of formal power series, including those with nonzero constant term. We prove its continuity and smoothness with respect to the topology of pointwise convergence and a natural Fr\'echet manifold structure. A necessary and sufficient condition for the left composition inverse of a formal power series to exist is provided. We also present some properties of the Fr\'echet-Lie group structures on the set of nonunit formal power series.</description>

      <title>Cholesky decomposition for symmetric matrices, Riemannian geometry, and random matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02715v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For each $n \geq 1$ and sign pattern $\epsilon \in \{ \pm 1 \}^n$, we introduce a cone of real symmetric matrices $LPM_n(\epsilon)$: those with leading principal $k \times k$ minors of signs $\epsilon_k$. These cones are pairwise disjoint and their union $LPM_n$ is an open dense cone in all symmetric matrices; they subsume positive and negative definite matrices, and symmetric (P-,) N-, PN-, almost P-, and almost N- matrices. We show that each $LPM_n$ matrix $A$ admits an uncountable family of Cholesky-type factorizations - yielding a unique lower triangular matrix $L$ with positive diagonals - with additional attractive properties: (i) each such factorization is algorithmic; and (ii) each such Cholesky map $A \mapsto L$ is a smooth diffeomorphism from $LPM_n(\epsilon)$ onto an open Euclidean ball.
  We then show that (iii) the (diffeomorphic) balls $LPM_n(\epsilon)$ are isometric Riemannian manifolds as well as isomorphic abelian Lie groups, each equipped with a translation-invariant Riemannian metric (and hence Riemannian means/barycentres). Moreover, (iv) this abelian metric group structure on each $LPM_n(\epsilon)$ - and hence the log-Cholesky metric on Cholesky space - yields an isometric isomorphism onto a finite-dimensional Euclidean space. The complex version of this also holds.
  In the latter part, we show that the abelian group $PD_n$ of positive definite matrices, with its bi-invariant log-Cholesky metric, is precisely the identity-component of a larger group with an alternate metric: the open dense cone $LPM_n$. This also holds for Hermitian matrices over several subfields $\mathbb{F} \subseteq \mathbb{C}$. As a result, (v) the groups $LPM_n^{\mathbb{F}}$ and $LPM_\infty^{\mathbb{F}}$ admit a rich probability theory, and the cones $LPM_n(\epsilon), TPM_n(\epsilon)$ admit Wishart densities with signed Bartlett decompositions.</description>
