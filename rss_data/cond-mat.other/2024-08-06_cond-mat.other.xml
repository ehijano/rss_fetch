      <title>Gibbs Sampling gives Quantum Advantage at Constant Temperatures with $O(1)$-Local Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sampling from Gibbs states $\unicode{x2013}$ states corresponding to system in thermal equilibrium $\unicode{x2013}$ has recently been shown to be a task for which quantum computers are expected to achieve super-polynomial speed-up compared to classical computers, provided the locality of the Hamiltonian increases with the system size (Bergamaschi et al., arXiv: 2404.14639). We extend these results to show that this quantum advantage still occurs for Gibbs states of Hamiltonians with O(1)-local interactions at constant temperature by showing classical hardness-of-sampling and demonstrating such Gibbs states can be prepared efficiently using a quantum computer. In particular, we show hardness-of-sampling is maintained even for 5-local Hamiltonians on a 3D lattice. We additionally show that the hardness-of-sampling is robust when we are only able to make imperfect measurements. Beyond these hardness results, we present a lower bound on the temperatures that Gibbs states become easy to sample from classically in terms of the maximum degree of the Hamiltonian's interaction graph.</description>

      <title>First-principles investigation of the emergence of multiferroicity and skyrmions in CrI2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recently discovered van der Waals magnetic semiconductor CrI2 shows promise for spintronic applications. Its electronic and magnetic properties are known to be strongly influenced by electronic correlations. In this work, we employ density functional theory calculations where electronic correlations in CrI2 are considered within an on-site Coulomb interaction, U, with U being determined using the perturbative approach based on the linear response method. We show that the accuracy of an on-site Coulomb interaction is essential for predicting the non-centrosymmetric orthorhombic ground state of CrI2, which allows the existence of ferroelectricity and non-zero Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DMI) interaction. Our calculation shows that the ground state of bulk CrI2 has electric polarization of 0.15 {\mu}C/cm-2 pointing along the z-axis and the small DMI energy that changes sign with the ferroelectric polarization switching. The DMI and polarization are enhanced to 0.28 meV/formula-unit and 0.63 {\mu}C/cm-2 when Pt intercalates bilayers of CrI2, due to its large spin-orbit coupling strength and large off-center displacement. Such an enhanced DMI leads to the N\'eel skyrmions, whose handedness is controlled by ferroelectric polarization. Our work contributes to the creation and manipulation of bits in skyrmions-based memory devices.</description>

      <title>An evidence of pion condensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pion condensation is a theoretical prediction, where pions form a special state of matter under certain extreme conditions in heavy ion collisions or neutron stars. However, there is currently no solid experimental evidence confirming the existence of pion condensation. We present a near-direct evidence for the existence of pion condensation. In actively changing galactic processes protons can be accelerated to very high energies and collide with the medium (protons or nuclei). The kinetic energy of the protons is mainly used to produce a large number of pions in the central region via gluons. When the collision energy exceeds a certain threshold, the huge amount of soft gluons condensed in protons pour into the central region, the number of pion increases abruptly to the saturation limit, and almost all the available collision energy is used to make pions, creating a dense, low-temperature pion condensation environment. Due to energy conservation and relativistic covariance, the gamma ray spectra produced by condensed pions exhibit recognizable broken power law with the gluon condensation characteristics. We find that they are already present in many recorded gamma ray spectra. Our findings reveal a novel mechanism for the generation of pion condensation, which is prevalent in the formation of high-energy cosmic rays, and deepen our understanding of related topics in a variety of disciplines, including particle physics, astrophysics, condensed matter physics and nuclear physics.</description>

      <title>Discrete $Z_4$ symmetry in quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00718v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the discrete $Z_4$ symmetry ${\hat {\bf i}}$, which takes place in the scenario of quantum gravity where the gravitational tetrads emerge as the order parameter. Under this symmetry operation $\hat {\bf i}$, the emerging tetrads are multiplied by the imaginary unit, $\hat {\bf i}\,e^a_\mu = - i e^a_\mu$. The existence of such symmetry and the spontaneous breaking of this symmetry are also supported by the consideration of the symmetry breaking scheme in the topological superfluid $^3$He-B. The order parameter $^3$He-B is the analogue of the tetrad field, but it has complex values. The $\hat {\bf i}$-symmetry operation changes the phase of the complex order parameter by $\pi/2$, which corresponds to the $Z_4$ discrete symmetry in quantum gravity. We also considered the alternative scenario of the breaking of this $Z_4$ symmetry, in which the $\hat {\bf i}$-operation changes sign of the scalar curvature, $\hat {\bf i} \,{\cal R} = - {\cal R}$, and thus the Einstein-Hilbert action violates the $\hat {\bf i}$-symmetry. In the alternative scenario of symmetry breaking, the gravitational coupling $K=1/16\pi G$ plays the role of the order parameter, which changes sign under $\hat {\bf i}$-transformation.</description>

      <title>Multi-temperature atomic ensemble: nonequilibrium evolution after ultrafast electronic excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05718v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultrafast laser radiation or beams of fast charged particles primarily excite the electronic system of a solid driving the target transiently out of thermal equilibrium. Apart from the nonequilibrium between the electrons and atoms, each subsystem may be far from equilibrium. From the first principles, we derive the definition of various atomic temperatures applicable to electronically excited ensembles. It is shown that the definition of the kinetic temperature of atoms in the momentum subspace is unaffected by the excitation of the electronic system. When the electronic temperature differs from the atomic one, an expression for the configurational atomic temperature is proposed, applicable to the electronic-temperature-dependent interatomic potentials (such as ab-initio molecular dynamics simulations). We study how the configurational temperature behaves during nonthermal phase transition, triggered by the evolution of the interatomic potential due to the electronic excitation. It is revealed that upon the ultrafast irradiation, the atomic system of a solid exists temporarily in a multi-temperature state: separate equilibria in the momentum and configurational subspaces. Complete equilibration between the various atomic temperatures takes place at longer timescales, forming the energy equipartition. Based on these results, we propose a formulation of multi-temperature heat transport equations.</description>

      <title>Theory of elastic constants of athermal amorphous solids with internal stresses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.09582</link>
      <description>arXiv:1901.09582v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new microscopic derivation of the elastic constants of amorphous solids is presented within the framework of nonaffine lattice dynamics, which makes use of a perturbative form of the low-frequency eigenvectors of the dynamical matrix introduced in [V. Mazzacurati, G. Ruocco, M. Sampoli EPL 34, 681 (1996)]. The theory correctly recovers the shear modulus at jamming, $\mu \sim (z-2d)$, including prefactors in quantitative agreement with simulations. Furthermore, this framework allows us, for the first time, to include the effect of internal stresses. The theory shows that the Maxwell rigidity criterion $z=2d$ is violated with internal stress. In particular, $\mu \sim (z-2df)$ where $f&lt;1$ if the bonds are, on average, stretched, and the solid is thus rigid below the Maxwell isostatic limit, while $f&gt;1$ if the bonds are, on average, compressed. The coefficient $f$ is derived in analytical form and depends only on $d$ and on the average particle displacement from the interaction energy minimum.</description>

      <title>Subharmonic oscillations in the Floquet circuit with the frequency-synthesis dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18769v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The period-doubling oscillation emerges with the coexistence between zero and {\pi} modes in Floquet topological insulator. Here, utilized the flexibility of the circuit, we construct the Floquet circuit with frequency-synthetic dimension and find the topological-protected deeply-subharmonic oscillations with the period extensively exceeding the doubling-driven period. In the construction framework, the periodically-driven mechanism is attained by implementing the circuit-oscillator hierarchy with the stepping-variation resonances in frequency domain. The zero and {\pi} modes that arise at the Floquet band in the circuit indicate the anomalous boundary-bulk correspondence. The coexistence of zero and {\pi} modes, results in a subharmonic oscillation with the extremely-low frequency on the edge of the Floquet circuit. Furthermore, we explore the Floquet band with the enhanced periodically-driven strength tailored by the component flexibility of the circuit. Our method provides a flexible scheme to study Floquet topological phases, and open a new path for realizing the deeply subwavelength system.</description>
