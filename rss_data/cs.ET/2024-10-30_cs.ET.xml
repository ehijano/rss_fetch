      <title>Deep Optimizer States: Towards Scalable Training of Transformer Models Using Interleaved Offloading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformers and large language models~(LLMs) have seen rapid adoption in all domains. Their sizes have exploded to hundreds of billions of parameters and keep increasing. Under these circumstances, the training of transformers is very expensive and often hits a ``memory wall'', i.e., even when using 3D parallelism (pipeline, tensor, data) and aggregating the memory of many GPUs, it is still not enough to hold the necessary data structures (model parameters, optimizer state, gradients, activations) in GPU memory. To compensate, state-of-the-art approaches offload the optimizer state, at least partially, to the host memory and perform hybrid CPU-GPU computations. However, the management of the combined host-GPU memory is often suboptimal and results in poor overlapping between data movements and computations. This leads to missed opportunities to simultaneously leverage the interconnect bandwidth and computational capabilities of CPUs and GPUs. In this paper, we leverage a key observation that the interleaving of the forward, backward and update phases generate fluctuations in the GPU memory utilization, which can be exploited to dynamically move a part of the optimizer state between the host and the GPU memory at each iteration. To this end, we design and implement \proj, a novel technique to split the LLM into subgroups, whose update phase is scheduled on either the CPU or the GPU based on our proposed performance model that addresses the trade-off between data movement cost, acceleration on the GPUs vs the CPUs, and competition for shared resources. We integrate our approach with DeepSpeed and demonstrate 2.5$\times$ faster iterations over state-of-the-art approaches using extensive experiments.</description>

      <title>Approaches to Simultaneously Solving Variational Quantum Eigensolver Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The variational quantum eigensolver (VQE), a type of variational quantum algorithm, is a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm to find the lowest-energy eigenstate of a particular Hamiltonian. We investigate ways to optimize the VQE solving process on multiple instances of the same problem, by observing the process on one instance of the problem to inform initialization for other processes. We aim to take advantage of the VQE solution process to obtain useful information while disregarding information which we can predict to not be very useful. In particular, we find that the solution process produces lots of data with very little new information. Therefore, we can safely disregard much of this repetitive information with little effect on the outcome of the solution process.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Review of Machine Learning in Sports Betting: Techniques, Challenges, and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The sports betting industry has experienced rapid growth, driven largely by technological advancements and the proliferation of online platforms. Machine learning (ML) has played a pivotal role in the transformation of this sector by enabling more accurate predictions, dynamic odds-setting, and enhanced risk management for both bookmakers and bettors. This systematic review explores various ML techniques, including support vector machines, random forests, and neural networks, as applied in different sports such as soccer, basketball, tennis, and cricket. These models utilize historical data, in-game statistics, and real-time information to optimize betting strategies and identify value bets, ultimately improving profitability. For bookmakers, ML facilitates dynamic odds adjustment and effective risk management, while bettors leverage data-driven insights to exploit market inefficiencies. This review also underscores the role of ML in fraud detection, where anomaly detection models are used to identify suspicious betting patterns. Despite these advancements, challenges such as data quality, real-time decision-making, and the inherent unpredictability of sports outcomes remain. Ethical concerns related to transparency and fairness are also of significant importance. Future research should focus on developing adaptive models that integrate multimodal data and manage risk in a manner akin to financial portfolios. This review provides a comprehensive examination of the current applications of ML in sports betting, and highlights both the potential and the limitations of these technologies.</description>

      <title>Can Large Language Models Act as Symbolic Reasoners?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The performance of Large language models (LLMs) across a broad range of domains has been impressive but have been critiqued as not being able to reason about their process and conclusions derived. This is to explain the conclusions draw, and also for determining a plan or strategy for their approach. This paper explores the current research in investigating symbolic reasoning and LLMs, and whether an LLM can inherently provide some form of reasoning or whether supporting components are necessary, and, if there is evidence for a reasoning capability, is this evident in a specific domain or is this a general capability? In addition, this paper aims to identify the current research gaps and future trends of LLM explainability, presenting a review of the literature, identifying current research into this topic and suggests areas for future work.</description>

      <title>Efficient Reprogramming of Memristive Crossbars for DNNs: Weight Sorting and Bit Stucking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel approach to reduce the number of times required for reprogramming memristors on bit-sliced compute-in-memory crossbars for deep neural networks (DNNs). Our idea addresses the limited non-volatile memory endurance, which restrict the number of times they can be reprogrammed.
  To reduce reprogramming demands, we employ two techniques: (1) we organize weights into sorted sections to schedule reprogramming of similar crossbars, maximizing memristor state reuse, and (2) we reprogram only a fraction of randomly selected memristors in low-order columns, leveraging their bit-level distribution and recognizing their relatively small impact on model accuracy.
  We evaluate our approach for state-of-the-art models on the ImageNet-1K dataset. We demonstrate a substantial reduction in crossbar reprogramming by 3.7x for ResNet-50 and 21x for ViT-Base, while maintaining model accuracy within a 1% margin.</description>

      <title>Noise-Aware Training of Neuromorphic Dynamic Device Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07387v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physical computing has the potential to enable widespread embodied intelligence by leveraging the intrinsic dynamics of complex systems for efficient sensing, processing, and interaction. While individual devices provide basic data processing capabilities, networks of interconnected devices can perform more complex and varied tasks. However, designing networks to perform dynamic tasks is challenging without physical models and accurate quantification of device noise. We propose a novel, noise-aware methodology for training device networks using Neural Stochastic Differential Equations (Neural-SDEs) as differentiable digital twins, accurately capturing the dynamics and associated stochasticity of devices with intrinsic memory. Our approach employs backpropagation through time and cascade learning, allowing networks to effectively exploit the temporal properties of physical devices. We validate our method on diverse networks of spintronic devices across temporal classification and regression benchmarks. By decoupling the training of individual device models from network training, our method reduces the required training data and provides a robust framework for programming dynamical devices without relying on analytical descriptions of their dynamics.</description>

      <title>Sorted Weight Sectioning for Energy-Efficient Unstructured Sparse DNNs on Compute-in-Memory Crossbars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11298v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce $\textit{sorted weight sectioning}$ (SWS): a weight allocation algorithm that places sorted deep neural network (DNN) weight sections on bit-sliced compute-in-memory (CIM) crossbars to reduce analog-to-digital converter (ADC) energy consumption. Data conversions are the most energy-intensive process in crossbar operation. SWS effectively reduces this cost leveraging (1) small weights and (2) zero weights (weight sparsity).
  DNN weights follow bell-shaped distributions, with most weights near zero. Using SWS, we only need low-order crossbar columns for sections with low-magnitude weights. This reduces the quantity and resolution of ADCs used, exponentially decreasing ADC energy costs without significantly degrading DNN accuracy.
  Unstructured sparsification further sharpens the weight distribution with small accuracy loss. However, it presents challenges in hardware tracking of zeros: we cannot switch zero rows to other layer weights in unsorted crossbars without index matching. SWS efficiently addresses unstructured sparse models using offline remapping of zeros into earlier sections, which reveals full sparsity potential and maximizes energy efficiency.
  Our method reduces ADC energy use by 89.5% on unstructured sparse BERT models. Overall, this paper introduces a novel algorithm to promote energy-efficient CIM crossbars for unstructured sparse DNN workloads.</description>
