      <title>Magnetic-field suppression of tomographic electron transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Degenerate two-dimensional electron liquids are theoretically established to possess two vastly distinct collisional electron mean free paths, where even-parity deformations of the Fermi surface are hydrodynamic with a short collisional mean free path but odd-parity deformations remain near ballistic (known as the "tomographic" transport regime). Predicted signatures of this regime rely on the scaling of observables with temperature or device dimension, both of which are difficult to establish with certainty. Here, we consider magnetotransport in a minimal model of tomographic electrons and show that even a small magnetic field suppresses tomographic transport signatures and thus acts as a sensitive and unique probe of this regime. Fundamentally, the magnetic field breaks time-reversal invariance, which is a prerequisite for the odd-even parity effect in the collisional relaxation. We analyze in detail the scaling of the transverse conductivity, which has been linked to small-channel conductance of interaction-dominated electrons, and show that a tomographic scaling regime at intermediate wavenumbers is quickly suppressed with magnetic field to a hydrodynamic or collisionless form. We confirm that the suppression occurs at relatively small magnetic fields when the cyclotron radius is comparable to the ballistic mean free path of the dominant odd-parity mode. This occurs at a much smaller magnetic field than the magnetic field strength required to suppress hydrodynamic electron transport, which suggests an experimental protocol to extract the odd-parity mean free path.</description>

      <title>Universal Moir\'e-Model-Building Method without Fitting: Application to Twisted MoTe$_2$ and WSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a comprehensive method to construct analytical continuum models for moir\'e systems directly from first-principle calculations without any parameter fitting. The core idea of this method is to interpret the terms in the continuum model as a basis, allowing us to determine model parameters as coefficients of this basis through Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization. We apply our method to twisted MoTe$_2$ and WSe$_2$ with twist angles ranging from 2.13$^\circ$ to 3.89$^\circ$, producing continuum models that exhibit excellent agreement with both energy bands and wavefunctions obtained from first-principles calculations. We further propose a strategy to integrate out the higher-energy degrees of freedom to reduce the number of the parameters in the model without sacrificing the accuracy for low-energy bands. Our findings reveal that decreasing twist angles typically need an increasing number of harmonics in the moir\'e potentials to accurately replicate first-principles results. We provide parameter values for all derived continuum models, facilitating further robust many-body calculations. Our approach is general and applicable to any commensurate moir\'e materials accessible by first-principles calculations.</description>

      <title>Latent Haldane Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Latent symmetries, which materialize after performing isospectral reductions, have recently been shown to be instrumental in revealing novel topological phases in one-dimensional systems, among many other applications. In this work, we explore how to construct a family of seemingly complicated two-dimensional models that result in energy-dependent Haldane models upon performing an isospectral reduction. In these models, we find energy-dependent latent Semenoff masses without introducing a staggered on-site potential. In addition, energy-dependent latent Haldane masses also emerge in decorated lattices with nearest-neighbor complex hoppings. Using the Haldane model's properties, we then predict the location of the topological gaps in the aforementioned family of models and construct phase diagrams to determine where the topological phases lie in parameter space. This idea yielded, for instance, useful insights in the case of a modified version of $\alpha$-graphyne and hexagonal plaquettes with additional decorations, where the gap-closing energies can be calculated using the ISR to predict topological phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Tuning the Quasi-bound States of Double-barrier Structures: Insights from Resonant Tunneling Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the resonant tunneling (RT) of electrons and H atoms in double-barrier (DB) systems. Our numerical calculations directly verify the correspondence between the resonant tunneling energies and the energy levels of quasi-bound states (QBS) within the double barriers. Based on this, in-depth analyses are carried out on the modulation of QBS energy levels and numbers which show step variation with the inter-barrier spacing. The mathematical criterion for the existence of QBS is derived, and the impacts of the barrier width and barrier height on QBS levels are investigated. Taking the rectangular double-barrier as an example, we have studied the manipulation of electronic structures and optical properties of the inter-barrier region (quasi-potential well) by tuning the inter-barrier spacing (width of quasi-potential well). Atom-like optical absorption features are found in the range of infrared to visible spectrum, which can be continuously tuned by the variation of quasi-potential well width. The potential application of double-barrier nanostructures in ultrahigh-precision detection of electromagnetic radiations is demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Evidence of Orbital Hall current revealed in second harmonic response of longitudinal and transverse voltage in light metal-ferromagnet bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present experimental evidence of orbital Hall torque and unidirectional magnetoresistance (UMR), arising from the orbital Hall effect generated by the transverse flow of orbital angular momentum in light metals under an applied electric current. Through second-harmonic measurements, we investigate orbital Hall torque and UMR in bilayer devices composed of ferromagnetic materials (FM), such as Ni and NiFe, paired with light metals (LM), such as Ti and Nb. Our results demonstrate that LM/Ni bilayers exhibit enhanced damping-like torque and unidirectional magnetoresistance (UMR) compared to LM/NiFe bilayers. This enhancement suggests that angular momentum is generated via the orbital Hall effect within the light metal, where it undergoes orbital-to-spin conversion within the Ni ferromagnet, ultimately transferring to the magnetization of the ferromagnetic layer. Torque and UMR are also absent in single-layer devices, highlighting the necessity of the bilayer structure for orbital current generation.</description>

      <title>Exciton Enhanced Giant Correlated Stoke AntiStokes Scattering of Multiorder Phonons in Semiconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The correlated Stoke antiStokes (SaS) scattering plays a crucial role in quantum information processing, such as heralded light sources, Fock state dynamics, and write read protocol for quantum memory. However, several reported materials exhibit low degree of SaS correlation and require high-power pulse laser excitation, limiting further applications. Herein, we explore the giant correlated multiorder SaS scattering under low power continuous laser excitation through red-sideband resonance of exciton in semiconductor ZnTe nanobelts. At low temperatures, we observe an unexpectedly strong anti-Stokes signal for multiorder longitudinal optical phonons, with SaS correlations two or four orders of magnitude larger than reported results. Furthermore, we observed the mitigation of laser heating effect for longitudinal optical phonon in SaS scattering. This finding paves a new pathway to study multiorder quantum correlated photon pairs produced through exciton-resonant Raman scattering.</description>

      <title>Electron-Magnon Coupling Mediated Magnetotransport in Antiferromagnetic van der Waals Heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron-magnon coupling reveals key insights into the interfacial properties between non-magnetic metals and magnetic insulators, influencing charge transport and spin dynamics. Here, we present temperature-dependent Raman spectroscopy and magneto-transport measurements of few-layer graphene (FLG)/antiferromagnetic FePS\(_3\) heterostructures. The magnon mode in FePS\(_3\) softens below 40 K, and effective magnon stiffness decreases with cooling. Magnetotransport measurements show that FLG exhibits negative magnetoresistance (MR) in the heterostructure at low fields (\(\pm 0.2 \, \text{T}\)), persisting up to 100 K; beyond this, MR transitions to positive. Notably, as layer thickness decreases, the coupling strength at the interface reduces, leading to a suppression of negative MR. Additionally, magnetodielectric measurements in the FLG/FePS\(_3\)/FLG heterostructure show an upturn at temperatures significantly below ($T_\text{N}$), suggesting a role for the magnon mode in capacitance, as indicated by hybridization between magnon and phonon bands in pristine FePS\(_3\) \textit{via} magnetoelastic coupling.</description>

Abstract: Quantum brachistochrone method has recently emerged as a technique allowing one to implement the desired unitary evolution operator in a physical system within the minimal time. Here, we apply this approach to the problem of time-optimal quantum state transfer in the array of three qubits with time-varying nearest-neighbor couplings and analytically derive the fastest protocol.</description>

      <title>Spin-valley-polarized Weiss oscillations in monolayer 1{\it T}$^{\prime}$-\ce{MoS2}</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monolayer 1{\it T}$^{\prime}$-\ce{MoS2} exhibits spin- and valley-dependent massive tilted Dirac cones with two velocity correction terms in low-energy effective Hamiltonian. We theoretically investigate the longitudinal diffusive magnetoconductivity of monolayer 1{\it T}$^{\prime}$-\ce{MoS2} by using the linear response theory. It is shown that, when the Fermi level is close to the spin-orbit coupling gap, the Weiss oscillation splits into two branches and exhibits spin-valley polarization in the presence of both a spatial periodic electric potential modulation in the lateral direction and a nonzero perpendicular electric field. The spin-valley polarization stems from the interplay between the tilted Dirac cones, the spin-orbit coupling gap, and the external electric potential modulation, and can be treated as a signature of monolayer 1{\it T}$^{\prime}$-\ce{MoS2}. When the Fermi level is far from the spin-orbit coupling gap, the spin-polarization appears in the Weiss oscillation under a magnetic field modulation in the lateral direction. This polarization behavior arises from the interplay between the tilted Dirac cones, the spin-orbit coupling, and the external magnetic field modulation, indicating that a finite spin-orbit coupling gap is not indispensable for polarization in the Weiss oscillation.</description>

      <title>Cavity-enhanced circular dichroism in a van der Waals antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Broken symmetry plays a pivotal role in determining the macroscopic electrical, optical, magnetic, and topological properties of materials. Circular dichroism (CD) has been widely employed to probe broken symmetry in various systems, from small molecules to bulk crystals, but designing CD responses on demand remains a challenge, especially for antiferromagnetic materials. Here, we develop a cavity-enhanced CD technique to sensitively probe the magnetic order and broken symmetry in the van der Waals antiferromagnet FePS3. By introducing interfacial inversion asymmetry in cavity-coupled FePS3 crystals, we demonstrate that the induced CD is strongly coupled with the zig-zag antiferromagnetic order of FePS3 and can be tuned both spectrally and in magnitude by varying the cavity length and FePS3 thickness. Our findings open new avenues for using cavity-modulated CD as a sensitive diagnostic probe to detect weak broken symmetries, particularly at hidden interfaces, and in systems exhibiting hidden spin polarization or strong correlations.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Accelerated Quantum Transport Simulations in Nanoelectronics: From Break Junctions to Field-Effect Transistors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum transport calculations are essential for understanding and designing nanoelectronic devices, yet the trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency has long limited their practical applications. We present a general framework that combines the deep learning tight-binding Hamiltonian (DeePTB) approach with the non-equilibrium Green's Function (NEGF) method, enabling efficient quantum transport calculations while maintaining first-principles accuracy. We demonstrate the capabilities of the DeePTB-NEGF framework through two representative applications: comprehensive simulation of break junction systems, where conductance histograms show good agreement with experimental measurements in both metallic contact and single-molecule junction cases; and simulation of carbon nanotube field effect transistors through self-consistent NEGF-Poisson calculations, capturing essential physics including the electrostatic potential and transfer characteristic curves under finite bias conditions. This framework bridges the gap between first-principles accuracy and computational efficiency, providing a powerful tool for high-throughput quantum transport simulations across different scales in nanoelectronics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the ground state of a weakly charged two-dimensional electron-hole fluid in a strong magnetic field is a broken translational symmetry state with interpenetrating lattices of localized vortices and antivortices in the electron-hole-pair field. The vortices and antivortices carry fractional charges of equal sign but unequal magnitude and have a honeycomb lattice structure that contrasts with the triangular lattices of superconducting electron-electron-pair vortex lattices. We predict that increasing charge density and weakening magnetic fields drive vortex delocalization transitions signaled experimentally by abrupt increases in counterflow transport resistance.</description>

      <title>Non-Fermi liquids from subsystem symmetry breaking in van der Waals multilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the spontaneous breaking of subsystem symmetry in a stack of two-dimensional Fermi liquid metals, each maintaining a subsystem number conservation symmetry, driven by interlayer exciton condensation. The resulting Goldstone modes in this broken symmetry phase couple to the quasiparticle current perpendicular to the layers. This coupling, which remains non-zero for small momentum transfers, leads to the emergence of a three-dimensional anisotropic marginal Fermi liquid state when the number of layers is sufficiently large. We propose a possible experimental realization of this phenomenon in two-dimensional multilayer van der Waals heterostructures. Using self-consistent mean-field calculations, we characterize the subsystem symmetry-broken metallic state and examine the effects of fluctuations on its physical properties within the random phase approximation. We find that these fluctuations produce additional logarithmic enhancements to the specific heat at low temperature, specifically $C\sim T (\log(1/T))^2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological quantum computation relies on control of non-Abelian anyons for inherently fault-tolerant storage and processing of quantum information. By now, blueprints for topological qubits are well developed for electrically active topological superconductor and fractional quantum Hall platforms. We leverage recent insights into the creation and detection of non-Abelian anyons in electrically insulating spin systems to propose topological qubit architectures based on quantum spin liquids. We present two types of prototype designs that enable the requisite control in a potentially scalable framework: one invokes spin liquids integrated into magnetic tunnel junction arrays, the other uses semiconductor-spin liquid hybrids. We further identify various protocols for interrogating spin-liquid-based topological qubits, both to validate the underlying principles of topological quantum computation and to establish gates required for universal quantum computation. These results provide long-term direction for experimental investigation of Kitaev materials and potentially other solid-state spin liquid hosts.</description>

      <title>Atomic-scale mapping of superconductivity in the incoherent CDW mosaic phase of a transition metal dichalcogenide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of superconductivity in the octahedrally coordinated (1T) phase of TaS2 is preceded by the intriguing loss of long-range order in the charge density wave (CDW). Such decoherence, attainable by different methods, results in the formation of nm-sized coherent CDW domains bound by a two-dimensional network of domain walls (DW) - mosaic phase -, which has been proposed as the spatial origin of the superconductivity. Here, we report the atomic-scale characterization of the superconducting state of 1T-TaSSe, a model 1T compound exhibiting the CDW mosaic phase. We use high-resolution scanning tunneling spectroscopy and Andreev spectroscopy to probe the microscopic nature of the superconducting state in unambiguous connection with the electronic structure of the mosaic phase. Spatially resolved conductance maps at the Fermi level at the onset of superconductivity reveal that the density of states is mostly localized on the CDW domains compared to the domain walls, which suggests their dominant role in the formation of superconductivity. This scenario is confirmed within the superconducting dome at 340 mK, where superconductivity is fully developed, and the subtle spatial inhomogeneity of the superconducting gap remains unlinked to the domain wall network. Our results provide key new insights into the fundamental interplay between superconductivity and CDW in these relevant strongly correlated systems.</description>

      <title>Microscopic Theory of Polariton Group Velocity Renormalization</title>

Abstract: Cavity exciton-polaritons exhibit ballistic transport and can achieve a distance of 100 $\mu $m in one picosecond. This ballistic transport significantly enhances mobility compared to that of bare excitons, which often move diffusively and become the bottleneck for energy conversion and transfer devices. Despite being robustly reproduced in experiments and simulations, there is no comprehensive microscopic theory addressing the group velocity of polariton transport, and its renormalization due to phonon scattering while still preserving this ballistic behavior. In this work, we develop a microscopic theory to describe the group velocity renormalization using a finite-temperature Green's function approach. Utilizing the generalized Holstein-Tavis-Cummings Hamiltonian, we analytically derive an expression for the group velocity renormalization and find that it is caused by phonon-mediated transitions from the lower polariton states to the dark states. The theory predicts that the magnitude of group velocity renormalization scales linearly with the phonon bath reorganization energy under weak coupling conditions and also linearly depends on the temperature in the high-temperature regime. These predictions are numerically verified using quantum dynamics simulations via the mean-field Ehrenfest method, demonstrating quantitative agreement. Our findings provide theoretical insights and a predictive analytical framework that advance the understanding and design of cavity-modified semiconductors and molecular ensembles, opening new avenues for engineered polaritonic devices.</description>

Abstract: A recent experiment reports a creation of goldene, which is two-dimensional gold with hexagonal structure. By rolling up the goldene, gold nanotubes (GNT) should exist, but their structural and electronic properties are not understood well. Based on first-principles calculations, we demonstrate a breakdown of inverse square law, wherein the curvature energy stored in a GNT decreases with the inverse square of the GNT radius. This is due to the enhanced curvature energy in specific GNTs having nearly flat bands around the Fermi level. We show that the electron states on the flat band of GNT reflect those on the Fermi surface of goldene by using the Bloch and geometric boundary conditions, and that in-plane character of the latter states enhances the curvature energy.</description>

Abstract: Inertial waves in convective regions of stars exhibit topological properties linked to a Chern number of 1. The first of these is a unique, unidirectional, prograde oscillation mode within the cavity, which propagates at arbitrarily low frequencies for moderate azimuthal wavenumbers. The second one are phase singularities around which the phase winds in Fourier space, with winding numbers of $\pm 1$ depending on the hemisphere. Phase winding is a collective effect over waves propagating in all directions that is strongly robust to noise. This suggests a topology-based method for wave detection in noisy observational data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose the realization of a fractional Chern mosaic: a state characterized by a spatially varying topological order. This state is enabled by a separation of length scales that emerges when three graphene sheets are sequentially rotated by a small twist angle. The resulting structure features not only conventional moir\'e lattices, but also a much larger supermoir\'e lattice. We demonstrate that a fractional Chern mosaic arises when electron correlations induce fractionalization locally on the moir\'e scale, while the pattern of fractionalization varies at the supermoir\'e scale.</description>

Abstract: It is well known that a nontrivial Chern number results in quantized Hall conductance. What is less known is that, generically, the Hall response can be dramatically different from its quantized value in materials with broken inversion symmetry. This stems from the leading Hall contribution beyond the linear order, known as the Berry curvature dipole (BCD). While the BCD is in principle always present, it is typically very small outside of a narrow window close to a topological transition and is thus experimentally elusive without careful tuning of external fields, temperature, or impurities. In this work, we transcend this challenge by devising optical driving and quench protocols that enable practical and direct access to large BCD and nonlinear Hall responses. Varying the amplitude of an incident circularly polarized laser drives a topological transition between normal and Chern insulator phases, and importantly allows the precise unlocking of nonlinear Hall currents comparable to or larger than the linear Hall contributions. This strong BCD engineering is even more versatile with our two-parameter quench protocol, as demonstrated in our experimental proposal. Our predictions are expected to hold qualitatively across a broad range of Hall materials, thereby paving the way for the controlled engineering of nonlinear electronic properties in diverse media.</description>

      <title>Hybrid acousto-optical swing-up state control in a quantum dot</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07887v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: State transfer between different quantum systems is key for successful quantum technologies. Over long distances, photons are irreplaceable, but on short ranges in miniaturized complex devices or hybrid systems, coupling via orders of magnitude shorter wavelength acoustic waves has great potential. With interfaces to light, acoustic waves, and more, optically active quantum dots (QDs) are essential for multi-component systems. Here, we propose a hybrid acousto-optical method of non-resonant QD charge state control as an extension of the recent all-optical swing-up state preparation. We show that exciton and biexciton states or other superpositions of charge states can be prepared. Each field can act as a trigger, so an optically gated acoustic control and the opposite scheme, where an optical pulse controls the transition during acoustic modulation, can be implemented. Thus, we introduce acoustic state control into a system that lacks direct acoustic coupling between the states. The method does not rely on pulse shaping and is expected to work with arbitrary pulse shapes. Evaluating the phonon impact, we find an almost decoherence-free exciton preparation even at elevated temperatures with current QD and acoustic technology. This approach may also pave the way for optically controlled entanglement between emitters and acoustic modes and further on-chip state transfer via quantum acoustic busses.</description>

Abstract: Two dimensional materials subject to long-wavelength modulations have emerged as novel platforms to study topological and correlated quantum phases. In this article, we develop a versatile and computationally inexpensive method to predict the topological properties of materials subjected to a superlattice potential by combining degenerate perturbation theory with the method of symmetry indicators. In the absence of electronic interactions, our analysis provides a systematic rule to find the Chern number of the superlattice-induced miniband starting from the harmonics of the applied potential and a few material-specific coefficients. Our method also applies to anomalous (interaction-generated) bands, for which we derive an efficient algorithm to determine all Chern numbers compatible with a self-consistent solution to the Hartree-Fock equations. Our approach gives a microscopic understanding of the quantum anomalous Hall insulators recently observed in rhombohedral graphene multilayers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14125v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a computational study to explore the potential of different experimental approaches to tune the magnetic interactions in two-dimensional van der Waals magnets. We selected CrGeSe$_3$, CrGeTe$_3$, and Janus Cr$_2$Ge$_2$(Se,Te)$_3$ monolayers as case studies and calculated the full exchange tensors among all relevant atomic pairs and analyze their dependence on different external parameters, such as biaxial and uniaxial strain, as well as gate voltage. We pay special attention to interactions that emerge or vanish due to changes of the symmetry of the system. We find that biaxial and uniaxial strains significantly modify isotropic exchange couplings, which can lead to a transition from a ferromagnetic to an antiferromagnetic phase, while a gate voltage induces Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions, forming a vortex pattern whose chirality is determined by the sign of the electric field. The electric dipole moment of the Janus material is large, raising the possibility of multiferroic behaviour. The polarizability is similar for the three compounds.</description>

      <title>Phonon-induced modification of polaritonic Rabi oscillations in the presence of the dark excitonic condensate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13882v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optically inactive (dark) intervalley momentum-forbidden excitons are characterized by relatively long life time, and therefore are desirable candidates for realizing collective excitonic phases. However, testing their coherence by light directly is impossible. Here we propose a method for detecting a dark excitonic condensate. It relies on the interaction between excitons and phonons responsible for the interconversion between bright and dark excitons. As long as the dark condensate forms, the Rabi oscillations between photons and bright excitons can become strongly modified, and can be viewed as the photon-exciton-phonon polaritonic effect. The multi-component nature of the dark condensate consistent with the point-group symmetry is taken into account in the limit of weak phonon-exciton interaction. A perspective for the case of the strong interaction leading to the polaronic effect is discussed.</description>

      <title>Signatures of topology in generic transport measurements for Rarita-Schwinger-Weyl semimetals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17447v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate how the signatures of the topological properties of the bandstructures for nodal-point semimetals are embedded in the response coefficients, arising in two distinct experimental set-ups, by taking the Rarita-Schwinger-Weyl (RSW) semimetal as an example. The first scenario involves the computation of third-rank tensors representing second-order response coefficients, relating the charge/thermal current densities to the combined effects of the gradient of the chemical potential and an external electric field/temperature gradient. On the premises that internode scatterings can be ignored, the relaxation-time approximation leads to a quantized value for the nonvanishing components of each of these nonlinear response tensors, characterizing a single untilted RSW node. Furthermore, the final expressions turn out to be insensitive to the specific values of the chemical potential and the temperature. The second scenario involves computing the magnetoelectric conductivity under the action of collinear electric ($\mathbf E$) and magnetic ($\mathbf B$) fields, representing a planar Hall set-up. In particular, our focus is in bringing out the dependence of the linear-in-$|\mathbf B|$ parts of the conductivity tensor on the intrinsic topological properties of the bandstructure, which are nonvanishing only in the presence of a nonzero tilt in the energy spectrum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06891v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Voltage is a sensitive quantity to quantum interference in coherent electronic transport. We study the voltage fluctuations in disordered graphene nanoribbons with zigzag and armchair edge terminations in a four-terminal configuration. We show that the average and standard deviation of the voltage oscillates with the separation of the attached voltage probes and depend on the coupling strength of the probes. The voltage fluctuations can be large enough to observe negative voltages for weakly coupled probes. As we numerically verified, the voltage fluctuations are described within a random matrix approach for weakly disordered nanoribbons at energies away from the Fermi energy. However, near the Fermi energy, zigzag nanoribbons exhibit Anderson localization, whereas electrons are anomalously localized in armchair nanoribbons. This distinction leads to different voltage statistics for zigzag and armchair nanoribbons.</description>

Abstract: Quantum dot-based spin qubit realization is one of the most promising quantum computing systems owing to its integrability with classical computation hardware and its versatility in realizing qubits and quantum gates. In this work, we investigate a quantum dot-based universal set of quantum gates (single qubit gates and the Toffoli gate) in the presence of hyperfine fluctuation noise and phononic charge noise. We model the spin dynamics and noise processes in the NOT gate, Hadamard gate and the Toffoli gate using the Lindblad master equation formalism to estimate the operating ranges of the external static and ac magnetic fields to achieve high fidelity operation of these gates in a noisy environment. In addition, the generality of the framework proposed in this paper enables modeling of larger quantum processors based on spin qubits in realistic conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15065v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transport in open quantum systems can be explored through various theoretical frameworks, including the quantum master equation, scattering matrix, and Heisenberg equation of motion. The choice of framework depends on factors such as the presence of interactions, the coupling strength between the system and environment, and whether the focus is on steady-state or transient regimes. Existing literature treats these frameworks independently, lacking a unified perspective. Our work addresses this gap by clarifying the role and status of these approaches using a minimal single-level quantum dot model in a two-terminal setup under voltage and temperature biases. We derive analytical expressions for particle and energy currents and their fluctuations in both steady-state and transient regimes. Exact results from the Heisenberg equation are shown to align with scattering matrix and master equation approaches within their respective validity regimes. Crucially, we establish a protocol for the weak-coupling limit, bridging the applicability of master equations at weak-coupling with Heisenberg or scattering matrix approaches at arbitrary coupling strength.</description>

Abstract: We present a comprehensive study on the longitudinal magneto-thermal transport in a paramagnetic effective spin-1/2 magnetic insulator CsYbSe$_2$, by introducing a minimal model requiring only Zeeman splitting and magnetoelastic coupling. We use it to argue that hybridized excitations -- formed from acoustic phonons and localized spin-flip-excitations across the Zeeman gap of the crystal electric field ground doublet -- are responsible for a non-monotonic field dependence of longitudinal thermal conductivity. Beyond highlighting a starring role for phonons, our results raise the prospect of universal magneto-thermal transport phenomena in paramagnetic insulators that originate from simple features shared across many systems.</description>

Abstract: Describing the ground states of continuous, real-space quantum many-body systems, like atoms and molecules, is a significant computational challenge with applications throughout the physical sciences. Recent progress was made by variational methods based on machine learning (ML) ansatzes. However, since these approaches are based on energy minimization, ansatzes must be twice differentiable. This (a) precludes the use of many powerful classes of ML models; and (b) makes the enforcement of bosonic, fermionic, and other symmetries costly. Furthermore, (c) the optimization procedure is often unstable unless it is done by imaginary time propagation, which is often impractically expensive in modern ML models with many parameters. The stochastic representation of wavefunctions (SRW), introduced in Nat Commun 14, 3601 (2023), is a recent approach to overcoming (c). SRW enables imaginary time propagation at scale, and makes some headway towards the solution of problem (b), but remains limited by problem (a). Here, we argue that combining SRW with path integral techniques leads to a new formulation that overcomes all three problems simultaneously. As a demonstration, we apply the approach to generalized ``Hooke's atoms'': interacting particles in harmonic wells. We benchmark our results against state-of-the-art data where possible, and use it to investigate the crossover between the Fermi liquid and the Wigner molecule within closed-shell systems. Our results shed new light on the competition between interaction-driven symmetry breaking and kinetic-energy-driven delocalization.</description>

      <title>Current-induced sliding motion in a helimagnet MnAu$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00167v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We found signatures of current-induced sliding motion in helimagnetic $\mathrm{Mn}\mathrm{Au}_2$ thin films. An abrupt change in differential resistivity occurred at a threshold bias current in the helimagnetic state, whereas it was absent in the induced ferromagnetic state. Broadband voltage noise also emerged above the threshold current in the helimagnetic state. Based on the similarity to canonical charge/spin density wave systems, we ascribed the origin of these phenomena to the sliding motion of the helimagnetic structure.</description>

      <title>Multipolar Skyrmion Crystals in Non-Kramers Doublet Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14404v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Kondo lattice model of multipolar magnetic moments interacting with conduction electrons on a triangular lattice. Bond-dependent electron hoppings induce a compass-like anisotropy in the effective Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida interaction between multipolar moments. This unique anisotropy stabilizes multipolar skyrmion crystals at zero magnetic field. In a unit cell, the skyrmion fractionalizes into meron composites subject to the conservation of total topological charge. Diverse multipolar phases in the phase diagram give rise to novel spontaneous Hall response of conduction electrons.</description>

      <title>Refined cyclic renormalization group in Russian Doll model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08573v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Focusing on Bethe-ansatz integrable models, robust to both time-reversal symmetry breaking and disorder, we consider the Russian Doll Model (RDM) for finite system sizes and energy levels. Suggested as a time-reversal-symmetry breaking deformation of Richardson's model, the well-known and simplest model of superconductivity, RDM revealed an unusual cyclic renormalization group (RG) over the system size $N$, where the energy levels repeat themselves, shifted by one after a finite period in $\ln N$, supplemented by a hierarchy of superconducting condensates, with the superconducting gaps following the so-called Efimov (exponential) scaling. The equidistant single-particle spectrum of RDM made the above Efimov scaling and cyclic RG to be asymptotically exact in the wideband limit of the diagonal potential. Here, we generalize this observation in various respects. We find that, beyond the wideband limit, when the entire spectrum is considered, the periodicity of the spectrum is not constant, but appears to be energy-dependent. Moreover, we resolve the apparent paradox of shift in the spectrum by a single level after the RG period, despite the disappearance of a finite fraction of energy levels. We also analyze the effects of disorder in the diagonal potential on the above periodicity and show that it survives only for high energies beyond the energy interval of the disorder amplitude. Our analytic analysis is supported with exact diagonalization.</description>

      <title>Manipulating Spectral Windings and Skin Modes through Nonconservative Couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15005v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The discovery of the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) has revolutionized our understanding of wave propagation in non-Hermitian systems, highlighting unexpected localization effects beyond conventional theories. Here, we discover that NHSE, accompanied by multitype spectral phases, can be induced by manipulating nonconservative couplings. By characterizing the spectra through the windings of the energy bands, we demonstrate that band structures with identical, opposite, and even twisted windings can be achieved. These inequivalent types of spectra originate from the multichannel interference resulting from the interplay between conservative and nonconservative couplings. Associated with the multitype spectra, unipolar and bipolar NHSE with different eigenmode localizations can be observed. Additionally, our findings link the nonreciprocal transmission properties of the system to multiple spectral phases, indicating a connection with the skin modes. This paper paves new pathways for investigating non-Hermitian topological effects and manipulating nonreciprocal energy flow.</description>

      <title>Chiral superconductivity from parent Chern band and its non-Abelian generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05384v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a minimal model starting from a parent Chern band with quartic dispersion that can describe the spin-valley polarized electrons in rhombohedral tetra-layer graphene. The interplay between repulsive and attractive interactions on top of that parent Chern band is studied. We conduct standard self-consistent mean-field calculations, and find a rich phase diagram that consists of metal, quantum anomalous Hall crystal, chiral topological superconductor, as well as trivial gapped Bose-Einstein condensate. In particular, there exists a topological phase transition from the chiral superconductor to the Bose-Einstein condensate at zero temperature. Motivated by the recent experimental and theoretical studies of composite Fermi liquid in rhombohedral stacked multi-layer graphene, we further generalize the physical electron model to its composite fermion counterpart based on a field theory analysis. The chiral superconductor phase of the composite fermion becomes the non-Abelian Moore-Read quantum Hall phase. We argue that a chiral (pseudo-)spin liquid phase can emerge in the vicinity of this Moore-Read quantum Hall phase. Our work suggests rhombohedral multi-layer graphene as a potential platform for rich correlated topological phases.</description>
