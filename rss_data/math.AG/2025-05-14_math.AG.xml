      <title>Sparse systems and algorithmic equidimensional decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new probabilistic algorithm that characterizes the equidimensional components of the affine algebraic variety defined by an arbitrary sparse polynomial system with prescribed supports. For each equidimensional component, the algorithm computes a witness set, namely a finite set obtained by intersecting the component with a generic linear variety of complementary dimension. The complexity of the algorithm is polynomial in combinatorial invariants associated to the supports of the polynomials involved.</description>

      <title>Splicing braid varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a positive braid $\beta \in \mathrm{Br}^{+}_{k}$, we consider the braid variety $X(\beta)$. We define a family of open sets $\mathcal{U}_{r, w}$ in $X(\beta)$, where $w \in S_k$ is a permutation and $r$ is a positive integer no greater than the length of $\beta$. For fixed $r$, the sets $\mathcal{U}_{r, w}$ form an open cover of $X(\beta)$. We conjecture that $\mathcal{U}_{r,w}$ is given by the nonvanishing of some cluster variables in a single cluster for the cluster structure on $\mathbb{C}[X(\beta)]$ and that $\mathcal{U}_{r,w}$ admits a cluster structure given by freezing these variables. Moreover, we show that $\mathcal{U}_{r, w}$ is always isomorphic to the product of two braid varieties, and we conjecture that this isomorphism is quasi-cluster. In some important special cases, we are able to prove our conjectures.</description>

      <title>A new class of compactified Jacobians for families of reduced curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is the first paper of a series of three. Here we give an abstract definition of the relative compactified Jacobian of a family of reduced curves. We prove that, under some mild assumptions on the family of curves, the fibres of the relative Jacobian are schemes (and not just algebraic spaces).
  We define V-stability conditions, and use them to construct relative compactified Jacobians. This extends the classical methods to produce modular compactifications of the Jacobian. To conclude, we show that, in the case when the curves have at worst planar singularities, the compactified Jacobians constructed from V-stability conditions have the same good properties of the classical ones.</description>

      <title>Nonprojective crepant resolutions of quiver varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct a large class of examples of proper, nonprojective crepant resolutions of singularities for Nakajima quiver varieties. These include four and six dimensional examples and examples with $Q$ containing only three vertices. There are two main techniques: by taking a locally projective resolution of a projective partial resolution as in our previous work arXiv:2311.07539, and more generally by taking quotients of open subsets of representation space which are not stable loci, related to Arzhantsev--Derental--Hausen--Laface's construction in the setting of Cox rings. By the latter method we exhibit a proper crepant resolution that does not factor through a projective partial resolution. Most of our quiver settings involve one-dimensional vector spaces, hence the resolutions are toric hyperk\"ahler, which were studied from a different point of view in Arbo and Proudfoot arXiv:1511.09138.
  This builds on the classification of projective crepant resolutions of a large class of quiver varieties in arXiv:2212.09623 and the classification of proper crepant resolutions for the hyperpolygon quiver varieties in arXiv:2406.04117.</description>

      <title>Worldsheet fermion correlators, modular tensors and higher genus integration kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cyclic product of an arbitrary number of Szeg\"o kernels for even spin structure $\delta$ on a compact higher-genus Riemann surface $\Sigma$ may be decomposed via a descent procedure which systematically separates the dependence on the points $z_i \in \Sigma$ from the dependence on the spin structure $\delta$. In this paper, we prove two different, but complementary, descent procedures to achieve this decomposition. In the first procedure, the dependence on the points $z_i \in \Sigma$ is expressed via the meromorphic multiple-valued Enriquez kernels of e-print 1112.0864 while the dependence on $\delta$ resides in multiplets of functions that are independent of $z_i$, locally holomorphic in the moduli of $\Sigma$ and generally do not have simple modular transformation properties. The $\delta$-dependent constants are expressed as multiple convolution integrals over homology cycles of $\Sigma$, thereby generalizing a similar representation of the individual Enriquez kernels. In the second procedure, which was proposed without proof in e-print 2308.05044, the dependence on $z_i$ is expressed in terms the single-valued, modular invariant, but non-meromorphic DHS kernels introduced in e-print 2306.08644 while the dependence on $\delta$ resides in modular tensors that are independent of $z_i$ and are generally non-holomorphic in the moduli of $\Sigma$. Although the individual building blocks of these decompositions have markedly different properties, we show that the combinatorial structure of the two decompositions is virtually identical, thereby extending the striking correspondence observed earlier between the roles played by Enriquez and DHS kernels. Both decompositions are further generalized to the case of linear chain products of Szeg\"o kernels.</description>

      <title>Majorization and Inequalities among Complete Homogenous Symmetric Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inequalities among symmetric functions are fundamental in various branches of mathematics, thus motivating a systematic study of their structure. Majorization has been shown to characterize inequalities among commonly used symmetric functions, except for complete homogeneous symmetric functions (shortened as CHs). In 2011, Cuttler, Greene, and Skandera posed a natural question: Can majorization also characterize inequalities among CHs? Their work demonstrated that majorization characterizes inequalities among CHs up to degree 7 and suggested exploring its validity for higher degrees. In this paper, we show that, for every degree greater than 7, majorization does not characterize inequalities among CHs.</description>

      <title>Three Tone Networks and a Tessellation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the Eulerian tonnetz, which associates three minor chords to each major chord and three major chords to each minor chord, can be represented by a bipartite graph with twelve white vertices signifying major chords and twelve black vertices signifying minor chords. This so-called Levi graph uniquely determines the combinatorial geometry of a certain remarkable configuration of twelve points and twelve lines in the real projective plane with the property that three points lie on each line and three lines pass through each point. Interesting features of the tonnetz, such as the existence of Cohn's four hexatonic cycles, crucial for the understanding of nineteenth-century voice leading and extended harmony, can be read off rather directly as properties of the configuration. We show that analogous tone networks can be constructed for pentatonic music and twelve-tone music.</description>

      <title>The Open Crepant Transformation Conjecture for Toric Calabi-Yau 3-Orbifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2002.08524v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove an open version of Ruan's Crepant Transformation Conjecture for toric Calabi-Yau 3-orbifolds, which is an identification of disk invariants of K-equivalent semi-projective toric Calabi-Yau 3-orbifolds relative to corresponding Lagrangian suborbifolds of Aganagic-Vafa type. Our main tool is a mirror theorem of Fang-Liu-Tseng that relates these disk invariants to local coordinates on the B-model mirror curves. Treating toric crepant transformations as wall-crossings in the GKZ secondary fan, we establish the identification of disk invariants through constructing a global family of mirror curves over charts of the secondary variety and understanding analytic continuation on local coordinates. Our work generalizes previous results of Brini-Cavalieri-Ross on disk invariants of threefold type-A singularities and of Ke-Zhou on crepant resolutions with effective outer branes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2109.12187v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the syzygies of canonical curves of genus $g\geq 3$ over an algebraically closed field $\mathbb{F}$ of characteristic $p&gt;0$. We provide a new proof of generic Green's Conjecture for $p\geq\frac{g+4}{2}$. Using the techniques from the even-genus case, we establish a significant case of the Geometric Syzygy Conjecture for the last syzygy space of a general even-genus canonical curve (assuming $p&gt;g$). In characteristic 0, it was shown in prior work that this case implies the full conjecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.06115v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent works of Costa-Dalai, Christandl-Gesmundo-Zuiddam, Blatter-Draisma-Rupniewski, and Bri\"et-Christandl-Leigh-Shpilka-Zuiddam have investigated notions of discreteness and gaps in the possible values that asymptotic tensor ranks can take. In particular, it was shown that the asymptotic subrank and asymptotic slice rank of any nonzero 3-tensor is equal to 1, equal to 1.88, or at least 2 (over any field), and that the set of possible values of these parameters is discrete (in several regimes). We determine exactly the next gap, showing that the asymptotic subrank and asymptotic slice rank of any nonzero 3-tensor is equal to 1, equal to 1.88, equal to 2, or at least 2.68.</description>

      <title>The birational geometry of Markov numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17957v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is known that all degenerations of the complex projective plane into a surface with only quotient singularities are controlled by the positive integer solutions $(a,b,c)$ of the Markov equation $$x^2+y^2+z^2=3xyz.$$ It turns out that these degenerations are all connected through finite sequences of other simpler degenerations by means of birational geometry. In this paper, we explicitly describe these birational sequences and show how they are bridged among all Markov solutions. For a given Markov triple $(a,b,c)$, the number of birational modifications depends on the number of branches that it needs to cross in the Markov tree to reach the Fibonacci branch. We show that each of these branches corresponds exactly to a Mori train of the flipping universal family of a particular cyclic quotient singularity defined by $(a,b,c)$. As a byproduct, we obtain new numerical/combinatorial data for each Markov number, and new connections with the Markov conjecture (Frobenius Uniqueness Conjecture), which rely on Hirzebruch-Jung continued fractions of Wahl singularities.</description>

Abstract: We show that for any smooth Calabi--Yau variety, its index can be realized as the index of a Kawamata log terminal (klt) Calabi--Yau pair of lower dimension with standard coefficients. Our approach is based on an inductive argument on the dimension using the Beauville--Bogomolov decomposition. A key step in the argument is to prove that for $n\ge3$, any positive integer $m$ satisfying $\varphi(m)\le 2n$ can be realized as the index of a klt Calabi--Yau pair of dimension $n-1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10723v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a moduli description of the ramified unitary local model of signature $(n-1,1)$ with arbitrary parahoric level structure, assuming the residue field has characteristic not equal to $2$, thereby confirming a conjecture of Smithling. Our approach involves writing down explicit equations for the special fiber and proving that they define a normal, Cohen-Macaulay scheme, which is also of independent interest. As applications, we obtain moduli descriptions for: (1) ramified unitary Pappas-Zhu local models with arbitrary parahoric level; (2) the irreducible components of their special fiber in the maximal parahoric case; (3) integral models of ramified unitary Shimura varieties with arbitrary (quasi-)parahoric level.</description>

      <title>Monodromy in the space of symmetric cubic surfaces with a line</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09270v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the enumerative problem of finding lines on cubic surfaces defined by symmetric polynomials. We prove that the moduli space of symmetric cubic surfaces is an arithmetic quotient of the complex hyperbolic line, and determine constraints on the monodromy group of lines on symmetric cubic surfaces arising from Hodge theory and geometry of the associated cover. This interestingly fails to pin down the entire Galois group. Leveraging computations in equivariant line geometry and homotopy continuation, we prove that the Galois group is the Klein 4-group. This is the first computation in what promises to be an interesting direction of research: studying monodromy in classical enumerative problems restricted by a finite group of symmetries.</description>

      <title>Torsion points of small order on cyclic covers of $\mathbb P^1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03508v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $d\geq 2$ be a positive integer, $K$ an algebraically closed field of characteristic not dividing $d$, $n\geq d+1$ a positive integer that is prime to $d$, $f(x)\in K[x]$ a degree $n$ monic polynomial without multiple roots, $C_{f,d}: y^d=f(x)$ the corresponding smooth plane affine curve over $K$, $\mathcal{C}_{f,d}$ a smooth projective model of $C_{f,d}$ and $J(\mathcal{C}_{f,d})$ the Jacobian of $\mathcal{C}_{f,d} $. We identify $\mathcal{C}_{f,d}$ with the image of its canonical embedding into $J(\mathcal{C}_{f,d})$ (such that the infinite point of $\mathcal{C}_{f,d}$ goes to the zero of the group law on $J(\mathcal{C}_{f,d})$).
  Earlier the second named author proved that if $d=2$ and $n=2g+1 \ge 5$ then the genus $g$ hyperelliptic curve $\mathcal{C}_{f,2}$ contains no points of orders lying between $3$ and $n-1=2g$.
  In the present paper we generalize this result to the case of arbitrary $d$. Namely, we prove that if $P$ is a point of order $m&gt;1$ on $\mathcal{C}_{f,d}$, then either $m=d$ or $m\geq n$. We also describe all curves $\mathcal{C}_{f,d}$ having a point of order $n$.</description>

      <title>Formal Derived Algebraic Geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13506v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop some foundations for the theory of formal derived algebraic geometry, which parallel the theory of formal spectral algebraic geometry by Jacob Lurie. For this, we establish a close connection between algebro-geometric objects in the derived and spectral settings. We apply this construction to prove a version of the formal GAGA theorem in the derived setting.</description>

      <title>Cyclic products of higher-genus Szeg\"o kernels, modular tensors and polylogarithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05044v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A wealth of information on multiloop string amplitudes is encoded in fermionic two-point functions known as Szeg\"o kernels. In this paper we show that cyclic products of any number of Szeg\"o kernels on a Riemann surface of arbitrary genus may be decomposed into linear combinations of modular tensors on moduli space that carry all the dependence on the spin structure $\delta$. The $\delta$-independent coefficients in these combinations carry all the dependence on the marked points and are composed of the integration kernels of higher-genus polylogarithms. We determine the antiholomorphic moduli derivatives of the $\delta$-dependent modular tensors.</description>

      <title>Geometric realizations of representations for $\text{PSL}(2, \mathbb{F}_p)$ and Galois representations arising from defining ideals of modular curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02589v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a geometric realization of representations for $\text{PSL}(2, \mathbb{F}_p)$ by the defining ideals of rational models $\mathcal{L}(X(p))$ of modular curves $X(p)$ over $\mathbb{Q}$, which gives rise to a Rosetta stone for geometric representations of $\text{PSL}(2, \mathbb{F}_p)$. The defining ideal of a modular curve, i.e., an anabelian counterpart of the Eisenstein ideal, is the anabelianization of the Jacobian of this modular curve and is a reification of the fundamental group $\pi_1$. We show that there exists a correspondence among the defining ideals of modular curves over $\mathbb{Q}$, reducible $\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_p)$-rational representations $\pi_p: \text{PSL}(2, \mathbb{F}_p) \rightarrow \text{Aut}(\mathcal{L}(X(p)))$ of $\text{PSL}(2, \mathbb{F}_p)$, and $\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_p)$-rational Galois representations $\rho_p: \text{Gal}(\overline{\mathbb{Q}}/\mathbb{Q}) \rightarrow \text{Aut}(\mathcal{L}(X(p)))$ as well as their modular and surjective realization. It is an anabelian counterpart of the global Langlands correspondence for $\text{GL}(2, \mathbb{Q})$ by the \'{e}tale cohomology of modular curves as well as an anabelian counterpart of Artin's conjecture, Serre's modularity conjecture and the Fontaine-Mazur conjecture. It is an ideal theoretic (i.e. nonlinear) counterpart of Grothendieck's section conjecture and an ideal theoretic (i.e. nonlinear) reification of ``arithmetic theory of $\pi_1$'' expected by Weil for modular curves. It is also an anabelian counterpart of the theory of Kubert-Lang and Mazur-Wiles on the cuspidal divisor class groups and the Eisenstein ideals of modular curves.</description>

      <title>Hilbert's tenth problem for systems of diagonal quadratic forms, and B\"{u}chi's problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16740v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we complete B\"{u}chi's proof that there is no decision algorithm for the solubility in integers of arbitrary systems of diagonal quadratic form equations, by proving the assertion that whenever $x_1^2, \cdots, x_5^2$ are five squares such that the second differences satisfy
  \[x_{k+2}^2 - 2 x_{k+1}^2 + x_k^2 = 2\]
  for $k = 1,2,3$, then they must be consecutive. This answers a question of J.~Richard~B\"{u}chi.</description>

      <title>The Batyrev-Manin conjecture for DM stacks II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07157v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is a sequel to a paper by the authors. We formulate a prototype of a Batyrev-Manin type conjecture for DM stacks in positive characteristic with emphasis on the wild case. The key to doing so is the notion of sectoroids, which plays a role similar to the role played by sectors in characteristic zero. We also check some compatibilities of the proposed prototype and see how it reduces to special cases. In the course of formulating the prototype, we introduce a new type of height functions, which is more general and flexible than the one we considered in the preceding paper. Examples of this new height function include discriminants of torsors, minimal discriminants and conductors of elliptic curves in characteristic three. In appendices, we generalize construction of a moduli stack by Tonini-Yasuda and construct a morphism between stacks of twisted arcs. These results are closely related to the main text, but also of independent interest.</description>
