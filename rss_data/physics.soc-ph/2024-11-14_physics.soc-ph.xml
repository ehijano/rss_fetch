      <title>Know Their Name: An Anthology of Great Women in the Shadows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There has been a long history of women innovators producing outstanding contributions to society and public benefit yet having their work passed over or sidelined or attributed to male colleagues. This phenomenon has been coined the Matilda Effect. The amendments to the record of human achievements are now taking place, with an increasing pace in recent times due to greater social enlightenment and awareness and the interest in social justice. However, there remains a gap that must be addressed. In this article, we demonstrate the disparity in scientific recognition for a handful of case studies through search data collected via Google Trends and plotted as time-series figures and choropleth maps. Search trends reflect a noticeable divergence between recognition of female and male innovators. However, we note that in more well-known cases of the Matilda Effect, such as the historical account of Rosalind Franklin vs. James Watson and Francis Crick, the differences become less pronounced, emphasizing the importance of publicizing recognition. In response to this revelation, this article presents the stories of several women innovators and their great achievements. We identify the truth behind several discoveries and inventions, while revealing the full nature of this historical problem of social exclusion.</description>

      <title>Mathematical representation of bias and nudges centered on intangible goods using quantum information theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this study is to explore whether the relationship between bias and nudges can be mathematically expressed in terms of quantum information theory, particularly by means of individually customized nudges. Based on the value function of customer satisfaction, which is subject to uncertainty due to the subjectivity of customer evaluations, a model of bias and nudges is proposed that takes into account the environment for intangible goods. Then, by defining an index of nudges from the mathematical properties of the value function obtained from this economic model, a model could be expressed in this study that has a mathematical structure of the same nature as nudges expressed in standard economics, where welfare is impaired by bias from the mathematical structure of the gross social surplus derived as a social welfare function. Moreover, the mathematical structure of the gross social surplus can be made larger than that in standard economics, adding knowledge about the mathematical design of nudges as individually customized customer experiences. This increases the feasibility of the economic model based on quantum information theory and the mathematical design of customized nudges.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2023, 639,300 people died in France, 35,900 fewer than in 2022, a year of high mortality. Over the last twenty years, from 2004 to 2023, January 3rd was the deadliest day, while August 15th was the least deadly one. Elderly people die significantly less often in the summer. Deaths are also less frequent on public holidays and Sundays. Finally, the risk of dying is higher on one's birthday, especially for young people.</description>

      <title>Mobility-based Traffic Forecasting in a Multimodal Transport System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the analysis of all the movements of the population on the basis of their mobility from one node to another, to observe, measure, and predict the impact of traffic according to this mobility. The frequency of congestion on roads directly or indirectly impacts our economic or social welfare. Our work focuses on exploring some machine learning methods to predict (with a certain probability) traffic in a multimodal transportation network from population mobility data. We analyze the observation of the influence of people's movements on the transportation network and make a likely prediction of congestion on the network based on this observation (historical basis).</description>

      <title>Biodynamic Analysis of Alpine Skiing with a Skier-Ski-Snow Interaction Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study establishes a skier-ski-snow interaction (SSSI) model that integrates a 3D full-body musculoskeletal model, a flexible ski model, a ski-snow contact model, and an air resistance model. An experimental method is developed to collect kinematic and kinetic data using IMUs, GPS, and plantar pressure measurement insoles, which are cost-effective and capable of capturing motion in large-scale field conditions. The ski-snow interaction parameters are optimized for dynamic alignment with snow conditions and individual turning techniques. Forward-inverse dynamics simulation is performed using only the skier's posture as model input and leaving the translational degrees of freedom (DOFs) between the pelvis and the ground unconstrained. The effectiveness of our model is further verified by comparing the simulated results with the collected GPS and plantar pressure data. The correlation coefficient between the simulated ski-snow contact force and the measured plantar pressure data is 0.964, and the error between the predicted motion trajectory and GPS data is 0.7%. By extracting kinematic and kinetic parameters from skiers of different skill levels, quantitative performance analysis helps quantify ski training. The SSSI model with the parameter optimization algorithm of the ski-snow interaction allows for the description of skiing characteristics across varied snow conditions and different turning techniques, such as carving and skidding. Our research advances the understanding of alpine skiing dynamics, informing the development of training programs and facility designs to enhance athlete performance and safety.</description>

      <title>The Grass of the Universe: Rethinking Technosphere, Planetary History, and Sustainability with Fermi Paradox</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SETI is not a usual point of departure for environmental humanities. However, this paper argues that theories originating in this field have direct implications for how we think about viable inhabitation of the Earth. To demonstrate SETI's impact on environmental humanities, this paper introduces Fermi paradox as a speculative tool to probe possible trajectories of planetary history, and especially the "Sustainability Solution" proposed by Jacob Haqq-Misra and Seth Baum. This solution suggests that sustainable coupling between extraterrestrial intelligences and their planetary environments is the major factor in the possibility of their successful detection by remote observation. By positing that exponential growth is not a sustainable development pattern, this solution rules out space-faring civilizations colonizing solar systems or galaxies. This paper elaborates on Haqq-Misra's and Baum's arguments, and discusses speculative implications of the Sustainability Solution, thus rethinking three concepts in environmental humanities: technosphere, planetary history, and sustainability. The paper advocates that (1) technosphere is a transitory layer that shall fold back into biosphere; (2) planetary history must be understood in a generic perspective that abstracts from terrestrial particularities; and (3) sustainability is not sufficient vector of viable human inhabitation of the Earth, suggesting instead habitability and genesity as better candidates.</description>

      <title>MatPilot: an LLM-enabled AI Materials Scientist under the Framework of Human-Machine Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence, particularly large language models, presents unprecedented opportunities for materials science research. We proposed and developed an AI materials scientist named MatPilot, which has shown encouraging abilities in the discovery of new materials. The core strength of MatPilot is its natural language interactive human-machine collaboration, which augments the research capabilities of human scientist teams through a multi-agent system. MatPilot integrates unique cognitive abilities, extensive accumulated experience, and ongoing curiosity of human-beings with the AI agents' capabilities of advanced abstraction, complex knowledge storage and high-dimensional information processing. It could generate scientific hypotheses and experimental schemes, and employ predictive models and optimization algorithms to drive an automated experimental platform for experiments. It turns out that our system demonstrates capabilities for efficient validation, continuous learning, and iterative optimization.</description>

      <title>q Index Degree Distribution in Random Networks via Superstatistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we employ a superstatistical approach to construct q exponential and q Maxwell Boltzmann complex networks, generalizing the concept of scale free networks. By adjusting the crossover parameter {\lambda}, we control the degree of the q exponential plateau at low node degrees, allowing a smooth transition to pure power law degree distributions. Similarly, the parameter b modulates the q Maxwell Boltzmann curvature, facilitating a shift toward pure power law networks. This framework introduces a novel perspective for constructing and analyzing scale free networks. Our results show that these additional degrees of freedom significantly enhance the flexibility of both network types in terms of topological and transport properties, including clustering coefficients, small world characteristics, and resilience to attacks. Future research will focus on exploring the dynamic properties of these networks, offering promising directions for further investigation.</description>

      <title>The role of spatial structures and social values in shaping local productive systems -New lessons from the wood-furniture cluster of Jepara, Indonesia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper revisits the well-known wood-furniture cluster of Jepara (Central Java, Indonesia) with new parameters inspired by the theories of industrial districts and clusters. So far, literature on this production centre, mostly focused on value chain analysis, has failed to explain how it could survive external shocks and rising pressure of global competition, without upgrading. Based on a qualitative analysis encompassing the spatial organization and social structures supporting the productive system, this contribution of geography, sociology, and anthropology to development economics unveils a singular combination of ultraliberal business practices together with conservative social values, expressed in a unique arbourlike morphology. These qualitative results tend to show that, beyond the concept of flexible specialization identified by literature as the core driving force of the cluster, Jepara may be considered as a new avatar of Marshallian district in a context of subaltern globalization. Such findings question the opportunities offered to subaltern towns in emerging economies enrolled in globalization to capitalize their own local social and environmental assets to develop labour-intensive activities capable of adapting an ever-changing deal imposed by external price-driven competition.</description>

      <title>Impact of Covid-19 on Taxi Industry and Travel Behavior: A Case Study on Chicago, IL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the debate over the future of transportation continues in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic as a deepening global crisis, taxi industry seems to be not spared by the quick and disrupting changes that may arise from the pandemic. The impact is relatively higher in major cities because of the high-density population and transportation congestion. In this study, we used spatial analysis and visualization to investigate the impact of the pandemic on the economics of the taxi industry and travel behavior using trip-by-trip data from the year of 2014 to 2020 in Chicago, IL. Results show that there is a drastic decline in the trips in the central city and airport areas. During the pandemic, people tended to travel longer distances, but travel times were considerably less because of the significant reduction in traffic volumes. Results also showed that the top twenty most popular pick-up and drop-off locations only included Chicago Downtown and OHare International Airport before the pandemic. However, during the pandemic, the top twenty most popular pick-up and drop-off locations is distributed between the Airport, the Downtown, as well as many other areas along Chicago Eastside.</description>

      <title>Steady-State and Dynamical Behavior of a PDE Model of Multilevel Selection with Pairwise Group-Level Competition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evolutionary competition often occurs simultaneously at multiple levels of organization, in which traits or behaviors that are costly for an individual can provide collective benefits to groups to which the individual belongs. Building off of recent work that has used ideas from game theory to study evolutionary competition within and among groups, we study a PDE model for multilevel selection that considers group-level evolutionary dynamics through a pairwise conflict depending on the strategic composition of the competing groups. This model allows for incorporation of group-level frequency dependence, facilitating the exploration for how the form of probabilities for victory in a group-level conflict can impact the long-time support for cooperation via multilevel selection. We characterize well-posedness properties for measure-valued solutions of our PDE model and apply these properties to show that the population will converge to a delta-function at the all-defector equilibrium when between-group selection is sufficiently weak. We further provide necessary conditions for the existence of bounded steady state densities for the multilevel dynamics of Prisoners' Dilemma and Hawk-Dove scenarios, using a mix of analytical and numerical techniques to characterize the relative strength of between-group selection required to ensure the long-time survival of cooperation via multilevel selection. We also see that the average payoff at steady state appears to be limited by the average payoff of the all-cooperator group, even for games in which groups achieve maximal average payoff at intermediate levels of cooperation, generalizing behavior that has previously been observed in PDE models of multilevel selection with frequency-indepdent group-level competition.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate searching efficiency of different kinds of random walk on complex networks which rely on local information and one-step memory. For the studied navigation strategies we obtained theoretical and numerical values for the graph mean first passage times as an indicator for the searching efficiency. The experiments with generated and real networks show that biasing based on inverse degree, persistence and local two-hop paths can lead to smaller searching times. Moreover, these biasing approaches can be combined to achieve a more robust random search strategy. Our findings can be applied in the modeling and solution of various real-world problems.</description>

      <title>The impact of social noise on the majority rule model across various network topologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01731v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the impact of social noise, characterized by nonconformist behavior, on the phase transition within the framework of the majority rule model. The order-disorder transition can reflect the consensus-polarization state in a social context. This study covers various network topologies, including complete graphs, two-dimensional (2-D) square lattices, three-dimensional (3-D) square lattices, and heterogeneous or complex networks such as Watts-Strogatz (W-S), Barab\'asi-Albert (B-A), and Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi (E-R) networks, as well as their combinations (multilayer network). Social behavior is represented by the parameter \( p \), which indicates the probability of agents exhibiting nonconformist behavior. Our results show that the model exhibits a continuous phase transition across all networks. Through finite-size scaling analysis and evaluation of critical exponents, our results suggest that the model falls into the same universality class as the Ising model.</description>

Abstract: Every sport needs rules. Tournament design refers to the rules that determine how a tournament, a series of games between a number of competitors, is organized. This study aims to provide an overview of the tournament design literature from the perspective of operational research. Three important design criteria are discussed: efficacy, fairness, and attractiveness. Our survey classifies the papers discussing these properties according to the main components of tournament design: format, seeding, draw, scheduling, and ranking. We also outline several open questions and promising directions for future research.</description>

      <title>Misaligned incentives in the post-2024 UEFA Champions League: A managerial failure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12636v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: UEFA declares that it is fully committed to respecting the fundamental values of sport. However, the qualification for the post-2024 UEFA Champions League is not always based on sporting merit as we show: a match with misaligned incentives has barely been avoided in the 2023/24 German Bundesliga. Two straightforward solutions are recommended to safeguard the integrity of the competition. Fairness can be easily guaranteed by reversing the order of two articles in the Champions League regulation. UEFA repeatedly commits the same mistake in allocating vacant slots, which seems to indicate a clear managerial failure, especially because the solution is widely known. Thus, governing bodies in sports are called to work more closely together with the scientific community.</description>

      <title>Comparison of gap-based and flow-based control strategies using a new controlled stochastic cellular automaton model for traffic flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.14291v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomous vehicles are essential to future transportation systems, potentially reducing traffic congestion. This study examines the impact of different vehicle control strategies on traffic flow through simulations. We propose a novel stochastic cellular automaton model, the controlled stochastic optimal velocity (CSOV) model, which incorporates vehicle control effects. Within the CSOV model, two control strategies are implemented: gap-based control (GC), which adjusts vehicle velocity to balance the gaps between adjacent vehicles, and flow-based control (FC), which aims to maintain a consistent local flow between the front and rear vehicles. Results show that both control strategies improve traffic flow. However, under weaker control, the GC sometimes resulted in lower flow compared to no control. In contrast, the FC consistently enhanced flow across control strengths, yielding more robust outcomes. Furthermore, when both strategies achieved comparable flow rates, the FC provided a more stable velocity distribution under varying traffic densities than the GC.</description>
