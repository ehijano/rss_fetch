      <title>Reflections of Sadi Carnot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Carnot theory is unique among the theories of heat developed before the emergence of thermodynamics because it considers the relationship between heat and work. The theory is contained in Carnot's book published in 1824, which includes the basic ideas on how thermal machines work, including the need for a temperature difference. The fundamental principle of the theory is stated with the help of a cyclic process invented by Carnot, involving two isotherms and two adiabatics. The ratio between the mechanical work produced during the cycle and the heat involved depends only on the temperatures. We make a critical analysis of Carnot theory and show how the fundamental principle was used by Clausius to define entropy in terms of which he enunciated the second law of thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>A Revision for the Draconic Gearing of the Antikythera Mechanism, the eclipse events of Saros spiral and their classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07023v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our research is focused on the missing, but important and necessary Draconic gearing of the Antikythera Mechanism. The three Lunar cycles Sidereal, Synodic and Anomalistic are represented on the Mechanism by correlating the Fragments A and C (part of the Front plate), whereas the fourth Lunar cycle Draconic results after correlating the unplaced Fragment D with Fragment A. Considering the deformation of the Mechanism s parts during 2000 years underwater and their shrinkage after their retraction from the sea bottom, we present a revised gearing scheme of the Draconic scale. The existence of the Draconic gearing is crucial, because both the preserved and the missing eclipse events can be precalculated by the phase correlation of three pointers: of the Lunar Disc, of the Golden sphere/Sun-ray and the Draconic. This means that the eclipse events are calculated by pure mechanical processing and that they are not documented observed events. The phase coordination of the three lunar cycles can be used as a quality criterion for a functional model of the Mechanism. Eudoxus papyrus was the key for the lost words completion of the Back Plate inscriptions eclipse events classification of the Antikythera Mechanism.</description>
