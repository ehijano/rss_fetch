      <title>Vertical NAND in a Ferroelectric-driven Paradigm Shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past decades, the relentless scaling and mass production of flash memory have underpinned the data-centric era. Yet charge-trap-based 3D NAND flash is now constrained by intrinsic physical and architectural limits, including reliability degradation at the device level, high operating power at the array level, and vertical scaling saturation at the system level. These bottlenecks hinder further advances in storage density and energy efficiency required by memory-centric computing. This Perspective outlines how coupling ferroelectric polarization with charge trapping can reconfigure the foundations of flash memory. In these hybrid architectures, polarization offers an energy-efficient pathway for charge modulation through enhanced Fowler-Nordheim tunneling, while trapped charges reinforce polarization-driven states to ensure stability. Such synergistic dynamics enable low-voltage operation and integration beyond one thousand layers without compromising process compatibility. We discuss the material, device, and architectural transitions required to realize this hybrid technology and chart future research directions to overcome the remaining scaling bottlenecks. Hybrid ferroelectric NAND extends conventional flash toward a scalable and energy-efficient platform, marking a paradigm shift for next-generation non-volatile memory.</description>

      <title>Hypervelocity Impact Debris Cloud Trajectory-Planning based on Additive Manufactured Lattice Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Space debris and micrometeoroid (MMOD) impacts pose a serious threat to the safe operation of spacecraft. However, traditional protective structures typically suffer from limitations such as excessive thickness and inadequate load-bearing capacity. Guided by the design concepts of debris-cloud deflection and hierarchical energy dissipation, this study proposes a trajectory-planning lattice protective structure. First, the lattice parameters and geometry were designed according to the functional relationship between the incident angle and the transmitted/ricochet trajectory angles. Subsequently, multi-angle hypervelocity impact experiments were carried out to evaluate the proposed lattice protection structure. In combination with post-impact CT three-dimensional reconstruction and smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) numerical simulations, the protective mechanisms of the lattice structure were systematically characterized and clarified. The results demonstrate that, for three oblique incidence conditions, the lattice structure remained intact and significantly deflected the debris-cloud momentum direction while effectively dissipating its kinetic energy. The angled plates with gradient designs enabled continuous changes in the momentum direction and stepwise kinetic energy dissipation through multiple cycles of debrisation, dispersion, and trajectory deflection. This research presents a novel, engineering-ready approach for spacecraft MMOD protection and validates the potential of trajectory-planning lattice structures for hypervelocity impact defense.</description>

      <title>Acoustic scattering singularities via quasi-Bound states in the continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems enable advanced control of wave propagation by exploiting engineered losses. This introduces an additional degree of freedom that permits the emergence of exceptional points (EPs). In this letter, we theoretically and experimentally demonstrate the control of scattering singularities in a non-Hermitian acoustic system using quasibound states in the continuum (qBICs). Through Friedrich Wintgen interference, the losses of a two port cavity are tuned until achieving critical coupling, yielding narrowband coherent perfect absorption (CPA) with a quality factor of 140. Additionally, by coupling two distinct resonators, we observe the emergence of an EP, where both eigenvalues simultaneously coalesce and vanish, resulting in narrowband unidirectional absorption. Our results establish a connection between qBICs and scattering singularities, and offer a route toward acoustic devices featuring narrowband resonances and tunable radiative losses.</description>

      <title>Fabrication Optimization of Suspended Stencil Mask Lithography for Multi-Terminal Josephson Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stencil mask lithography is an advanced technique for fully in-situ fabricating Josephson junctions, which is increasingly being used for multi-terminal Josephson junctions. This study provides information on the optimal mask design and mask reliability. For this, 270 mask designs were systematically fabricated and investigated under scanning electron microscope. Reliable statements are made about mask yield, minimal dimensions, and systematic dependencies on the number of superconducting terminals. We find that stencil mask lithography can be used reliably for fabricating multi-terminal Josephson junctions, enabling lateral mask dimensions down to 40$\,$nm on average.</description>

      <title>Polymer-inspired mechanical metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metamaterials benefit from unique architected patterns to achieve lightweight with exceptional mechanical properties inaccessible to conventional materials. Typical mechanical metamaterials mimic crystal structures with close-packed lattices, exhibit high structural stiffness but suffer from reduced flexibility and abrupt fracture similar to atomic debonding. Here, we demonstrate a new class of polymer-inspired metamaterials by translating, understanding, and programming the deformation and strengthening mechanics of polymers. By combining the metamaterial programmability with polymer-like mechanics, we also program crosslinking, proto-crystalline order, and entanglements of free chains to enable polymeric functional programmability of the metamaterials on the macroscale. This macroscale polymeric programmability not only allows synthetic, nature-inspired strengthening combinations that are unattainable in microscale polymer networks, but also turns polymer-inspired metamaterials into a programmable experimental platform for exploring new deformation strengthening strategies, opening pathways to functional applications such as soft, humanoid-like tissues for robotic joints and compliant connectors.</description>

      <title>KAN-Matrix: Visualizing Nonlinear Pairwise and Multivariate Contributions for Physical Insight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interpreting complex datasets remains a major challenge for scientists, particularly due to high dimensionality and collinearity among variables. We introduce a novel application of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) to enhance interpretability and parsimony beyond what traditional correlation analyses offer. We present two interpretable, color-coded visualization tools: the Pairwise KAN Matrix (PKAN) and the Multivariate KAN Contribution Matrix (MKAN). PKAN characterizes nonlinear associations between pairs of variables, while MKAN serves as a nonlinear feature-ranking tool that quantifies the relative contributions of inputs in predicting a target variable. These tools support pre-processing (e.g., feature selection, redundancy analysis) and post-processing (e.g., model explanation, physical insights) in model development workflows. Through experimental comparisons, we demonstrate that PKAN and MKAN yield more robust and informative results than Pearson Correlation and Mutual Information. By capturing the strength and functional forms of relationships, these matrices facilitate the discovery of hidden physical patterns and promote domain-informed model development.</description>

      <title>Pulse-Mode Operation and Reliability of BEOL-Compatible Ferroelectric Non-Volatile Capacitive Memories with Amorphous Oxide Semiconductor Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-volatile capacitive memories (nvCAPs) exhibiting AC small-signal capacitance on/off ratio (Con/Coff) with non-destructive read have emerged as a promising device for next-generation memory paradigms. Recently, BEOL-compatible ferroelectric nvCAPs with an amorphous oxide semiconductor channel have been reported, suggesting the possibility of monolithic 3D integration of nvCAPs on top of CMOS. So far, the characterization studies on oxide-channel ferroelectric nvCAPs have been done using dual DC sweep C-V measurements which are typically performed over a time scale of a few seconds. However, non-volatile memory arrays typically require nvCAPs to operate under pulse-mode. It is thus crucial to advance understanding of the behavior of oxide-channel ferroelectric nvCAPs under pulse-mode operation, governed by the unique interplay between ferroelectric layer and oxide channel physics. In this study, we provide a systematic study of the pulse-mode operation of ferroelectric nvCAPs with an amorphous oxide semiconductor channel, including its pulse-based write characteristics and reliability characteristics. We examine overlap area, wake-up and pulse-width dependent Con and Coff writing characteristics under pulse-mode. Further, we suggest the importance of optimizing ferroelectric depolarization for Con retention, while reducing read-after-delay for Coff retention under pulse-mode. Lastly, non-destructive read operation for &gt;10^9 read stress cycles at |Vread|=1V is demonstrated.</description>

      <title>A Novel Proposal in Wind Turbine Blade Failure Detection: An Integrated Approach to Energy Efficiency and Sustainability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel methodology for detecting faults in wind turbine blades using com-putational learning techniques. The study evaluates two models: the first employs logistic regression, which outperformed neural networks, decision trees, and the naive Bayes method, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying fault-related patterns. The second model leverages clustering and achieves superior performance in terms of precision and data segmentation. The results indicate that clustering may better capture the underlying data characteristics compared to supervised methods. The proposed methodology offers a new approach to early fault detection in wind turbine blades, highlighting the potential of integrating different computational learning techniques to enhance system reliability. The use of accessible tools like Orange Data Mining underscores the practical application of these advanced solutions within the wind energy sector. Future work will focus on combining these methods to improve detection accuracy further and extend the application of these techniques to other critical components in energy infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Current-Induced Modulation of Spin-Wave Propagation in a Y-Junction via Transverse Spin-Transfer Torque</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the transverse control of spin-wave propagation in the configuration where the spin-wave wavevector k is perpendicular to the charge-current density J. Building on theoretical predictions of spin-wave refraction by nonuniform spin-polarized currents, and guided by micromagnetic simulations used to optimize the device geometry and current distribution, we experimentally explore a Y-shaped Permalloy structure in which a locally injected current perturbs the spin-wave dispersion. Measurements reveal current-dependent amplitude differences between the two output branches, providing initial experimental indications consistent with transverse, spin-transfer-torque-driven deflection. Although the magnitude of the effect is modest and accompanied by significant uncertainties, the observed trends qualitatively follow expectations from the simulations. These results demonstrate the feasibility of influencing spin-wave routing through local current injection and establish a proof-of-concept basis for current-controlled manipulation of spin-wave propagation in reconfigurable magnonic circuits.</description>

      <title>Controlling Spin-Waves by Inhomogeneous Spin-Transfer Torques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the interplay between spin currents and spin waves in nanofabricated Permalloy waveguides with geometrical constrictions. Using propagating spin-wave spectroscopy, micromagnetic simulations, and analytical modeling, we provide experimental evidence that spin-wave phase can be modulated by inhomogeneous spin-transfer torques generated by current-density gradients shaped by the constriction geometry. Narrower constrictions enhance these gradients and modify the internal field for Damon-Eshbach spin waves, resulting in pronounced changes in spin-wave group velocity and phase. To our knowledge, this constitutes the first demonstration of deterministic phase modulation via engineered nonuniform spin-transfer torques. Beyond enabling a scalable route to magnonic interferometry - a building block for spin-wave-based computing - our findings establish a platform to control spin-wave dynamics in spatially varying current landscapes, relevant for analogue-gravity experiments in condensed matter systems.</description>

      <title>Photonics of topological magnetic textures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological textures in magnetically ordered materials are important case studies for fundamental research with promising applications in data science. They can also serve as photonic elements to mold electromagnetic fields endowing them with features inherent to the spin order, as demonstrated analytically and numerically in this work. A self-consistent theory is developed for the interaction of spatially structured electromagnetic fields with non-collinear, topologically non-trivial spin textures. A tractable numerical method is designed and implemented for the calculation of the formed magnetic/photonic textures in the entire simulation space. Numerical illustrations are presented for scattering from point-like singularities, i.e. Bloch points, in the magnetization vector fields, evidencing that the geometry and topology of the magnetic order results in photonic fields that embody orbital angular momentum, chirality as well as magnetoelectric densities. Features of the scattered fields can serve as a fingerprint for the underlying magnetic texture and its dynamics. The findings point to the potential of topological magnetic textures as a route to molding photonic fields.</description>

Abstract: Dark current in silicon-based blocked impurity band (BIB) infrared detectors has long been a critical limitation on device performance. This work proposes a chiral-phonon-assisted spin current model at interfaces to explain the parabolic-like dark current behavior observed at low bias voltages. Concurrently, the spatially-confined charge transport theory is employed to elucidate the dark current generation mechanism across the entire operational voltage range.</description>

      <title>Lagrangian Heterogeneous Multiscale Method (LHMM) for Simulating Polymer Solutions/Melts Behavior under Complex Flows using DPD-SPH</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13267v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a Lagrangian Heterogeneous Multiscale Method (LHMM) for simulating the non-Newtonian rheology of polymer melts in complex two-dimensional flows. The method couples Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD) at the microscale with a GENERIC-compliant Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) at the macroscale, in a concurrent framework, overcoming the limitations of traditional Eulerian-based methods in capturing long-memory and history-dependent effects. At the microscale, DPD serves as a virtual rheometer, employing FENE (Finitely Extensible Nonlinear Elastic) bead-spring polymer chains. This approach provides key rheological properties, including shear-thinning and zero-shear-rate viscosities, relaxation times, and viscoelastic dynamics, which are quantified via Carreau-Yasuda fitting and spectral analysis. The LHMM couples SPH-derived strain rates with microscopic stress responses using the Irving-Kirkwood formalism. This approach enables a concurrent interaction between macroscopic strain rates and microscopic stress tensors, ensuring a consistent viscoelastic response across scales. The method is validated against benchmark flows, including Reverse Poiseuille Flow and flow through a Periodic Array of Cylinders, across Weissenberg numbers $0.5 &lt; \text{Wi} &lt; 30$ and low Reynolds numbers ($\text{Re} &lt; 1$). A final demonstration of flow in a 2D porous medium highlights LHMM's capability to handle highly heterogeneous geometries. The LHMM is implemented in LAMMPS, making it suitable for integrating multiple models to describe microscales. In contrast, large-scale simulations efficiently utilize GPU and CPU resources, managing multiple coupling and time-scaling levels to maintain numerical stability and accuracy. The framework offers a predictive, constitutive-free tool that links microscopic polymer dynamics to macroscopic flow behavior, making it suitable for multiscale applications.</description>
