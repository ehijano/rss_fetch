      <title>Configurations in the Euclidean plane associated to a system of equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the Euclidean plane ${\bf{E}}^2$, fix four pairwise distinct points \begin{equation*} %\label{eqA} \begin{array}{ccc} A=(a_1,a_2),\ B=(b_1,b_2),\ C=(c_1,c_2),\ D=(d_1,d_2), \end{array} \end{equation*} together with four non-zero real numbers $k_A,k_B,k_C,k_D$. We show that System (*) consisting of the following four equations in the unknowns $X=(x_1,x_2)$ and $Y=(y_1,y_2)$ \begin{equation*} %\label{egy} \frac{1}{\|X-T\|^2} +\frac{1}{\|Y-T\|^2}=k_T, \quad T\in\{A,B,C,D\} \end{equation*} has finitely many solutions $(X,Y)$ (counting also those with complex coordinates) provided that both of the following two conditions are satisfied: \begin{itemize} \item[($i$)] no three of the fixed points $A,B,C,D$ are coplanar; \item[($ii$)] no three of the four circles of center $T$ and radius $1/\sqrt{k_T}$ with share a common point in ${\bf{E}}^2$. \end{itemize} Furthermore, we exhibit a configuration $ABCD$ showing that System (*) satisfying $(i)$ and $(ii)$ may have many real solutions $(X,Y)$. This result is the planar version of an analog problem in the Euclidean space arising from applications to genetics, investigated in the recent papers \cite{cif} and \cite{ak2024}.</description>

      <title>Resolution of Indeterminacy of Rational Maps to Proper Tame Stacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show the resolution of indeterminacy of rational maps from a regular surface to a tame stack locally of finite type over an excellent scheme. The proof uses the valuative criterion for proper tame morphisms, which was proved by Bresciani and Vistoli, together with the resolution of singularities for excellent surfaces and the root stack construction. Using Hironaka's results on the resolution of singularities over fields of characteristic zero, we extend the result to rational maps from a regular scheme of arbitrary dimension to a tame stack locally of finite type over a field of characteristic zero. We also provide a Purity Lemma for higher dimensional tame stacks, generalizing results of Abramovich, Olsson, and Vistoli, which also plays an essential role in the proof.</description>

      <title>Automorphism groups and linearizability of rational Fano conic bundle threefolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize the equivariant intermediate Jacobian torsor obstruction over $\mathbb{C}$ to algebraically closed fields of characteristic zero. It is an obstruction to the (projective) linearizability problem of finite group actions on threefolds. In addition, we calculate automorphism groups of general smooth Fano threefolds of No. 2.18. As an application, we prove that a general smooth Fano threefold X of No. 2.18 is linearizable for its automorphism group.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that, over arbitrary base schemes, quintic del Pezzo threefolds are classified by non-degenerate ternary symmetric bilinear forms. As applications, we describe the automorphism groups, the Hilbert schemes of lines, the orbit decompositions, and the normalizations of the orbit closures of quintic del Pezzo threefolds, by placing special emphasis on the case of characteristic two, where symmetric bilinear forms behave differently. Furthermore, we refine a known result on arithmetic finiteness of quintic del Pezzo threefolds.</description>

      <title>Pencils of projective hypersurfaces, Griffiths heights and geometric invariant theory. I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Griffiths heights associated to the middle-dimensional cohomology of pencils of projective hypersurfaces, by comparing them to heights defined by means of geometric invariant theory (GIT). Kato and Koshikawa have conjectured a Northcott property for the Kato heights attached to motives over number fields, and investigated its consequences. Bounding these Griffiths heights in terms of the GIT heights would constitute a geometric counterpart, valid over function fields of characteristic zero, of Kato and Koshikawa's conjecture.
  Part of our results follows from our earlier works on the computation of these Griffiths heights in the case of pencils with generic singularities, and on semistability criteria for singular projective hypersurfaces, combined with a general formalism of GIT heights over function fields.
  We also establish estimates between the Griffiths and GIT heights associated to pencils of projective hypersurfaces, which are valid beyond the case of generic singularities. To achieve this, we establish diverse results of independent interest. Notably we extend our previous computations of Griffiths heights to pencils of projective hypersurfaces with semihomogeneous singularities, and we show the lower semicontinuity of the stable Griffiths height attached to polarized variations of Hodge structures over complex algebraic curves.</description>

      <title>Geography of Landau-Ginzburg models and threefold syzygies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the behavior of toric Landau-Ginzburg models under extremal contraction and minimal model program. We also establish a relation between the moduli space of toric Landau-Ginzburg models and the geography of central models. We conjecture that there is a correspondence between extremal contractions and minimal model program on Fano varieties, and degenerations of their associated toric Landau-Ginzburg models written explicitly. We prove the conjectures for smooth toric varieties, as well as general smooth Fano varieties in dimensions 2 and 3. As an application, we compute the elementary syzygies for smooth Fano threefolds.</description>

      <title>On Gorenstein $\mathbb{Q}_p$-rational threefolds and fourfolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that for $n \leq 4$ and $p &gt; 5$, quasi--Gorenstein $F$--pure and $\mathbb{Q}_p$--rational $n$--fold singularities are canonical. This is analogous to the usual fact that rational Gorenstein singularities are canonical. The proof is based on a careful analysis of the dual complex of a dlt modification of a log canonical singularity. The result for $n = 4$ is contingent upon the existence of log resolutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Specht ideals are symmetric ideals in the polynomial ring generated by Specht polynomials associated with group representations. These ideals were previously studied for reflection groups of types $A$ and $B$, where their inclusion relations and their varieties reflect rich combinatorial structures. In this paper, we extend this theory to type $D$ and the dihedral groups. Our results complete the combinatorial study of Specht ideals across all infinite families of essential real reflection groups.</description>

      <title>Singular intersections on families of abelian varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $S$ be a smooth irreducible curve defined over $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$, let $\mathcal{A}$ be an abelian scheme over $S$ and $\mathcal{C}$ a curve inside $\mathcal{A}$, both defined over $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$. In this paper we prove that the set of points in which $\mathcal{C}$ intersects proper flat subgroup schemes of $\mathcal{A}$ tangentially is finite. This fits in the framework of the so-called problems of unlikely intersections, and can be seen as a variation of the relative Pink conjecture for abelian varieties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06784v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a finiteness result for pointed maps to the base space $U$ of a smooth projective family of varieties with maximal variation in moduli. For its proof, we establish the rigidity of pointed maps to a (not necessarily compact) variety which is hyperbolic modulo a proper closed subset. Together with Viehweg's hyperbolicity conjecture on the bigness of log-canonical bundles of moduli spaces, resolved by Campana-Paun, we derive an optimal dimension bound on the Hom scheme from a curve to $U$ among other applications.</description>

Abstract: We prove that the complement to the caustic of a stable Lagrangian map germ of type $E_6^\pm$ has seven connected components, six of which are contractible and one is homotopy equivalent to a circle. The inverse image of the noncontractible component under this map has three connected components. The restriction of the map to one of them is a two-sheeted covering; the restriction to each of the other two is a diffeomorphism.</description>

      <title>Local motivic invariants of rational functions in two variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10210v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $P$ and $Q$ be two polynomials in two variables with coefficients in an algebraic closed field of characteristic zero. We consider the rational function $f=P/Q$. For an indeterminacy point $\text{x}$ of $f$ and a value $c$, we compute the motivic Milnor fiber $S_{f,\text{x}, c}$ in terms of some motives associated to the faces of the Newton polygons appearing in the Newton algorithms of $P-cQ$ and $Q$ at $\text{x}$, without any condition of non-degeneracy or convenience. In the complex setting, assuming for any $(a,b)\in \mathbb{C}^2$ that $\text{x}$ is a smooth or an isolated critical point of $aP+bQ$, and the curves $P=0$ and $Q=0$ do not have common irreducible component, we prove that the topological bifurcation set $\mathscr{B}_{f,\text{x}}^{\text{top}}$ is equal to the motivic bifurcation set $\mathscr{B}_{f,\text{x}}^{\text{mot}}$ and they are computed from the Newton algorithm.</description>

      <title>Non-vanishing of Ceresa and Gross--Kudla--Schoen cycles associated to modular curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20998v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Associated to an algebraic curve $X$, there are two canonically constructed homologically trivial algebraic $1$-cycles, the Ceresa cycle in the Jacobian of $X$, and the Gross-Kudla-Schoen modified diagonal cycle in the triple product $X \times X \times X$. By a result of Shou-Wu Zhang, one is torsion if and only if the other is. In this paper, we prove that these two cycles associated to a large family of modular curves are non-torsion in the corresponding Chow groups. We obtain the result by relating this problem to the study of special cycles on orthogonal Shimura varieties. As the main ingredient and a result of independent interest, we develop a pullback formula for special divisors on modular curves embedded in their products via the diagonal map.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09472v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a geometric refinement of Gromov-Witten invariants for $\mathbb P^1$-bundles relative to the natural fiberwise boundary structure. We call these refined invariant correlated Gromov-Witten invariants. Furthermore, we prove a refinement of the degeneration formula keeping track of the correlation. Finally, combining certain invariance properties of the correlated invariant, a local computation and the refined degeneration formula we follow floor diagram techniques to prove regularity results for the generating series of the invariants in the case of $\mathbb P^1$-bundles over elliptic curves. Such invariants are expected to play a role in the degeneration formula for reduced Gromov-Witten invariants for abelian and K3 surfaces.</description>

      <title>Equivariant aspects of de-completing cyclic homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05994v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Derived de Rham cohomology turns out to be important in p-adic geometry, following Bhatt's discovery [Bha12] of conjugate filtration in char p, de-Hodge-completing results in [Bei12]. In [Kal18], Kaledin introduced an analogous de-completion of the periodic cyclic homology, called the polynomial periodic cyclic homology, equipped with a conjugate filtration in char p, and expected to be related to derived de Rham cohomology. In this article, using genuine equivariant homotopy structure on Hochschild homology as in [ABG+18, BHM22], we give an equivariant description of Kaledin's polynomial periodic cyclic homology. This leads to Morita invariance without any Noetherianness assumption as in [Kal18], and the comparison to derived de Rham cohomology becomes transparent. Moreover, this description adapts directly to "topological" analogues, which gives rise to a de-Nygaard-completion of the topological periodic cyclic homology. We compare it to topological Hochschild homology over $\mathbb F_p$, and produce a conjugate filtration in char p from our description.</description>

      <title>The Picard group of the Baily--Borel compactification of the moduli space of quasi-polarized K3 surfaces and generalizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12931v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the Picard group of the Baily--Borel compactification of orthogonal Shimura varieties. As a key result, we determine the Picard group of the Baily--Borel compactification of the moduli space of quasi-polarized K3 surfaces, proving that it is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}$. Notably, this contrasts with the moduli space of smooth curves, where the Picard group exhibits a more complex structure after natural compactification.
  Our result follows from a general theorem for orthogonal Shimura varieties: for even lattices $M$ of signature $(2,n)$ with $n &gt; 8$ satisfying specific arithmetic conditions (e.g. K3 type or $p$-elementary), the rational Picard group of $\overline{\operatorname{Sh}}_\Gamma(M)$ with $\Gamma$ containing the stable orthogonal group is $1$-dimensional. The core of our proof lies in constructing an arithmetic obstruction space that governs the extension of Heegner divisors to the generic points of the boundary in orthogonal Shimura varieties. We further establish a connection between this obstruction space and the space of theta series, demonstrating that the obstruction space is maximal under our conditions.</description>

      <title>Witt Group of Nondyadic Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16041v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Witt group of real algebraic curves has been studied since Knebusch in 1970s. But few results are known if the base field is non-Archimedean except the hyperelliptic case. In this paper, we compute the Witt group of smooth proper curves over nondyadic local fields with $char\neq2$ by reduction, with a general study of the existence of Theta characteristics.</description>

      <title>On Picard Number and Dimension of Algebraic Homogeneous Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07044v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An algebraic variety $X$ is called a homogeneous space if there exists a transitive regular action of an algebraic group on $X$. In the case when $X$ is an affine or projective homogeneous space for a simple or, more generally, semisimple group, we prove inequalities between the dimension of $X$ and its Picard number.</description>

      <title>Wonderful embedding for group schemes in the Bruhat--Tits theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12777v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a reductive group $G$ over a discretely valued Henselian field $k$, using valuations of root datum and concave functions, the Bruhat--Tits theory defines an important class of open bounded subgroups of $G(k)$ which are essential objects in representation theory and arithmetic geometry. Moreover, these subgroups are uniquely determined by smooth affine group schemes whose generic fibers are $G$ over the ring of integers of $k$. To study these group schemes, when $G$ is adjoint and quasi-split, we systematically construct wonderful embedding for these group schemes which are uniquely determined by a big cell structure. The way that we construct our wonderful embedding is different from classical methods in the sense that we avoid embedding a group scheme into an ambient space and taking closure. We use an intrinsic and functorial method which is a variant of Artin--Weil method of birational group laws. Beyond the quasi-split case, our wonderful embedding is constructed by \'etale descent. Moreover our wonderful embedding behaves in a similar way to the classical wonderful compactification of $G$. Our results can serve as a bridge between the theory of wonderful compactifications and the Bruhat--Tits theory.</description>

      <title>Singular cscK metrics on smoothable varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13653v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the lower semi-continuity of the coercivity threshold of Mabuchi functional along a degenerate family of normal compact K\"ahler varieties with klt singularities. Moreover, we establish the existence of singular cscK metrics on $\mathbb{Q}$-Gorenstein smoothable klt varieties when the Mabuchi functional is coercive, these arise as a limit of cscK metrics on close-by fibres. The proof relies on developing a novel strong topology of pluripotential theory in families and establishing uniform estimates for cscK metrics.</description>

      <title>Thick subcategories on weighted projective curves and nilpotent representations of quivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01207v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We continue the study of thick triangulated subcategories, started by Valery Lunts and the author in arXiv:2007.02134, and consider thick subcategories in the derived category of coherent sheaves on a weighted projective curve and the corresponding abelian thick subcategories. Our main result is that any thick subcategory on a weighted projective curve either is equivalent to the derived category of nilpotent representations of some quiver (we call such categories quiver-like) or is the orthogonal to an exceptional collection of torsion sheaves (we call such subcategories big). We examine the structure of thick subcategories: in particular, for weighted projective lines we prove that any admissible subcategory is generated by an exceptional collection and any exceptional collection is a part of a full one. We show that the derived categories of weighted projective curves satisfy Jordan-Holder property and do not contain phantoms. Finally, we extend and simplify results from arXiv:2007.02134, providing sufficient criteria for a triangulated or abelian category to be quiver-like.</description>

      <title>On the Kummer pro-\'etale cohomology of $\mathbb B_{\operatorname{dR}}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16916v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate $p$-adic cohomologies of log rigid analytic varieties over a $p$-adic field. For a log rigid analytic variety $X$ defined over a discretely valued field, we compute the Kummer pro-\'etale cohomology of $\mathbb{B}_{\mathrm{dR}}^+$ and $\mathbb{B}_{\mathrm{dR}}$. When $X$ is defined over $\mathbb{C}_p$, we introduce a logarithmic ${B}_{\mathrm{dR}}^+$-cohomology theory, serving as a deformation of log de Rham cohomology. Additionally, we establish the log de Rham-\'etale comparison in this setting and prove the degeneration of both the Hodge-Tate and Hodge-log de Rham spectral sequences when $X$ is proper and log smooth.</description>

      <title>Equations defining Jacobians with Real Multiplication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11459v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: If $C:y^2=x(x-1)(x-a_1)(x-a_2)(x-a_3)$ is genus $2$ curve a natural question to ask is: Under what conditions on $a_1,a_2,a_3$ does the Jacobian $J(C)$ have real multiplication by $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{\Delta}]$ for some $\Delta&gt;0$. Over a hundred years ago Humbert gave an answer to this question for $\Delta=5$ and $\Delta=8$. In this paper we use work of Birkenhake and Wilhelm along with some classical results in enumerative geometry to generalize this to all discriminants, in principle. We also work it out explicitly in a few more cases.</description>
