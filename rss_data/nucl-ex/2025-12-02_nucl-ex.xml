      <title>A Review on Intense Electromagnetic Fields in Heavy-Ion Collisions: Theoretical Predictions and Experimental Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In heavy-ion collisions at relativistic energies, the incident nuclei travel at nearly the speed of light. These collisions deposit kinetic energy into the overlap region and create a high-temperature environment where hadrons ``melt'' into deconfined quarks and gluons. The spectator nucleons, which do not undergo scatterings, generate an ultra-intense electromagnetic field -- on the order of $10^{18}$ Gauss at Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider, and $10^{19}$ Gauss at the Large Hadron Collider. These powerful electromagnetic fields have a significant impact on the produced particles, not only complicating the study of particle interactions but also inducing novel physical phenomena. To explore the nature of these fields and their interactions with deconfined quarks, we provide a detailed overview, encompassing theoretical estimations of their generation and evolution, as well as experimental efforts to detect them. We also provide physical interpretations of the discovered results and discuss potential directions for future investigations.</description>

      <title>Probing hard/soft factorization via beam-spin asymmetry in exclusive pion electroproduction from the proton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep exclusive meson production (DEMP) reactions, such as $p(\vec{e},e'\pi^+)n$, provide opportunities to study the three-dimensional structure of the nucleon through differential cross section and beam- and target-spin asymmetry measurements. This work aims to probe the onset of the hard/soft factorization regime through the exclusive $p(\vec{e},e'\pi^+)n$ reaction, as measured in the KaonLT experiment at Jefferson Lab Hall C. A 10.6 GeV longitudinally polarized electron beam was incident on an unpolarized liquid hydrogen target, and the scattered electron and produced meson were detected in two magnetic focusing spectrometers, enabling precision cross section measurements. The cross section ratio $\sigma_{LT'}/\sigma_0$ was extracted from the beam-spin asymmetry $A_{LU}$. The $t$-dependence of $\sigma_{LT'}/\sigma_0$ was determined at fixed $Q^2$ and $x_B$ over a range of kinematics from $2&lt;Q^2&lt;6$ GeV$^2$ above the resonance region ($W&gt;2$ GeV). Furthermore, these data are combined with recent results from CLAS/CLAS12 to determine the $Q^2$-dependence of $\sigma_{LT'}/\sigma_0$ at two ($x_B$, $t$) settings. This was fairly flat, with $Q^2$ not having a measurable effect on the value of $\sigma_{LT'}/\sigma_0$ in the range explored. Results are compared to predictions from the generalized parton distribution (GPD) formalism, which relies explicitly on hard/soft factorization, and Regge formalism. The Regge models better predict $\sigma_{LT'}/\sigma_0$, which suggests that the factorization regime is not yet reached.</description>

      <title>Coincidence Algebra Bundle for Decay Quivers: An Algebraic Approach to Gamma-ray Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the need for a more comprehensive algebraic structure to calculate coincidence probabilities of a general decay scheme for gamma ray spectroscopy, we model the decay scheme, rather naturally, as a quiver through which we define a decay quiver. The path algebra of quivers is the underlying, more general, algebra for transition matrices that is typically used in modeling decay schemes. The path algebra allows for concatenation of transitions which affords the calculation of cascade probabilities. We extend the path algebra to allow for the multiplication of non-composable paths, i.e., transition that don't directly share a level connecting them. We define the coincidence algebra as the algebra that allows for such an extension and realize it as the fibres for a coincidence algebra bundle, the base space of which is the path algebra where decay schemes live. A given decay schemes coincidence probabilities are calculated on its fibre. \textit{Detection maps} are defined as linear maps on the base space that map transition probabilities to detected probabilities.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the Neutron Skin of $^{48}$Ca Through Collective Flow at the CERN Large Hadron Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recently developed ``imaging-by-smashing" technique has emerged as a powerful approach to connect final-state collective flow phenomena in ultra-relativistic nuclear collisions with the intrinsic structure of the colliding nuclei. While most efforts have focused on constraining nuclear shape properties such as deformation and triaxiality, less attention has been given to the neutron skin, primarily in heavy nuclei such as $^{208}$Pb. In this work, a novel study of the neutron-skin thickness in $^{48}$Ca is presented, based on comparative analyses of $^{48}$Ca+$^{48}$Ca and $^{40}$Ca+$^{40}$Ca collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=5.02$ TeV. Simulations within the AMPT framework are employed to investigate the impact of varying neutron-skin thicknesses $\Delta r_{np}$ for $^{48}$Ca on collective flow observables, including anisotropic flow coefficients and mean transverse momentum ($[p_{\rm T}]$) fluctuations. The triangular flow $v_3$, quadrangular flow $v_4$, as well as the variance and skewness of $[p_{\rm T}]$ fluctuations, display notable sensitivity to $\Delta r_{np}$. These findings indicate that calcium-isotope runs at the LHC could provide an independent and complementary approach to constraining $\Delta r_{np}$, with the potential to help resolve the current tension between PREX and CREX measurements.</description>

      <title>Nuclear modification of heavy flavor decayed dielectrons in relativistic heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dielectrons from heavy flavor hadron decays not only constitute a crucial background to their thermal spectrum in high-energy nuclear collisions, from which the temperature of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) is extracted, but also provide a valuable probe of heavy quark interactions with the QGP. Using a linear Boltzmann transport (LBT) model to describe heavy quark evolution inside the QGP and a hybrid fragmentation-coalescence model for their hadronization, we find heavy quark energy loss softens the invariant mass spectrum of their decayed dielectrons and yields a higher value of the extracted QGP temperature, while coalescence hardens the spectrum and yields a lower value. Taking into account full medium effects leads to higher values of the extracted temperature than using vacuum baselines of heavy flavor decayed dielectrons in analyzing the experimental data. In addition, we find the angular correlations between dielectron pairs are sensitive to heavy quark interactions with the QGP: the radial flow of the QGP enhances the near-side correlations, and scatterings between heavy quarks and the QGP broaden the away-side correlations, with elastic and string interactions playing a dominant role.</description>

      <title>Feasibility Study of Pion and Kaon Structure via the Sullivan Process at EicC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Electron--Ion Collider in China (EicC) provides an excellent opportunity to explore the internal structure of pions and kaons via the Sullivan process in deep-inelastic scattering (DIS). In this study, we present detailed projections for the pion and kaon structure functions, $F_2^\pi$ and $F_2^K$, at EicC, with a focus on both statistical and systematic uncertainties. Leveraging EicC's high luminosity and broad kinematic coverage, the accessible kinematic region is extended beyond previous measurements. The projected statistical uncertainties for $F_2^\pi$ and $F_2^K$ are below 5\% and 8\%, respectively, across most kinematic bins. Systematic uncertainties arising from detector effects have been carefully evaluated. These results significantly enhance the precision of meson structure function measurements and provide important constraints on theoretical models of meson parton distributions. Moreover, this study bridges the gap between fixed-target and collider-era measurements, highlighting the pivotal role of EicC in advancing our understanding of hadronic structure.</description>

      <title>Electron-induced single-pion production to constrain the neutron structure in $^{40}$Ar. A proof of concept</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study electron-induced single-pion production as a way to constrain the neutron structure of $^{40}$Ar, information that is necessary for neutrino experiments using argon detectors. The proposed experimental signal consists in detecting in coincidence the scattered electron, a proton and a $\pi^-$. We performed simulations compatible with the experimental conditions of the MAMI (University of Mainz) and CLAS (Jefferson Lab) facilities. We have computed cross sections and evaluated the main backgrounds. MAMI is a three-spectrometer system with extremely good energy resolution and small acceptances. We found that, by choosing specific values of the final particle's momenta, the shell structure can be well resolved, with negligible background contributions. CLAS is a large solid angle detector with poorer energy resolution. In both cases, the background can be kept under control by performing cuts in missing energy and missing momentum; however, in CLAS, the shell structure cannot be resolved due to the energy resolution. We conclude that MAMI is particularly appropriate for the proposed experiment, whereas CLAS is better suited for other studies.</description>

      <title>Measurement of $^{3,4}$He($K^-, \pi^0$)$^{3,4}_\Lambda$H reaction cross section and evaluation of hypertriton binding energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16967v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Light $s$-shell hypernuclei ($^{3,4}_{\Lambda}\text{H}$) and their ground-state properties are crucial benchmarks in hypernuclear physics. In particular, comparing the production cross sections of $^{3}_{\Lambda}\text{H}$ and $^{4}_{\Lambda}\text{H}$ provides insights into the $\Lambda N$ interaction in different isospin configurations, which can help address recent discrepancies in the reported $\Lambda$ binding energy of hypertriton. We present the first measurement of the production cross sections for $^{3}_{\Lambda}\text{H}$ and $^{4}_{\Lambda}\text{H}$ using the in-flight $(K^-, \pi^0)$ reaction at a beam momentum of 1.0 GeV/$c$ with an identical experimental setup. The production cross sections in the laboratory frame, for the angular range from 0$^{\circ}$ to 20$^{\circ}$, are measured to be $15.0~\pm~2.6~(\text{stat.})~^{+2.4}_{-2.8}~(\text{syst.})~\mu \text{b} $ and $49.9~\pm~2.1~(\text{stat.})~^{+7.8}_{-8.0}~(\text{syst.})~\mu \text{b}$ for the ground-state of $^{3}_{\Lambda}\text{H}$ and $^{4}_{\Lambda}\text{H}$, respectively. Using the ratio of these cross sections and comparing it with theoretical calculations, we evaluate the $\Lambda$ binding energy of hypertriton, yielding a value consistent with the picture of a loosely bound system.</description>

      <title>Tomographic beta-gamma spectroscopy of nuclear beta decay</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24612v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nuclear $\beta$ decay, a sensitive probe of nuclear structure and weak interactions, has become a precision test bed for physics beyond the Standard Model, driven by recent advances in spectrometric techniques. Here we introduce tomographic $\beta$-$\gamma$ spectroscopy (TBGS) of nuclear $\beta$ decay, a method that detects the energies of $\beta$, $\gamma$, and internal conversion electrons while simultaneously reconstructing the energy deposition vertices. Using the PandaX-4T detector operated as a TBGS, we obtain a precise and unbiased decay scheme of $^{214}$Pb, a key background isotope in searches for dark matter and Majorana neutrinos. For the first time, transitions of $^{214}$Pb to both the ground and excited states of $^{214}$Bi are measured concurrently, revealing discrepancies in branching ratios of up to 4.7$\sigma$ relative to previous evaluations. Combined with state-of-the-art theoretical spectral-shape calculations, these results establish a new benchmark for background modelling in rare-event searches and highlight the potential of TBGS as a versatile tool for fundamental physics and nuclear applications.</description>

      <title>The SHMS 11 GeV/c Spectrometer in Hall C at Jefferson Lab</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08706v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Super High Momentum Spectrometer (SHMS) has been built for Hall C at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (Jefferson Lab). With a momentum capability reaching 11 GeV/c, the SHMS provides measurements of charged particles produced in electron-scattering experiments using the maximum available beam energy from the upgraded Jefferson Lab accelerator. The SHMS is an ion-optics magnetic spectrometer comprised of a series of new superconducting magnets which transport charged particles through an array of triggering, tracking, and particle-identification detectors that measure momentum, energy, angle and position in order to allow kinematic reconstruction of the events back to their origin at the scattering target. The detector system is protected from background radiation by a sophisticated shielding enclosure. The entire spectrometer is mounted on a rotating support structure which permits measurements to be taken with a large acceptance over laboratory scattering angles from 5.5 to 40 degrees, thus allowing a wide range of low cross-section experiments to be conducted. These experiments complement and extend the previous Hall C research program to higher energies.</description>

Abstract: Nuclear ground state and collective excitation properties provide a means to probe the nuclear matter equation of state and establish connections between observables in finite nuclei and neutron stars. Specifically, the electric dipole polarizability, measured with high precision in various neutron-rich nuclei, serves as a robust constraint on the density dependence of the symmetry energy. In this Letter, we employ a class of relativistic energy density functionals in a twofold process: first, to link the electric dipole polarizability from recent experiments to the slope of the symmetry energy, and second, to translate this information into constraints on the tidal deformability and radii of neutron stars, in connection with multimessenger astrophysical observations from pulsars and binary neutron stars. We provide compelling evidence that the electric dipole polarizability represents a key nuclear observable to probe the neutron-star properties. By significantly reducing the uncertainties in the mass-radius plane, our findings also align with recent multimessenger observations.</description>

      <title>Deblurring fission fragment mass distributions</title>

Abstract: Measurements of fission fragment mass distributions provide valuable insights into the properties of fissioning systems and the dynamics of the fission process. Pre-neutron emission distributions, essential for fission fragment evaporation codes like \cgmf{}, are extracted from distributions that are always measured after neutron emission, as the time scale of the emission of prompt fission neutrons is too short for direct measurement before the emission. However, obtaining accurate pre-neutron emission distributions requires methods that eliminate the effects of mass resolution and detector efficiency. We propose a deblurring technique based on the Richardson-Lucy (RL) algorithm, commonly used in optics for image restoration, to correct for these experimental effects. The RL algorithm uses the measured mass distributions and a transfer matrix to perform iterative deconvolution. The advantage of this method over others is that it does not assume any predefined shape such as a sum of Gaussians, as in \cgmf{}, for the distributions. In this paper, we apply the algorithm to the fission fragment mass distributions measured in the spontaneous fission of $^{252}$Cf to extract pre-neutron emission fission fragment mass distributions. The results from deblurring are then used as inputs to \cgmf{}, and we compare the \cgmf{} results obtained using deblurring inputs with the default \cgmf{} results.</description>

      <title>Deviations from the Isobaric Multiplet Mass Equation due to threshold states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14674v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have completed the A=16 isospin quintets for states with spin/parity J{\pi} =0+ and 2+. The dependence of their masses as a function of isospin projection shows evidence for deviations from quadratic behavior indicating isospin violation beyond the expectation from two- body forces. The deviation is most pronounced for the 2+ states. Predictions from the Shell Model Embedded in the Continuum (SMEC) allow us to explain that this isospin violation is associated with a modification of the nuclear structure due to the open-quantum-system nature of the proton- rich members of the quintet. In particular, the 0+ and 2+ states in 16Ne and the 2+ state in 16F are threshold resonances located just above a proton-decay threshold where s-wave coupling to the continuum is expected. The measured deviations of these threshold states from the quadratic behavior of the remaining members of the multiplets makes it possible to obtain information on the magnitude and the energy dependence of the continuum-coupling energy correction. Continuum coupling is also indicated for the ground state of 8C, but this time through p-wave coupling.</description>
