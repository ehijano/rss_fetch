      <title>Two-way fixed effects instrumental variable regressions in staggered DID-IV designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many studies run two-way fixed effects instrumental variable (TWFEIV) regressions, leveraging variation in the timing of policy adoption across units as an instrument for treatment. This paper studies the properties of the TWFEIV estimator in staggered instrumented difference-in-differences (DID-IV) designs. We show that in settings with the staggered adoption of the instrument across units, the TWFEIV estimator can be decomposed into a weighted average of all possible two-group/two-period Wald-DID estimators. Under staggered DID-IV designs, a causal interpretation of the TWFEIV estimand hinges on the stable effects of the instrument on the treatment and the outcome over time. We illustrate the use of our decomposition theorem for the TWFEIV estimator through an empirical application.</description>

      <title>Estimating Dyadic Treatment Effects with Unknown Confounders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a statistical inference method for assessing treatment effects with dyadic data. Under the assumption that the treatments follow an exchangeable distribution, our approach allows for the presence of any unobserved confounding factors that potentially cause endogeneity of treatment choice without requiring additional information other than the treatments and outcomes. Building on the literature of graphon estimation in network data analysis, we propose a neighborhood kernel smoothing method for estimating dyadic average treatment effects. We also develop a permutation inference method for testing the sharp null hypothesis. Under certain regularity conditions, we derive the rate of convergence of the proposed estimator and demonstrate the size control property of our test. We apply our method to international trade data to assess the impact of free trade agreements on bilateral trade flows.</description>

      <title>Cross-border cannibalization: Spillover effects of wind and solar energy on interconnected European electricity markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The average revenue, or market value, of wind and solar energy tends to fall with increasing market shares, as is now evident across European electricity markets. At the same time, these markets have become more interconnected. In this paper, we empirically study the multiple cross-border effects on the value of renewable energy: on one hand, interconnection is a flexibility resource that allows to export energy when it is locally abundant, benefitting renewables. On the other hand, wind and solar radiation are correlated across space, so neighboring supply adds to the local one to depress domestic prices. We estimate both effects, using spatial panel regression on electricity market data from 2015 to 2023 from 30 European bidding zones. We find that domestic wind and solar value is not only depressed by domestic, but also by neighboring renewables expansion. The better interconnected a market is, the smaller the effect of domestic but the larger the effect of neighboring renewables. While wind value is stabilized by interconnection, solar value is not. If wind market share increases both at home and in neighboring markets by one percentage point, the value factor of wind energy is reduced by just above 1 percentage points. For solar, this number is almost 4 percentage points.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Reliance of Black-Box Decision-Makers on Variables of Interest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a framework for measuring how much black-box decision-makers rely on variables of interest. The framework adapts a permutation-based measure of variable importance from the explainable machine learning literature. With an emphasis on applicability, I present some of the framework's theoretical and computational properties, explain how reliance computations have policy implications, and work through an illustrative example. In the empirical application to interruptions by Supreme Court Justices during oral argument, I find that the effect of gender is more muted compared to the existing literature's estimate; I then use this paper's framework to compare Justices' reliance on gender and alignment to their reliance on experience, which are incomparable using regression coefficients.</description>

      <title>Mixing it up: Inflation at risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assessing the contribution of various risk factors to future inflation risks was crucial for guiding monetary policy during the recent high inflation period. However, existing methodologies often provide limited insights by focusing solely on specific percentiles of the forecast distribution. In contrast, this paper introduces a comprehensive framework that examines how economic indicators impact the entire forecast distribution of macroeconomic variables, facilitating the decomposition of the overall risk outlook into its underlying drivers. Additionally, the framework allows for the construction of risk measures that align with central bank preferences, serving as valuable summary statistics. Applied to the recent inflation surge, the framework reveals that U.S. inflation risk was primarily influenced by the recovery of the U.S. business cycle and surging commodity prices, partially mitigated by adjustments in monetary policy and credit spreads.</description>

      <title>Estimating treatment-effect heterogeneity across sites in multi-site randomized experiments with imperfect compliance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider multi-site randomized controlled trials with a large number of small sites and imperfect compliance, conducted in non-random convenience samples in each site. We show that an Empirical-Bayes (EB) estimator can be used to estimate a lower bound of the variance of intention-to-treat (ITT) effects across sites. We also propose bounds for the coefficient from a regression of site-level ITTs on sites' control-group outcome. Turning to local average treatment effects (LATEs), the EB estimator cannot be used to estimate their variance, because site-level LATE estimators are biased. Instead, we propose two testable assumptions under which the LATEs' variance can be written as a function of sites' ITT and first-stage (FS) effects, thus allowing us to use an EB estimator leveraging only unbiased ITT and FS estimators. We revisit Behaghel et al. (2014), who study the effect of counselling programs on job seekers job-finding rate, in more than 200 job placement agencies in France. We find considerable ITT heterogeneity, and even more LATE heterogeneity: our lower bounds on ITTs' (resp. LATEs') standard deviation are more than three (resp. four) times larger than the average ITT (resp. LATE) across sites. Sites with a lower job-finding rate in the control group have larger ITT effects.</description>

      <title>Count Data Models with Heterogeneous Peer Effects under Rational Expectations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a micro-founded peer effect model for count responses using a game of incomplete information. The model incorporates heterogeneity in peer effects through agents' groups based on observed characteristics. Parameter identification is established using the identification condition of linear models, which relies on the presence of friends' friends who are not direct friends in the network. I show that this condition extends to a large class of nonlinear models. The model parameters are estimated using the nested pseudo-likelihood approach, controlling for network endogeneity. I present an empirical application on students' participation in extracurricular activities. I find that females are more responsive to their peers than males, whereas male peers do not influence male students. An easy-to-use R packag--named CDatanet--is available for implementing the model.</description>

      <title>Statistical Mechanism Design: Robust Pricing, Estimation, and Inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper tackles challenges in pricing and revenue projections due to consumer uncertainty. We propose a novel data-based approach for firms facing unknown consumer type distributions. Unlike existing methods, we assume firms only observe a finite sample of consumers' types. We introduce \emph{empirically optimal mechanisms}, a simple and intuitive class of sample-based mechanisms with strong finite-sample revenue guarantees. Furthermore, we leverage our results to develop a toolkit for statistical inference on profits. Our approach allows to reliably estimate the profits associated for any particular mechanism, to construct confidence intervals, and to, more generally, conduct valid hypothesis testing.</description>

      <title>Long Story Short: Omitted Variable Bias in Causal Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.13398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.13398v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a general theory of omitted variable bias for a wide range of common causal parameters, including (but not limited to) averages of potential outcomes, average treatment effects, average causal derivatives, and policy effects from covariate shifts. Our theory applies to nonparametric models, while naturally allowing for (semi-)parametric restrictions (such as partial linearity) when such assumptions are made. We show how simple plausibility judgments on the maximum explanatory power of omitted variables are sufficient to bound the magnitude of the bias, thus facilitating sensitivity analysis in otherwise complex, nonlinear models. Finally, we provide flexible and efficient statistical inference methods for the bounds, which can leverage modern machine learning algorithms for estimation. These results allow empirical researchers to perform sensitivity analyses in a flexible class of machine-learned causal models using very simple, and interpretable, tools. We demonstrate the utility of our approach with two empirical examples.</description>

      <title>Characteristics and Predictive Modeling of Short-term Impacts of Hurricanes on the US Employment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.13686v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The physical and economic damages of hurricanes can acutely affect employment and the well-being of employees. However, a comprehensive understanding of these impacts remains elusive as many studies focused on narrow subsets of regions or hurricanes. Here we present an open-source dataset that serves interdisciplinary research on hurricane impacts on US employment. Compared to past domain-specific efforts, this dataset has greater spatial-temporal granularity and variable coverage. To demonstrate potential applications of this dataset, we focus on the short-term employment disruptions related to hurricanes during 1990-2020. The observed county-level employment changes in the initial month are small on average, though large employment losses (&gt;30%) can occur after extreme storms. The overall small changes partly result from compensation among different employment sectors, which may obscure large, concentrated employment losses after hurricanes. Additional econometric analyses concur on the post-storm employment losses in hospitality and leisure but disagree on employment changes in the other industries. The dataset also enables data-driven analyses that highlight vulnerabilities such as pronounced employment losses related to Puerto Rico and rainy hurricanes. Furthermore, predictive modeling of short-term employment changes shows promising performance for service-providing industries and high-impact storms. In the examined cases, the nonlinear Random Forests model greatly outperforms the multiple linear regression model. The nonlinear model also suggests that more severe hurricane hazards projected by physical models may cause more extreme losses in US service-providing employment. Finally, we share our dataset and analytical code to facilitate the study and modeling of hurricane impacts in a changing climate.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive OOS Evaluation of Predictive Algorithms with Statistical Decision Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11016v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We argue that comprehensive out-of-sample (OOS) evaluation using statistical decision theory (SDT) should replace the current practice of K-fold and Common Task Framework validation in machine learning (ML) research. SDT provides a formal framework for performing comprehensive OOS evaluation across all possible (1) training samples, (2) populations that may generate training data, and (3) populations of prediction interest. Regarding feature (3), we emphasize that SDT requires the practitioner to directly confront the possibility that the future may not look like the past and to account for a possible need to extrapolate from one population to another when building a predictive algorithm. SDT is simple in abstraction, but it is often computationally demanding to implement. We discuss progress in tractable implementation of SDT when prediction accuracy is measured by mean square error or by misclassification rate. We summarize research studying settings in which the training data will be generated from a subpopulation of the population of prediction interest. We consider conditional prediction with alternative restrictions on the state space of possible populations that may generate training data. We present an illustrative application of the methodology to the problem of predicting patient illness to inform clinical decision making. We conclude by calling on ML researchers to join with econometricians and statisticians in expanding the domain within which implementation of SDT is tractable.</description>

      <title>Towards Generalizing Inferences from Trials to Target Populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17042v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) are pivotal in generating internally valid estimates with minimal assumptions, serving as a cornerstone for researchers dedicated to advancing causal inference methods. However, extending these findings beyond the experimental cohort to achieve externally valid estimates is crucial for broader scientific inquiry. This paper delves into the forefront of addressing these external validity challenges, encapsulating the essence of a multidisciplinary workshop held at the Institute for Computational and Experimental Research in Mathematics (ICERM), Brown University, in Fall 2023. The workshop congregated experts from diverse fields including social science, medicine, public health, statistics, computer science, and education, to tackle the unique obstacles each discipline faces in extrapolating experimental findings. Our study presents three key contributions: we integrate ongoing efforts, highlighting methodological synergies across fields; provide an exhaustive review of generalizability and transportability based on the workshop's discourse; and identify persistent hurdles while suggesting avenues for future research. By doing so, this paper aims to enhance the collective understanding of the generalizability and transportability of causal effects, fostering cross-disciplinary collaboration and offering valuable insights for researchers working on refining and applying causal inference methods.</description>
