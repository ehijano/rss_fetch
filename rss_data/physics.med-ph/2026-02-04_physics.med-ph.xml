      <title>Perfusion Imaging and Single Material Reconstruction in Polychromatic Photon Counting CT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Perfusion computed tomography (CT) images the dynamics of a contrast agent through the body over time, and is one of the highest X-ray dose scans in medical imaging. Recently, a theoretically justified reconstruction algorithm based on a monotone variational inequality (VI) was proposed for single material polychromatic photon-counting CT, and showed promising early results at low-dose imaging.
  Purpose: We adapt this reconstruction algorithm for perfusion CT, to reconstruct the concentration map of the contrast agent while the static background tissue is assumed known; we call our method VI-PRISM (VI-based PeRfusion Imaging and Single Material reconstruction). We evaluate its potential for dose-reduced perfusion CT, using a digital phantom with water and iodine of varying concentration.
  Methods: Simulated iodine concentrations range from 0.05 to 2.5 mg/ml. The simulated X-ray source emits photons up to 100 keV, with average intensity ranging from $10^5$ down to $10^2$ photons per detector element. The number of tomographic projections was varied from 984 down to 8 to characterize the tradeoff in photon allocation between views and intensity.
  Results: We compare VI-PRISM against filtered back-projection (FBP), and find that VI-PRISM recovers iodine concentration with error below 0.4 mg/ml at all source intensity levels tested. Even with a dose reduction between 10x and 100x compared to FBP, VI-PRISM exhibits reconstruction quality on par with FBP.
  Conclusion: Across all photon budgets and angular sampling densities tested, VI-PRISM achieved consistently lower RMSE, reduced noise, and higher SNR compared to filtered back-projection. Even in extremely photon-limited and sparsely sampled regimes, VI-PRISM recovered iodine concentrations with errors below 0.4 mg/ml, showing that VI-PRISM can support accurate and dose-efficient perfusion imaging in photon-counting CT.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Electromagnetic Simulation of MRI RF Interactions with Graphene Microtransistor-Based Neural Probes for Electrophysiology-fMRI Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Implementing electrophysiological recordings within an MRI environment is challenging due to complex interactions between recording probes and MRI-generated fields, which can affect both safety and data quality. This study aims to develop and evaluate a hybrid electromagnetic (EM) simulation framework for efficient and accurate assessment of such interactions. Methods: A hybrid EM strategy integrating the Huygens' Box (HB) method with sub-gridding was implemented in an FDTD solver (Sim4Life). RF coil models for mouse and rat head were simulated with and without intracortical (IC) and epicortical (EC) graphene-based micro-transistor arrays. Three-dimensional multi-layered probe models were reconstructed from two-dimensional layouts, and transmit field ($B_{1}^{+}$), electric field ($E$), and specific absorption rate (SAR) distributions were evaluated. Performance was benchmarked against conventional full-wave multi-port (MP) simulations using Bland-Altman analysis and voxel-wise percentage differences. Results: HB simulations reduced computational time by approximately 70-80%, while preserving spatial patterns of $|B_{1}^{+}|$, $|E|$, and SAR, including transmit-field symmetry and localized high-field regions. Deviations from MP were minimal for $|B_{1}^{+}|$ (median $\Delta$% 0.02-0.07% in mice, -3.7% to -1.7% in rats) and modest for $|E|$ and SAR, with absolute SAR values remaining well below human safety limits. Graphene-based arrays produced negligible effects on RF transmission and SAR deposition. Conclusion: The HB approach enables computationally efficient, high-resolution evaluation of EM interactions involving microscopic probes in MRI environments, supporting simulations that are otherwise impractical with full-wave MP modeling.</description>

      <title>Reducing acquisition time and radiation damage: data-driven subsampling for spectro-microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03744v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectro-microscopy is an experimental technique which can be used to observe spatial variations in chemical state and changes in chemical state over time or under experimental conditions. As a result it has broad applications across areas such as energy materials, catalysis, environmental science and biological samples. However, the technique is often limited by factors such as long acquisition times and radiation damage. We present two measurement strategies that allow for significantly shorter experiment times and total doses applied. The strategies are based on taking only a small subset of all the measurements (e.g. sparse acquisition or subsampling), and then computationally reconstructing all unobserved measurements using mathematical techniques. The methods are data-driven, using spectral and spatial importance subsampling distributions to identify important measurements. As a result, taking as little as 4-6\% of the measurements is sufficient to capture the same information as in a conventional scan.</description>

      <title>A space-time LATIN-PGD strategy for solving Newtonian compressible flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulating flow problems is at the core of many engineering applications but often requires high computational effort, especially when dealing with complex models. This work presents a novel approach for resolving flow problems using the LATIN-PGD solver. In this contribution, we place ourselves within the framework of Newtonian compressible and laminar flows. This specific and relatively simple case enables focusing on flows for which a state equation provides a direct relation between pressure and density. It is then possible to use the LATIN solver to set up a pressure-velocity decoupling algorithm. Moreover, Proper Generalised Decomposition (PGD) is natively included in the solver and yields two independent space-time decompositions for the velocity and the pressure fields. As a first step, the solver is validated on a problem for which an analytical solution is available. It is then applied to slightly more complex problems. The results show good agreement with the literature, and we expect that the solver could be used to compute more complicated material laws in the future.</description>

      <title>Physics-Based Learning of the Wave Speed Landscape in Complex Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03281v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wave velocity is a key parameter for imaging complex media, but in vivo measurements are typically limited to reflection geometries, where only backscattered waves from short-scale heterogeneities are accessible. As a result, conventional reflection imaging fails to recover large-scale variations of the wave velocity landscape. Here we show that matrix imaging overcomes this limitation by exploiting the quality of wave focusing as an intrinsic guide star. We model wave propagation as a trainable multi-layer network that leverages optimization and deep learning tools to infer the wave velocity distribution. We validate this approach through ultrasound experiments on tissue-mimicking phantoms and human breast tissues, demonstrating its potential for tumour detection and characterization. Our method is broadly applicable to any kind of waves and media for which a reflection matrix can be measured.</description>

      <title>Multiparameter Uncertainty Mapping in Quantitative Molecular MRI using a Physics-Structured Variational Autoencoder (PS-VAE)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantitative imaging methods, such as magnetic resonance fingerprinting (MRF), aim to extract interpretable pathology biomarkers by estimating biophysical tissue parameters from signal evolutions. However, the pattern-matching algorithms or neural networks used in such inverse problems often lack principled uncertainty quantification, which limits the trustworthiness and transparency, required for clinical acceptance. Here, we describe a physics-structured variational autoencoder (PS-VAE) designed for rapid extraction of voxelwise multi-parameter posterior distributions. Our approach integrates a differentiable spin physics simulator with self-supervised learning, and provides a full covariance that captures the inter-parameter correlations of the latent biophysical space. The method was validated in a multi-proton pool chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) and semisolid magnetization transfer (MT) molecular MRF study, across in-vitro phantoms, tumor-bearing mice, healthy human volunteers, and a subject with glioblastoma. The resulting multi-parametric posteriors are in good agreement with those calculated using a brute-force Bayesian analysis, while providing an orders-of-magnitude acceleration in whole brain quantification. In addition, we demonstrate how monitoring the multi-parameter posterior dynamics across progressively acquired signals provides practical insights for protocol optimization and may facilitate real-time adaptive acquisition.</description>

      <title>Quasi-multimodal-based pathophysiological feature learning for retinal disease diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retinal diseases spanning a broad spectrum can be effectively identified and diagnosed using complementary signals from multimodal data. However, multimodal diagnosis in ophthalmic practice is typically challenged in terms of data heterogeneity, potential invasiveness, registration complexity, and so on. As such, a unified framework that integrates multimodal data synthesis and fusion is proposed for retinal disease classification and grading. Specifically, the synthesized multimodal data incorporates fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA), multispectral imaging (MSI), and saliency maps that emphasize latent lesions as well as optic disc/cup regions. Parallel models are independently trained to learn modality-specific representations that capture cross-pathophysiological signatures. These features are then adaptively calibrated within and across modalities to perform information pruning and flexible integration according to downstream tasks. The proposed learning system is thoroughly interpreted through visualizations in both image and feature spaces. Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrated the superiority of our approach over state-of-the-art ones in the tasks of multi-label classification (F1-score: 0.683, AUC: 0.953) and diabetic retinopathy grading (Accuracy:0.842, Kappa: 0.861). This work not only enhances the accuracy and efficiency of retinal disease screening but also offers a scalable framework for data augmentation across various medical imaging modalities.</description>

      <title>Super-resolution positron emission tomography by intensity modulation: Proof of concept</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16085v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We proposed a new approach, which is inspired by the method of super-resolution (SR) structured illumination microscopy (SIM) for overcoming the resolution limit in microscopy due to diffraction of light, for increasing the resolution of clinical positron emission tomography (PET) beyond its instrumentation limit. We implemented the key idea behind SR-SIM by using a rotating intensity modulator in front of a stationary PET detector ring. Its function is to modulate down high-frequency signals of the projection data that originally were above the system's bandwidth and unobservable to appear as aliased lower-frequency ones that are detectable. We formulated a model that relates an image whose resolution is above the instrumentation limit to several thus obtained limited-resolution measurements at various rotational positions of the modulator. We implemented an ordered-subsets expectation-maximization algorithm for inverting the model. Using noise-free data produced by an analytic projector, we showed this approach can resolve 0.9 mm sources when applied to a PET system that employs 4.2 mm-width detectors. With noisy data, the SR performance remains promising. In particular, 1.5 mm sources were resolvable, and the visibility and quantification of small sources and fine structures were improved despite the sensitivity loss incurred by the modulator. These observations remain valid when using more realistic Monte-Carlo simulation data. More studies are needed to better understand the theoretical aspects of the proposed method and to optimize the design of the modulator and the reconstruction algorithm.</description>

      <title>Joint Reconstruction of Activity and Attenuation in PET by Diffusion Posterior Sampling in Wavelet Coefficient Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18782v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Attenuation correction (AC) is necessary for accurate activity quantification in positron emission tomography (PET). Conventional reconstruction methods typically rely on attenuation maps derived from a co-registered computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. However, this additional scan may complicate the imaging workflow, introduce misalignment artifacts and increase radiation exposure. In this paper, we propose a joint reconstruction of activity and attenuation (JRAA) approach that eliminates the need for auxiliary anatomical imaging by relying solely on emission data. This framework combines wavelet diffusion model (WDM) and diffusion posterior sampling (DPS) to reconstruct fully three-dimensional (3-D) data. Experimental results show our method outperforms maximum likelihood activity and attenuation (MLAA) and MLAA with U-Net-based post processing, and yields high-quality noise-free reconstructions across various count settings when time-of-flight (TOF) information is available. It is also able to reconstruct non-TOF data, although the reconstruction quality significantly degrades in low-count (LC) conditions, limiting its practical effectiveness in such settings. Nonetheless, a non-TOF Biograph mMR data reconstruction with joint scatter estimation highlights the potential of the method for clinical applications. This approach represents a step towards stand-alone PET imaging by reducing the dependence on anatomical modalities while maintaining quantification accuracy, even in low-count scenarios when TOF information is available. Our code is available on GitHub at https://github.com/clemphg/jraa-dps.</description>
