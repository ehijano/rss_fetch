Abstract: The high demand for mango (Mangifera indica L.) fruits has led sellers to employ ripening agents. However, concerns are growing regarding the potential toxicities of induced ripening, emphasizing the need for scientific investigation. Samples of artificially and naturally ripened mangoes were analyzed for proximate composition using standard protocols. Cytogenotoxicity was then assessed using the Allium cepa L. toxicity test. Twenty (20)A. cepa (onion) bulbs were used, with 5 ripened naturally, 5 with wood ash, 5 with herbaceous ash, and 5 with rice chips, all grown over tap water for five days. The root tips of the bulbs were assayed and examined for chromosomal aberrations. The results revealed a significant (P&lt;0.05) increase in moisture, protein, and ash content of mangoes as ripening agents were introduced. Mangoes ripened with wood ash exhibited the highest moisture content (81%), while those ripened with rice chips had the highest protein (0.5%) and ash content (1.5%). Naturally ripened mangoes displayed the highest fat (0.0095%) and fiber (11.46%) contents. The A. cepa toxicity test indicated significant (p&lt;0.05) differences in the root growth of mangoes ripened with various agents. Wood ash resulted in the highest root growth (2.62cm), while herbaceous ash had the least (2.18%). Chromosomal aberrations, including sticky, vagrant, and laggard abnormalities, were observed in all agents, with herbaceous ash exhibiting the highest and rice chips the least. The obtained results suggest that induced ripening of the fruits could induce toxicities, highlighting the necessity for public awareness regarding the potential dangers posed by these agents.</description>
