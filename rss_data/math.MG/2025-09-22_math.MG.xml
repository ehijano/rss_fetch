      <title>On Markowitz's pseudodistance for conformal manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the 1980s, M. J. Markowitz introduced a conformally invariant pseudodistance on pseudo-Riemannian manifolds, inspired by the Kobayashi metric in projective geometry. This construction relies on a distinguished class of parametrized lightlike geodesics, called projectively parametrized. We begin by reviewing the fundamental properties of this pseudodistance and provide several families of examples where it is non-degenerate and, in some cases, complete. In particular, we investigate three classes of manifolds: closed manifolds, conformally convex domains of the Einstein universe, and globally hyperbolic, conformally flat, $C$-maximal spacetimes. For the first two classes, we obtain results analogous to those of Brody and Barth concerning the complex Kobayashi metric. Finally, we apply Markowitz's pseudodistance to classify all quasi-homogeneous domains of the Einstein-de Sitter space, that is, a half-space of Minkowski space bounded by a spacelike hyperplane. Up to conformal transformations, only finitely many such domains exist, and all of them turn out to be homogeneous.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06456v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that Hadamard spaces with geometric group actions admit affine maps that are not dilations, if and only if they are Riemannian symmetric spaces of higher rank, Euclidean buildings of higher rank, or split as non-trivial metric products.</description>

      <title>The Riemannian geometry of Sinkhorn divergences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04987v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new metric between probability measures on a compact metric space that mirrors the Riemannian manifold-like structure of quadratic optimal transport but includes entropic regularization. Its metric tensor is given by the Hessian of the Sinkhorn divergence, a debiased variant of entropic optimal transport. We precisely identify the tangent space it induces, which turns out to be related to a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). As usual in Riemannian geometry, the distance is built by looking for shortest paths. We prove that our distance is geodesic, metrizes the weak-star topology, and is equivalent to a RKHS norm. Still it retains the geometric flavor of optimal transport: as a paradigmatic example, translations are geodesics for the quadratic cost on $\mathbb{R}^d$. We also show two negative results on the Sinkhorn divergence that may be of independent interest: that it is not jointly convex, and that its square root is not a distance because it fails to satisfy the triangle inequality.</description>

      <title>Fuzzy simplicial sets and their application to geometric data analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11154v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we expand upon the concepts introduced by David Spivak about the relationship between the category $\mathbf{UM}$ of uber metric spaces and the category $\mathbf{sFuz}$ of fuzzy simplicial sets. We show that fuzzy simplicial sets can be regarded as natural combinatorial generalizations of metric relations. Furthermore, we take inspiration from UMAP to apply the theory to manifold learning, dimension reduction and data visualization, while refining some of their constructions. We generalize the adjunction between $\mathbf{UM}$ and $\mathbf{sFuz}$, derive an explicit description of colimits in $\mathbf{UM}$, and show that $\mathbf{UM}$ can be embedded into $\mathbf{sFuz}$. Furthermore, we prove analogous results for the category of extended-pseudo metric spaces $\mathbf{EPMet}$. We also provide rigorous definitions of functors that make it possible to recursively merge sets of fuzzy simplicial sets and provide a description of the adjunctions between the category of truncated fuzzy simplicial sets and $\mathbf{sFuz}$, which we relate to persistent homology. Combining those constructions, we can show a surprising connection between the well-known dimension reduction methods UMAP and Isomap and derive an alternative algorithm, which we call IsUMap, that combines some of the strengths of both methods. Additionally, we developed a new embedding method that allows to preserve clusters detected in the original metric space that we construct from the data. The visualization of the optimization process gives the user information, both about the inner-cluster distributions in the original metric space and their inter-cluster relations. We compare our new method with UMAP, Isomap and t-SNE on a series of low- and high-dimensional datasets and provide explanations for observed differences and improvements.</description>

      <title>Functional Liftings of Restricted Geometric Inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15247v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate what we term ``generalized sup-convolutions". We show that functional inequalities that enjoy an interpretation as sup-convolution inequalities can be deduced from the special case of indicator functions corresponding to a geometric inequality. As consequences we derive a Borell-Brascamp Lieb inequality for the Gaussian Brunn-Minkowski inequality and give a functional analog of the log-Brunn-Minkowski conjecture. We also show that Barthe's reverse Brascamp-Lieb inequality is equivalent to the geometric inequality it implies and give a functional formulation of a conjecture of Schneider. Though we focus on Euclidean applications, our results are general and can be directly applied in more abstract settings, like groups or even topological measure spaces without algebraic structure, we instantiate this claim with a Borell-Brascamp-Lieb type inequality for nilpotent Lie groups.</description>
