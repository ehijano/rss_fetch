      <title>Representing Subgrid-Scale Cloud Effects in a Radiation Parameterization using Machine Learning: MLe-radiation v1.0</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05963v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Improvements of Machine Learning (ML)-based radiation emulators remain constrained by the underlying assumptions to represent horizontal and vertical subgrid-scale cloud distributions, which continue to introduce substantial uncertainties. In this study, we introduce a method to represent the impact of subgrid-scale clouds by applying ML to learn processes from high-resolution model output with a horizontal grid spacing of 5km. In global storm resolving models, clouds begin to be explicitly resolved. Coarse-graining these high-resolution simulations to the resolution of coarser Earth System Models yields radiative heating rates that implicitly include subgrid-scale cloud effects, without assumptions about their horizontal or vertical distributions. We define the cloud radiative impact as the difference between all-sky and clear-sky radiative fluxes, and train the ML component solely on this cloud-induced contribution to heating rates. The clear-sky tendencies remain being computed with a conventional physics-based radiation scheme. This hybrid design enhances generalization, since the machine-learned part addresses only subgrid-scale cloud effects, while the clear-sky component remains responsive to changes in greenhouse gas or aerosol concentrations. Applied to coarse-grained data offline, the ML-enhanced radiation scheme reduces errors by a factor of 4-10 compared with a conventional coarse-scale radiation scheme. This shows the potential of representing subgrid-scale cloud effects in radiation schemes with ML for the next generation of Earth System Models.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Reconstruction of Tropical Cyclogenesis in the Western North Pacific from Climate Reanalysis Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a deep learning (DL) architecture based on residual convolutional neural networks (ResNet) to reconstruct the climatology of tropical cyclogenesis (TCG) in the Western North Pacific (WNP) basin from climate reanalysis datasets. Using different TCG data labeling strategies and data enrichment windows for the NASA Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications Version 2 (MERRA2) dataset during the 1980-2020 period, we demonstrate that ResNet can reasonably reproduce the overall TCG climatology in the WNP, capturing both its seasonality and spatial distribution. Our sensitivity analyses and optimizations show that this TCG reconstruction depends on both the type of TCG climatology that one wishes to reconstruct and the strategies used to label TCG data. Of interest, analyses of different input features reveal that DL-based reconstruction of TCG climatology needs only a subset of channels rather than all available data, which is consistent with previous modeling and observational studies of TCG. These results not only enhance our understanding of the TCG process but also provide a promising pathway for predicting or downscaling TCG climatology based on large-scale environments from global model forecasts or climate output. Overall, our study demonstrates that DL can offer an effective approach for studying TC climatology beyond the traditional physical-based simulations and vortex-tracking algorithms used in current climate model analyses.</description>

      <title>Zeeman: A Deep Learning Regional Atmospheric Chemistry Transport Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atmospheric chemistry encapsulates the emission of various pollutants, the complex chemistry reactions, and the meteorology dominant transport, which form a dynamic system that governs air quality. While deep learning (DL) models have shown promise in capturing intricate patterns for forecasting individual atmospheric component - such as PM2.5 and ozone - the critical interactions among multiple pollutants and the combined influence of emissions and meteorology are often overlook. This study introduces an advanced DL-based atmospheric chemistry transport model Zeeman for multi-component atmospheric chemistry simulation. Leveraging an attention mechanism, our model effectively captures the nuanced relationships among these constituents. Performance metrics demonstrate that our approach rivals numerical models, offering an efficient solution for atmospheric chemistry. In the future, this model could be further integrated with data assimilation techniques to facilitate efficient and accurate atmospheric emission estimation and concentration forecast.</description>

      <title>Field observation of soliton gases in the deep open ocean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Soliton gases are large ensembles of random solitons with distinct characteristics arising from integrable system dynamics. They have been widely studied in theory and experiments, and were observed in natural lagoons. However, it remains an open question whether they occur naturally in the open ocean. Nonlinear ocean states containing solitons have been observed in the literature, but the dominance of solitons over other wave components required for a soliton gas has not been demonstrated. Our study provides the first field evidence of soliton gas sea states in the deep ocean, measured in Taiwan waters. The soliton energy ratio derived from the nonlinear Fourier transform (NFT) is employed as a key parameter to quantify how close sea states are to soliton gases. We identify eleven measurements with extremely high soliton energy ratios. They are characterized by short-period waves with relatively small wave heights, accompanied by extreme steepness and Benjamin-Feir Index (BFI) values. These states are exceptionally rare, representing only 0.054 percent of our dataset. Since directional interference can artificially increase the soliton energy ratio, we furthermore apply a probabilistic directional filtering method to remove the directional interference. Three wave records from the Eluanbi station are found to retain high soliton energy ratios after the directional interference has been removed, confirming that they are indeed soliton gases.</description>

      <title>Climate Model Tuning with Online Synchronization-Based Parameter Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In climate science, the tuning of climate models is a computationally intensive problem due to the combination of the high-dimensionality of the system state and long integration times. Here we demonstrate the potential of a parameter estimation algorithm which makes use of synchronization to tune a global atmospheric model at modest computational costs. We first use it to directly optimize internal model parameters. We then apply the algorithm to the weights of each member of a supermodel ensemble to optimize the overall predictions. In both cases, the algorithm is able to find parameters which result in reduced errors in the climatology of the model. Finally, we introduce a novel approach which combines both methods called adaptive supermodeling, where the internal parameters of the members of a supermodel are tuned simultaneously with the model weights such that the supermodel predictions are optimized. For a case designed to challenge the two previous methods, adaptive supermodeling achieves a performance similar to a perfect model.</description>

      <title>PACER: Physics Informed and Uncertainty Aware Climate Emulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21657v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Physics based numerical climate models serve as critical tools for evaluating the effects of climate change and projecting future climate scenarios. However, the reliance on numerical simulations of physical equations renders them computationally intensive and inefficient. While deep learning methodologies have made significant progress in weather forecasting, they are still unstable for longer roll-out climate emulation task. Here, we propose PACER, a relatively lightweight 2.1M parameter Physics Informed Uncertainty Aware Climate EmulatoR. PACER is trained across is trained across varying spatial resolutions and physics based climate models, enabling faithful and stable emulation of temperature fields at multiple surface levels over a 10 year horizon. We propose an auto-regressive ODE-SDE framework for climate emulation that integrates the fundamental physical law of advection, while being trained under a negative log-likelihood objective to enable principled uncertainty quantification of stochastic variability. We show PACER's emulation performance across 20 climate models outperforming relevant baselines and advancing towards explicit physics infusion in ML emulator.</description>
