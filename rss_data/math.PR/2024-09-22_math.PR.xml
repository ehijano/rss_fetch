      <description>arXiv:2409.13046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In his 1996 paper, Talagrand highlighted that the Law of Large Numbers (LLN) for independent random variables can be viewed as a geometric property of multidimensional product spaces. This phenomenon is known as the concentration of measure. To illustrate this profound connection between geometry and probability theory, we consider a seemingly intractable geometric problem in multidimensional Euclidean space and solve it using standard probabilistic tools such as the LLN and the Central Limit Theorem (CLT).</description>

      <title>Harmonic analysis of Mandelbrot cascades -- in the context of vector-valued martingales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We solve a long-standing open problem of determining the Fourier dimension of the Mandelbrot canonical cascade measure (MCCM). This problem of significant interest was raised by Mandelbrot in 1976 and reiterated by Kahane in 1993. Specifically, we derive the exact formula for the Fourier dimension of the MCCM for random weights $W$ satisfying the condition $\mathbb{E}[W^t]&lt;\infty$ for all $t&gt;0$. As a corollary, we prove that the MCCM is Salem if and only if the random weight has a specific two-point distribution. In addition, we show that the MCCM is Rajchman with polynomial Fourier decay whenever the random weight satisfies $\mathbb{E}[W^{1+\delta}]&lt;\infty$ for some $\delta&gt;0$. As a consequence, we discover that, in the Biggins-Kyprianou's boundary case, the Fourier dimension of the MCCM exhibits a second order phase transition at the inverse temperature $\beta = 1/2$; we establish the upper Frostman regularity for MCCM; and we obtain a Fourier restriction estimate for MCCM.
  While the precise Fourier dimension formula seems to be a little magical in the realm of cascade theory, it turns out to be fairly natural in the context of vector-valued martingales. Indeed, the vector-valued martingales will play key roles in our new formalism of actions by multiplicative cascades on finitely additive vector measures, which is the major novelty of this paper.</description>

      <title>Variation inequalities for smartingales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A result by N.G. Makarov [Algebra i Analiz, 1989] states that for martingales $(M_n)$ on the torus we have the strict inequality \[ \liminf_{n\to\infty} \frac{M_n}{\sum_{k=1}^n |\Delta M_k|} &gt; 0 \] on a set of Hausdorff dimension one, denoting by $\Delta M_n$ the martingale differences $ \Delta M_n = M_n - M_{n-1} $. We discuss an extension of this inequality to so-called smartingales on convex, compact subsets of $\mathbb R^d$, which are piecewise polynomial (or spline) versions of martingales. As a tool we need and prove an estimate for smartingales in the spirit of the law of the iterated logarithm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study macroscopic observables of large random matrices introduced by Pennington and Worah, defined by applying entry wise a non linear function on a product of matrices with independent entries. We allow the variance of the entries of the matrices to vary from entry to entry. We complement P\'ech\'e perspective from [Electron. Commun. Probab. 24 (2019)] showing a decomposition of these matrices whose and traffic asymptotic traffic-equivalent for their ingredients, when the activation function belongs to the space of odd polynomials. This give a new interpretation of the linear plus chaos phenomenon observed for these matrices.</description>

      <title>Fourier dimension of Mandelbrot multiplicative cascades</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the Fourier dimension, $\dim_F\mu$, of Mandelbrot multiplicative cascade measures $\mu$ on the $d$-dimensional unit cube. We show that if $\mu$ is the cascade measure generated by a sub-Gaussian random variable then \[\dim_F\mu=\min\{2,\dim_2\mu\}\,,\] where $\dim_2\mu$ is the correlation dimension of $\mu$ and it has an explicit formula.
  For cascades on the circle $S\subset\mathbb{R}^2$, we obtain \[\dim_F\mu\ge\frac{\dim_2\mu}{2+\dim_2\mu}\,.\]</description>

      <title>On the uniqueness of solutions to quadratic BSDEs with non-convex generators and unbounded terminal conditions: the certain exponential moment case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the terminal value $|\xi|$ admitting some given exponential moment, we put forward and prove several existence and uniqueness results for the unbounded solutions of quadratic backward stochastic differential equations whose generators may be represented as a uniformly continuous (not necessarily locally Lipschitz continuous) perturbation of some convex (concave) function with quadratic growth. These results generalize those posed in \cite{Delbaen 2011} and \cite{Fan-Hu-Tang 2020} to some extent. The critical case is also tackled, which strengthens the main result of \cite{Delbaen 2015}.</description>

      <title>From Letters to Words and Back: Invertible Coding of Stationary Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider probability measures on infinite sequences over two countable alphabets of a different cardinality. We introduce an invertible mapping between such measures, called the normalized transport, that preserves both stationarity and ergodicity. The normalized transport applies so called self-avoiding codes that generalize comma-separated codes. The normalized transport is also connected to the usual measure transport via underlying asymptotically mean stationary measures. It preserves the ergodic decomposition. The normalized transport arises, for instance, in the problem of successive recurrence times. In particular, we show that successive recurrence times are ergodic for an ergodic measure, which solves an open problem that generalizes a result by Chen Moy from 1959.</description>

      <title>Sharp supremum and H\"older bounds for stochastic integrals indexed by a parameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide sharp bounds for the supremum of countably many stochastic convolutions taking values in a 2-smooth Banach space. As a consequence, we obtain sharp bounds on the modulus of continuity of a family of stochastic integrals indexed by parameter $x\in M$, where $M$ is a metric space with finite doubling dimension. In particular, we obtain a theory of stochastic integration in H\"older spaces on arbitrary bounded subsets of $\mathbb{R}^d$. This is done by relating the (generalized) H\"older-seminorm associated with a modulus of continuity to a supremum over countably many variables, using a Kolmogorov-type chaining argument. We provide two applications of our results: first, we show long-term bounds for Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes, and second, we derive novel results regarding the modulus of continuity of the parabolic Anderson model.</description>

      <title>A generalised spatial branching process with ancestral branching to model the growth of a filamentous fungus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a spatial branching process to model the growth of the mycelial network of a filamentous fungus. In this model, each filament is described by the position of its tip, the trajectory of which is solution to a stochastic differential equation with a drift term which depends on all the other trajectories. Each filament can branch either at its tip or along its length, that is to say at some past position of its tip, at some time- and space-dependent rates. It can stop growing at some rate which also depends on the positions of the other tips. We first construct the measure-valued process corresponding to this dynamics, then we study its large population limit and we characterise the limiting process as the weak solution to a system of partial differential equations.</description>

      <title>Heat modulated affine stochastic volatility models for forward curve dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a function-valued stochastic volatility model designed to capture the continuous-time evolution of forward curves in fixed-income or commodity markets. The dynamics of the (logarithmic) forward curves are defined by a Heath-Jarrow-Morton-Musiela stochastic partial differential equation modulated by an instantaneous volatility process that describes the second-order moment structure of forwards with different time-to-maturity. We propose to model the operator-valued instantaneous covariance by an affine process on the cone of positive trace-class operators with drift given by the Lyapunov operator of the Laplacian. The so defined infinite-rank stochastic volatility model is analytically tractable due to its affine structure and allows to model maturity specific risk and volatility clustering in forward markets. Furthermore, we introduce a numerically feasible spectral Galerkin approximation of the associated operator-valued generalized Riccati equations and study the robustness of the model with respect to finite-rank approximations by providing explicit error bounds on the approximation error.</description>

      <title>Space-Time Statistical Solutions of the Incompressible Euler Equations and Landau-Lifshitz Fluctuating Hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study rigorously the infinite Reynolds limit of the solutions of the Landau-Lifschitz equations of fluctuating hydrodynamics for an incompressible fluid on a $d$-dimensional torus for $d\geq 2.$ These equations, which model the effects of thermal fluctuations in fluids, are given a standard physical interpretation as a low-wavenumber ``effective field theory'', rather than as stochastic partial differential equations. We study in particular solutions which enjoy some a priori Besov regularity in space, as expected for initial data chosen from a driven, turbulent steady-state ensemble. The empirical basis for this regularity hypothesis, uniform in Reynolds number, is carefully discussed, including evidence from numerical simulations of turbulent flows that incorporate thermal fluctuations. Considering the initial-value problem for the Landau-Lifschitz equations, our main result is that the infinite Reynolds number limit is a space-time statistical solution of the incompressible Euler equations in the sense of Vishik \&amp; Fursikov. Such solutions are described by a probability measure on space-time velocity fields whose realizations are weak or distributional solutions of the incompressible Euler equations, each with the same prescribed initial data. In conjunction with recent numerical evidence that these probability measures are non-trivial, our theorem shows that the mathematical non-uniqueness of the solutions of the Cauchy problem for Euler, as revealed by convex integration studies, may be physically realized. In support of the theory of spontaneous stochasticity, any persistent randomness in the infinite-Reynolds limit is associated to a nontrivial probability distribution over non-unique solutions of the ideal Euler equations.</description>

      <title>Weak convergence of particle swarm optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:1811.04924v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Particle swarm optimization algorithm is a stochastic meta-heuristic solving global optimization problems appreciated for its efficacity and simplicity. It consists in a swarm of particles interacting among themselves and searching the global optimum. The trajectory of the particles has been well-studied in a deterministic case and more recently in a stochastic context. Assuming the convergence of PSO, we proposed here two CLT for the particles corresponding to two kinds of convergence behavior. These results can lead to build confidence intervals around the local minimum found by the swarm or to the evaluation of the risk. A simulation study confirms these properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2205.14446v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a general method to study the Fisher information distance in central limit theorem for nonlinear statistics. We first construct completely new representations for the score function. We then use these representations to derive quantitative estimates for the Fisher information distance. To illustrate the applicability of our approach, explicit rates of Fisher information convergence for quadratic forms and the functions of sample means are provided. For the sums of independent random variables, we obtain the Fisher information bounds without requiring the finiteness of Poincar\'e constant. Our method can also be used to bound the Fisher information distance in non-central limit theorems.</description>

Abstract: We survey the application of Parisi-Wu's stochastic quantization to the construction of random fields under sublinear expectation framework. In particular, we derive the unique mild solution to the robust Langevin dynamics of bosonic free field -- a parabolic linear stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) driven by cylindrical $G$-Brownian motions, using the infinite dimensional $G$-Ornstein Uhlenbeck process. Mimicking the linear expectation case, we show the equilibrium distribution of the solution is the sublinear expectation analog of the massive Gaussian free field.</description>

      <title>Causal Identification for Complex Functional Longitudinal Studies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.12525v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Real-time monitoring in modern medical research introduces functional longitudinal data, characterized by continuous-time measurements of outcomes, treatments, and confounders. This complexity leads to uncountably infinite treatment-confounder feedbacks, which traditional causal inference methodologies cannot handle. Inspired by the coarsened data framework, we adopt stochastic process theory, measure theory, and net convergence to propose a nonparametric causal identification framework. This framework generalizes classical g-computation, inverse probability weighting, and doubly robust formulas, accommodating time-varying outcomes subject to mortality and censoring for functional longitudinal data. We examine our framework through Monte Carlo simulations. Our approach addresses significant gaps in current methodologies, providing a solution for functional longitudinal data and paving the way for future estimation work in this domain.</description>

Abstract: We define and study Poissonian actions of Polish groups as a framework to Poisson suspensions, characterize them spectrally, and provide a complete characterization of their ergodicity. We further construct 'spatial' Poissonian actions, answering partially a question of Glasner, Tsirelson &amp; Weiss about L\'evy groups. We also construct for every diffeomorphism group an ergodic free spatial probability preserving actions. This constitutes a new class of Polish groups admitting non-essentially countable orbit equivalence relations, obtaining progress on a problem of Kechris.</description>

      <title>The number of random 2-SAT solutions is asymptotically log-normal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03302v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that throughout the satisfiable phase, the logarithm of the number of satisfying assignments of a random 2-SAT formula satisfies a central limit theorem. This implies that the log of the number of satisfying assignments exhibits fluctuations of order $\sqrt n$, with $n$ the number of variables. The formula for the variance can be evaluated effectively. By contrast, for numerous other random constraint satisfaction problems the typical fluctuations of the logarithm of the number of solutions are {\em bounded} throughout all or most of the satisfiable regime.</description>

      <title>A Trek Rule for the Lyapunov Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21223v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Lyapunov equation is a linear matrix equation characterizing the cross-sectional steady-state covariance matrix of a Gaussian Markov process. We show a new version of the trek rule for this equation, which links the graphical structure of the drift of the process to the entries of the steady-state covariance matrix. In general, the trek rule is a power series expansion of the covariance matrix, though for acyclic models it simplifies to a polynomial in the off-diagonal entries of the drift matrix. Using the trek rule we can give relatively explicit formulas for the entries of the covariance matrix for some special cases of the drift matrix. These results illustrate notable differences between covariance models entailed by the Lyapunov equation and those entailed by linear additive noise models. To further explore differences and similarities between these two model classes, we use the trek rule to derive a new lower bound for the marginal variances in the acyclic case. This sheds light on the phenomenon, well known for the linear additive noise model, that the variances in the acyclic case tend to increase along a topological ordering of the variables.</description>

      <title>Multidimensional local limit theorem in deterministic systems and an application to non-convergence of polynomial multiple averages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05087v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that for every ergodic and aperiodic probability preserving system $(X,\mathcal{B},m,T)$, there exists $f:X\to \mathbb{Z}^d$, whose corresponding cocycle satisfies the $d$-dimensional local central limit theorem.
  We use the $2$-dimensional result to resolve a question of Huang, Shao and Ye and Franzikinakis and Host regarding non-convergence in $L^2$ of polynomial multiple averages of non-commuting zero entropy transformations. Our methods also give the first examples of failure of multiple recurrence for zero entropy transformations along polynomial iterates.</description>
