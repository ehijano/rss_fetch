      <title>Deterministic approximate counting of colorings with fewer than $2\Delta$ colors via absence of zeros</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\Delta,q\geq 3$ be integers. We prove that there exists $\eta\geq 0.002$ such that if $q\geq (2-\eta)\Delta$, then there exists an open set $\mathcal{U}\subset \mathbb{C}$ that contains the interval $[0,1]$ such that for each $w\in \mathcal{U}$ and any graph $G=(V,E)$ of maximum degree at most $\Delta$, the partition function of the anti-ferromagnetic $q$-state Potts model evaluated at $w$ does not vanish. This provides a (modest) improvement on a result of Liu, Sinclair, and Srivastava, and breaks the $q=2\Delta$-barrier for this problem.
  As a direct consequence we obtain via Barvinok's interpolation method a deterministic polynomial time algorithm to approximate the number of proper $q$-colorings of graphs of maximum degree at most $\Delta$, provided $q\geq (2-\eta)\Delta$.</description>

      <title>A simple quadratic kernel for Token Jumping on surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problem \textsc{Token Jumping} asks whether, given a graph $G$ and two independent sets of \emph{tokens} $I$ and $J$ of $G$, we can transform $I$ into $J$ by changing the position of a single token in each step and having an independent set of tokens throughout. We show that there is a polynomial-time algorithm that, given an instance of \textsc{Token Jumping}, computes an equivalent instance of size $O(g^2 + gk + k^2)$, where $g$ is the genus of the input graph and $k$ is the size of the independent sets.</description>

      <title>Locally Private Histograms in All Privacy Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Frequency estimation, a.k.a. histograms, is a workhorse of data analysis, and as such has been thoroughly studied under differentially privacy. In particular, computing histograms in the local model of privacy has been the focus of a fruitful recent line of work, and various algorithms have been proposed, achieving the order-optimal $\ell_\infty$ error in the high-privacy (small $\varepsilon$) regime while balancing other considerations such as time- and communication-efficiency. However, to the best of our knowledge, the picture is much less clear when it comes to the medium- or low-privacy regime (large $\varepsilon$), despite its increased relevance in practice. In this paper, we investigate locally private histograms, and the very related distribution learning task, in this medium-to-low privacy regime, and establish near-tight (and somewhat unexpected) bounds on the $\ell_\infty$ error achievable. Our theoretical findings emerge from a novel analysis, which appears to improve bounds across the board for the locally private histogram problem. We back our theoretical findings by an empirical comparison of existing algorithms in all privacy regimes, to assess their typical performance and behaviour beyond the worst-case setting.</description>

      <title>On the Number of Non-equivalent Parameterized Squares in a String</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A string $s$ is called a parameterized square when $s = xy$ for strings $x$, $y$ and $x$ and $y$ are parameterized equivalent. Kociumaka et al. showed the number of parameterized squares, which are non-equivalent in parameterized equivalence, in a string of length $n$ that contains $\sigma$ distinct characters is at most $2 \sigma! n$ [TCS 2016]. In this paper, we show that the maximum number of non-equivalent parameterized squares is less than $\sigma n$, which significantly improves the best-known upper bound by Kociumaka et al.</description>

      <title>Vertex-critical graphs in co-gem-free graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A graph $G$ is $k$-vertex-critical if $\chi(G)=k$ but $\chi(G-v)&lt;k$ for all $v\in V(G)$ and $(G,H)$-free if it contains no induced subgraph isomorphic to $G$ or $H$. We show that there are only finitely many $k$-vertex-critical (co-gem, $H$)-free graphs for all $k$ when $H$ is any graph of order $4$ by showing finiteness in the three remaining open cases, those are the cases when $H$ is $2P_2$, $K_3+P_1$, and $K_4$. For the first two cases we actually prove stronger results when forbidding graphs of order $5$ that contain the graphs of interest as induced subgraphs and employ a novel application of Sperner's Theorem on the number of antichains in a partially ordered set. Our result for $K_4$ uses exhaustive computer search and actually shows the stronger result that every $(\text{co-gem, }K_4)$-free graph is $4$-colourable. Our results imply the existence of simple polynomial-time certifying algorithms to decide the $k$-colourability of (co-gem, $H$)-free graphs for all $k$ and all $H$ of order $4$ by searching the vertex-critical graphs as induced subgraphs.</description>

      <title>Complexity of Anchored Crossing Number and Crossing Number of Almost Planar Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.03490v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we deal with the problem of computing the exact crossing number of almost planar graphs and the closely related problem of computing the exact anchored crossing number of a pair of planar graphs. It was shown by [Cabello and Mohar, 2013] that both problems are NP-hard; although they required an unbounded number of high-degree vertices (in the first problem) or an unbounded number of anchors (in the second problem) to prove their result. Somehow surprisingly, only three vertices of degree greater than 3, or only three anchors, are sufficient to maintain hardness of these problems, as we prove here. The new result also improves the previous result on hardness of joint crossing number on surfaces by [Hlin\v{e}n\'y and Salazar, 2015]. Our result is best possible in the anchored case since the anchored crossing number of a pair of planar graphs with two anchors each is trivial, and close to being best possible in the almost planar case since the crossing number is efficiently computable for almost planar graphs of maximum degree 3 [Riskin 1996, Cabello and Mohar 2011].</description>

      <title>Simple Combinatorial Construction of the $k^{o(1)}$-Lower Bound for Approximating the Parameterized $k$-Clique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.07516v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the parameterized $k$-clique problem, or $k$-Clique for short, we are given a graph $G$ and a parameter $k\ge 1$. The goal is to decide whether there exist $k$ vertices in $G$ that induce a complete subgraph (i.e., a $k$-clique). This problem plays a central role in the theory of parameterized intractability as one of the first W[1]-complete problems. Existing research has shown that even an FPT-approximation algorithm for $k$-Clique with arbitrary ratio does not exist, assuming the Gap-Exponential-Time Hypothesis (Gap-ETH) [Chalermsook et al., FOCS'17 and SICOMP]. However, whether this inapproximability result can be based on the standard assumption of $\mathrm{W} 1\ne \mathrm{FPT}$ remains unclear. The recent breakthrough of Bingkai Lin [STOC'21] and subsequent works by Karthik C.S. and Khot [CCC'22], and by Lin, Ren, Sun Wang [ICALP'22] give a technique that bypasses Gap-ETH, thus leading to the inapproximability ratio of $O(1)$ and $k^{o(1)}$ under $\mathrm{W}[1]$-hardness (the first two) and ETH (for the latter one). All the work along this line follows the framework developed by Lin, which starts from the $k$-vector-sum problem and requires some involved algebraic techniques.
  This paper presents an alternative framework for proving the W[1]-hardness of the $k^{o(1)}$-FPT-inapproximability of $k$-Clique. Using this framework, we obtain a gap-producing self-reduction of $k$-Clique without any intermediate algebraic problem. More precisely, we reduce from $(k,k-1)$-Gap Clique to $(q^k, q^{k-1})$-Gap Clique, for any function $q$ depending only on the parameter $k$, thus implying the $k^{o(1)}$-inapproximability result when $q$ is sufficiently large. Our proof is relatively simple and mostly combinatorial. At the core of our construction is a novel encoding of $k$-element subset stemming from the theory of "network coding" and a "Sidon set" representation of a graph.</description>
