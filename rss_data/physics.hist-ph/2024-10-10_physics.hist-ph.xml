      <title>How do we Observe Relational Observables?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In theories with a diffeomorphism symmetry, such as general relativity and canonical quantum gravity, it is often proposed that the empirical content is encoded in relational observables. But how do relational observables actually make contact with experience? I argue that this question can only be answered by providing a schematization of the observer which is appropriate for the context of a diffeomorphism-invariant theory. I suggest that this may require us to move away from a `passive awareness' conception of consciousness towards a more agential conception, because there is a clear sense in which an embodied agent must experience herself as localised at a time. Finally, I consider what this means for the prospects of using quantum reference frames to address the problem of time, arguing that the way in which quantum reference frames are standardly described does not give us adequate resources to model agency, so some other kind of internal reference frame may be required to fully explain how we observe relational observables in the quantum context.</description>

      <title>Distribution can be Dropped: Reply to Rumfitt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most believe that there are no empirical grounds that make the adoption of quantum logic necessary. Ian Rumfitt has further argued that this adoption is not possible, either, for the proof that distribution fails in quantum mechanics is rule-circular or unsound. I respond to Rumfitt, by showing that neither is the case: rule-circularity disappears when an appropriate semantics is considered, and soundness is restored by slightly modifying standard quantum mechanics. Thus, albeit this is indeed not necessary, it is however possible for a quantum logician to rationally adjudicate against classical logic.</description>

      <title>Information-theoretic description of a feedback-control Kuramoto model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02221v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semantic Information Theory (SIT) offers a new approach to evaluating the information architecture of complex systems. In this study we describe the steps required to {\it operationalize} SIT via its application to dynamical problems. Our road map has four steps: (1) separating the dynamical system into agent-environment sub-systems; (2) choosing an appropriate coarse graining and quantifying correlations; (3) identifying a measure of viability; (4) implementing a scrambling protocol and measuring the semantic content. We apply the road map to a model inspired by the neural dynamics of epileptic seizures whereby an agent (a control process) attempts to maintain an environment (a base process) in a desynchronized state. The synchronization dynamics is studied through the well-known Kuramoto model of phase synchronization. Our application of SIT to this problem reveals new features of both semantic information and the Kuramoto model. For the latter we find articulating the correlational structure for agent and environment(the oscillators), allows us to cast the model in in a novel computational (information theoretic) perspective, where the agent-environment dynamics can be thought of as analyzing a communication channel. For the former we find that all the information in our system is semantic. This is in contrast to previous SIT studies of foragers in which semantic thresholds where seen above which no further semantic content was obtained.</description>

      <title>Bell vs Bell: a ding-dong battle over quantum incompleteness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19426v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Does determinism (or even the incompleteness of quantum mechanics) follow from locality and perfect correlations? In a 1964 paper John Bell gave the first demonstration that quantum mechanics is incompatible with local hidden variables. Since then a vigorous debate has rung out over whether he relied on an assumption of determinism or instead, as he later claimed in a 1981 paper, derived determinism from assumptions of locality and perfect correlation. This paper aims to bring clarity to the debate via simple examples and rigorous results. It is first recalled, via quantum and classical counterexamples, that the weakest statistical form of locality consistent with Bell's 1964 paper (parameter independence) is insufficient for the derivation of determinism. Attention is then turned to critically assess Bell's appealing to the Einstein-Rosen-Podolsky (EPR) incompleteness argument to support his claim. It is shown this argument is itself incomplete, via counterexamples that expose two logical gaps. Closing these gaps via a strong "counterfactual" reality criterion enables a rigorous derivation of both determinism and parameter independence, and in this sense justifies Bell's claim. Conversely, however, it is noted that whereas the EPR argument requires a weaker "measurement choice" assumption than Bell's demonstration, it nevertheless leads to a similar incompatibility with quantum predictions rather than to quantum incompleteness.</description>

      <title>Where are the bits in atoms? A perspective on the physical origin and evolutionary nature of information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09567v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This manuscript proposes a conceptual hypothesis regarding the ontology of information, which can serve as a foundation for future empirical exploration and theoretical development. Starting from the premise that information consists of a structural pattern of matter and analysing the current understanding of the evolution of structures and complexity in the universe, we propose to redefine information as a physical structure capable of evolving and driving complexity across multiple layers of self-organization - biological, cultural, civilizational, and cybernetic. The perspective highlights how information structures replicate, vary, and evolve across different domains, speculating on the emergence of a cybernetic layer where machines could evolve autonomously. This interdisciplinary framework challenges traditional views of information and encourages further research into its role in shaping the structures of the universe, offering a new perspective on the evolution of complexity across both natural and artificial systems.</description>
