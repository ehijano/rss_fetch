      <title>Eikonal 2.0: General Solutions for Modified Eikonal Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We find implicit general solutions for modified eikonal equations $u_a u_a=F(u_t)$, where lower indices at dependent variables designate derivatives, $a=1,2,..,n$, and summation is implied over the repeated indices. We will consider the general solutions and symmetries of these equations.</description>

      <title>Formal Languages and TQFTs with Defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A construction that assigns a Boolean 1D TQFT with defects to a finite state automaton was recently developed by Gustafson, Im, Kaldawy, Khovanov, and Lihn. We show that the construction is functorial with respect to the category of finite state automata with transducers as morphisms. Certain classes of subregular languages correspond to additional cohomological structures on the associated TQFTs. We also show that the construction generalizes to context-free grammars through a categorical version of the Chomsky-Sch\"utzenberger representation theorem, due to Melli\`es and Zeilberger. The corresponding TQFTs are then described as morphisms of colored operads on an operad of cobordisms with defects.</description>

      <title>On the Ergodicity of Renormalized Translation-Invariant Nelson-Type Semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a simple functional integration based proof that the semigroups generated by the ultraviolet-renormalized translation-invariant non- and semi-relativistic Nelson Hamiltonians are positivity improving (and hence ergodic) with respect to the Fr\"ohlich cone for arbitrary values of the total momentum. Our argument simplifies known proofs for ergodicity and the result is new in the semi-relativistic case.</description>

      <title>Spectral analysis of metamaterials in curved manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Negative-index metamaterials possess a negative refractive index and thus present an interesting substance for designing uncommon optical effects such as invisibility cloaking. This paper deals with operators encountered in an operator-theoretic description of metamaterials. First, we introduce an indefinite Laplacian and consider it on a compact tubular neighbourhood in constantly curved compact two-dimensional Riemannian ambient manifolds, with Euclidean rectangle in $\mathbb{R}^2$ being present as a special case. As this operator is not semi-bounded, standard form-theoretic methods cannot be applied. We show that this operator is (essentially) self-adjoint via separation of variables and find its spectral characteristics. We also provide a new method for obtaining alternative definition of the self-adjoint operator in non-critical case via a generalized form representation theorem. The main motivation is existence of essential spectrum in bounded domains.</description>

      <title>Quantum Indeterminacy and Polar Duality: a Probabilistic Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a probabilistic argument supporting the application of polar duality, as discussed in our previous work, to express the indeterminacy principle of quantum mechanics. Our approach combines the properties of the Mahler volume of a convex body with the Donoho--Stark uncertainty principle from harmonic analysis, which characterizes the concentration of a function and its Fourier transform. The central result demonstrates that the sum of the probabilities of position concentration near a convex body and momentum concentration near its polar dual is equal to one, with an error term that diminishes rapidly as the number of degrees of freedom increases. This result motivates the interpretation of polar duality as a kind of geometric Fourier transform.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We point out that the non-trivial function obtained by Ferrari and Liu for the persistence probability of the Airy$_1$ process has a strikingly similar form as a large deviation function found earlier by the author for current fluctuations of the totally asymmetric exclusion process with periodic boundaries conditioned on flat initial and final states. A proposed explanation for this observation, which relates similar yet clearly distinct quantities, is that both results pertain to conditioning on the same kind of rare events where a current larger than typical is maintained throughout the system.</description>

      <title>A 3D lattice defect and efficient computations in topological MBQC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe an efficient, fully fault-tolerant implementation of Measurement-Based Quantum Computation (MBQC) in the 3D cluster state. The two key novelties are (i) the introduction of a lattice defect in the underlying cluster state and (ii) the use of the Rudolph-Grover rebit encoding. Concretely, (i) allows for a topological implementation of the Hadamard gate, while (ii) does the same for the phase gate. Furthermore, we develop general ideas towards circuit compaction and algorithmic circuit verification, which we implement for the Reed-Muller code used for magic state distillation. Our performance analysis highlights the overall improvements provided by the new methods.</description>

      <title>Critical threshold for weakly interacting log-correlated focusing Gibbs measures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study log-correlated Gibbs measures on the $d$-dimensional torus with weakly interacting focusing quartic potentials whose coupling constants tend to $0$ as we remove regularization. In particular, we exhibit a phase transition for this model by identifying a critical threshold, separating the weakly and strongly coupling regimes; in the weakly coupling regime, we show that the frequency-truncated measures converge to the base Gaussian measure (possibly with a renormalized $L^2$-cutoff), whereas, in the strongly coupling regime, we prove non-convergence of the frequency-truncated measures, even up to a subsequence. Our result answers an open question posed by Brydges and Slade (1996).</description>

      <title>The p-Laplacian: phenomenological modelling of the flow in porous media and CFD simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to discuss several aspects of connections between the p-Laplacian and mathematical models in hydrology. At first we present models of groundwater flow in phreatic aquifers and models of irrigation and drainage that lead to quasilinear parabolic equations involving the p-Laplacian. Next, we survey conditions of validity of Strong Maximum Principle and Strong Comparison Principle for this type of problems. Finally, we employ computer fluid dynamics simulations to realistic scenario of fracture networks to estimate values of the parameters of constitutive laws governing groundwater flow in the context of fractured hard-rock aquifers.</description>

      <title>On the rank of extremal marginal states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\rho_1$ and $\rho_2$ be two states on $\mathbb{C}^{d_1}$ and $\mathbb{C}^{d_2}$ respectively. The marginal state space, denoted by $\mathcal{C}(\rho_1,\rho_2)$, is the set of all states $\rho$ on $\mathbb{C}^{d_1}\otimes \mathbb{C}^{d_2}$ with partial traces $\rho_1, \rho_2$. K. R. Parthasarathy established that if $\rho$ is an extreme point of $\mathcal{C}(\rho_1,\rho_2)$, then the rank of $\rho$ does not exceed $\sqrt{d_1^2+d_2^2-1}$. Rudolph posed a question regarding the tightness of this bound. In 2010, Ohno gave an affirmative answer by providing examples in low-dimensional matrix algebras $\mathbb{M}_3$ and $\mathbb{M}_4$. This article aims to provide a positive answer to the Rudolph question in various matrix algebras. Our approaches, to obtain the extremal marginal states with tight upper bound, are based on Choi-Jamio\l kowski isomorphism and tensor product of extreme points.</description>

      <title>Microcanonical Phase Space and Entropy in Curved Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the structure of microcanonical ensembles in inertial and non-inertial frames attached to a confined system of positive energy particles in curved spacetime. Under certain physically reasonable assumptions that ensure the existence of such ensembles, we derive two generic characteristics of the leading curvature corrections: (1) they are characterized by Ricci and Einstein tensors, and (2) their contribution is proportional to the boundary area of the system. We also obtain exact analytical results for microcanonical ensembles in de Sitter spacetime, which reproduce the perturbative results in the limit $\Lambda \to 0$, but have interesting limits when the size of the system is comparable to ${\Lambda}^{-1/2}$. We give a general argument to highlight two distinct sources of divergences in the phase space volume, coming from redshift and spatial geometry, and illustrate this by comparing and contrasting the results for (i) geodesic box in de Sitter, (ii) geodesic box in Schwarzschild, and (iii) uniformly accelerated box in Minkowski. Finally, we extend these results to $N$ particle systems in the massless (ultra-relativistic) limit for certain restricted class of spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Tensor Product CFTs and One-Character Extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study one-character CFTs obtained as one-character extensions of the tensor products of a single CFT $\mathcal{C}$. The motivation comes from the fact that $28$ of the $71$ CFTs in the Schelleken's list of $c = 24$ CFTs are such CFTs. We study for $\mathcal{C}$ : (i) any two-character WZW CFT with vanishing Wronskian index, (ii) the Ising CFT, (iii) the infinite class of $D_{r,1}$ CFTs and the $A_{4,1}$ CFT. The characters being $S$-invariant homogenous polynomials of the characters of $\mathcal{C}$, when organised in terms of a $S$-invariant basis, take compact forms allowing for closed form answers for high central charges. We find a $S$-invariant basis for each of the CFTs studied. As an example, one can find an explicit expression for the character of the monster CFT as a degree-$48$ polynomial of the characters of the Ising CFT. In some CFTs, some of the $S$-invariant polynomials of characters compute, after using the $q$-series of the characters, to a constant value. Hence, the characters of one-character extensions are more properly elements of the quotient ring of polynomials (of characters) with the ideal needed for the quotient, generated by $S$-invariant polynomials that compute to a constant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lie-Poisson electrodynamics describes the semi-classical limit of non-commutative $U(1)$ gauge theory, characterized by Lie-algebra-type non-commutativity. We focus on the mechanics of a charged point-like particle moving in a given gauge background. First, we derive explicit expressions for gauge-invariant variables representing the particle's position. Second, we provide a detailed formulation of the classical action and the corresponding equations of motion, which recover standard relativistic dynamics in the commutative limit. We illustrate our findings by exploring the exactly solvable Kepler problem in the context of the $\lambda$-Minkowski (or the angular) non-commutativity, along with other examples.</description>

      <title>The Critical 2d Stochastic Heat Flow and Related Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In these lecture notes, we review recent progress in the study of the stochastic heat equation and its discrete analogue, the directed polymer model, in spatial dimension 2. It was discovered that a phase transition emerges on an intermediate disorder scale, with Edwards-Wilkinson (Gaussian) fluctuations in the sub-critical regime. In the critical window, a unique scaling limit has been identified and named the critical 2d stochastic heat flow. This gives a meaning to the solution of the stochastic heat equation in the critical dimension 2, which lies beyond existing solution theories for singular SPDEs. We outline the proof ideas, introduce the key ingredients, and discuss related literature on disordered systems and singular SPDEs. A list of open questions is also provided.</description>

      <title>Navigating string theory field space with geometric flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Swampland Distance Conjecture postulates the emergence of an infinite tower of massless states when approaching infinite-distance points in moduli space. However, most string backgrounds are supported by fluxes, and therefore depart from the purely geometric paradigm. This fact requires an extension of the Swampland conjectures to scalar field spaces with non-trivial potentials, rather than just moduli spaces. To address this task, we utilise geometric flows, in particular generalised Ricci flow, to probe the associated scalar field spaces. Considering internal spaces supported by three-form fluxes, we first show that the distance defined in terms of the Perelman entropy functional needs to be refined in order to encompass fluxes. Doing so, we extend the Ricci Flow Conjecture to include Kalb-Ramond flux besides the metric and the dilaton field. This allows us to probe infinite-distance points within these scalar field spaces in a purely geometric way. We subsequently construct a geometric flow for internal manifolds supported by Ramond-Ramond fluxes and discuss its role in the Ricci Flow Conjecture. Our analysis suggests that in the presence of fluxes the Distance Conjecture might be better characterised in terms of a cost function on the space of metrics, rather than a genuine distance.</description>

Abstract: We study a family of tree-type diagrams that arise in studies of the cumulant expansion in discrete Erd\H os-R\'enyi random matrix models. Using a version of the Pr\" ufer code, we obtain an explicit expression for the number of tree-type diagrams assembled from $k$ oriented chains of $q$ edges. Using this modified Pr\"ufer codification, we get an explicit expression for sum overs weighted tree-type diagrams with a weight depending on multiplicity of edges. We describe similar results for tree-type diagrams assembled from chains that are not necessarily regular.</description>

      <title>$G$-Gaussian random fields and stochastic quantization under nonlinear expectation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.10942v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the application of Parisi-Wu stochastic quantization to the construction of random fields within the sublinear expectation framework. Using the semigroup approach and the infinite dimensional $G$-Ornstein Uhlenbeck process, we derive the unique mild solution to the robust Langevin dynamics of bosonic free field -- a parabolic linear stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) driven by cylindrical $G$-Brownian motions. Mimicking the linear expectation case, we show the equilibrium distribution of the mild solution is the sublinear expectation analog of the massive Gaussian free field.</description>

      <title>Exact quantization of nonreciprocal quasi-lumped electrical networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09120v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Following a consistent geometrical description previously introduced in Parra-Rodriguez et al. (2024), we present an exact method for obtaining canonically quantizable Hamiltonian descriptions of nonlinear, nonreciprocal quasi-lumped electrical networks. We identify and classify singularities arising in the quest for Hamiltonian descriptions of general quasi-lumped element networks via the Faddeev-Jackiw technique. We offer systematic solutions to cases previously considered singular--a major challenge in the context of canonical circuit quantization. The solution relies on the correct identification of the reduced classical circuit-state manifold, i.e., a mix of flux and charge fields and functions. Starting from the geometrical description of the transmission line, we provide a complete program including lines coupled to one-port lumped-element networks, as well as multiple lines connected to multiport nonreciprocal lumped-element networks, with intrinsic ultraviolet cutoff. On the way we naturally extend the canonical quantization of transmission lines coupled through frequency-dependent, nonreciprocal linear systems, such as practical circulators. Additionally, we demonstrate how our method seamlessly facilitates the characterization of general nonreciprocal, dissipative linear environments. This is achieved by extending the Caldeira-Leggett formalism, using continuous limits of series of immittance matrices. We provide a tool in the analysis and design of electrical circuits and of special interest in the context of canonical quantization of superconducting networks. For instance, this work will provide a solid ground for a precise non-divergent input-output theory in the presence of nonreciprocal devices, e.g., within (chiral) waveguide QED platforms.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Reversibility and A New Theory of Causal Emergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15054v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The theory of causal emergence (CE) with effective information (EI) posits that complex systems can exhibit CE, where macro-dynamics show stronger causal effects than micro-dynamics. A key challenge of this theory is its dependence on coarse-graining method. {In this paper, we introduce a fresh concept of approximate dynamical reversibility and establish a novel framework for CE based on this. By applying singular value decomposition(SVD) to Markov dynamics, we find that the essence of CE lies in the presence of redundancy, represented by the irreversible and correlated information pathways. Therefore, CE can be quantified as the potential maximal efficiency increase for dynamical reversibility or information transmission. We also demonstrate a strong correlation between the approximate dynamical reversibility and EI, establishing an equivalence between the SVD and EI maximization frameworks for quantifying CE, supported by theoretical insights and numerical examples from Boolean networks, cellular automata, and complex networks. Importantly, our SVD-based CE framework is independent of specific coarse-graining techniques and effectively captures the fundamental characteristics of the dynamics.</description>

      <title>Solutions of tetrahedron equation from quantum cluster algebra associated with symmetric butterfly quiver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08814v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a new solution to the tetrahedron equation by further pursuing the quantum cluster algebra approach in our previous works. The key ingredients include a symmetric butterfly quiver attached to the wiring diagrams for the longest element of type $A$ Weyl groups and the implementation of quantum $Y$-variables through the $q$-Weyl algebra. The solution consists of four products of quantum dilogarithms, incorporating a total of seven parameters. By exploring both the coordinate and momentum representations, along with their modular double counterparts, our solution encompasses various known three-dimensional (3D) $R$-matrices. These include those obtained by Kapranov-Voevodsky ('94) utilizing the quantized coordinate ring, Bazhanov-Mangazeev-Sergeev ('10) from a quantum geometry perspective, Kuniba-Matsuike-Yoneyama ('23) linked with the quantized six-vertex model, and Inoue-Kuniba-Terashima ('23) associated with the Fock-Goncharov quiver. The 3D $R$-matrix presented in this paper offers a unified perspective on these existing solutions, coalescing them within the framework of quantum cluster algebra.</description>

      <title>The Edge of Random Tensor Eigenvalues with Deviation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07731v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The largest eigenvalue of random tensors is an important feature of systems involving disorder, equivalent to the ground state energy of glassy systems or to the injective norm of quantum states. For symmetric Gaussian random tensors of order 3 and of size $N$, in the presence of a Gaussian noise, continuing the work [arXiv:2310.14589], we compute the genuine and signed eigenvalue distributions, using field theoretic methods at large $N$ combined with earlier rigorous results of [arXiv:1003.1129]. We characterize the behaviour of the edge of the two distributions as the variance of the noise increases. We find two critical values of the variance, the first of which corresponding to the emergence of an outlier from the main part of the spectrum and the second where this outlier merges with the corresponding largest eigenvalue and they both become complex. We support our claims with Monte Carlo simulations. We believe that our results set the ground for a definition of pseudospectrum of random tensors based on $Z$-eigenvalues.</description>

      <title>Parameter inference and nonequilibrium identification for Markovian systems based on coarse-grained observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19586v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most experiments can only detect a set of coarse-grained clusters of a molecular system, while the internal microstates are often inaccessible. Here, based on an infinitely long coarse-grained trajectory, we obtain a set of sufficient statistics which extracts all statistic information of coarse-grained observations. Based on these sufficient statistics, we set up a theoretical framework of parameter inference and nonequilibrium identification for a general Markovian system with an arbitrary number of microstates and arbitrary coarse-grained partitioning. Our framework can identify whether the sufficient statistics are enough for empirical estimation of all unknown parameters and we can also provide a quantitative criterion that reveals nonequilibrium. Our nonequilibrium criterion generalizes the one obtained [J. Chem. Phys. 132:041102 (2010)] for a three-state system with two coarse-grained clusters, and is capable of detecting a larger nonequilibrium region compared to the classical criterion based on autocorrelation functions.</description>

      <title>Critical reassessment of the restricted Weyl symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02763v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A class of globally scale-invariant scalar-tensor theories have been proposed to be invariant under a larger class of transformations that take the form of local Weyl transformations supplemented by a restriction that the conformal factor satisfies a covariant Klein-Gordon equation. The action of these theories indeed seems to be invariant under such transformations up to boundary terms, this property being referred to as ``restricted Weyl symmetry''. However, we find that corresponding equations of motion are not invariant under these transformations. This is a paradox, that is explained by realizing that the restriction condition on the conformal factor forces the restricted Weyl transformation to be a nonlocal transformation. For nonlocal transformations would-be boundary terms cannot in general be discarded from the action. Moreover, variations of trajectories cannot be assumed to vanish at boundaries of the action when deriving equations of motion. We illustrate both of these less known properties by considering a series of simple examples. Finally, we apply these observations to the case of globally scale-invariant scalar-tensor theories to demonstrate that restricted Weyl transformations are, in fact, not symmetries of the full system.</description>

Abstract: This letter presents new nontrivial stochastic identities for random isotropic second rank tensor fields. They can be considered as markers of statistical isotropy in turbulent flows of any nature. The case of axial symmetry is also considered. We confirm the validity of the identities using different direct numerical simulations of turbulent flows.</description>

      <title>Operator algebra and algorithmic construction of boundaries and defects in (2+1)D topological Pauli stabilizer codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11942v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a computational algorithm for constructing all boundaries and defects of topological generalized Pauli stabilizer codes in two spatial dimensions. Utilizing the operator algebra formalism, we establish a one-to-one correspondence between the topological data-such as anyon types, fusion rules, topological spins, and braiding statistics-of (2+1)D bulk stabilizer codes and (1+1)D boundary anomalous subsystem codes. To make the operator algebra computationally accessible, we adapt Laurent polynomials and convert the tasks into matrix operations, e.g., the Hermite normal form for obtaining boundary anyons and the Smith normal form for determining fusion rules. This approach enables computers to automatically generate all possible gapped boundaries and defects for topological Pauli stabilizer codes through boundary anyon condensation and topological order completion. This streamlines the analysis of surface codes and associated logical operations for fault-tolerant quantum computation. Our algorithm applies to $Z_d$ qudits, including both prime and nonprime $d$, thus enabling the exploration of topological quantum codes beyond toric codes. We have applied the algorithm and explicitly demonstrated the lattice constructions of 2 boundaries and 6 defects in the $Z_2$ toric code, 3 boundaries and 22 defects in the $Z_4$ toric code, 1 boundary and 2 defects in the double semion code, 1 boundary and 22 defects in the six-semion code, 6 boundaries and 270 defects in the color code, and 6 defects in the anomalous three-fermion code. In addition, we investigate the boundaries of two specific bivariate bicycle codes within a family of low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. We demonstrate that their topological orders are equivalent to 8 and 10 copies of $Z_2$ toric codes, with anyons restricted to move by 12 and 1023 lattice sites in the square lattice, respectively.</description>

      <title>Continuous symmetry entails the Jordan algebra structure of quantum theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19672v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symmetry postulates play a crucial role in various approaches to reconstruct quantum theory from a few basic principles. Discrete and continuous symmetries are under consideration. The continuous case better matches the physical needs for mathematical models of dynamical processes and is studied here. Applying the representation theory of the orthomodular lattices, we show that the continuous symmetry, together with three further requirements, entails that the underlying mathematical structure of a finite-dimensional generalized probabilistic theory becomes a simple Euclidean Jordan algebra. The further requirements are: spectrality, a strong state space and a condition called gbit property.</description>
