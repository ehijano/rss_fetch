      <title>Distinguishing Strong from Weak Signals in Economic Forecasts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the information embedded in forecasts by examining the moments of subjective probability distributions. Specifically, we propose that a forecast conveys a strong upward signal when the median exceeds a target, such as a central bank's 2% inflation threshold, coupled with positive skewness. Conversely, a median below the target with negative skewness signals strong downward expectations. In cases where the median and skewness diverge, the signal weakens, indicating mixed expectations. To formalize these insights, we develop a Signal Strength Indicator (SSI) that quantifies the consistency and directional alignment of forecast signals, assessing its predictive power within a Growth-at-Risk framework. Importantly, the SSI can be estimated without relying on parametric assumptions. Our findings indicate that the SSI offers valuable insights, suggesting it could serve as a practical tool for central banks to monitor expectations in real time.</description>

      <title>Can ESG Investment and the Implementation of the New Environmental Protection Law Enhance Public Subjective Well-being?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Air pollution has emerged as a serious challenge for China, posing a threat to public health and hindering the progress of sustainable economic development. In response to air pollution and other environmental issues, the Chinese government introduced a new Environmental Protection Law in 2015. This paper investigates the impact of the new Environmental Protection Law's implementation and corporate Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) investments on air pollution and public subjective well-being. Using panel data at the macro level, we employ a difference-in-differences (DID) model, with Chinese provinces and municipalities as units of analysis, to examine the combined effects of the new Environmental Protection Law and changes in corporate ESG investment intensity. The study evaluates their impacts on air quality and public subjective well-being. Findings indicate that these policies and investment behaviors significantly improve public subjective well-being by reducing air pollution. Notably, an increase in ESG investment significantly reduces air pollution levels and is positively associated with enhanced well-being. These results underscore the critical role of environmental legislation and corporate social responsibility in improving public quality of life and provide empirical support for promoting sustainable development in China and beyond.</description>

      <title>Axiomatic characterizations of some simple risk-sharing rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present axiomatic characterizations of some simple risk-sharing (RS) rules, such as the uniform, the mean-proportional and the covariance-based linear RS rules. These characterizations make it easier to understand the underlying principles when applying these rules. Such principles typically include maintaining some degree of anonymity regarding participants' data and/or incident-specific data, adopting non-punitive processes and ensuring the equitability and fairness of risk sharing. By formalizing key concepts such as the reshuffling property, the source-anonymous contributions property and the strongly aggregate contributions property, along with their generalizations, we develop a comprehensive framework that expresses these principles clearly and defines the relevant rules. To illustrate, we demonstrate that the uniform RS rule, a simple mechanism in which risks are shared equally, is the only RS rule that satisfies both the reshuffling property and the source-anonymous contributions property. This straightforward axiomatic characterization of the uniform RS rule serves as a foundation for exploring similar principles in two broad classes of risk-sharing rules, which we baptize the $q$-proportional RS rules and the $(q_1,q_2)$-based linear RS rules, respectively. This framework also allows us to introduce novel particular RS rules, such as the scenario-based RS rules.</description>

      <title>The labour and resource use requirements of a good life for all</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use multi-regional input-output analysis to calculate the paid labour, energy, emissions, and material use required to provide basic needs for all people. We calculate two different low-consumption scenarios, using the UK as a case study: (1) a "decent living" scenario, which includes only the bare necessities, and (2) a "good life" scenario, which is based on the minimum living standards demanded by UK residents. We compare the resulting footprints to the current footprint of the UK, and to the footprints of the US, China, India, and a global average. Labour footprints are disaggregated by sector, skill level, and region of origin.
  We find that both low-consumption scenarios would still require an unsustainable amount of labour and resources at the global scale. The decent living scenario would require a 26-hour working week, and on a per capita basis, 89 GJ of energy use, 5.9 tonnes of emissions, and 5.7 tonnes of used materials per year. The more socially sustainable good life scenario would require a 53-hour working week, 165 GJ of energy use, 9.9 tonnes of emissions, and 11.5 tonnes of used materials per capita. Both scenarios represent substantial reductions from the UK's current labour footprint of 68 hours per week, which the UK is only able to sustain by importing a substantial portion of its labour from other countries. We conclude that reducing consumption to the level of basic needs is not enough to achieve either social or environmental sustainability. Dramatic improvements in provisioning systems are also required.</description>

      <title>Human game experiment to verify the equilibrium selection controlled by design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conducted a laboratory experiment involving human subjects to test the theoretical hypothesis that equilibrium selection can be impacted by manipulating the games dynamics process, by using modern control theory. Our findings indicate that human behavior consists with the predictions derived from evolutionary game theory paradigm. The consistency is supported by three key observations: (1) the long-term distribution of strategies in the strategy space, (2) the cyclic patterns observed within this space, and (3) the speed of convergence to the selected equilibrium. These findings suggest that the design of controllers aimed at equilibrium selection can indeed achieve their theoretical intended purpose. The location of this study in the knowledge tree of evolutionary game science is presented.</description>

      <title>The Impact of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) on Online Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the impact of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), introduced on May 25th, 2018, on online trackers, vital elements in the online advertising ecosystem. Using a difference-in-differences approach with a balanced panel of 294 publishers, we compare publishers subject to the GDPR with those unaffected (the control group). Drawing on data from WhoTracks.me, which spans 32 months from May 2017 to December 2019, we analyze how the number of trackers used by publishers changed before and after the GDPR. The findings reveal that although online tracking increased for both groups, the rise was less significant for EU-based publishers subject to the GDPR. Specifically, the GDPR reduced about four trackers per publisher, equating to a 14.79% decrease compared to the control group. The GDPR was particularly effective in curbing privacy invasive trackers that collect and share personal data, thereby strengthening user privacy. However, it had a limited impact on advertising trackers and only slightly reduced the presence of analytics trackers.</description>

      <title>NGO Activism: Exposure vs. Influence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the timing of NGO campaigns to shed light on NGOs' objectives and how their strategies evolve over time. Using data from 2,500 campaigns, we find that NGOs are eight times more likely to launch campaigns on Annual General Meeting (AGM) dates. These campaigns increase media exposure and stakeholder scrutiny, raising the likelihood of consumer boycotts and related shareholder proposals at the following AGM of the targeted firm but have no impact on current AGM votes. As NGOs build reputational capital, they adjust their timing to influence AGM outcomes, revealing the trade-offs they face to drive corporate change.</description>

      <title>Forecasting Company Fundamentals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Company fundamentals are key to assessing companies' financial and overall success and stability. Forecasting them is important in multiple fields, including investing and econometrics. While statistical and contemporary machine learning methods have been applied to many time series tasks, there is a lack of comparison of these approaches on this particularly challenging data regime. To this end, we try to bridge this gap and thoroughly evaluate the theoretical properties and practical performance of 22 deterministic and probabilistic company fundamentals forecasting models on real company data. We observe that deep learning models provide superior forcasting performance to classical models, in particular when considering uncertainty estimation. To validate the findings, we compare them to human analyst expectations and find that their accuracy is comparable to the automatic forecasts. We further show how these high-quality forecasts can benefit automated stock allocation. We close by presenting possible ways of integrating domain experts to further improve performance and increase reliability.</description>

      <title>Do Unions Shape Political Ideologies at Work?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.02637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.02637v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Labor unions influence economic outcomes not only through bargaining with employers over work contracts but also via political activities that can profoundly shape political systems. In unionized workplaces, they may mobilize and change the ideological positions of both unionizing workers and their non-unionizing management. In this paper, we analyze the workplace-level impact of unionization on workers' and managers' political campaign contributions in the United States from 1980 to 2016. To do so, we link establishment-level union election data with transaction-level campaign contributions to federal and local candidates. Using a difference-in-differences design, validated through regression discontinuity tests and a novel instrumental variable approach, we find that unionization leads to a leftward shift of campaign contributions. Unionization increases the support for Democrats relative to Republicans not only among workers but also among managers, suggesting that it fosters political alignment between the two groups. Our findings are not driven by compositional changes of the workforce and are stronger in establishments where, after union certification, the employer and union agree on a collective bargaining agreement.</description>

Abstract: Social media influencers account for a growing share of marketing worldwide. We demonstrate the existence of a novel form of market failure in this advertising market: influencer cartels, where groups of influencers collude to increase their advertising revenue by inflating their engagement. Our theoretical model shows that influencer cartels can improve consumer welfare if they expand social media engagement to the target audience, or reduce welfare if they divert engagement to less relevant audiences. Drawing on the model's insights, we empirically examine influencer cartels using novel datasets and machine learning tools, and derive policy implications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04508v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Labor market tightness tremendously increased in Germany between 2012 and 2022. We analyze the effect of tightness on wages by combining social security data with unusually rich information on vacancies and job seekers. Instrumental variable regressions reveal positive elasticities between 0.004 and 0.011, implying that higher tightness explains between 7 and 19 percent of the real wage increase. We report greater elasticities for new hires, high-skilled workers, the Eastern German labor market, and the service sector. In particular, tightness raised wages at the bottom of the wage distribution, contributing to the decline in wage inequality over the last decade.</description>

      <title>Job Loss and Political Entry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23705v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The supply of politicians affects the quality of democratic institutions. Yet little is known about the economic motivations that drive individuals into politics. This paper examines how experiencing a job loss affects individuals' decisions to enter political life and explores its implications for political selection. Using highly granular administrative data linking individual records of political participation with comprehensive employer-employee data for all formal workers in Brazil, and leveraging mass layoffs for causal identification, we find that job loss significantly increases the likelihood of joining a political party and running for local office. Layoff-induced candidates are positively selected on various competence measures, suggesting that economic shocks may improve the quality of political entrants. Further, we observe that the increase in candidacies is more pronounced among laid-off individuals with greater financial incentives from office holding and higher predicted income losses. Finally, using a regression discontinuity design, we find that eligibility for unemployment benefits increases the likelihood of becoming a party member and running for local office. These results are consistent with the reduction in private-sector opportunity costs and the increased time resources explaining the rise in political entry.</description>

      <title>A Numerical Assessment for Predicting Human Development Index (HDI) Trends in the GCC Countries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01177v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study focuses on predicting the Human Development Index (HDI) trends for GCC countries Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain, United Arab Emirates, and Omanusing machine learning techniques, specifically the XGBoost algorithm. HDI is a composite measure of life expectancy, education, and income, reflecting overall human development. Data was gathered from official government sources and international databases, including the World Bank and UNDP, covering the period from 1996 to 2022. Using the Edit Distance on Real sequence (EDR) method for feature selection, the model analyzed key indicators to predict HDI values over the next five years (2023-2027). The model demonstrated strong predictive accuracy for in-sample data, but minor overfitting issues were observed with out-of-sample predictions, particularly in the case of the UAE. The forecast results suggest that Kuwait, Bahrain, and the UAE will see stable or slightly increasing HDI values, while Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Oman are likely to experience minimal fluctuations or slight decreases. This study highlights the importance of economic, health, and educational indicators in determining HDI trends and emphasizes the need for region-specific predictive models to improve accuracy. Policymakers should focus on targeted interventions in healthcare, education, and economic diversification to enhance human development outcomes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02085v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper examines how a firm's performance can decline despite consistently implementing successful A/B test innovations -- a phenomenon we term "seesaw experimentation." While these innovations improve the measured primary dimension, they create negative externalities in unmeasured secondary dimensions that exceed the gains. Using a multivariate normal distribution model, we identify the conditions for this decline and propose positive hurdle rates as a solution. Our analysis shows how to set optimal hurdle rates to best mitigate these negative externalities and provides practical guidance for experimental design by demonstrating how these rates should vary with underlying parameters.</description>
