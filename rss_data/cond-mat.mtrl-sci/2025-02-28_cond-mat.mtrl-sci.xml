      <title>The Strain Impact on Weyl Semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weyl semimetals are a class of topological semimetals defined by a Chern number as their topological invariant. These materials exhibit unique properties, such as transverse topological currents and anomalous magnetoelectric responses, making them promising candidates for device applications.This thesis explores the effects of strain on the electronic properties of Weyl semimetals using both toy models and first-principles calculations, specifically density functional theory (DFT) combined with the Wannier method. We investigated the strain effects on two-band tight-binding toy models by tuning their hopping integrals. To connect these models to real materials, we derived a tight-binding Hamiltonian from DFT combined with Wannier functions and analyzed the surface states and density of states under varying strain conditions.
  Our results reveal that both tensile and compressive strains significantly alter the electronic structure of TaAs, potentially inducing topological phase transitions. Specifically, tensile strain along the [100] direction leads to the transformation and eventual disappearance of Fermi arcs, while compressive strain results in the formation of complex surface states, suggesting the emergence of a new phase at higher strain levels.</description>

      <title>Effects of Galactic Irradiation on Thermal and Electronic Transport in Tungsten</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The impact of irradiation on the thermal and electronic properties of materials is a persistent puzzle, particularly defect formation at the atomic and nanoscales. This work examines the nanoscale effects of low-energy irradiation on tungsten (W), focusing on defect-induced modifications to thermal and electronic transport. Using the Site-Projected Thermal Conductivity (SPTC) method [A. Gautam et al. PSS-RRL, 2400306, 2024], we analyze bulk and twin-grain boundary W with vacancy defects based on the Norgett-Robinson-Torrens displacements per atom (NRT-dpa) model. SPTC provides a detailed prediction of post-cascade spatial thermal conductivity distribution. We estimate electronic conductivity activity using the "N2 method" [K. Nepal et al. Carbon, 119711, 2025] to explore the consequences of vacancies and grain boundaries, highlighting the defect-dependent nature of charge transport behavior. These findings offer high-resolution insights into irradiation-driven transport phenomena, with implications for space-exposed materials and nanoscale thermal/electronic management.</description>

      <title>Intercalated structures formed by platinum on epitaxial graphene on SiC(0001)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphene on SiC intercalated with two-dimensional metal layers, such as Pt, offers a versatile platform for applications in spintronics, catalysis, and beyond. Recent studies have demonstrated that Pt atoms can intercalate at the heterointerface between SiC(0001) and the C-rich $(6\sqrt{3}\times6\sqrt{3})$R30{\deg} reconstructed surface (hereafter referred as the buffer layer). However, key aspects such as intercalated phase structure and intercalation mechanisms remain unclear. In this work, we investigate changes in morphology, chemistry, and electronic structure for both buffer layer and monolayer graphene grown on SiC(0001) following Pt deposition and annealing cycles, which eventually led to Pt intercalation at temperatures above 500{\deg}C. Atomic-resolution imaging of the buffer layer reveals a single intercalated Pt layer that removes the periodic corrugation of the buffer layer, arising from partial bonding of C-atoms with Si-atoms of the substrate. In monolayer graphene, the Pt-intercalated regions exhibit a two-level structure: the first level corresponds to a Pt layer intercalated below the buffer layer, while the second level contains a second Pt layer, giving rise to a $(12\times12)$ superstructure relative to graphene. Upon intercalation, Pt atoms appear as silicides, indicating a reaction with Si atoms from the substrate. Additionally, charge neutral $\pi$-bands corresponding to quasi-free-standing monolayer and bilayer graphene emerge. Analysis of multiple samples, coupled with a temperature-dependent study of the intercalation rate, demonstrates the pivotal role of buffer layer regions in facilitating the Pt intercalation in monolayer graphene. These findings provide valuable insight into Pt intercalation, advancing the potential for applications.</description>

      <title>A generalized calculation of the rate independent single crystal yield surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss a method to calculate the topology of the rate independent single crystal yield surface for materials with arbitrary slip systems and arbitrary slip strengths. We describe the general problem, as motivated by Schmid's law, and detail the calculation of hyperplanes in deviatoric stress space, $\mathbb{D}^5$, which describe the criteria for slip on individual slip systems. We focus on finding the intersection of five linearly independent hyperplanes which represent stresses necessary to satisfy the criteria for general plastic deformation. Finally, we describe a method for calculating the inner convex hull of these intersection points, which describe the vertices of the five dimensional polytope that represents the single crystal yield surface. Our method applies to arbitrary crystal structure, allowing for an arbitrary number and type of slip systems and families, considers plastic anisotropy via inter- and intra-family strength anisotropy, and further considers strength anisotropy between slip in the positive and negative direction. We discuss the calculation and possible applications, and share a computational implementation of the calculation of the single crystal yield surface.</description>

      <title>Atomistic insights into solid solution strengthening: size misfit versus stiffness misfit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Used for centuries to enhance mechanical properties of materials, solid solution strengthening (SSS) is a classical metallurgical method in which small amounts of impurity elements are added to a base metal. Developed for dilute alloys, classical theories of SSS are presently challenged by the ongoing explosive development of complex concentrated alloys (CCA) in which all component elements are present in nearly equal fractions. Here we develop a method of computational alchemy in which interatomic interactions are modified to continuously and systematically vary two key parameters defining SSS, atomic size misfit and elastic stiffness misfit, over a maximally wide range of misfit values. The resulting model alloys are subjected to massive Molecular Dynamics simulations reproducing full complexity of plastic strength response in concentrated single-phase body-centered cubic solid solutions. At variance with views prevailing in the literature, our computational experiments show that stiffness misfit can contribute to SSS on par if not more than size misfit. Furthermore, depending on exactly how they are combined, the two misfits can result in synergistic or antagonistic effect on alloy strengthening. In contrast to real CCAs in which every constituent element comes with its specific combination of atomic size and elastic stiffness, our alchemical model alloys sample the space of misfit parameters continuously thus augmenting the much more constrained and inevitably spotty experimental exploration of the CCA design space. Taking advantage of unique to our approach ability to define alloy misfit parameters, our computational study demonstrates how useful insights can be gained from intentionally unrealistic alchemical models. Rather than practical recommendation for alloy design, our computational experiments should be regarded as a proving ground for further SSS theory development.</description>

      <title>First-Principles Framework for the Prediction of Intersystem Crossing Rates in Spin Defects: The Role of Electron Correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optically active spin defects in solids are promising platforms for quantum technologies. Here, we present a first-principles framework to investigate intersystem crossing processes, which represent crucial steps in the optical spin-polarization cycle used to address spin defects. Considering the nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond as a case study, we demonstrate that our framework effectively captures electron correlation effects in the calculation of many-body electronic states and their spin-orbit coupling and electron-phonon interactions, while systematically addressing finite-size effects. We validate our predictions by carrying out measurements of fluorescence lifetimes, finding excellent agreement between theory and experiments. The framework presented here provides a versatile and robust tool for exploring the optical cycle of varied spin defects entirely from first principles.</description>

      <title>Manipulation of topological phase transitions and the mechanism of magnetic interactions in Eu-based Zintl-phase materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Various topological phases, including topological insulators, topological semimetals, and topological superconductors, along with the controllable topological phase transitions, have attracted considerable attention due to their promising applications in spintronics and quantum computing. In this work, we propose two distinct methods for manipulating topological phase transitions in magnetic materials. First, by varying the strength of electron correlation effects, we induce a series of topological state transitions within the EuM$_2$X$_2$ (M = Zn, Cd; X = P, As, Sb) family of Zintl materials, including magnetic topological crystalline insulators (TCIs) and magnetic Dirac semimetals. Our findings indicate that strong electron correlation effects tend to influence the emergence of topological phases. Second, by reducing the electronegativity of the pnictogen X (from P to As and Sb), we observe a similar transition from trivial insulator to magnetic Dirac semimetal or magnetic TCI. This suggests that weaker electronegativity favors the emergence of topological phases. Furthermore, we establish a Heisenberg model to describe the magnetic interactions of the EuM$_2$X$_2$ system, based on which we perform Monte Carlo simulations of specific heat and magnetic susceptibility, yielding N\'eel temperatures that perfectly match experimental data. This suggests that the local magnetic moment framework provides an accurate description of the magnetization behavior in this family of materials. This work provides the potential for the experimental manipulation of topological phase transitions and their possible applications, while also enhancing the understanding of the magnetic interactions within the EuM$_2$X$_2$ system and offering a theoretical foundation for future applications in magnetism.</description>

      <title>Realizing stable zig-zag polymeric nitrogen chains in P-N compounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The zig-zag Nitrogen (N) chain similar to the Ch-N structure has long been considered a potential high energy density structure. However, all previously predicted zig-zag N chain structures similar to Ch-N exhibit imaginary frequencies in their phonon spectra at 0 GPa. Here, we conducted a systematic investigation of P-N compounds using first-principles calculations, uncovering a series of structurally similar stable phases, C2/m-PNx (x = 6, 8, 10, 12, 14), in which N forms zig-zag N chains similar to those in Ch-N. In P-N compounds, the longest zig-zag N chain that can theoretically remain stable under ambient pressure is the N chain composed of 14 N atoms in C2/m-PN14. If the N chain continues to grow, inter-chain vibrational imaginary frequencies will arise in the system. Notably, N chains with an even number of atoms are more likely to be energetically favorable. The five C2/m-PNx phases and one metastable phase (R-PN6) exhibit both remarkable stability and excellent detonability at ambient pressure, positioning them as promising candidates for high-energy-density materials. In addition, the R-PN6 is the first structure to stabilize the N6 ring through covalent bonding, with the covalent network contributing to its high hardness (47.59 GPa).</description>

      <title>Ferroelectric Chirality-Driven Direction-Tunable and Spin-Invertible Corner States in 2D MOF-Based Magnetic Second-Order Topological Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the rapid progress in predicting 2D magnetic second-order topological insulators (SOTIs), effective strategies for manipulating their spin-polarized corner states remain largely unexplored. The interplay between ferroelectricity, chirality, magnetism, and topology presents an untapped opportunity for controlling these corner states. Here, we propose a novel approach for tuning spin-polarized corner states in 2D magnetic SOTIs by inducing ferroelectric chirality in 2D metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with intrinsic structural flexibility. Through symmetry analysis, we strategically replace pyrazine (pyz) ligands with 2-pyrazinolate (2-pyzol) ligands in the 2D MOF Cr(pyz)2, leading to the emergence of a new 2D magnetic SOTI, Cr(2-pyzol)2, which facilitates ferroelectric chirality controlled spin-polarized corner states in both spin channels. Through first-principle calculations, we demonstrate that Cr(2-pyzol)2 belongs to ferroelectric chiral systems, and its corner states can be directionally tuned in real space and spin-inverted in spin space upon ferroelectric chirality switching. Our work represents the first attempt to simultaneously manipulate corner states in both real space and spin space, offering a new strategy for integrating ferroelectric chirality into 2D MOF-based magnetic SOTIs.</description>

      <title>Machine-Learning Force Fields Reveal Shallow Electronic States on Dynamic Halide Perovskite Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spectacular performance of halide perovskites in optoelectronic devices is rooted in their favorable tolerance to structural defects. Previous studies showed that defects in these materials generate shallow electronic states that do not degrade device performance. However, how these shallow states persist amid the pronounced thermally-stimulated atomic dynamics on halide perovskite surfaces remains unknown. This work reveals that electronic states at surfaces of the prototypical CsPbBr$_3$ variant are energetically distributed at room temperature, akin to well-passivated inorganic semiconductors, even when covalent bonds remain cleaved and undercoordinated. Specifically, a striking tendency for shallow surface states is found with approximately 70% of surface-state energies appearing within 0.2 eV or ${\approx}8k_\text{B}T$ from the valence-band edge. Furthermore, we show that even when surface states appear deeper in the gap, they are not energetically isolated and are less likely to act as traps. We achieve this result by accelerating first-principles calculations via machine-learning techniques and show that the unique atomic dynamics in these materials render the formation of deep electronic states at their surfaces unlikely. These findings reveal the microscopic mechanism behind the low density of deep defect states at dynamic halide perovskite surfaces, which is key to their exceptional performance in devices.</description>

      <title>Improvement of Morphology and Electrical Properties of Boron-doped Diamond Films via Seeding with HPHT Nanodiamonds Synthesized from 9-Borabicyclononane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Boron-doped diamond (BDD) films are becoming increasingly popular as electrode materials due to their broad potential window and stability in harsh conditions and environments. Therefore, optimizing the crystal quality and minimizing defect density to maximize electronic properties (e.g. conductivity) of BDD is of great importance. This study investigates the influence of different hydrogenated nanodiamond (H-ND) seeding layers on the growth and properties of BDD films. Three types of seeding H-NDs were examined: detonation (H-DND) and top-down high-pressure high-temperature NDs (TD_HPHT H-ND), and boron-doped NDs (H-BND) newly synthesized at high-pressure high-temperature from an organic precursor. Purified and oxidized BND (O-BND) samples yielded clear, blue, and stable colloidal dispersions. Subsequent thermal hydrogenation reversed their zeta potential from - 32 mV to + 44 mV and promoted the seeding of negatively charged surfaces. All three H-ND types formed dense seeding layers on SiO2 and Si/SiOx substrates, which enabled the growth of BDD films by chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Despite variations in initial surface coverage among the seeding layers (13-25%), all NDs facilitated the growth of fully closed BDD films approximately 1 {\mu}m thick. Significant differences in film morphology and electrical properties were observed. H-BND nucleation yielded the BDD films with the largest crystals (up to 1 000 nm) and lowest sheet resistance (400 ohm/sq). This superior performance is attributed to the uniform particle shape and monocrystalline character of H-BND, as corroborated by FTIR, TEM, and SAXS measurements. These findings highlight the critical role of seeding layer properties in determining consequent diamond film evolution and establish H-BNDs as promising seeding material for the growth of high-quality BDD films suitable for electronic and electrochemical applications.</description>

      <title>Colossal Dielectric Response and Electric Polarization in Lithium Nitrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Materials with record-breaking properties are interesting as they can redefine existing models. Lithium nitrate LiNO$_3$ is identified to possess a dielectric constant $\epsilon$' larger than 6x10$^6$ at 1 kHz in powdered samples above the critical temperature $T$$_W$ = 306 K. When cooling back from $T$$_W$, if the temperature remains above 275 K, $\epsilon$' can be sustained above 10$^4$ and the dissipation factor below 10$^2$. Moreover, pyroelectric current measurements show LiNO$_3$ to be ferroelectric with an electric polarization of $P$ = 1,200 $\mu$C/cm$^2$. Both $\epsilon$' and $P$ are the highest amongst all known materials. We suggest the mechanism underlying the colossal magnitudes of $\epsilon$' and $P$ to stem from a gearing-ungearing process of the planar NO$_3$$^-$ at the macroscopic level. Our results potentially push the boundaries of ceramic capacitors.</description>

      <title>Computational Characterization of the Recently Synthesized Pristine and Porous 12-Atom-Wide Armchair Graphene Nanoribbon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently synthesized Porous 12-Atom-Wide Armchair Graphene Nanoribbons Nano Lett. 2024, 24, 10718-10723 exhibit tunable properties through periodic porosity, enabling precise control over their electronic, optical, thermal, and mechanical behavior. This work presents a comprehensive theoretical characterization of pristine and porous 12-AGNRs based on density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. DFT calculations reveal substantial electronic modifications, including band gap widening and the emergence of localized states. Analyzed within the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) framework, optical properties highlight strong excitonic effects and significant absorption shifts. Thermal transport simulations indicate a pronounced reduction in conductivity due to enhanced phonon scattering at nanopores. At the same time, MD-based mechanical analysis shows decreased stiffness and strength while maintaining structural integrity. Despite these modifications, porous 12-AGNRs remain mechanically and thermally stable. These findings establish porosity engineering as a powerful strategy for tailoring graphene nanoribbons' functional properties, reinforcing their potential for nanoelectronic, optoelectronic, and thermal management applications.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Layer-Controlled Two-dimensional Semiconductors for Photoelectrochemical Energy Storage via Quantum Capacitance and Band Nesting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides like molybdenum diselenide (MoSe$_2$) have shown great potential in optoelectronics and energy storage due to their layer-dependent bandgap. However, producing high-quality 2D MoSe$_2$ layers in a scalable and controlled manner remains challenging. Traditional methods, such as hydrothermal and liquid-phase exfoliation, lack precision and understanding at the nanoscale, limiting further applications. Atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition (APCVD) offers a scalable solution for growing high-quality, large-area, layer-controlled 2D MoSe$_2$. Despite this, the photoelectrochemical performance of APCVD-grown 2D MoSe$_2$, particularly in energy storage, has not been extensively explored. This study addresses this by examining MoSe$_2$'s layer-dependent quantum capacitance and photo-induced charge storage properties. Using a three-electrode setup in 0.5M H$_2$SO$_4$, we observed a layer-dependent increase in areal capacitance under both dark and illuminated conditions. A six-layer MoSe$_2$ film exhibited the highest capacitance, reaching $96 \mu\mathrm{F/cm^2}$ in the dark and $115 \mu\mathrm{F/cm^2}$ under illumination at a current density of $5 \mu\mathrm{A/cm^2}$. Density Functional Theory (DFT) and Many-Body Perturbation Theory calculations reveal that Van Hove singularities and band nesting significantly enhance optical absorption and quantum capacitance. These results highlight APCVD-grown 2D MoSe$_2$'s potential as light-responsive, high-performance energy storage electrodes, paving the way for innovative energy storage systems.</description>

      <title>Processing-dependent Chemical Ordering in a Metallic Alloy Characterized via Non-destructive Bragg Coherent Diffraction Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Of current importance for alloy design is controlling chemical ordering through processing routes to optimize an alloy's mechanical properties for a desired application. However, characterization of chemical ordering remains an ongoing challenge, particularly when nondestructive characterization is needed. In this study, Bragg coherent diffraction imaging is used to reconstruct morphology and lattice displacement in model Cu$_3$Au nanocrystals that have undergone different heat treatments to produce variation in chemical ordering. The magnitudes and distributions of the scattering amplitudes (proportional to electron density) and lattice strains within these crystals are then analyzed to correlate them to the expected amount of chemical ordering present. Nanocrystals with increased amounts of ordering are found to generally have less extreme strains present and reduced strain distribution widths. In addition, statistical correlations are found between the spatial arrangement of scattering amplitude and lattice strains.</description>

      <title>Environment-friendly technologies with lead-free piezoelectric materials: A review of recent developments, applications, and modelling approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Piezoelectric materials are widely used in several industries, including power sources, energy harvesting, biomedical, electronics, haptic, photostrictive, and sensor/actuator technologies. Conventional piezoelectric materials, such lead zirconate titanate (PZT), pose significant environmental and health risks due to lead content. Recent years have seen a growing need for eco-friendly alternatives to lead-based piezoelectric technologies. The drawback of lead-free piezoelectric materials is a reduced responsiveness. To enhance the performance of lead-free piezoelectric materials, substantial research is being undertaken using both experimental and numerical methods. The experimental studies provide a deep understanding of the process and are crucial for developing lead-free piezoelectric materials. Relying only on experimental research is not feasible due to high expenditures. To understand the piezoelectric properties of lead-free materials and enhance their efficiency, it is crucial to develop varied numerical models and computational methods. This paper is a comprehensive summary of lead-free piezoelectric technology breakthroughs. The study emphasizes numerical models that demonstrate enhanced piezoelectric behaviour and their use in eco-friendly technologies like energy harvesting, haptics, nano-electromechanical, photostrictive, and biomedical sensors and actuators using lead-free materials. The paper discusses the synthesis, properties, and applications of eco-friendly materials, highlighting their potential to revolutionize piezoelectric devices and promote sustainable development and conservation.</description>

      <title>Carrier Localization and Spontaneous Formation of Two-Dimensional Polarization Domain in Halide Perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Halide perovskites are known for their rich phase diagram and superior performance in diverse optoelectronics applications. The latter property is often attributed to the long electron-hole recombination time, whose underlying physical mechanism has been a long-standing controversy. In this work, we investigate the transport and localization properties of electron and hole carriers in a prototypical halide perovskite (CsPbBr3), through ab initio tight-binding non-adiabatic dynamics approach for large-scale (tens of nm size) supercell calculations. We found distinct structural, lattice polarization, and electron-phonon coupling properties at low (below 100 K) and high temperatures, consistent with experimental observations. In particular, at low temperature we find spontaneous formation of polar grain-boundaries in the nonpolar bulk systems, which result in two dimensional polarization patterns that serve to localize and separate electrons and holes. We reveal phonon-assisted variable-range hopping mostly responsible for low-temperature transport, and their characteristic frequency correlates with temperature-dependent phonon power spectrum and energy oscillation frequency in nonadiabatic dynamics. We answer the critical questions of long electron-hole recombination lifetime and offer the correlation among polarization domains, electron-phonon couplings, and photocarrier dynamics.</description>

      <title>Novel electronic state of honeycomb iridate Cu$_2$IrO$_3$ at high pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02934v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cu$_2$IrO$_3$ has attracted recent interest due to its proximity to the Kitaev quantum spin liquid state and the complex structural response observed at high pressures. We use x-ray spectroscopy and scattering as well as electrical transport techniques to unveil the electronic structure of Cu$_2$IrO$_3$ at ambient and high pressures. Despite featuring a $\mathrm{Ir^{4+}}$ $J_{\rm{eff}}=1/2$ state at ambient pressure, Ir $L_{3}$ edge resonant inelastic x-ray scattering reveals broadened electronic excitations that point to the importance of Ir $5d$-Cu $3d$ interaction. High pressure first drives an Ir-Ir dimer state with collapsed $\langle \mathbf{L} \cdot \mathbf{S} \rangle$ and $\langle L_z \rangle/\langle S_z \rangle$, signaling the formation of $5d$ molecular orbitals. A novel $\mathrm{Cu \to Ir}$ charge transfer is observed at the onset of phase 5 above 30 GPa at low temperatures, leading to an approximate $\mathrm{Ir^{3+}}$ and $\mathrm{Cu^{1.5+}}$ valence, with persistent insulating electrical transport seemingly driven by charge segregation of Cu 1+/2+ ions into distinct sites. Concomitant x-ray spectroscopy and scattering measurements through different thermodynamic paths demonstrate a strong electron-lattice coupling, with $J_{\rm{eff}}=1/2$ and $\mathrm{Ir^{3+}}$/$\mathrm{Cu^{1.5+}}$ electronic states occurring only in phases 1 and 5, respectively. Remarkably, the charge-transferred state can only be reached if Cu$_2$IrO$_3$ is pressurized at low temperature, suggesting that phonons play an important role in the stability of this phase. These results point to the choice of thermodynamic path across interplanar collapse transition as a key route to access novel states in intercalated iridates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An analysis of the measured rovibrational transitions is carried out for the 12C32S2 isotopologue of carbon disulfide. Data from 21 sources is extracted and validated using a consistent set of standard linear molecule quantum numbers. A corrected list of 8714 CS2 transitions forms the input to a Measured Active Rotational-Vibrational Energy Levels (MARVEL) procedure, generating 4279 empirical rovibrational energy levels across 138 bands of 12C32S2. Results are compared to the recent NASA Ames line list. While the agreement is generally good, issues are identified with the energy levels of some states, notably those with high values of the v2 bending quantum number.</description>

      <title>Single-band square lattice Hubbard model from twisted bilayer C568</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose twisted homobilayer of a carbon allotrope, C$_{568}$, to be a promising platform to realize controllable square lattice single-band extended Hubbard model. This setup has the advantage of a widely tunable $t'/t$ ratio without adding external fields, and the intermediate temperature $t\ll T\ll U$ regime can be easily achieved. We first analyze the continuum model obtained from symmetry analysis and first-principle calculations, and calculate the band structures. Subsequently, we derive the corresponding tight-binding models and fit the hopping parameters as well as the Coulomb interactions. When displacement field is applied, anisotropic nearest neighbor hoppings can further be achieved. If successfully fabricated, the device could be an important stepping stone towards understanding high-temperature superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Quantitative description of strongly correlated materials by combining downfolding techniques and tensor networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a high-accuracy procedure for electronic structure calculations of strongly correlated materials. The approach involves downfolding the full Hilbert space into a low-energy subspace that captures the most significant electron correlations, leading to an effective Hubbard model. This generalized model is then solved using tensor network methods. Our work focuses on one-dimensional and quasi-one-dimensional materials, for which we employ the machinery of matrix product states. We apply this framework to the conjugated polymers trans-polyacetylene and polythiophene, as well as the quasi-one-dimensional charge-transfer insulator Sr2CuO3. The predicted band gaps exhibit quantitative agreement with state-of-the-art computational techniques and experimental measurements. Beyond band gaps, tensor networks provide access to a wide range of physically relevant properties, including spin magnetization and various excitation energies. Their flexibility supports the implementation of complex Hamiltonians with longer-range interactions, while the bond dimension enables systematic control over accuracy. Furthermore, the computational cost scales efficiently with system size, demonstrating the framework's scalability.</description>

      <title>In-plane Ising superconductivity revealed by exchange interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional superconductors with spin-textured Fermi surfaces can be a platform for realizing unconventional pairing and are of substantial interest in the context of quantum information science, and superconducting spintronics/orbitronics. We find that the superconducting 2D electron gas (2DEG) formed at EuOx/KTaO3 (110) interfaces, where the EuOx is magnetic, has a spin-texture with an unusual in-plane Ising like uniaxial anisotropy that is revealed in measurements of the in-plane critical field in the superconducting state, as well as from quantum corrections to the magnetoresistance in the normal state. This spin texture is not evident in AlOx/KTaO3 (110) where the overlayer is non-magnetic. Our results are consistent with a highly anisotropic spin-textured Fermi surface in 2DEGs formed at the KTaO3 (110) interface that is hidden from external magnetic fields due to a near cancellation between orbital and spin moments but revealed by exchange interactions of the electrons in the 2DEG with Eu moments near the EuOx/KTaO3 (110) interface. Our findings demonstrate that magnetic overlayers provide a unique probe of spin textures and related phenomena in heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Extracting intrinsic superconducting properties in intercalated layered superconductors using an extended 2D Tinkham model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bulk two dimensional (2D) superconductivity has gained considerable attention due to its intricate interplay between symmetry breaking, nontrivial topology, 2D phase fluctuations, and unconventional superconductivity. However, certain intercalated layered superconductors, despite their short c-axis superconducting coherence length, have been misclassified as anisotropic three-dimensional (3D) superconductors. Here, we investigate (Li,Fe)OHFeSe superconductors with varying degrees of interlayer misalignment, revealing sample-dependent superconducting dimensionality while consistently observing Berezinskii Kosterlitz Thouless (BKT) transitions. To resolve this discrepancy, we develop an extended 2D Tinkham model that quantitatively captures the blurring effects induced by interlayer misalignment. We further demonstrate the validity of this model in both (Li,Fe)OHFeSe and cetyltrimethyl ammonium (CTA+) intercalated (CTA)0.5SnSe2 superconductors, highlighting its broad applicability. This work provides valuable insights into bulk 2D superconductivity and establishes an extended 2D Tinkham model for quantitatively extracting intrinsic superconducting properties in intercalated layered superconductors, particularly those exhibiting significant interlayer misalignments.</description>

      <title>Gate-Tunable Spin-to-Charge Conversion in Topological Insulator-Magnetic Insulator Heterostructures at Room Temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past decade, topological insulators have received enormous attention for their potential in energy-efficient spin-to-charge conversion, enabled by strong spin-orbit coupling and spin-momentum locked surface states. Despite extensive research, the spin-to-charge conversion efficiency, usually characterized by the spin Hall angle ({\theta}SH), remains low at room temperature. In this work, we employed pulsed laser deposition to synthesize high-quality ternary topological insulators (Bi0.1Sb0.9)2Te3 thin films on magnetic insulator Y3Fe5O12. We find that the value of {\theta}SH reaches ~0.76 at room temperature and increases to ~0.9 as the Fermi level is tuned to cross topological surface states via electrical gating. Our findings provide an innovative approach to tailoring the spin-to-charge conversion in topological insulators and pave the way for their applications in energy-efficient spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Phonon anomalies within the polar charge density wave phase of superconductor Mo$_3$Al$_2$C with structural chirality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ polarization-resolved Raman spectroscopy to study the lattice dynamics of the polar charge density wave phase of the superconductor Mo$_3$Al$_2$C with structural chirality. We show the phononic signatures of the charge density wave transition at $T^*$=155K in Mo$_3$Al$_2$C. The detailed temperature dependence of these phonon modes' frequency, half-width-at-half-maximum, and the integrated area below $T^*$ reveal anomalies at an intermediate temperature $T'\sim$100K, especially for the low-energy modes at 130cm$^{-1}$ and 180cm$^{-1}$. Since these low-energy modes are dominated by Mo-related lattice vibration, we propose that lattice anomalies at $T'$ within the charge density wave phase are related to a modification of the Mo displacements while preserving the crystal symmetry.</description>

      <title>Effect of a uniaxial strain on optical spin orientation in cubic semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effect of a uniaxial strain on the optical spin orientation of a cubic semiconductor is investigated by calculating the valence wavefunctions, the optical oscillator strengths and the initial electron spin polarization for near resonant light excitation from heavy and light valence levels. A strain orientation along the [001], [111] or [-110] crystal direction and a circularly-polarized light excitation parallel or perpendicular to the strain are considered. For all these cases, the total conduction electron spin polarization has a universal character since i) the oscillator strengths do not depend on the magnitude of the strain but only on its sign. ii) Although the oscillator strengths strongly depend on the configuration, the conduction electron spin polarization generated by optical transitions from both the heavy and light valence levels induced by sigma + light excitation is in all cases equal to -0.5 as predicted by the simple atomic model. iii) The spin polarization generated by light excitation from heavy and light valence levels does not depend on the deformation tensor and on the valence deformation potential, except for a strain along [-110].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Altermagnetism defies conventional classifications of collinear magnetic phases, standing apart from ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism with its unique combination of spin-dependent symmetries, net-zero magnetization, and anomalous Hall transport. Although altermagnetic states have been realized experimentally, their integration into functional devices has been hindered by the structural rigidity and poor tunability of existing materials. First, through cobalt intercalation of the superconducting 2H-NbSe$_2$ polymorph, we induce and stabilize a robust altermagnetic phase and using both theory and experiment, we directly observe the lifting of Kramers degeneracy. Then, using ultrafast laser pulses, we demonstrate how the low temperature phase of this system can be quenched, realizing the first example of an optical altermagnetic switch. While shedding light on overlooked aspects of altermagnetism, our findings open pathways to spin-based technologies and lay a foundation for advancing the emerging field of altertronics.</description>

      <title>Generating long-distance magnetic couplings with flat bands</title>

Abstract: One of the great challenges for the large-scale development of quantum technologies is to generate and control the entanglement of quantum bits through interactions of sufficiently long range. Two decades ago, spin chains have been proposed for quantum communication. Unfortunately, couplings are of very short range in general which drastically limits the communication to very short distances. Here, we demonstrate that the presence of flat bands (FBs) can trigger very long-distance magnetic couplings in spin chains. Furthermore, we show that the typical decaying lengthscale is directly related to the quantum metric of the flat band eigenstates. We believe that our unexpected findings could open up an alternative route to enable long-distance quantum communication.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Magnon Decays from Nonrelativistic Time-Reversal Symmetry Breaking in Altermagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasiparticles are central to condensed matter physics, but their stability can be undermined by quantum many-body interactions. Magnons, quasiparticles in quantum magnets, are particularly intriguing because their properties are governed by both real and spin space. While crystal symmetries may be low, spin interactions often remain approximately isotropic, limiting spontaneous magnon decay. Textbook wisdom holds that collinear Heisenberg magnets follow a dichotomy: ferromagnets host stable magnons, while antiferromagnetic magnons may decay depending on dispersion curvature. Up to now, relativistic spin-orbit coupling and noncollinear order that connect spin space to real space, were shown to introduce more complex magnon instability mechanisms. Here, we show that even in nonrelativistic isotropic collinear systems, this conventional dichotomy is disrupted in altermagnets. Altermagnets, a newly identified class of collinear magnets, exhibit compensated spin order with nonrelativistic time-reversal symmetry breaking and even-parity band splitting. Using kinematic analysis, nonlinear spin-wave theory, and quantum simulations, we reveal that even weak band splitting opens a decay phase space, driving quasiparticle breakdown. Additionally, d-wave altermagnets form a rare ``island of stability'' at the Brillouin zone center. Our findings establish a quasiparticle stability trichotomy in collinear Heisenberg magnets and position altermagnets as a promising platform for unconventional spin dynamics.</description>

      <title>Half-Metallic Fe/MgO Superlattice: An Ideal Candidate for Magnetic Tunnel Junction Electrodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic Tunnel Junction (MTJ) based Spin-Transfer Torque Magnetic Random Access Memory (STT-MRAM) is poised to replace embedded Flash for advanced applications such as automotive microcontroller units. To achieve deeper technological adoption, MTJ needs to exhibit three key features: low magnetization (Ms), high perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) and high tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR). Here, we theoretically show that when Fe/MgO multilayers are inserted into the fixed and free layers of the MTJ, these three conditions are simultaneously met. As the number of Fe/MgO multilayers in MTJ electrodes is increased, we find that the electron transport evolves from direct barrier tunneling of majority spin states to the resonant tunneling of minority spin states. Remarkably, the projected density of states (PDOS) of Fe/MgO superlattice at the MgO tunnel barrier exhibits half-metallicity near the Fermi Energy, where the minority states exist while the majority states are gapped out, resulting in astronomically high TMR.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in doped planar Dirac insulators: A renormalization group study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: From a leading-order unbiased renormalization group analysis we here showcase the emergence of superconductivity (including the topological ones) from purely repulsive electron-electron interactions in two-dimensional doped Dirac insulators, featuring a Fermi surface. In the absence of chemical doping, such systems describe quantum anomalous or spin Hall and normal insulators. Otherwise a simply connected Fermi surface becomes annular deep inside the topological regime. By considering all symmetry allowed repulsive local four-fermion interactions, we show that the nature of the resulting superconducting states at low temperature follows certain Clifford algebraic selection rules, irrespective of the underlying Fermi surface topology. Within the framework of a microscopic Hubbard model, on-site repulsion among fermions with opposite orbitals (spin projections) typically favors topological $p$-wave (conventional $s$-wave) pairing. Theoretically predicted superconductivity can in principle be observed in experiments once the promising candidate materials for quantum anomalous and spin Hall insulators are doped to foster Fermi surfaces.</description>

      <title>Theoretical study of high harmonic generation in monolayer NbSe$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.03080v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High harmonic generation (HHG) is a powerful probe of electron dynamics on attosecond to femtosecond timescales and has been successfully used to detect electronic and structural changes in solid-state quantum materials, including transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). Among TMDs, bulk NbSe2 exhibits charge density wave (CDW) order below 33 K and becomes superconducting below 7.3 K. Monolayer NbSe2 is therefore interesting as a material whose different structural and electronic properties could be probed via HHG. Here, we predict the HHG response of the pristine 2H and CDW phases of monolayer NbSe2 using real-time time-dependent density functional theory under the application of a simulated laser pulse excitation. We find that due to the lack of inversion symmetry in both monolayer phases, it is possible to excite even harmonics and that the even harmonics appear as the transverse components of the current response under excitations polarized along the zigzag direction of the monolayer, while odd harmonics arise from the longitudinal current response in all excitation directions. This suggests that the even and odd harmonic response can be controlled via the polarization of the probing field, opening an avenue for potentially useful applications in opto-electronic devices.</description>

      <title>Non Linear Hall Effects induced by Berry Curvature Dipole in CuPb$_9$(PO$_4$)$_6$O</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18588v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nonlinear Hall effect (NLHE), an emergent response in systems with broken inversion symmetry, provides a powerful tool for probing topological transport properties. In this context, we investigate copper-substituted lead apatite (LK-99), a material that initially garnered attention for its controversial claim of room-temperature superconductivity. Despite the unresolved nature of its superconducting properties, LK-99's unique electronic structure featuring flat bands near the Fermi level and broken inversion symmetry makes it a promising candidate for exploring Berry curvature-driven phenomena such as the NLHE. Using first-principles density functional theory and a refined tight-binding Hamiltonian model, we investigate LK-99's band topology and transport properties. Our calculations reveal that LK-99 hosts Weyl points near the Fermi level, which contribute significantly to Berry curvature. The inclusion of spin-orbit coupling further splits these bands, generating additional Weyl points and enhancing the Berry curvature distribution. Crucially, the absence of inversion symmetry in LK-99 leads to a net Berry curvature dipole, producing a nonlinear Hall current that scales quadratically with the applied electric field. Moreover, we demonstrate that the NLHE in LK-99 can be tuned by varying the direction of the applied electric field, underscoring its potential as a versatile platform for exploring topological transport phenomena and designing next-generation nonlinear electronic devices.</description>

      <title>Exciton self-trapping in twisted hexagonal boron nitride homostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09420v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the main interests of 2D materials is their ability to be assembled with many degrees of freedom for tuning and manipulating excitonic properties. There is a need to understand how the structure of the interfaces between atomic layers influences exciton properties. Here we use cathodoluminescence and time-resolved cathodoluminescence experiments to study how excitons interact with the interface between two twisted hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) crystals with various angles. An efficient capture of free excitons by the interface is demonstrated, which leads to a population of long-lived and interface-localized (2D) excitons. Temperature dependent experiments indicate that for high twist angles, these excitons localized at the interface further undergo a selftrapping. It consists in a distortion of the lattice around the exciton on which the exciton traps itself. Our results suggest that this exciton-interface interaction causes the broad 4-eV optical emission of highly twisted hBN-hBN structures. Exciton self-trapping is finally discussed as a common feature of sp2 hybridized boron nitride polytypes and nanostructures due to the ionic nature of the B-N bond and the small size of their excitons.</description>

      <title>Electrical resistivity, thermal conductivity, and viscosity of Fe-H alloys at Earth's core conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04521v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The transport properties (electrical resistivity, thermal conductivity, and viscosity) of iron-hydrogen alloys are of great significance in the stability and evolution of planetary magnetic fields. Here, we investigate the thermal transport properties of iron doped with varying hydrogen content as functions of pressure (P) and temperature (T) for the top and bottom of Earth's outer core and beyond, corresponding to pressures of about 130 to 300 GPa and temperatures of 4000 to 7000 K. Using first-principles density functional theory molecular dynamic simulations (FPMD), we verify that crystalline FeH$_x$ is superionic with H diffusing freely. We find a low frequency viscosity of 10-11 mPa$\cdot$s for liquid Fe-H alloys at Earth's outer core conditions. We find saturation of electrical resistivity with increasing temperatures in liquid iron at outer core conditions. The effect of H on electrical and thermal transport we find is small, so that the exact H content of the core is not needed. The primary effect of H is on the equation of state, decreasing the density at constant P and T. We find the Lorenz number is smaller than the ideal value, and obtain for X(H)= 0.20, or 0.45 wt% H , thermal conductivity $\kappa$ of $\sim$105 and $\sim$190 $Wm^{-1}K^{-1}$, respectively, at conditions near the core-mantle and inner-outer core boundary.</description>

      <title>Enhancing creep resistance in refractory high-entropy alloys: role of grain size and local chemical order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00588v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Refractory high-entropy alloys (RHEAs) are a promising class of materials with potential applications in extreme environments, where the dominant failure mode is thermal creep. The design of these alloys, therefore, requires an understanding of how their microstructure and local chemical distribution affect creep behavior. In this study, we performed high-fidelity atomistic simulations using machine-learning interatomic potentials to explore the creep deformation of MoNbTaW RHEAs under a wide range of stress and temperature conditions. We parametrized grain size and local chemical order (LCO) to investigate the effects of these two important design variables, which are controllable during the alloy fabrication process. Our investigation revealed that resistance to creep deformation is enhanced by larger grain sizes and higher levels of LCO. This study highlights the importance of utilizing LCO in conjunction with other microstructural properties when designing RHEAs for extreme environment applications.</description>

Abstract: This study systematically investigates the electronic structure and bonding properties of two-dimensional bilayer transition metal chalcogenides MX2 (M = Mo, W; X = S, Se, Te) using density functional theory calculations. By analyzing band gaps, deformation bond energies, and non-Hermitian bonding characteristics across various MX2 compounds, we comprehensively examine their electronic properties and chemical bonding behavior. The results reveal that charge transfer plays a crucial role in electron mass fluctuations, with topological geometric analysis further confirming the impact of mass variations on atomic bonding and electronic states. These findings provide a theoretical foundation for advancing the application of these materials.</description>

      <title>Machine Learned Potential for High-Throughput Phonon Calculations of Metal-Organic Frameworks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02877v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are highly porous and versatile materials studied extensively for applications such as carbon capture and water harvesting. However, computing phonon-mediated properties in MOFs, like thermal expansion and mechanical stability, remains challenging due to the large number of atoms per unit cell, making traditional Density Functional Theory (DFT) methods impractical for high-throughput screening. Recent advances in machine learning potentials have led to foundation atomistic models, such as MACE-MP-0, that accurately predict equilibrium structures but struggle with phonon properties of MOFs. In this work, we developed a workflow for computing phonons in MOFs within the quasi-harmonic approximation with a fine-tuned MACE model, MACE-MP-MOF0. The model was trained on a curated dataset of 127 representative and diverse MOFs. The fine-tuned MACE-MP-MOF0 improves the accuracy of phonon density of states and corrects the imaginary phonon modes of MACE-MP-0, enabling high-throughput phonon calculations with state-of-the-art precision. The model successfully predicts thermal expansion and bulk moduli in agreement with DFT and experimental data for several well-known MOFs. These results highlight the potential of MACE-MP-MOF0 in guiding MOF design for applications in energy storage and thermoelectrics.</description>

Abstract: The dynamic magnetic properties of Full Heusler alloy thin films of Co$_2$FeGe, grown on MgO (001) substrates under different thermal conditions, were investigated. Brillouin light scattering and ferromagnetic resonance measurements revealed that depositing at room temperature followed by annealing at 300 deg C for 1 hour produces the best results for maximizing magnetization, exchange stiffness, and minimizing spin-dynamic dissipation in the films, which are desirable characteristics for high-speed spintronic devices. Additionally, strong hybridization of spin waves in the Damon-Eshbach geometry was observed, which is attractive for applications in magnonic signal processing circuits.</description>

      <title>Relationship between polymorphic structures and magnetic properties of La$_{2-x}A'_{x}$Ni$_{7}$ compounds ($A$' = Sm, Gd)</title>

Abstract: In this study, the crystal structure and magnetic properties of La$_{2-x} A'_{x}$Ni$_{7}$ compounds with magnetic rare earth elements ($A$' = Sm, Gd) have been investigated combining X-ray powder diffraction and magnetic measurements. These intergrowth compounds crystallize in a mixture of 2$H$ hexagonal (Ce$_{2}$Ni$_{7}$-type) and 3$R$ rhombohedral (Gd$_{2}$Co$_{7}$-type) polymorphic structures which are related to the stacking of [$AB_{5}$] and [$A_{2}B_{4}$] subunits along the $c$-axis.The average cell volume decreases linearly versus $A$' content, whereas the $c/a$ ratio reaches a minimum at $x$ = 1, due to geometric constraints upon $A$' for La substitution between the two different subunits. The magnetic properties strongly depend on the structure type and the $A$' content. Hexagonal La$_{2}$Ni$_{7}$ is a weak antiferromagnet (wAFM) at low field and temperature and undergoes metamagnetic transitions towards weak ferromagnetic state (wFM) under applied field. Under an applied field of 0.1 T, La$_{2-x}A'_{x}$Ni$_{7}$ intermetallic compounds display two different transition temperatures $T_{1}$ and $T_{2}$ that both increase with $x$. $T_{1}$ is associated with a wFM-wAFM transition in the 2$H$ phase for $A$'= Sm, whereas $T_{2}$ is related to the Curie temperature of both 2$H$ and 3$R$ phases. A metamagnetic behaviour is observed between $T_{1}$ and $T_{2}$ with transition field $\mu_{0}H_{Trans}$ between 2 and 3.5 T for compounds with $A$' = Sm. The La$_{2-x}Sm_{x}$Ni$_{7}$ compounds ($x$ &gt; 0} behave as hard magnets with a large coercive field $\mu_{0}H_{C}$ at low temperature ($\mu_{0}H_{C}$ &gt; 9 T at 5 K for $x$ = 2), whereas the La$_{2-x} Gd_{x}$Ni$_{7}$ compounds ($x$ &gt; 0) are soft ferrimagnets with a linear increase of the saturation magnetization versus Gd content.</description>

      <title>Spin Pumping in Magnetostrictive Galfenol Interfaced with Ta</title>

Abstract: In view of their advantages for memory and storage applications, the quest to find suitable magnetic thin film heterostructures that can exhibit strong spin pumping effect persists in the scientific community. Here, the spin pumping phenomenon is investigated in Ta/Galfenol (FeGa) thin film heterostructures by systematically varying the thickness of the heavy metallic Ta underlayer (UL). The films exhibit soft magnetic property with a bcc-phase with a notably low Gilbert damping obtained for FeGa on Si (100). The precessional magnetization dynamics of Ta/FeGa films are explored using time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect magnetometry, revealing the presence of a resonant Kittel mode and additional strain-induced modes. The lowest value of effective Gilbert damping in Ta/FeGa is obtained as ~ 0.015, which rises by ~ 65 % as the thickness of UL increases. Spin pumping and two-magnon scattering mechanisms are validated using a ballistic spin transport model. An overall effective spin mixing conductance value of ~ 5.48 $\times$ 10$^{15}$ cm$^{-2}$ is found, which is the highest value ever reported in magnetostrictive Galfenol films. Additionally, micromagnetic simulations are performed to understand the effect of tilted magnetic anisotropy on the formation of magnetic modes in these films. These findings in FeGa films establish it as an effective spin source material and offer innovative ideas to control spin-wave propagation and diverse applications in straintronics.</description>

      <title>Agnostic calculation of atomic free energies with the descriptor density of states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18191v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new method to evaluate vibrational free energies of atomic systems without a priori specification of an interatomic potential. Our model-agnostic approach leverages descriptors, high-dimensional feature vectors of atomic structure. The entropy of a high-dimensional density, the descriptor density of states, is accurately estimated with conditional score matching. Casting interatomic potentials into a form extensive in descriptor features, we show free energies emerge as the Legendre-Fenchel conjugate of the descriptor entropy, avoiding all high-dimensional integration. The score matching campaign requires less resources than fixed-model sampling and is highly parallel, reducing wall time to a few minutes, with tensor compression schemes allowing lightweight storage. Our model-agnostic estimator returns differentiable free energy predictions over a broad range of potential parameters in microseconds of CPU effort, allowing rapid forward and back propagation of potential variations through finite temperature simulations, long desired for uncertainty quantification and inverse design. We test predictions against thermodynamic integration calculations over a broad range of models for BCC, FCC and A15 phases of W, Mo and Fe at high homologous temperatures. Predictions pass the stringent accuracy threshold of 1-2 meV/atom (1/40-1/20 kcal/mol) for phase prediction with propagated score uncertainties robustly bounding errors. We also demonstrate targeted fine-tuning, reducing the alpha-gamma transition temperature in a non-magnetic machine learning model of Fe from 2030 K to 1063 K through back-propagation, with no additional sampling. Applications to liquids and fine-tuning foundational models are discussed along with the many problems in computational science which estimate high-dimensional integrals.</description>

      <title>Spin-Peierls transition in the frustrated spinels ZnCr2O4 and MgCr2O4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13908v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The chromium spinels MgCr2O4 and ZnCr2O4 are prime examples of the highly frustrated pyrochlore lattice antiferromagnet. Experiment has carefully established that both materials, upon cooling, distort to lower symmetry and order magnetically. We study the nature of this process by a combination of density-functional-theory based energy mapping and classical Monte Carlo simulations. We first computationally establish precise Heisenberg Hamiltonian parameters for the high temperature cubic and the low temperature tetragonal and orthorhombic structures of both spinels. We then investigate the respective ordering temperatures of high symmetry and low symmetry structures. We carefully compare our results with experimental facts and find that our simulations are remarkably consistent with a type of spin-Peierls mechanism, adapted to three dimensions, where the structural distortion is mediated by a magnetic energy gain due to a lower degree of frustration.</description>

      <title>Surface detachment and bed entrainment of fluvial plastics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03081v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the last decade, fluvial plastics have been identified as major threat to aquatic environments and human health. In order to develop adequate mitigation strategies for plastic pollution, a fundamental process understanding of riverine plastic transport is of significant importance. In this context, the implementation of research findings into numerical simulation environments is anticipated to enhance modelling capabilities and to support a rigorous decision making. Recent experimental research has focused on the incipient motion of plastic particles, as well as on the effects of surface tension on plastic concentration profiles. While these investigations have advanced the state-of-the-art knowledge, current literature still displays a lack of basic insights into layer-specific plastic transport physics. In this study, first principles are applied to advance knowledge on free-surface detachment and bed entrainment of fluvial plastics. A novel relationship for the critical surface detachment velocity is derived, followed by the development of a framework that allows to relate plastic Shields parameters to those of natural sediments. Overall, it is anticipated that these developments will trigger new research within the plastics community, and it is hoped that present findings will be implemented into Lagrangian particle tracking software.</description>

      <title>Constitutive Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (CKANs): Combining Accuracy and Interpretability in Data-Driven Material Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05682v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hybrid constitutive modeling integrates two complementary approaches for describing and predicting a material's mechanical behavior: purely data-driven black-box methods and physically constrained, theory-based models. While black-box methods offer high accuracy, they often lack interpretability and extrapolability. Conversely, physics-based models provide theoretical insight and generalizability but may not capture complex behaviors with the same accuracy. Traditionally, hybrid modeling has required a trade-off between these aspects. In this paper, we show how recent advances in symbolic machine learning, specifically Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), help to overcome this limitation. We introduce Constitutive Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (CKANs) as a new class of hybrid constitutive models. By incorporating a post-processing symbolification step, CKANs combine the predictive accuracy of data-driven models with the interpretability and extrapolation capabilities of symbolic expressions, bridging the gap between machine learning and physical modeling.</description>
