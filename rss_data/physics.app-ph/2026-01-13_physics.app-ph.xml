      <title>Hierarchical metamaterials with tunable flat bands, zero-frequency, and wavenumber gaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metamaterials are arrangement of basic building blocks that repeat in space, time, or both. These material systems serve as an excellent platform for controlling waves, such as engineering wavenumber band gaps, flat bands, and zero-frequency band gaps. However, combining one or more of these exotic features within the same unit cell design remains a challenge. Moreover, once a metamaterial is realized, its dispersive properties are usually fixed. In this work, we present a tunable passive hierarchical metamaterial capable of exhibiting wavenumber band gaps, flat bands, and zero-frequency band gaps within the same dispersion curve. Our metamaterial is composed of magnetic elements confined within a fixed magnetic boundary. The metamaterial can be tuned by adjusting the magnetic boundary, which in turn can alter the lattice periodicity. We open wavenumber band gaps by incorporating magnetic coupling within the unit cell elements, resulting in negative physical stiffness. The tunability of the magnetic coupling also enables complete flattening of the dispersion bands. Moreover, the ground stiffness within our unit-cell design causes the opening of zero-frequency band gaps. We present our approach through a combination of analytical, numerical, and experimental methods. The analytical framework provides a blueprint for obtaining each of these exotic dispersion characteristics. The numerical analysis, using both linear and nonlinear models, validates our analytical predictions, which we further confirm through experimental demonstrations. Our work opens the door to exploring magnetic tunability and hierarchy in engineering metamaterial systems with exotic properties that can be harnessed in advanced acoustic and mechanical devices.</description>

      <title>Digitally Controlled Mechatronic Metamaterials for Actively Induced Targeted Bandgaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an experimental framework for inducing and tuning vibration bandgaps in digitally controlled mechatronic metamaterials. A slender-beam structure instrumented with collocated piezoelectric sensor-actuator pairs distributed periodically along the length is used as the host medium, with decentralized second-order low-pass resonant filter with negative position feedback controllers implemented in real time on an FPGA platform. Unlike conventional approaches that assess bandgap formation through tip displacement, this study relies on bending strain minimization of piezoelectric sensors as the principal indicator of control-induced bandgaps. This reflects more accurately the moment-based phase cancellation dynamics similar to resonator behavior. We derive analytical expressions for transmissibility in an n x n decentralized feedback architecture and verify them experimentally using a 7 x 7 unit-cell configuration. The findings show that resonant controllers with negative feedback applied at the unit-cell level can be systematically tuned through controller gain and damping to open targeted low-frequency bandgaps and significantly improve vibration attenuation. By shifting the focus to localized dynamics, this work deepens the understanding of how control-induced bandgaps emerge and demonstrates a scalable pathway for designing programmable mechatronic metamaterials based on unconventional resonator behavior.</description>

      <title>Coherent power combining of four-way injection-locked 5.8-GHz magnetrons based on a five-port hybrid waveguide combiner</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A high-efficiency power-combining method for four-way 5.8-GHz magnetrons based on the external injection-locking technique is presented in this article. The method uses a nonisolated, lossless five-port hybrid waveguide combiner for power combining. Meanwhile, the injection-locking technology has been applied to magnetrons for achieving coherent power combining. The phase fluctuation of the injection-locked magnetron, without the presence of a phase-locked loop, measured nearly 2.5 degree. In contrast, when a phase-locked loop was introduced, the phase fluctuation reduced significantly to approximately 0.5 degree. This phase accuracy can fully meet the requirements of combining experiments. Four magnetrons worked in injection-locked states without phase-locked loop. The proposed power-combining system is designed, measured, and analyzed. Measurement results show that a high-power-combining efficiency of over 95% is achieved by injection-locked magnetron without PLL, with the best efficiency reaching up to 97.7% with phase control of the injected signals. Experimental results reveal that the magnetron phase-pushing effects and the ripple in high-power dc voltage and current have a minor impact of approximately 4% on the combining efficiency.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional FrBD friction models for rolling contact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a comprehensive two-dimensional generalisation of the recently introduced Friction with Bristle Dynamics (FrBD) framework for rolling contact problems. The proposed formulation extends the one-dimensional FrBD model to accommodate simultaneous longitudinal and lateral slips, spin, and arbitrary transport kinematics over a finite contact region. The derivation combines a rheological representation of the bristle element with an analytical local sliding-friction law. By relying on an application of the Implicit Function Theorem, the notion of sliding velocity is then eliminated, and a fully dynamic friction model, driven solely by the rigid relative velocity, is obtained. Building upon this local model, three distributed formulations of increasing complexity are introduced, covering standard linear rolling contact, as well as linear and semilinear rolling in the presence of large spin slips. For the linear formulations, well-posedness, stability, and passivity properties are investigated under standard assumptions. In particular, the analysis reveals that the model preserves passivity under almost any parametrisation of practical interest. Numerical simulations illustrate steady-state action surfaces, transient relaxation phenomena, and the effect of time-varying normal loads. The results provide a unified and mathematically tractable friction model applicable to a broad class of rolling contact systems.</description>

      <title>Fluoride doping into SiO2-MgO-CaO bioactive glass nanoparticles: bioactivity, biodegradation and biocompatibility assessments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this research, for the first time, the structure, bioactivity, biodegradation and biocompatibility of SiO2-MgO-CaO glasses doped with different levels of fluoride were studied. The glassy powder samples were synthesized by a coprecipitation method followed by calcination at 500 C, where amorphicity and fluoride incorporation were verified by X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy, respectively. The in vitro biomineralization and biodegradation of the samples were also investigated by electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry. These assessments revealed that there is an optimum level of fluoride doping to meet the highest bioactivity. Remarkably, the same level of incorporation presented the foremost biocompatibility with respect to osteoblast-like MG-63 human cells, as realized by the MTT assay and cell attachment studies.</description>

      <title>Co-doping of silicate bioceramics as a potential strategy to further enhance mono-doping consequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Silicate bioceramics have attracted significant attention in medical applications, particularly in hard tissue regeneration, because of their controllable chemical, physical, and biological functionalities, while ensuring biocompatibility. The coordination of silicate bioceramics with mono-dopants has been extensively studied to enhance their osteogenesis, angiogenesis, and antibacterial activity. However, the concept of employing dual or multiple co-doping to further enhance these biomaterials still demands more attention. This review paper originally focuses on the effect of chemical interactions among co-dopants and the principal constituents of the silicates, on the bio-behavior of these bioceramics. Additionally, future prospects of co-doped silicate bioceramics are outlined, including in vivo studies, clinical trials, and potential commercialization.</description>

      <title>Confinement-controlled chase-escape dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a minimal chase-and-escape model on a two-dimensional square lattice with randomly distributed static obstacles, focusing on how geometric disorder controls collective pursuit dynamics. Chasers and escapers move according to short-range sensing rules, while the density of obstacles tunes the connectivity of the accessible space. Using a combination of geometric analysis, dynamical observables, survival statistics, and transport characterization, we establish a direct link between lattice connectivity and pursuit efficiency. A Breadth-First Search analysis reveals that obstacle-induced fragmentation leads to a progressive loss of accessibility before the percolation threshold, defining the effective initial conditions for the dynamics. The trapping time and capture cost exhibit a non-monotonic dependence on obstacle density, reflecting a competition between path elongation in connected environments and geometric confinement near the percolation threshold. Survival analysis shows that the decay of the escaper population follows a Weibull form, with characteristic time and shape parameters displaying clear crossovers as a function of obstacle density, signaling the coexistence of cooperative capture and confinement-dominated trapping. Transport properties, quantified through the mean-squared displacement exponent, further support this picture, revealing sub-diffusive dynamics and a convergence toward a geometry-controlled regime near percolation. Overall, our results demonstrate that chase--and--escape dynamics in disordered environments are governed by a geometry-driven crossover, where percolation and connectivity act as unifying control parameters for spatial, temporal, and collective behavior.</description>

      <title>Electric field switching of altermagnetic spin-splitting in multiferroic skyrmions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions are localized magnetic structures that retain their shape and stability over time, thanks to their topological nature. Recent theoretical and experimental progress has laid the groundwork for understanding magnetic skyrmions characterized by negligible net magnetization and ultrafast dynamics. Notably, skyrmions emerging in materials with altermagnetism, a novel magnetic phase featuring lifted Kramers degeneracy-have remained unreported until now. In this study, we demonstrate that BiFeO3, a multiferroic renowned for its strong coupling between ferroelectricity and magnetism, can transit from a spin cycloid to a Neel-type skyrmion under antidamping spin-orbit torque at room temperature. Strikingly, the altermagnetic spin splitting within BiFeO3 skyrmion can be reversed through the application of an electric field, revealed via the Circular photogalvanic effect. This quasiparticle, which possesses a neutral topological charge, holds substantial promise for diverse applications-most notably, enabling the development of unconventional computing systems with low power consumption and magnetoelectric controllability.</description>

      <title>Influence of bending parameters on crystalline undulator radiation peak stability for 530 MeV positron channelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the stability of crystalline undulator radiation (CUR) peaks emitted by 530 MeV positron channelling in periodically bent C(110) crystals with varying bending amplitudes and bending periods. Relativistic molecular dynamics simulations were performed to quantify how these parameters affect the intensity and position of the CUR peak. The continuous potential approximation was used to identify isolines of constant peak energy, providing a reference for regions of spectral stability. MD results show that increasing the bending amplitude shifts the CUR peak to lower photon energies, while decreasing the period shifts it to higher energies, with both trends accompanied by enhanced dechannelling. For crystal parameters similar to recent experiments conducted at the MAinz MIkrotron (MAMI), the simulated CUR peak appears near 0.515 MeV. These results demonstrate that the CUR peak remains stable across a broad range of bending amplitudes and periods, establishing estimates of manufacturing tolerances for the design of gamma-ray crystal-based light sources.</description>

      <title>Case study of an exploratory high voltage NASICON-based Na$_4$NiCr(PO$_4$)$_3$ cathode material for sodium-ion batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine a new NASICON-type Na$_4$NiCr(PO$_4$)$_3$ material designed for high-voltage and multi-electron reactions for the sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). The Rietveld refinement of the X-ray diffraction pattern, using the R$\bar{3}$c space group, confirmed the stabilization of the rhombohedral NASICON framework. Furthermore, the Raman and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy are employed to probe the structure and chemical bonding. The core-level photoemission analysis reveals the Cr$^{3+}$ and mixed Ni$^{2+}$/Ni$^{3+}$ oxidation states in the sample. Moreover, the bond valence energy landscape (BVEL) analysis, based on the refined structure, revealed a three-dimensional network of well-connected sodium sites with a migration energy barrier of 0.468 eV. The material delivered a good charge capacity at around 4.5 V, but showed no sodium-ion intercalation during discharge, resulting in negligible discharge capacity. The post-mortem analysis confirmed that the crystal structure remained intact. The calculated energy barrier values indicated a reversal in sodium site stability after cycling, though the barriers can still permit feasible ion migration. This suggests that ion transport alone cannot explain the lack of reversibility, which likely arises from intrinsically poor electronic conductivity. These findings highlight key challenges in achieving stable, reversible capacity in this system and underscore the need for doping, structural modification, and electrolyte optimization to realize its full potential as a high-voltage SIB cathode.</description>

      <title>Optimizing the Design of a Simple Three-Sphere Magnetic Microswimmer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When swimming at low Reynolds numbers, inertial effects are negligible and reciprocal movements cannot induce net motion. Instead, symmetry breaking is necessary to achieve net propulsion. Directed swimming can be supported by magnetic fields, which simultaneously provide a versatile means of remote actuation. Thus, we analyze the motion of a straight microswimmer composed of three magnetizable beads connected by two elastic links. The swimming mechanism is based on oriented external magnetic fields that oscillate in magnitude. Through induced reversible hysteretic collapse of the two segments of the swimmer, the two pairs of beads jump into contact and separate nonreciprocally. Due to higher-order hydrodynamic interactions, net displacement results after each cycle. Different microswimmers can be tuned to different driving amplitudes and frequencies, allowing for simultaneous independent control by just one external magnetic field. The swimmer geometry and magnetic field shape are optimized for maximum swimming speed using an evolutionary optimization strategy. Thanks to the simple working principle, an experimental realization of such a microrobot seems feasible and may open new approaches for microinvasive medical interventions such as targeted drug delivery.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrated optical transceivers, utilizing wavelength-division-multiplexing, offer a path forward for implementation of compact, high-bandwidth and energy-efficient interconnects for future data centers. Here we report the demonstration of a monolithically integrated optical receiver in 45nm CMOS, where efficient multi-layer optical demultiplexing with capacitive tuning, energy efficient electronics and wideband inverse designed grating couplers enable implementation of a 32-channel receiver chip based on wavelength-division multiplexing. The chip operates at an aggregate data-rate of 1.024 Tb/s with all channels operating simultaneously at a data-rate of 32 Gb/s/channel achieving a record energy efficiency of 71 fJ/b, including the power consumption of both the electronic circuitry and the tuning and control of photonic devices, and a record bandwidth density of 4 Tb/s/mm2. The receiver achieves a bit-error-rate below 1E-12 without requiring equalization, error correction or digital processing. Inverse-designed broadband grating couplers provide efficient, low-loss optical coupling into the chip. An on-chip demultiplexer, composed of Mach-Zehnder interferometers (MZIs) and ring resonators, offers a large channel-to-channel isolation sufficient for error-free operation. Capacitive phase shifters embedded within the ring resonators of the demultiplexer are used for wavelength alignment at a zero static power consumption. MZIs and ring-resonators are periodically selected and autonomously locked to the wavelength of the corresponding optical carrier. The implemented monolithic receiver offers a scalable, energy-efficient and reliable solution for the beyond Tb/s optical interconnects.</description>

Abstract: Recent advances in mechanical metamaterials and piezoelectric energy harvesting provide exciting opportunities to guide and convert the mechanical energy in electromechanical systems for autonomous sensing and vibration control. However, practical realizations remain rare due to the lack of advanced modeling methods and interdisciplinary barriers. By integrating mechanical metamaterials with power electronics-based interface circuits, this paper makes a breakthrough with an electromechanical friction-induced metamaterial node, which realizes self-powered sensing and broadband vibration attenuation in the same time. A reduced-order modeling-based numerical harmonic balance method has been established for general nonlinear metamaterials with local nonlinearities, significantly enhancing computational efficiency. The electromechanical friction induced by synchronized switching interface circuits has been revealed for the first time, leading to energy harvesting abilities and the broader nonlinear bandgap and higher harmonics induced vibration attenuation. Experimentally, an electromechanical metamaterial node is realized for self-powered sensing of temperature and acceleration data, highlighting its potential for structural health monitoring and Internet of Things applications.

      <title>Pregnancy as a dynamical paradox: robustness, control and birth onset</title>

Abstract: The timing of human labor is among the most critical determinants of neonatal survival, yet the mechanisms that govern the transition from uterine quiescence to coordinated contractions remain elusive. Here we present a dynamical-systems framework that models the pregnant uterus as a spatially extended network of electrically excitable cells regulated by sparse adaptive feedback mimicking hormonal and mechanical influences. This approach reveals how stability during gestation and sensitivity near parturition can be simultaneously maintained through the interplay of control, network structure, and noise. Our analysis shows that spontaneous contractions such as Braxton-Hicks and Alvarez waves are not epiphenomena, but functional components that reduce control effort and preserve responsiveness. Moreover, we identify preterm labor as a boundary-crossing phenomenon arising when control fails to correctly interpret early-warning signals. These results establish a unifying mechanistic theory for labor onset, yield testable predictions, and suggest new therapeutic strategies to mitigate preterm birth risk.</description>

Abstract: The broad band resonant spin echo interferometer, CANISIUS, is presented. CANISIUS is built in a versatile way, such that it can be operated in both a continuous broad band beam or a pulsed Time of Flight beam. This versatility also extends to the modes available to the instrument, such as Neutron Resonant Spin Echo, Spin Echo (Modulated) Small Angle Neutron Scattering and coherent averaging to produce structured wavefunctions for scattering. The instrument may also be used as an interferometer, to probe fundamental questions in quantum mechanics. In this paper we detail both the continuous and Time of Flight options of the instruments. In addition we demonstrate the applicability of our interferometer to ultra small angle scattering in a white beam. Finally we demonstrate a new spin echo interferometry tool, which uses incomplete recombination of the two path states to generate composite wavefunctions with special structure. In particular we show that this method produces neutron wavefunctions that exist in a superposition of two quantum mechanical OAM modes, l =+1 or -1 We illustrate that just as this method can be used to generate certain structured waves, it may also be used to characterize the structure of the input wavefunction.</description>

      <title>An information-matching approach to optimal experimental design and active learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02740v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The efficacy of mathematical models heavily depends on the quality of the training data, yet collecting sufficient data is often expensive and challenging. Many modeling applications require inferring parameters only as a means to predict other quantities of interest (QoI). Because models often contain many unidentifiable (sloppy) parameters, QoIs often depend on a relatively small number of parameter combinations. Therefore, we introduce an information-matching criterion based on the Fisher Information Matrix to select the most informative training data from a candidate pool. This method ensures that the selected data contain sufficient information to learn only those parameters that are needed to constrain downstream QoIs. It is formulated as a convex optimization problem, making it scalable to large models and datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach across various modeling problems in diverse scientific fields, including power systems and underwater acoustics. Finally, we use information-matching as a query function within an Active Learning loop for material science applications. In all these applications, we find that a relatively small set of optimal training data can provide the necessary information for achieving precise predictions. These results are encouraging for diverse future applications, particularly active learning in large machine learning models.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional quantum anomalous Hall effect in Weyl semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01399v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) is a quantum phenomenon in which a two-dimensional system exhibits a quantized Hall resistance $h/e^2$ in the absence of magnetic field, where $h$ is the Planck constant and $e$ is the electron charge. In this work, we extend this novel phase to three dimensions and thus propose a three-dimensional QAHE exhibiting richer and more versatile transport behaviors. We first confirm this three-dimensional QAHE through the quantized Chern number, then establish its bulk-boundary correspondence, and finally reaffirm it via the distinctive transport properties. Remarkably, we find that the three-dimensional QAHE hosts two chiral surface states along one spatial direction while a pair of chiral hinge states along another direction, and the location of the hinge states depends sensitively on the Fermi energy. These two types of boundary states are further connected through a perpendicular chiral surface states, whose chirality is also Fermi energy dependent. Consequently, depending on the transport direction, its Hall resistance can quantize to $0$, $h/e^2$, or $\pm h/e^2$ when the Fermi energy is tuned across the charge neutral point. This three-dimensional QAHE not only fill the gap in the Hall effect family but also holds significant potentials in device applications such as in-memory computing.</description>

      <title>Metasurfaces-Enabled Wave Computing for Future Wireless Systems: Opportunities and Challenges</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05173v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The next generations of wireless networks are envisioned to integrate communications, sensing, and computing into a unified platform, demanding ultra-high data rates, submillisecond latency, and unprecedented energy efficiency. However, conventional digital processors face limitations in scalability, cost, and power consumption that hinder this vision. Wave computing, enabled by programmable metasurfaces, offers an alternative paradigm according to which signal processing operations are implemented in the domain of the propagation of electromagnetic waves. This approach transforms metasurfaces from passive wavefront shapers into functional analog processors capable of executing tasks such as beamforming, sensing, imaging, and machine learning at the speed of light with minimal power consumption. This article provides an overview of metasurface-enabled wave computing, highlighting its fundamental principles and key application scenarios for future wireless systems, including integrated sensing and communications, artificial intelligence acceleration, over-the-air channel estimation, and computational electromagnetic imaging. Future research directions are outlined in response to the major open challenges of the technology, aiming to enable large-scale deployment of wave computing in practical wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Radiation-induced Instability of Organic-Inorganic Halide Perovskite Single Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06222v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Organic-inorganic halide perovskites (OIHPs) are promising optoelectronic materials, but their instability under radiation environments restricts their durability and practical applications. Here we employ electron and synchrotron X-ray beams, individually, to investigate the radiation-induced instability of two types of OIHP single crystals (FAPbBr3 and MAPbBr3). Under the electron beam, we observe that 3-point star-style cracks grow on the surface of FAPbBr3, and bricklayer-style cracks are formed on the surface of MAPbBr3. Under the X-ray beam, a new composition without organic components appears in both FAPbBr3 and MAPbBr3. Such cracking and composition changes are attributed to the volatilization of organic components. We propose a volume-strain-based mechanism, in which the energy conversion results from the organic cation loss. Using nanoindentation, we reveal that beam radiations reduce the Youngs modulus and increase the hardness of both OIHPs. This study provides valuable insights into the structural and mechanical stabilities of OIHP single crystals in radiation environments.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric power factors of defective scandium nitride nanostructures from first principles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14762v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The thermoelectric properties of scandium nitride are strongly influenced by structural and electronic factors arising from defects and impurities. Nevertheless, the mechanisms by which these microscopic features affect transport are not yet fully understood. Experiments show a large variability in the electronic transport properties, with a strong dependence on the experimental conditions, and attempts to improve thermoelectric efficiency often lead to conflicting effects. In this work, we employ the Landauer approach to analyze the effects of different kinds of structural defects and impurities on electronic transport in scandium nitride. This approach allows us to relate the transport mechanisms to the structural and electronic modifications introduced in the lattice, with atomistic resolution. In light of these new insights, we propose a rationale relating part of the experimental variability to its microscopic origin.</description>

      <title>Dynamically stable optical trapping of thermophoretically active Janus colloids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.21088v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ability to optically trap and manipulate artificial microswimmers such as active Janus particles (JPs) provides a breakthrough in active matter research and applications. However, it presents significant challenges because of the asymmetry in the optical properties of JPs and remains incomprehensible. Illustrating the interplay between optical and thermophoretic forces, we demonstrate dynamically stable optical trapping of Pt-silica JPs, where the force-balanced position evolves spontaneously within a localized volume around the focal point and in a vertically shifted annular confinement at low and high laser powers, respectively. Intriguingly, the orientational and orbital dynamics of JP remain strongly coupled in the delocalized confinement. Furthermore, we demonstrate simultaneous optical trapping of multiple JPs. This first report on thermophoresis of Pt-silica JPs and localized-to-delocalized crossover in the position distributions of an optically trapped active JP, verifying theoretical predictions, advances our understanding on confined active matter and their experimental realizations.</description>

      <title>Transverse superconducting diode without parity and time-reversal violation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01560v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The superconducting diode effect (SDE) is characterized by its nonreciprocal nature in critical supercurrents. However, realizing a longitudinal SDE typically requires simultaneous time-reversal ($\mathcal{T}$) and inversion ($\mathcal{P}$) symmetry breaking in the device, raising challenges in applications. In this Letter, we reveal that an off-axis direct-current bias applied to a planar anisotropic superconductor can convert intrinsic anisotropy into transverse nonreciprocity, generating ultra-tunable SDE without breaking either $\mathcal{P}$ or $\mathcal{T}$ symmetry. Using both Ginzburg-Landau theory and self-consistent mean-field calculations, we show that diode efficiency can be continuously tuned via bias current amplitude. Notably, when the injected bias current exceeds a critical threshold, the system is driven into a ``unidirectional superconductivity" regime, where transverse dissipationless currents are permitted in only one direction. Based on this mechanism, we propose the ``current-gated orthogonal superconducting transistor (CGOST)" and demonstrate its utility in tunable supercurrent range controllers and half-wave rectifiers. Our findings open new avenues for nonreciprocal superconducting electronics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04136v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent rapid deployment of datacenter infrastructures for performing large language models (LLMs) and related artificial intelligence (AI) applications in the clouds is predicted to incur an exponentially growing energy consumption in the near-term future. In this paper, we propose and analyze the implementation of the transformer model, which is the cornerstone of the modern LLMs, with novel large-scale optoelectronic neurons (OENs) constructed over a complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) compatible platform. With all of the required optoelectronic devices and electronic circuits integrated in a chiplet only about 2 cm by 3 cm in size, 175 billon parameters in the case of GPT-3 are shown to perform inference at an unprecedented speed of 12.6 POPS using only 40 nm CMOS process node, orchestrated by an optoelectronic version of systolic array with no data skew and negligible propagation delay, along with a high power efficiency of 74 TOPS/W and a high area efficiency of 19 TOPS/mm^2. The influence of the quantization formats and the hardware induced errors are numerically investigated, and are shown to have a minimal impact. Our study presents a new yet practical path toward analog neural processing units (NPUs) to complement existing digital processing units.</description>

      <title>Empirical Quantum Advantage in Constrained Optimization from Encoded Unitary Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14296v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Constraint-Enhanced Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (CE-QAOA), a shallow, constraint-aware ansatz that operates inside the one-hot product space [n]^m, where m is the number of blocks and each block is initialized in an n-qubit W_n state. We give an ancilla-free, depth-optimal encoder that prepares W_n using n-1 two-qubit rotations per block, and a two-local block-XY mixer that preserves the one-hot manifold and has a constant spectral gap on the one-excitation sector. At the level of expressivity, we establish per-block controllability, implying approximate universality per block. At the level of distributional behavior, we show that, after natural block and symbol permutation twirls, shallow CE-QAOA realizes an encoded unitary 1-design and supports approximate second-moment (2-design) behavior; combined with a Paley-Zygmund argument, this yields finite-shot anticoncentration guarantees.
  Algorithmically, we wrap constant-depth sampling with a deterministic feasibility checker to obtain a polynomial-time hybrid quantum-classical solver (PHQC) that returns the best observed feasible solution in O(S n^2) time, where S is a polynomial shot budget. We obtain two advantages. First, when CE-QAOA fixes r &gt;= 1 locations different from the start city, we achieve a Theta(n^r) reduction in shot complexity even against a classical sampler that draws uniformly from the feasible set. Second, against a classical baseline restricted to raw bitstring sampling, we show an exp(Theta(n^2)) minimax separation. In noiseless circuit simulations of traveling salesman problem instances with n in {4,...,10} locations from the QOPTLib benchmark library, we recover the global optimum at depth p = 1 using polynomial shot budgets and coarse parameter grids defined by the problem size.</description>

      <title>Efficient calculation of magnetic fields from ferromagnetic materials near strong electromagnets, and application to stellarator coil optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17305v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In fusion reactor design, steels under consideration for the blanket are ferromagnetic, so the steel's effect on the plasma physics must be examined. For efficient calculation of these fields, we can exploit the fact that the magnetic material gives a small perturbation relative to the fields from the electromagnetic coils and plasma. Moreover the magnetization is saturated due to the strong fields in typical fusion systems. These approximations significantly reduce the nonlinearity of the problem, so the magnetic materials can be described by an array of point dipoles of known magnitude, oriented in the direction of the coil and plasma field. The approach is verified by comparison to finite-element calculations with commercial software and shown to be accurate. As no linear or nonlinear solve is required, only evaluation of Biot-Savart-type integrals, the method here is significantly simpler to implement than other methods, and extremely fast. The method is compatible with arbitrary CAD geometry, and also allows rapid computation of the magnetic forces. We demonstrate adding the ferromagnetic effects to free-boundary MHD equilibrium calculations, assessing the effect on plasma properties such as confinement and stability. Moreover, it is straightforward to differentiate through the model to get the derivative of the field with respect to the electromagnet parameters. We thereby demonstrate gradient-based coil optimization for a quasi-isodynamic stellarator in which the field contribution from a ferromagnetic blanket is included. Even a significant steel volume is found to have little impact on the plasma physics properties, with the main effects being a slight destabilization of ballooning modes and a radial shift of the edge islands due to decrease in rotational transform. Both issues are corrected by minor reoptimization of the coil shapes to account for the field from the steel.</description>

      <title>Design of Microlens Arrays for Thermal Imaging with Spintronic Poisson Bolometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12491v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Infrared (IR) detectors are widely used for their ability to sense thermal radiation. Recently, a room-temperature infrared detector known as the spintronic Poisson bolometer was introduced. Operating in a probabilistic regime governed by Poissonian counting statistics, it establishes a fundamentally different detection mechanism with the potential to beat conventional sensitivity limits. While offering fast digital readout, its sensitivity is currently limited by a small active area and array fill factor. In this work, we present design guidelines for spherical plano-convex microlens arrays that enhance light collection in spintronic Poisson bolometer arrays in the mid-wave infrared (MWIR). Guided by the simulations, we fabricate a microlens array sample to demonstrate that the chosen geometrical parameters are realistic and compatible with the fabrication process. A unique radiometric-stochastic model is used to quantify the resulting sensitivity improvements. Our work is the first systematic integration of microlens design with spintronic Poisson bolometer arrays, bridging microphotonics, spintronics, and thermal imaging.</description>

Abstract: Wavefunction collapse is commonly associated with unavoidable physical disturbance of the measured system. Here we show that in driven-dissipative quantum systems, continuous measurement can induce strong trajectory-level collapse while leaving the ensemble-averaged steady state strictly invariant. We identify measurement-invariant steady states whose unconditional density matrix remains unchanged under continuous monitoring, despite pronounced measurement-induced localization in conditioned quantum trajectories. This separation between trajectory-level collapse and ensemble invariance defines a regime of partial collapse, in which measurement-induced localization is continuously counteracted by dissipative dynamics. We derive a necessary and sufficient condition for steady-state invariance under continuous measurement and identify Liouvillian symmetry as a concrete dynamical mechanism enforcing it. Our results clarify the distinction between conditional collapse and physical disturbance in open quantum systems and provide a framework for non-invasive continuous monitoring in driven-dissipative settings.</description>

      <title>Casimir Arc Plate Geometry: Computational Analysis of Thickness Constraints for Gold and Silver Nanomembranes in MEMS Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22352</link>

Abstract: A theoretical analysis of the Casimir interaction between an arc and plate is conducted, which remains unexplored despite its relevance to Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) fabrication. The configuration consists of a rigid finite plate and a flexible curved nanomembrane, with radius 100 micrometers, initially concave toward the rigid plate. The maximum thickness is evaluated for which the nanomembrane undergoes a change in curvature: from concave to convex with respect to the plate, due to the Casimir interaction. The Casimir energy for a curved surface is derived using the Proximity Force Approximation (PFA) with next-to-leading-order (NTLO) corrections. Kirchhoff-Love theory for a thin isotropic plate of constant thickness is used to estimate the bending energy. Material-dependent effects on the Casimir interaction are evaluated by comparing Au and Ag plates. The maximum thickness is derived where U_Casimir &gt; U_bending for distances in the range of 0.1-1 micrometers. Results show curvature reversal occurs for nanomembranes with nanoscale thicknesses at the studied distances. Silver nanomembranes tolerate greater thickness than gold nanomembranes due to material-dependent properties. Comparison between NTLO-corrected PFA and perturbative PFA confirms the accuracy of the NTLO approach. The Casimir arc-to-plate geometry in MEMS enables Casimir-based actuation, enhances devices reliability, and prevents stiction. These findings provide thickness constraints for MEMS design and performance, accounting for the Casimir force.</description>
