      <title>Patchwork: A Unified Framework for RAG Serving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a new paradigm for enhancing Large Language Model reliability through integration with external knowledge sources. However, efficient deployment of these systems presents significant technical challenges due to their inherently heterogeneous computational pipelines comprising LLMs, databases, and specialized processing components. We introduce Patchwork, a comprehensive end-to-end RAG serving framework designed to address these efficiency bottlenecks. Patchwork's architecture offers three key innovations: First, it provides a flexible specification interface enabling users to implement custom RAG pipelines. Secondly, it deploys these pipelines as distributed inference systems while optimizing for the unique scalability characteristics of individual RAG components. Third, Patchwork incorporates an online scheduling mechanism that continuously monitors request load and execution progress, dynamically minimizing SLO violations through strategic request prioritization and resource auto-scaling. Our experimental evaluation across four distinct RAG implementations demonstrates that Patchwork delivers substantial performance improvements over commercial alternatives, achieving throughput gains exceeding 48% while simultaneously reducing SLO violations by ~24%.</description>

      <title>Work-in-Progress: Multi-Deadline DAG Scheduling Model for Autonomous Driving Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06780v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autoware is an autonomous driving system implemented on Robot Operation System (ROS) 2, where an end-to-end timing guarantee is crucial to ensure safety. However, existing ROS 2 cause-effect chain models for analyzing end-to-end latency struggle to accurately represent the complexities of Autoware, particularly regarding sync callbacks, queue consumption patterns, and feedback loops. To address these problems, we propose a new scheduling model that decomposes the end-to-end timing constraints of Autoware into local relative deadlines for each sub-DAG. This multi-deadline DAG scheduling model avoids the need for complex analysis of data flows through queues and loops, while ensuring that all callbacks receive data within correct intervals. Furthermore, we extend the Global Earliest Deadline First (GEDF) algorithm for the proposed model and evaluate its effectiveness using a synthetic workload derived from Autoware.</description>
