      <title>Neural Expectation Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces \textbf{Measure Learning}, a paradigm for modeling ambiguity via non-linear expectations. We define Neural Expectation Operators as solutions to Backward Stochastic Differential Equations (BSDEs) whose drivers are parameterized by neural networks. The main mathematical contribution is a rigorous well-posedness theorem for BSDEs whose drivers satisfy a local Lipschitz condition in the state variable $y$ and quadratic growth in its martingale component $z$. This result circumvents the classical global Lipschitz assumption, is applicable to common neural network architectures (e.g., with ReLU activations), and holds for exponentially integrable terminal data, which is the sharp condition for this setting. Our primary innovation is to build a constructive bridge between the abstract, and often restrictive, assumptions of the deep theory of quadratic BSDEs and the world of machine learning, demonstrating that these conditions can be met by concrete, verifiable neural network designs. We provide constructive methods for enforcing key axiomatic properties, such as convexity, by architectural design. The theory is extended to the analysis of fully coupled Forward-Backward SDE systems and to the asymptotic analysis of large interacting particle systems, for which we establish both a Law of Large Numbers (propagation of chaos) and a Central Limit Theorem. This work provides the foundational mathematical framework for data-driven modeling under ambiguity.</description>

      <title>Pinning models with contact number constraint: the effect of disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10707v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Disordered pinning models are statistical mechanics models built on discrete renewal processes: renewal epochs in this context are called contacts. It is well known that pinning models can undergo a localization/delocalization phase transition: in the localized phase the typical density of contacts is positive and the largest gap between contacts is at most of the order of the logarithm of the size $n$ of the system, whereas the system is void of contacts in the delocalized phase. When disorder is absent and the phase transition is discontinuous, conditioning the contact density to be positive but smaller than the minimum typical density in the localized phase has the effect of forcing to create one, and only one, macroscopic gap between two contacts, while the rest of the configuration keeps the characteristics of a localized state. However it is known that, in the presence of (bounded) disorder, this big jump phenomenon is no longer observed, in the sense that the largest gap in the conditioned system is $o(n)$. Under minimal integrability conditions on the disorder we show that the conditioned system is localized in a very strong sense, in particular the largest gap is $O(\log n)$. The proof is achieved by exploiting the improved understanding of the localized phase of disordered pinning models developed in [34] and by establishing some refined estimates, in particular a quenched Local Central Limit Theorem. We also present an analysis of the effect of disorder on the large deviation rate function of the contact density and, as an important ingredient for the generality of our results, we establish a smoothing inequality for pinning models under minimal integrability conditions, thus generalizing [11,32].</description>

      <title>Universal diameter bounds for random graphs with given degrees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$, let $\mathrm{diam}(G)$ be the greatest distance between any two vertices of $G$ which lie in the same connected component, and let $\mathrm{diam}^+(G)$ be the greatest distance between any two vertices of $G$; so $\mathrm{diam}^+(G)=\infty$ if $G$ is not connected.
  Fix a sequence $(d_1,\ldots,d_n)$ of positive integers, and let $\mathbf{G}$ be a uniformly random connected simple graph with $V(\mathbf{G})=[n]:=\{1,\ldots,n\}$ such that $\mathrm{deg}_{\mathbf{G}}(v)=d_v$ for all $v \in [n]$. We show that, unless a $1-o(1)$ proportion of vertices have degree $2$, then $\mathbb{E}[\mathrm{diam}(\mathbf{G})]=O(\sqrt{n})$. It is not hard to see that this bound is best possible for general degree sequences (and in particular in the case of trees, in which $\sum_{v=1}^n d_v = 2(n-1)$). We also prove that this bound holds without the connectivity constraint. As a key input to the proofs, we show that graphs with minimum degree $3$ are with high probability connected and have logarithmic diameter: if $\min(d_1,\ldots,d_n) \ge 3$ then $\mathrm{diam}^+(\mathbf{G})=O_{\mathbb{P}}(\log n)$; this bound is also best possible.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cylindrical Hastings-Levitov$(0)$ admits a single infinite connected tree (arm). For a cylinder of width $N$, and particles of size $\lambda$, we consider the last time $\upsilon_{N, \lambda}$, that a finite tree receives a particle. We prove that $\frac{cN^2}{\lambda^3}&lt;\mathbb{E}[\upsilon_{N, \lambda}]&lt; \frac{CN^2}{\lambda^3}$. Furthermore, we establish an exponential tail for $\upsilon_{N, \lambda}$.</description>

      <title>Tube formula for spherically contoured random fields with subexponential marginals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is widely known that the tube method, or equivalently the Euler characteristic heuristic, provides a very accurate approximation for the tail probability that the supremum of a smooth Gaussian random field exceeds a threshold value $c$. The relative approximation error $\Delta(c)$ is exponentially small as a function of $c$ when $c$ tends to infinity. On the other hand, little is known about non-Gaussian random fields.
  In this paper, we obtain the approximation error of the tube method applied to the canonical isotropic random fields on a unit sphere defined by $u\mapsto\langle u,\xi\rangle$, $u\in M\subset\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$, where $\xi$ is a spherically contoured random vector. These random fields have statistical applications in multiple testing and simultaneous regression inference when the unknown variance is estimated. The decay rate of the relative error $\Delta(c)$ depends on the tail of the distribution of $\|\xi\|^2$ and the critical radius of the index set $M$. If this distribution is subexponential but not regularly varying, $\Delta(c)\to 0$ as $c\to\infty$. However, in the regularly varying case, $\Delta(c)$ does not vanish and hence is not negligible. To address this limitation, we provide simple upper and lower bounds for $\Delta(c)$ and for the tube formula itself. Numerical studies are conducted to assess the accuracy of the asymptotic approximation.</description>

      <title>Finding the Smallest Possible Exact Aggregation of a Markov Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Markov chains are an important tool for modelling and evaluating systems in computer science, economics, biology and numerous other fields. Thus, approximating Markov chains is a useful tool for decreasing the computational effort needed for analysis by reducing the size of the state space. So far, most approximative algorithms focused on finding approximations, which are, again, Markov chains. We remove this restriction and present an algorithm using the Arnoldi iteration. Further, we show that if these approximations are without error, they are of minimal size. Lastly, we implement the algorithm for Markov chains via the Arnoldi iteration. If another type of aggregation, so-called Exlump aggregations, can find an exact aggregation for a Markov chain, they usually yield similar or smaller errors at much lower runtime. On the contrary, approximations computed via the Arnoldi iteration can find usable aggregations where Exlump yields none. Still, runtime is a primary concern, as our criterion for determining the approximate state space size is exceptionally costly. As such, further work is needed to decrease the runtime of the Arnoldi approach.</description>

      <title>Large deviations for general Markov chains on discrete state spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the large deviations of Markov chains under the sole assumption that the state space is discrete. In particular, we do not require any of the usual irreducibility and exponential tightness assumptions. Using subadditive arguments, we provide an elementary and self-contained proof of the level-2 and level-3 large deviation principles. Due to the possible reducibility of the Markov chain, the rate functions may be nonconvex and may differ, outside a specific set, from the Donsker-Varadhan entropy and other classical rate functions.</description>

      <title>Strategic Customer Behavior in an M/M/1 Feedback Queue with General Payoffs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an M/M/1 feedback queue in which service attempts may fail, requiring the customer to rejoin the queue. Arriving customers act strategically, deciding whether to join the queue based on a threshold strategy that depends on the number of customers present. Their decisions balance the expected service reward against the costs associated with waiting, while accounting for the behavior of others.
  This model was first analyzed by Fackrell, Taylor and Wang (2021), who assumed that waiting costs were a linear function of the time in the system. They showed that increasing the reward for successful service or allowing reneging can paradoxically make all customers worse off. In this paper, we adopt a different setting in which waiting does not incur direct costs, but service rewards are subject to discounting over time. We show that under this assumption, paradoxical effects can still arise.
  Furthermore, we develop a numerical method to recover the sojourn time distribution under a threshold strategy and demonstrate how this can be used to derive equilibrium strategies under other payoff metrics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper discusses a special class of nonlinear Hawkes processes, where the rate function is the exponential function. We call these processes loglinear Hawkes processes. In the main theorem, we give sufficient conditions for explosion and nonexplosion that cover a large class of practically relevant memory functions. We also investigate stability. In particular, we show that for nonpositive memory functions the loglinear Hawkes process is stable. The paper aims at providing a theoretical basis for further research and applications of these processes.</description>

      <title>Markov approximation for controlled Hawkes Jump-Diffusions with general kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a Markov approximation for jump-diffusions whose jump part consists in a Hawkes process with intensity driven by a general (possibly non-monotone) kernel. Under minimal integrability conditions, the kernel can be approximated by a linear combination of exponential functions. This implies that Hawkes jump-diffusions can be approximated with Markov jump-diffusions. We illustrate the usefulness of this approximation by applying it to a class of stochastic control problems.</description>

      <title>Randomised Euler-Maruyama Method for SDEs with H\"older Continuous Drift Coefficient Driven by $\alpha$-stable L\'evy Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the performance of randomised Euler-Maruyama (EM) method for additive time-inhomogeneous SDEs with an irregular drift driven by symmetric $\alpha$-table process, $\alpha\in (1,2)$. In particular, the drift is assumed to be $\beta$-H\"older continuous in time and bounded $\eta$-H\"older continuous in space with $\beta,\eta\in (0,1]$. The strong order of convergence of the randomised EM in $L^p$-norm is shown to be $1/2+(\beta \wedge (\eta/\alpha)\wedge(1/2))-\varepsilon$ for an arbitrary $\varepsilon\in (0,1/2)$, higher than the one of standard EM, which cannot exceed $\beta$. The result for the case of $\alpha \in (1,2)$ extends the almost optimal order of convergence of randomised EM obtained in (arXiv:2501.15527) for SDEs driven by Gaussian noise ($\alpha=2$), and coincides with the performance of EM method in simulating time-homogenous SDEs driven by $\alpha$-stable process considered in (arXiv:2208.10052). Various experiments are presented to validate the theoretical performance.</description>

Abstract: We consider generalizations of open ASEP in the interval and half-space, where the speed of the reservoir dynamics can depend on the local particle configuration. We show that their height functions have a continuum limit given by the open KPZ equation. This removes the assumption of Liggett's condition in Corwin-Shen '18 and Parekh '19, thus answering a question of Corwin, and it also removes the assumption of product invariant measures in Goncalves-Perkowski-Simon '20.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the optimal investment behavior of renewable electricity producers in a competitive market, where both prices and installation costs are influenced by aggregate industry activity. We model the resulting crowding effects using a mean field game framework, capturing the strategic interactions among a continuum of heterogeneous producers. The equilibrium dynamics are characterized via a coupled system of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman and Fokker-Planck equations, which describe the value function of a representative producer and the evolution of the distribution of installed capacities over time. We analyze both deterministic and stochastic versions of the model, providing analytical insights in tractable cases and developing numerical methods to approximate the general solution. Simulation results illustrate how aggregate investment responds to changing market conditions, cost structures, and exogenous productivity shocks.</description>

      <title>Eigenvalue Bounds for Symmetric Markov Chains on Multislices With Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider random walks on ``balanced multislices'' of any ``grid'' that respects the ``symmetries'' of the grid, and show that a broad class of such walks are good spectral expanders. (A grid is a set of points of the form $\mathcal{S}^n$ for finite $\mathcal{S}$, and a balanced multi-slice is the subset that contains an equal number of coordinates taking every value in $\mathcal{S}$. A walk respects symmetries if the probability of going from $u = (u_1,\ldots,u_n)$ to $v = (v_1,\ldots,v_n)$ is invariant under simultaneous permutations of the coordinates of $u$ and $v$.) Our main theorem shows that, under some technical conditions, every such walk where a single step leads to an almost $\mathcal{O}(1)$-wise independent distribution on the next state, conditioned on the previous state, satisfies a non-trivially small singular value bound.
  We give two applications of our theorem to error-correcting codes: (1) We give an analog of the Ore-DeMillo-Lipton-Schwartz-Zippel lemma for polynomials, and junta-sums, over balanced multislices. (2) We also give a local list-correction algorithm for $d$-junta-sums mapping an arbitrary grid $\mathcal{S}^n$ to an Abelian group, correcting from a near-optimal $(\frac{1}{|\mathcal{S}|^{d}} - \varepsilon)$ fraction of errors for every $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, where a $d$-junta-sum is a sum of (arbitrarily many) $d$-juntas (and a $d$-junta is a function that depends on only $d$ of the $n$ variables).
  Our proofs are obtained by exploring the representation theory of the symmetric group and merging it with some careful spectral analysis.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Modeling of Antibody Kinetics Post Infection and Vaccination: A Markov Chain Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of antibody levels is crucial for characterizing the time-dependent response to immune events: either infections or vaccinations. The sequence and timing of these events significantly influence antibody level changes. Despite extensive interest in the topic in the recent years and many experimental studies, the effect of immune event sequences on antibody levels is not well understood. Moreover, disease or vaccination prevalence in the population are time-dependent. This, alongside the complexities of personal antibody kinetics, makes it difficult to analyze a sample immune measurement from a population. As a solution, we design a rigorous mathematical characterization in terms of a time-inhomogeneous Markov chain model for event-to-event transitions coupled with a probabilistic framework for the post-event antibody kinetics of multiple immune events. We demonstrate that this is an ideal model for immune event sequences, referred to as personal trajectories. This novel modeling framework surpasses the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) characterizations by rigorously tracking the probability distribution of population antibody response across time. To illustrate our ideas, we apply our mathematical framework to longitudinal severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) data from individuals with multiple documented infection and vaccination events. Our work is an important step towards a comprehensive understanding of antibody kinetics that could lead to an effective way to analyze the protective power of natural immunity or vaccination, predict missed immune events at an individual level, and inform booster timing recommendations.</description>

      <title>Rapid Mixing of Glauber Dynamics for Monotone Systems via Entropic Independence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the mixing time of Glauber dynamics on monotone systems. For monotone systems satisfying the entropic independence condition, we prove a new mixing time comparison result for Glauber dynamics. For concrete applications, we obtain $\tilde{O}(n)$ mixing time for the random cluster model induced by the ferromagnetic Ising model with consistently biased external fields, and $\tilde{O}(n^2)$ mixing time for the bipartite hardcore model under the one-sided uniqueness condition, where $n$ is the number of variables in corresponding models, improving the best known results in [Chen and Zhang, SODA'23] and [Chen, Liu, and Yin, FOCS'23], respectively.
  Our proof combines ideas from the stochastic dominance argument in the classical censoring inequality and the recently developed high-dimensional expanders. The key step in the proof is a novel comparison result between the Glauber dynamics and the field dynamics for monotone systems.</description>

      <title>Markov dualities via the spectral decompositions of the two Markov generators in their bi-orthogonal basis of right and left eigenvectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The notion of Markov duality between two Markov processes that can live in two different configurations spaces $(x,{\tilde x})$ is revisited via the spectral decompositions of the two Markov generators in their bi-orthogonal basis of right and left eigenvectors. In this formulation, the two generators should have the same eigenvalues $(-E)$ that may be complex, while the duality function $\Omega(x,{\tilde x})$ can be considered as a mapping between the right and the left eigenvectors of the two models. We describe how this spectral perspective is useful to better understand two well-known dualities between processes defined in the same configuration space: the Time-Reversal duality corresponds to an exchange between the right and the left eigenvectors that involves the steady state, while in the Siegmund duality, the left eigenvectors correspond to integrals of the dual right eigenvectors. We then focus on the famous Moment-Duality between the Wright-Fisher diffusion on the interval $x \in [0,1] $ and the Kingman Markov jump process on the semi-infinite lattice $n \in {\mathbb N}$ in order to analyze the relations between their eigenvectors living in two different configuration spaces. Finally, we discuss how the spectral perspective can be used to construct new dualities and we give an example for the case of non-degenerate real eigenvalues, where one can always construct a dual Directed Jump process on the semi-infinite lattice $n \in {\mathbb N}$, whose transitions rates are the opposite-eigenvalues.</description>

      <title>Improved sampling algorithms and Poincar\'e inequalities for non-log-concave distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of sampling from a distribution $\mu$ with density $\propto e^{-V}$ for some potential function $V:\mathbb R^d\to \mathbb R$ with query access to $V$ and $\nabla V$. We start with the following standard assumptions:
  (1) The potential function $V$ is $L$-smooth.
  (2) The second moment $\mathbf{E}_{X\sim \mu}[\|X\|^2]\leq M$.
  Recently, He and Zhang (COLT'25) showed that the query complexity of sampling from such distributions is at least $\left(\frac{LM}{d\epsilon}\right)^{\Omega(d)}$ where $\epsilon$ is the desired accuracy in total variation distance, and the Poincar\'e constant can be arbitrarily large.
  Meanwhile, another common assumption in the study of diffusion based samplers (see e.g., the work of Chen, Chewi, Li, Li, Salim and Zhang (ICLR'23)) strengthens the smoothness condition (1) to the following:
  (1*) The potential function of *every* distribution along the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process starting from $\mu$ is $L$-smooth.
  We show that under the assumptions (1*) and (2), the query complexity of sampling from $\mu$ can be $\mathrm{poly}(L,d)\cdot \left(\frac{Ld+M}{\epsilon^2}\right)^{\mathcal{O}(L+1)}$, which is polynomial in $d$ and $\frac{1}{\epsilon}$ when $L=\mathcal{O}(1)$ and $M=\mathrm{poly}(d)$. This improves the algorithm with quasi-polynomial query complexity developed by Huang et al. (COLT'24). Our results imply that the seemly moderate strengthening of the smoothness condition (1) to (1*) can lead to an exponential gap in the query complexity of sampling algorithms.
  Moreover, we show that together with the assumption (1*) and the stronger moment assumption that $\|X\|$ is $\lambda$-sub-Gaussian for $X\sim\mu$, the Poincar\'e constant of $\mu$ is at most $\mathcal{O}(\lambda)^{2(L+1)}$. As an application of our technique, we obtain improved estimate of the Poincar\'e constant for mixture of Gaussians with the same covariance.</description>

      <title>Extropy Rate: Properties and Application in Feature Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extropy, a complementary dual of entropy, (proposed by Lad et al. \cite{lad2015extropy} in 2015) has attracted considerable interest from the research community. In this study, we focus on discrete random variables and define conditional extropy, establishing key properties of joint and conditional extropy such as bounds, uncertainty reduction due to additional information, and Lipschitz continuity. We further introduce the concept of extropy rate for a stochastic process of discrete random variables as a measure of the average uncertainty per random variable within the process. It is observed that for infinite stationary and ergodic stochastic processes, as well as for identically and independently distributed sequences, the extropy rate exhibits asymptotic equivalence. We explore the extropy rate for finite stochastic processes and numerically illustrate its effectiveness in capturing the underlying information across various distributions, quantifying complexity in time series data, and characterizing chaotic dynamics in dynamical systems. The behaviour of estimated extropy rate is observed to be closely aligned with Simpson's diversity index. The real-life applicability of the extropy rate is presented through a novel feature selection method based on the fact that features with higher extropy rates contain greater inherent information. Using six publicly available datasets, we show the superiority of the proposed feature selection method over some other existing popular approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a stochastic version of the classical RAGE theorem that applies to the two-point motion generated by noisy transport equations. As a consequence, we identify a necessary and sufficient condition for the corresponding diffusive equation to be dissipation enhancing. This involves the identification of a non-trivial, finite dimensional subspace that is invariant for the family of self-adjoint operator characterizing the structure of the transport noise. We discuss several examples and prove a sharp enhanced dissipation rate for stochastic shear flows.</description>

      <title>The stability of long-range order in disordered systems: A generalized Ding-Zhuang argument</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stability of long-range order against quenched disorder is a central problem in statistical mechanics. This paper develops a generalized framework extending the Ding-Zhuang method and integrated with the Pirogov-Sinai framework, establishing a systematic scheme for studying phase transitions of long-range order in disordered systems. We axiomatize the Ding-Zhuang approach into a theoretical framework consisting of the Peierls condition and a local symmetry condition. For systems in dimensions $d \geq 3$ satisfying these conditions, we prove the persistence of long-range order at low temperatures and under weak disorder, with multiple coexisting distinct Gibbs states. The framework's versatility is demonstrated for diverse models, providing a systematic extension of Peierls methods to disordered systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2008.03255v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores the process of optimal quantization for several types of discrete probability distributions. Quantization is a technique used to approximate a complex distribution with a smaller set of representative points, which is important in fields such as data compression and signal processing. We begin by examining two specific nonuniform distributions over a finite set of values and identify the best representative points for different levels of approximation. We then extend our analysis to two infinite discrete distributions: one supported on the reciprocals of natural numbers and another on the natural numbers themselves. For these distributions, we compute the optimal sets of representatives and assess how well they approximate the original distributions. Finally, we address the reverse problem-determining the underlying distribution when the optimal sets are known. Our results provide both theoretical insights and computational techniques useful in information theory and data analysis.</description>

Abstract: We study a mean-field version of Bank-El Karoui's representation theorem of stochastic processes. Under different technical conditions, we establish some existence and uniqueness results. As motivation and first applications, our mean-field representation results provide a unified approach to study different Mean-Field Games (MFGs) in the setting with common noise and multiple populations, including the MFG of timing, the MFG with singular control, etc. As a crucial technical step, we provide a stability result on the classical Bank-El Karoui's representation theorem, which has its own interests and other applications, such as in deriving stability results of the optimizers (in the strong sense) for a class of optimal stopping problems and singular control problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.16095v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a stochastic PDE model for an evolving set $\mathbb{M}(t)\subseteq\mathbb{R}^{\mathrm{d}+1}$ that resembles a continuum version of origin-excited or reinforced random walk. We show that long-time fluctuations of an associated height function are given by a regularized Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ)-type PDE on a hypersurface in $\mathbb{R}^{\mathrm{d}+1}$, modulated by a Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator. We also show that for $\mathrm{d}+1=2$, the regularization in this KPZ-type equation can be removed after renormalization. To our knowledge, this gives the first instance of KPZ-type behavior in Laplacian growth, which was asked about (for somewhat different models) in Parisi-Zhang '84 and Ramirez-Sidoravicius '04.</description>

Abstract: Let $G_{n,k}$ be the group of permutations of $\{1,2,\ldots, kn\}$ that permutes the first $k$ symbols arbitrarily, then the next $k$ symbols and so on through the last $k$ symbols. Finally the $n$ blocks of size $k$ are permuted in an arbitrary way. For $\sigma$ chosen uniformly in $G_{n,k}$, let $L_{n,k}$ be the length of the longest increasing subsequence in $\sigma$. For $k,n$ growing, we determine that the limiting mean of $L_{n,k}$ is asymptotic to $4\sqrt{nk}$. This is different from parallel variations of the Vershik-Kerov theorem for colored permutations.</description>

Abstract: For the Moran model with strong or moderately strong selection we prove that the fluctuations around the deterministic limit of the line counting process of the ancestral selection graph converge to an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. To this purpose we provide an extension of a functional limit theorem by Ethier and Kurtz 1986. This result and a small adaptation of our arguments can also be used to obtain the scaling limit for the fluctuations of certain logistic branching processes.</description>

Abstract: We define Poisson genericity for infinite sequences in any finite or countable alphabet with an invariant exponentially-mixing probability measure. A sequence is Poisson generic if the number of occurrences of blocks of symbols asymptotically follows a Poisson law as the block length increases. We prove that almost all sequences are Poisson generic. Our result generalizes Peres and Weiss' theorem about Poisson genericity of integral bases numeration systems. In particular, we obtain that their continued fraction expansions for almost all real numbers are Poisson generic.</description>

Abstract: We define multideterminantal probability measures, a family of probability measures on $[k]^n$ where $[k]=\{1,2,\dots,k\}$, generalizing determinantal measures (which correspond to the case $k=2$). We give examples coming from the positive Grassmannian, from the dimer model and from the spanning tree model.
  We characterize kernels of \emph{pure} $k$-determinantal measures as those arising from $k$-tuples of Grassmannian elements whose maximal minors have certain sign restrictions. As a special case we construct all kernels of pure determinantal measures via a pair of elements of $Gr_{n_1,n}$ having corresponding Pl\"ucker coordinates of the same signs.
  We also define and completely characterize determinantal probability measures on the permutation group $S_n$.</description>

Abstract: The Critical 2D Stochastic Heat Flow (SHF) provides a natural candidate solution to the ill-posed 2D Stochastic Heat Equation with multiplicative space-time white noise. In this paper, we initiate the investigation of the spatial properties of the SHF. We prove that, as a random measure on $\mathbb{R}^2$, it is a.s. singular w.r.t. the Lebesgue measure. This is obtained by probing a "quasi-critical" regime and showing the asymptotic log-normality of the mass assigned to vanishing balls, as the disorder strength is sent to zero at a suitable rate, accompanied by similar results for critical 2D directed polymers. We also describe the regularity of the SHF, showing that it is a.s. H\"older $C^{-\epsilon}$ for any $\epsilon&gt;0$, implying the absence of atoms, and we establish local convergence to zero in the long time limit.</description>

      <title>Exceptional force, uncountably many solutions in the KPZ fixed point</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09604v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a complete characterization of all eternal solutions $b(x,t)$ of the KPZ fixed point satisfying the asymptotic slope condition $\lim_{|x| \to \infty} \frac{b(x,0)}{x} = 2\xi$. For fixed $\xi$, there is exactly one eternal solution with probability one. However, in the second and third authors' work with Sepp\"al\"ainen, it was shown that there exists a random, countably infinite set of slopes, for which there exist at least two eternal solutions. These correspond to two non-coalescing families of infinite geodesics in the same direction for the directed landscape. We denote the two eternal solutions as $b^{\xi-}$ and $b^{\xi +}$. In the present paper, we show that, for the exceptional slopes, there are in fact uncountably many eternal solutions. To give the characterization, we show that these eternal solutions are in bijection with a certain set of bi-infinite competition interfaces. Each bi-infinite interface separates the plane into two connected components -- a left component and a right component. A general eternal solution with slope $\xi$ is equal to $b^{\xi-}$ on the left component and equal to $b^{\xi +}$ on the right component. For these bi-infinite interfaces in the exceptional directions, we uncover new geometric phenomena that is not present for directed landscape geodesics. Additionally, we show that this set of eternal solutions appears as the Busemann limits $\mathcal{L}(\mathbf {v_n};\mathbf {p}) - \mathcal{L}(\mathbf{v_n};\mathbf {q})$ for sequences $\mathbf {v_n}$ going to $-\infty$ in direction $\xi$.</description>

      <title>A law of large numbers for kinetic interacting diffusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01769v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the convergence of the empirical distribution associated with a system of interacting kinetic particles subject to independent Brownian forcing in a finite horizon setting, using some recent progress on kinetic non-linear partial differential equations. Under general assumptions that require only weak convergence on the initial datum -- without assuming independence or moment conditions -- we prove convergence in probability to the corresponding non-linear Fokker-Planck PDE.</description>

      <title>Stochastic heat flow is a black noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16484v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the stochastic heat flow Caravenna Sun Zygouras (2023), Tsai (2024) is a black noise in the sense of Tsirelson (2004). As a corollary, the 2d stochastic heat equation driven by a mollified spacetime white noise becomes asymptotically independent of that noise in the scaling limit.</description>

      <title>Weak Optimal Transport: When is the Dual Potential Convex?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07200v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Weak optimal transport generalizes the classical theory of optimal transportation to nonlinear cost functions and covers a range of problems that lie beyond the traditional theory - including entropic transport, martingale transport, and applications in mechanism design. As in the classical case, the weak transport problem can also be written as a dual maximization problem over a pair of conjugate potentials.
  We identify sharp monotonicity conditions on the cost under which the dual problem can be restricted to convex potentials. This framework unifies several known results from the literature, including barycentric transport, martingale Benamou-Brenier, the multiple-good monopolist problem, Strassen's theorem, stochastic order projections and the classical Brenier theorem.</description>

      <title>Optimal control under unknown intensity with Bayesian learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04917v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider an optimal control problem inspired by neuroscience, where the dynamics is driven by a Poisson process with a controlled stochastic intensity and an uncertain parameter. Given a prior distribution for the unknown parameter, we describe its evolution according to Bayes' rule. We reformulate the optimization problem using Girsanov's theorem and establish a dynamic programming principle. Finally, we characterize the value function as the unique viscosity solution to a finite-dimensional Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, which can be solved numerically.</description>

      <title>Entropy and determinants for unitary representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13751v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Several notions of entropy have been studied widely in the ergodic theory of probability-preserving actions of countable groups. These include the generalization of Kolmogorov--Sinai entropy to amenable groups based on F{\o}lner sequences, percolative entropy for general countable groups, and Bowen's sofic entropy for sofic groups. In this work we pursue these notions across an analogy between ergodic theory and representation theory. We arrive at new quantities associated to unitary representations of groups and representations of other C*-algebras. Our main results show that these new quantities can often be evaluated as Fuglede--Kadison determinants. The resulting determinantal formulas offer various non-commutative generalizations of Szeg\H{o}'s limit theorem for Toeplitz determinants. They make contact with Arveson's theory of subdiagonal subalgebras, and also with some exact entropy calculations in the ergodic theory of actions by automorphisms of compact Abelian groups.</description>

      <title>Analytic toolkit for the Anderson model with arbitrary disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06903v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Anderson model in one dimension is a quantum particle on a discrete chain of sites with nearest-neighbor hopping and random on-site potentials. It is a progenitor of many further models of disordered systems, and it has spurred numerous developments in various branches of physics. The literature is silent, however, on practical analytic tools for computing the density-of-states of this model when the distribution of the on-site potentials is arbitrary. Here, supersymmetry-based techniques are employed to give an explicit linear integral equation whose solutions control the density-of-states. The output of this analytic procedure is in perfect agreement with numerical sampling. By Thouless formula, these results immediately provide analytic control over the localization length.</description>
