      <title>Socioeconomic determinants of protective behaviors and contact patterns in the post-COVID-19 pandemic era: a cross-sectional study in Italy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Socioeconomic inequalities significantly influence infectious disease outcomes, as seen with COVID-19, but the pathways through which socioeconomic conditions affect transmission dynamics remain unclear. To address this, we conducted a survey representative of the Italian population, stratified by age, gender, geographical area, city size, employment status, and education level. The survey's final aim was to estimate differences in contact and protective behaviors across various population strata, both being key components of transmission dynamics. Our initial insights based on the survey indicate that years after the pandemic began, the perceived impact of COVID-19 on professional, economic, social, and psychological dimensions varied across socioeconomic strata, extending beyond the heterogeneity observed in the epidemiological outcomes of the pandemic. This reinforces the need for approaches that systematically consider socioeconomic determinants. In this context, using generalized models, we identified associations between socioeconomic factors and vaccination status for both COVID-19 and influenza, as well as the influence of socioeconomic conditions on mask-wearing and social distancing. Importantly, we also observed differences in contact behaviors based on employment status while education level did not show a significant association. These findings highlight the complex interplay of socioeconomic and demographic factors in shaping individual responses to public health measures. Understanding these dynamics is essential for developing effective epidemic models and targeted public health strategies, particularly for vulnerable populations.</description>

      <title>Opinion response functions are key to understanding tipping of social conventions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The extent to which committed minorities can overturn social conventions is an active area of research in the mathematical modelling of opinion dynamics. Researchers generally use simulations of agent-based models (ABMs) to compute approximate values for the minimum committed minority size needed to overturn a social convention. In this manuscript, we expand on previous work by studying an ABM's mean-field behaviour using ordinary differential equation (ODE) models and a new tool, opinion response functions. Using these methods allows for formal analysis of the deterministic model which can provide a theoretical explanation for observed behaviours, e.g., coexistence or overturning of opinions. In particular, opinion response functions are a method of characterizing the equilibria in our social model. Our analysis confirms earlier numerical results and supplements them with a precise formula for computing the minimum committed minority size required to overturn a social convention.</description>

      <title>Hidden high-risky states identification from routine urban traffic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the core risk management tasks is to identify hidden high-risky states that may lead to system breakdown, which can provide valuable early warning knowledge. However, due to high dimensionality and nonlinear interaction embedded in large-scale complex systems like urban traffic, it remains challenging to identify hidden high-risky states from huge system state space where over 99% of possible system states are not yet visited in empirical data. Based on maximum entropy model, we infer the underlying interaction network from complicated dynamical processes of urban traffic, and construct system energy landscape. In this way, we can locate hidden high-risky states that have never been observed from real data. These states can serve as risk signals with high probability of entering hazardous minima in energy landscape, which lead to huge recovery cost. Our finding might provide insights for complex system risk management.</description>

      <title>Data-driven physics-based modeling of pedestrian dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pedestrian crowds encompass a complex interplay of intentional movements aimed at reaching specific destinations, fluctuations due to personal and interpersonal variability, and interactions with each other and the environment. Previous work showed the effectiveness of Langevin-like equations in capturing the statistical properties of pedestrian dynamics in simple settings, such as almost straight trajectories. However, modeling more complex dynamics, e.g. when multiple routes and origin-destinations are involved, remains a significant challenge. In this work, we introduce a novel and generic framework to describe the dynamics of pedestrians in any geometric setting, significantly extending previous works. Our model is based on Langevin dynamics with two timescales. The fast timescale corresponds to the stochastic fluctuations present when a pedestrian is walking. The slow timescale is associated with the dynamics that a pedestrian plans to follow, thus a smoother path. Employing a data-driven approach inspired by statistical field theories, we learn the complex potentials directly from the data, namely a high-statistics database of real-life pedestrian trajectories. This approach makes the model generic as the potentials can be read from any trajectory data set and the underlying Langevin structure enables physics-based insights. We validate our model through a comprehensive statistical analysis, comparing simulated trajectories with actual pedestrian measurements across five complementary settings, including a real-life train platform scenario, underscoring its practical societal relevance. We show that our model effectively captures fluctuation statistics in pedestrian motion. Beyond providing fundamental insights and predictive capabilities in pedestrian dynamics, our model could be used to investigate generic active dynamics such as vehicular traffic and collective animal behavior.</description>

      <title>Inferring financial stock returns correlation from complex network analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Financial stock returns correlations have been studied in the prism of random matrix theory, to distinguish the signal from the "noise". Eigenvalues of the matrix that are above the rescaled Marchenko Pastur distribution can be interpreted as collective modes behavior while the modes under are usually considered as noise. In this analysis we use complex network analysis to simulate the "noise" and the "market" component of the return correlations, by introducing some meaningful correlations in simulated geometric Brownian motion for the stocks. We find that the returns correlation matrix is dominated by stocks with high eigenvector centrality and clustering found in the network. We then use simulated "market" random walks to build an optimal portfolio and find that the overall return performs better than using the historical mean-variance data, up to 50% on short time scale.</description>

      <title>Information index augmented eRG to model vaccination behaviour: A case study of COVID-19 in the US</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent pandemics triggered the development of a number of mathematical models and computational tools apt at curbing the socio-economic impact of these and future pandemics. The need to acquire solid estimates from the data led to the introduction of effective approaches such as the \emph{epidemiological Renormalization Group} (eRG). A recognized relevant factor impacting the evolution of pandemics is the feedback stemming from individuals' choices. The latter can be taken into account via the \textit{information index} which accommodates the information--induced perception regarding the status of the disease and the memory of past spread. We, therefore, show how to augment the eRG by means of the information index. We first develop the {\it behavioural} version of the eRG and then test it against the US vaccination campaign for COVID-19. We find that the behavioural augmented eRG improves the description of the pandemic dynamics of the US divisions for which the epidemic peak occurs after the start of the vaccination campaign. Our results strengthen the relevance of taking into account the human behaviour component when modelling pandemic evolution. To inform public health policies, the model can be readily employed to investigate the socio-epidemiological dynamics, including vaccination campaigns, for other regions of the world.</description>

      <title>Symmetric conformity functions make decision-making processes independent of the distribution of learning strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10628v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two main procedures characterize the way in which social actors evaluate the qualities of the options in decision-making processes: they either seek to evaluate their intrinsic qualities (individual learners), or they rely on the opinion of the others (social learners). For the latter, social experiments have suggested that the mathematical form of the probability of adopting an option, called the conformity function, is symmetric in the adoption rate. However, the literature on decision-making includes models where social learners employ either symmetric or nonsymmetric conformity functions. We generalize a particular case studied in a previous work, and we show analytically that if the conformity function is symmetric, the details of the probability distribution of the propensity of the agents to behave as a social or an individual learner do not matter, only its expected value influences the determination of the steady state. We also show that in this case, the same steady state is reached for two extreme dynamical processes: one that considers propensities as idiosyncratic properties of the agents (each agent being an individual learner always with the same probability), and the opposite one, which allows them to change their propensity during the dynamics. This is not the case if the conformity function is nonsymmetric. This fact can inspire experiments that could shed light on the debate about mathematical properties of conformity functions.</description>

      <title>Shortest-path percolation on random networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06753v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a bond-percolation model intended to describe the consumption, and eventual exhaustion, of resources in transport networks. Edges forming minimum-length paths connecting demanded origin-destination nodes are removed if below a certain budget. As pairs of nodes are demanded and edges are removed, the macroscopic connected component of the graph disappears, i.e., the graph undergoes a percolation transition. Here, we study such a shortest-path-percolation transition in homogeneous random graphs where pairs of demanded origin-destination nodes are randomly generated, and fully characterize it by means of finite-size scaling analysis. If budget is finite, the transition is identical to the one of ordinary percolation, where a single giant cluster shrinks as edges are removed from the graph; for infinite budget, the transition becomes more abrupt than the one of ordinary percolation, being characterized by the sudden fragmentation of the giant connected component into a multitude of clusters of similar size.</description>

      <title>Social clustering reinforces external influence on the majority opinion model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02689v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Public opinion is subject to peer interaction via social networks and external pressure from the media, advertising, and other actors. In this paper, we study the interaction between external and peer influence on the stochastic opinion dynamics of a majority vote model. We introduce a model where agents update their opinions based on the combined influence of their local neighbourhood (peers) and an external actor in the transition rates. In the first model, the external influence is only felt by agents non-aligned with the external actor ("push strategy"). In the second model, agents are affected by external influence, independently of their opinions ("nudging strategy"). In both cases, the external influence increases the possible macroscopic outcomes. These outcomes are determined by the chosen influence strategy. We also find that the social network structure affects the opinion dynamics, with social clustering positively reinforcing the external influence whereas degree heterogeneity weakens the external forces. These findings are relevant to businesses and policy making, helping to understand how groups of individuals collectively react to external actors.</description>

      <title>Persuasion, Betrayal and Regret in Election Campaigns</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15894v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Elections play a fundamental role in democratic societies, however they are often characterized by unexpected results. Here we discuss an election campaign model inspired by the compartmental epidemiology, and we show that the model captures the main characteristics of an election campaign: persuasion, betrayal and regret. All of these three factors can be used together or independently to influence the campaign, and to determine the winner. We include results for both the deterministic and the stochastic versions of the model, and we show that the decision to not vote significantly increases the fluctuations in the model, amplifying the chance of controversial results, in agreement with the well known "paradox of not voting".</description>

      <title>Modeling the amplification of epidemic spread by misinformed populations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11351v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding how misinformation affects the spread of disease is crucial for public health, especially given recent research indicating that misinformation can increase vaccine hesitancy and discourage vaccine uptake. However, it is difficult to investigate the interaction between misinformation and epidemic outcomes due to the dearth of data-informed holistic epidemic models. Here, we employ an epidemic model that incorporates a large, mobility-informed physical contact network as well as the distribution of misinformed individuals across counties derived from social media data. The model allows us to simulate and estimate various scenarios to understand the impact of misinformation on epidemic spreading. Using this model, we present a worst-case scenario in which a heavily misinformed population would result in an additional 14% of the U.S. population becoming infected over the course of the COVID-19 epidemic, compared to a best-case scenario.</description>
