      <title>Durotaxis in viscoelastic fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Organisms often swim through fluids that are spatially inhomogeneous. If the fluids are polymeric, gradients in polymer concentration may lead to gradients in both fluid viscosity and elasticity. In this letter, we present theoretical results for the dynamics of active particles, biological or otherwise, swimming through spatially inhomogeneous viscoelastic fluids. We model the active particles using the squirmer model, and show that spatial variations in fluid relaxation time lead to a novel mechanism for reorientation and taxis in viscoelastic fluids, which we refer to as a form of durotaxis in fluids.</description>

      <title>Defiltering turbulent flow fields for Lagrangian particle tracking using machine learning techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a defiltering method of turbulent flow fields for Lagrangian particle tracking using machine learning techniques. Numerical simulation of Lagrangian particle tracking is commonly used in various fields. In general, practical applications require an affordable grid size due to the limitation of computational resources; for instance, a large-eddy simulation reduces the number of grid points with a filtering operator. However, low resolution flow fields usually underestimate the fluctuations of particle velocity. We thus present a novel approach to defilter the fluid velocity to improve the particle motion in coarse-grid (i.e., filtered) fields. The proposed method, which is based on the machine learning techniques, intends to reconstruct the fluid velocity at a particle location. We assess this method in a priori manner using a turbulent channel flow at the friction Reynolds number ${\rm Re}_\tau=$ $180$. The investigation is conducted for the filter size, $n_{\rm filter}$, of $4$, $8$, and $16$. In the case of $n_{\rm filter} = 4$, the proposed method can perfectly reconstruct the fluid velocity fluctuations. The results of $n_{\rm filter} = 8$ and $16$ also exhibit substantial improvements in the fluctuation statistics although with some underestimations. Subsequently, the particle motion computed using the present method is analyzed. The trajectories, the velocity fluctuations, and the deposition velocity of particles are reconstructed accurately. Moreover, the generalizability of the present method is also demonstrated using the fields whose computational domain is larger than that used for the training. The present findings suggest that machine learning-based velocity reconstruction will enable us precise particle tracking in coarse-grid flow fields.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Regularity in Sobolev and Besov Spaces with Variable Noise Intensity for Turbulent Fluid Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper advances the stochastic regularity theory for the Navier-Stokes equations by introducing a variable-intensity noise model within the Sobolev and Besov spaces. Traditional models usually assume constant-intensity noise, but many real-world turbulent systems exhibit fluctuations of varying intensities, which can critically affect flow regularity and energy dynamics. This work addresses this gap by formulating a new regularity theorem that quantifies the impact of stochastic perturbations with bounded variance on the energy dissipation and smoothness properties of solutions. The author employs techniques such as the Littlewood-Paley decomposition and interpolation theory, deriving rigorous bounds, and we demonstrate how variable noise intensities influence the behavior of the solution over time. This study contributes theoretically by improving the understanding of energy dissipation in the presence of stochastic perturbations, particularly under conditions relevant to turbulent flows where randomness cannot be assumed to be uniform. The findings have practical implications for more accurate modeling and prediction of turbulent systems, allowing potential adjustments in simulation parameters to better reflect the observed physical phenomena. This refined model therefore provides a fundamental basis for future work in fluid dynamics, particularly in fields where variable stochastic factors are prevalent, including meteorology, oceanography, and engineering applications involving fluid turbulence. The present approach not only extends current theoretical frameworks but also paves the way for more sophisticated computational tools in the analysis of complex and stochastic fluid systems.</description>

      <title>LESnets (Large-Eddy Simulation nets): Physics-informed neural operator for large-eddy simulation of turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Acquisition of large datasets for three-dimensional (3D) partial differential equations are usually very expensive. Physics-informed neural operator (PINO) eliminates the high costs associated with generation of training datasets, and shows great potential in a variety of partial differential equations. In this work, we employ physics-informed neural operator, encoding the large-eddy simulation (LES) equations directly into the neural operator for simulating three-dimensional incompressible turbulent flows. We develop the LESnets (Large-Eddy Simulation nets) by adding large-eddy simulation equations to two different data-driven models, including Fourier neural operator (FNO) and implicit Fourier neural operator (IFNO) without using label data. Notably, by leveraging only PDE constraints to learn the spatio-temporal dynamics problem, LESnets retains the computational efficiency of data-driven approaches while obviating the necessity for data. Meanwhile, using large-eddy simulation equations as PDE constraints makes it possible to efficiently predict complex turbulence at coarse grids. We investigate the performance of the LESnets with two standard three-dimensional turbulent flows: decaying homogeneous isotropic turbulence and temporally evolving turbulent mixing layer. In the numerical experiments, the LESnets model shows a similar or even better accuracy as compared to traditional large-eddy simulation and data-driven models of FNO and IFNO. Moreover, the well-trained LESnets is significantly faster than traditional LES, and has a similar efficiency as the data-driven FNO and IFNO models. Thus, physics-informed neural operators have a strong potential for 3D nonlinear engineering applications.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Network with Chebyshev Polynomials for Fluid Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) is essential in scientific forecasting and fluid dynamics. Traditional approaches often incur expensive computational costs and trade-offs in efficiency and accuracy. Recent deep neural networks improve accuracy but require quality training data. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) effectively integrate physical laws, reducing data reliance in limited sample scenarios. A novel machine-learning framework, Chebyshev physics-informed Kolmogorov-Arnold network (ChebPIKAN), is proposed to integrate the robust architectures of Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KAN) with physical constraints to enhance calculation accuracy of PDEs for fluid mechanics. We explore the fundamentals of KAN, emphasis on the advantages of using the orthogonality of Chebyshev polynomial basis functions in spline fitting, and describe the incorporation of physics-informed loss functions tailored to specific PDEs in fluid dynamics, including Allen-Cahn equation, nonlinear Burgers equation, two-dimensional Helmholtz equations, two-dimensional Kovasznay flow and two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed ChebPIKAN model significantly outperforms standard KAN architecture in solving various PDEs by embedding essential physical information more effectively. These results indicate that augmenting KAN with physical constraints can not only alleviate overfitting issues of KAN but also improve extrapolation performance. Consequently, this study highlights the potential of ChebPIKAN as a powerful tool in computational fluid dynamics, proposing a path toward fast and reliable predictions in fluid mechanics and beyond.</description>

      <title>Shear-induced force and dispersion due to buoyancy in a horizontal Hele-Shaw cell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates shear flow in a Hele-Shaw cell, driven by varying horizontal buoyancy forces resulting from a horizontal density gradient induced by a scalar field. By employing asymptotic methods and taking the dependence of density and transport coefficients on the scalar field into account, effective two-dimensional hydrodynamic equations coupled with the scalar conservation equation are derived. These equations determine an effective diffusion coefficient for the scalar field accounting for shear-induced diffusion, and an effective shear-induced buoyancy force that modifies the classical Darcy's law. The derived equations provide a foundation for future research into various problems involving scalar transport in horizontal Hele-Shaw cells.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic theory of premixed flames under Darcy's law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the theoretical implications of applying Darcy's law to premixed flames, a topic of growing interest in research on flame propagation in porous media and confined geometries. A multiple-scale analysis is carried out treating the flame as a hydrodynamic discontinuity in density, viscosity and permeability. The analysis accounts in particular for the inner structure of the flame. A simple model is derived allowing the original conservation equations to be replaced by Laplace's equation for pressure, applicable on both sides of the flame front, subject to specific conditions across the front. Such model is useful for investigating general problems under confinement including flame instabilities in porous media or Hele-Shaw channels. In particular, our analysis reveals novel contributions to the local propagation speed arising from discontinuities in the tangential components of velocity and gravitational force, which are permissible in Darcy's flows to leading order, but not in flows obeying Euler or Navier-Stokes equations.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic instabilities of propagating interfaces under Darcy's law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hydrodynamic instabilities of propagating interfaces in Hele-Shaw channels or porous media under the influence of an imposed flow and gravitational acceleration are investigated within the framework of Darcy's law. The stability analysis pertains to an interface between two fluids with different densities, viscosities, and permeabilities, which can be susceptible to Darrieus-Landau, Saffman-Taylor, and Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities. A theoretical analysis, treating the interface as a hydrodynamic discontinuity, yields a simple dispersion relation between the perturbation growth rate $s$ and its wavenumber $k$ in the form $s=(ak - bk^2)/(1+ck)$, where $a$, $b$ and $c$ are constants determined by problem parameters. The constant $a$ characterises all three hydrodynamic instabilities, which are long-wave in nature. In contrast, $b$ and $c$, which characterize the influences of local curvature and flow strain on interface propagation speed, typically provide stabilisation at short wavelengths comparable to interface's diffusive thickness. The theoretical findings for Darcy's law are compared with a generalisation of the classical work by Joulin &amp; Sivashinsky, which is based on an Euler-Darcy model. The comparison provides a conceptual bridge between predictions based on Darcy's law and those on Euler's equation and offers valuable insights into the role of confinement on interface instabilities in Hele-Shaw channels. Numerical analyses of the instabilities are carried out for premixed flames using a simplified chemistry model and Darcy's law. The numerical results corroborate with the explicit formula with a reasonable accuracy. Time-dependent numerical simulations of unstable premixed flames are carried out to gain insights into the nonlinear development of these instabilities.</description>

      <title>Intermittency of a transitional airfoil flow with laminar separation bubble solved by the lattice-Boltzmann method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The flow over a NACA0012 airfoil at a moderate Reynolds number Re = 50,000 and angle of attack of alpha = 3 degrees is investigated using the lattice-Boltzmann method (LBM). The LBM solutions are computed in direct numerical simulation (DNS) mode, i.e., without a wall model. A validation is performed against a Navier-Stokes wall-resolved large eddy simulation, and good agreement is achieved between the different approaches, showing that the LBM can provide accurate solutions of boundary layers under transitional regime, but with a significant computational cost reduction. A laminar separation bubble (LSB) forms over the suction side of the airfoil, leading to intermittent vortex shedding that impacts transition to turbulence and the generation of strong spanwise-coherent vortices. Different shedding patterns are observed including the advection of single vortical structures and pairing of two vortices, which may or may not break into finer turbulent scales. Such flow features are characterized by 2D and 3D events that directly impact the sound generation by the trailing edge. Frequency and amplitude modulations from the LSB lead to a noise spectrum with a main tone plus equidistant secondary tones, and a time-frequency analysis shows that the main tones may switch frequencies due to intermittency. This research advances in the comprehension of the LSB behavior in transitional airfoil flows, impacting the performance and noise generation of blades and propellers.</description>

      <title>An optimized dynamic mode decomposition to identify coherent dynamics in noisy flow data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) is a popular approach to analyzing and modeling fluid flows. In practice, datasets are almost always corrupted to some degree by noise. The vanilla DMD is highly noise-sensitive, which is why many algorithmic extensions for improved robustness exist. We introduce a flexible optimization approach that merges available ideas for improved accuracy and robustness. The approach simultaneously identifies coherent dynamics and noise in the data. In tests on the laminar flow past a cylinder, the method displays strong noise robustness and high levels of accuracy.</description>

      <title>Internal Solitary Wave Generation Using A Jet-Array Wavemaker</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper evaluates the experimental generation of internal solitary waves (ISWs) in a miscible two-layer system with a free surface using a jet-array wavemaker (JAW). Unlike traditional gate-release experiments, the JAW system generates ISWs by forcing a prescribed vertical distribution of mass flux. Experiments examine three different layer-depth ratios, with ISW amplitudes up to the maximum allowed by the extended Korteweg-de Vries (eKdV) solution. Phase speeds and wave profiles are captured via planar laser-induced fluorescence and the velocity field is measured synchronously using particle imaging velocimetry. Measured properties are directly compared with the eKdV predictions. As expected, small- and intermediate-amplitude waves match well with the corresponding eKdV solutions, with errors in amplitude and phase speed below 10%. For large waves with amplitudes approaching the maximum allowed by the eKdV solution, the phase speed and the velocity profiles resemble the eKdV solution while the wave profiles are distorted following the trough. This can potentially be attributed to Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities forming at the pycnocline. Larger errors are generally observed when the local Richardson number at the JAW inlet exceeds the threshold for instability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discover a surprising connection between Carrollian symmetries and hydrodynamics in the shallow water approximation. Carrollian symmetries arise in the speed of light going to zero limit of relativistic Poincar\'e symmetries. Using a recent gauge theoretic description of shallow water wave equations we find that the actions corresponding to two different waves, viz. the so called flat band solution and the Poincar\'e waves map exactly to the actions of the electric and magnetic sectors of Carrollian electrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Odd Viscodiffusive Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a theory of "odd viscodiffusive fluids," which exhibit three-dimensional odd transport phenomena through the coupling of viscous and diffusive transport. In these fluids, diffusive fluxes may arise from orthogonal velocity gradients and, reciprocally, stresses may arise from concentration gradients. We examine microscopic fluctuations using the recently proposed "flux hypothesis" to derive Green-Kubo and reciprocal relations for the governing transport coefficients. These relations suggest that only parity symmetry, and not time-reversal symmetry, must be broken at the microscopic scale to observe these couplings. Chiral liquids, whether passive or active, are therefore a natural choice as viscodiffusive fluids. We then introduce two analytically tractable model systems, namely a generator and a corresponding reciprocal engine, which illustrate the nature of viscodiffusive cross-coupling in chiral matter and enable the experimental measurement of the novel transport coefficients. Finally, we make the case for chiral bacterial suspensions to be odd viscodiffusive fluids, and use our theory to predict the behaviors exhibited in prior experimental microfluidic studies involving bacterial migration in response to shearing flows.</description>

      <title>Energy Dissipation and Regularity in Quaternionic Fluid Dynamics using Sobolev-Besov Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the dynamics of incompressible fluid flows through quaternionic variables integrated within Sobolev-Besov spaces. Traditional mathematical models for fluid dynamics often employ Sobolev spaces to analyze the regularity of the solution to the Navier-Stokes equations. However, with the unique ability of Besov spaces to provide localized frequency analysis and handle high-frequency behaviors, these spaces offer a refined approach to address complex fluid phenomena such as turbulence and bifurcation. Quaternionic analysis further enhances this approach by representing three-dimensional rotations directly within the mathematical framework. The author presents two new theorems to advance the study of regularity and energy dissipation in fluid systems. The first theorem demonstrates that energy dissipation in quaternionic fluid systems is dominated by the higher-frequency component in Besov spaces, with contributions decaying at a rate proportional to the frequency of the quaternionic component. The second theorem provides conditions for regularity and existence of solutions in quaternionic fluid systems with external forces. By integrating these hypercomplex structures with Sobolev-Besov spaces, our work offers a new mathematically rigorous framework capable of addressing frequency-specific dissipation patterns and rotational symmetries in turbulent flows. The findings contribute to fundamental questions in fluid dynamics, particularly by improving our understanding of high Reynolds number flows, energy cascade behaviors, and quaternionic bifurcation. This framework therefore paves the way for future research on regularity in complex fluid dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.15046v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the classical Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) instability, initial conditions are forgotten and the growth of the mixing layer becomes self-similar when short wavelength modes couple to generate longer wavelength modes. In this paper, we explore how adding a reaction at the unstable interface affects this inverse cascade in wavenumber ("inverse k-cascade"). We simulate a 2D, Boussinesq, premixed model flame perturbed by a large amplitude primary mode ($k_1$) and a smaller amplitude secondary mode ($k_2$). Early on, the modes are uncoupled and the flame propagates as a metastable traveling wave. Once the secondary mode has grown large enough, the modes couple. The traveling wave is destabilized and the flame front bubbles rapidly grow. This inverse k-cascade, driven by two-mode coupling, ultimately generates a long wavelength mode with wavenumber GCD$(k_1,k_2)$, where GCD is the greatest common divisor. We identify five distinct flame growth solution types, and show that the flame may stall, develop coherent pulsations, or even become a metastable traveling wave again depending on GCD$(k_1,k_2)$. Finally, we compare our results with two-mode coupling in ablative and classical RT and show that all three systems may follow the same mode coupling dynamics.</description>

      <title>A progressive data-augmented RANS model for enhanced wind-farm simulations</title>

Abstract: The development of advanced simulation tools is essential, both presently and in the future, for improving wind-energy design strategies, paving the way for a complete transition to sustainable solutions. The Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) models are pivotal in enhancing our comprehension of the complex flow within and around wind farms and, hence, improving their capacity to accurately model turbulence within this context is a vital research goal. The enhancement is essential for a precise prediction of wake recovery and for capturing intricate flow phenomena such as secondary flows of Prandtl's second kind behind the turbines. To reach these objectives, here, we propose a progressive data-augmentation approach. We first incorporate the turbine-induced forces in the turbulent kinetic energy equation of the widely used $k-\omega\text{SST}$ model. Afterward, we utilize data from large-eddy simulations to progressively enhance the Reynolds-stress prediction of this baseline model, accurately capturing the evolution of eddy viscosity in the wake, as well as the emergence of secondary flows. We then apply the optimized model to two unseen cases with distinct layouts and conduct a comparative analysis focusing on the obtained quantities such as normalized streamwise velocity deficit, turbulence intensity, and power output. We also examine the success rate of the augmented model in predicting the secondary flows in the wake region. We also evaluate the performance of the augmented model in predicting wake characteristics by comparing it with wind-tunnel measurement data. Our comparisons and validations demonstrate the superior performance of the progressive data-augmented model over the standard version in all cases considered in this study.</description>

      <title>Large Airfoil Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08392v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The development of a "Large Airfoil Model (LAM)," a transformative approach for answering technical questions on airfoil aerodynamics, requires a vast dataset and a model to leverage it. To build this foundation, a novel probabilistic machine learning approach, A Deep Airfoil Prediction Tool (ADAPT), has been developed. ADAPT makes uncertainty-aware predictions of airfoil pressure coefficient ($C_p$) distributions by harnessing experimental data and incorporating measurement uncertainties. By employing deep kernel learning, performing Gaussian Process Regression in a ten-dimensional latent space learned by a neural network, ADAPT effectively handles unstructured experimental datasets. In tandem, Airfoil Surface Pressure Information Repository of Experiments (ASPIRE), the first large-scale, open-source repository of airfoil experimental data has been developed. ASPIRE integrates century-old historical data with modern reports, forming an unparalleled resource of real-world pressure measurements. This addresses a critical gap left by prior repositories, which relied primarily on numerical simulations. Demonstrative results for three airfoils show that ADAPT accurately predicts $C_p$ distributions and aerodynamic coefficients across varied flow conditions, achieving a mean absolute error in enclosed area ($\text{MAE}_\text{enclosed}$) of 0.029. ASPIRE and ADAPT lay the foundation for a future, more elaborate LAM that is coupled with a large language model, which will then enable users to perform design tasks based on design questions rather than explicit technical inputs.</description>

      <title>Convergence study of multi-field singular value decomposition for turbulence fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03739v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Convergence of a matrix decomposition technique, the multi-field singular value decomposition (MFSVD) which efficiently analyzes nonlinear correlations by simultaneously decomposing multiple fields, is investigated. Toward applications in turbulence studies, we demonstrate that SVD for an artificial matrix with multi-scale structures reproduces the power-law-like distribution in the singular value spectrum with several orthogonal modes. Then, MFSVD is applied to practical turbulence field data produced by numerical simulations. It is clarified that relative errors in the reproduction of quadratic nonlinear quantities in multi-field turbulence converge remarkably faster than the single-field case, which requires thousands of modes to converge.</description>

      <title>Velocity and acceleration fluctuations in dark matter and dynamical dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.05606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.05606v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using Illustris and Virgo N-body simulations, we study the velocity and acceleration fluctuations in collisionless dark matter involving long-range gravity. By contrast, in the kinetic theory of gases, molecules undergo elastic collisions involving short-range interactions, where only velocity fluctuations are relevant. Long-range gravity requires a broad size of haloes to be formed. Hierarchical structure formation proceeds through the merging of smaller haloes to form larger haloes, which facilitates a continuous energy cascade from small to large haloes at a constant rate of $\varepsilon_u\approx -10^{-7}$m$^2$/s$^3$. Velocity fluctuations involve a critical velocity $u_c\propto (1+z)^{-3/4}$, and acceleration fluctuations involve a critical acceleration $a_c\propto (1+z)^{3/4}$. The two quantities are related as $\varepsilon_{u}\approx -a_c u_c/(18\pi^2)$. With critical velocity $u_c$ on the order of 300km/s at $z=0$, the critical acceleration is found to be $a_{c0}\equiv a_c(z=0) \approx 10^{-10}$m/s$^2$ at $z=0$ that is higher at higher redshift. This suggests that the critical acceleration $a_c$ might explain the universal acceleration $a_0 \approx 10^{-10}$m/s$^2$ in the empirical Tully-Fisher relation and modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND). The predicted redshift evolution of $a_0 \propto (1+z)^{3/4}$ can be validated by Magneticum and EAGLE simulations. High-redshift Tully-Fisher relation will provide more insight. Finally, note that dark energy density $\rho_{DE}\approx {a_{c0}^{2}/G}=10^{-10}$J/m$^3$, we postulate an entropic origin of dark energy from the acceleration fluctuations in dark matter. A $\nu_0\nu_a$CDM model was proposed for the evolution of dynamical dark energy. When compared to the $w_0w_a$CDM model with constraints from DESI (2024), this model suggests a constant density at high redshift and a slower power-law weakening density at low redshift.</description>

      <title>On the rotational invariance and hyperbolicity of shallow water moment equations in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.07202v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the two-dimensional extension of a recently introduced set of shallow water models based on a regularized moment expansion of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations \cite{kowalski2017moment,koellermeier2020analysis}. We show the rotational invariance of the proposed moment models with two different approaches. The first proof involves the split of the coefficient matrix into the conservative and non-conservative parts and proves the rotational invariance for each part, while the second one relies on the special block structure of the coefficient matrices. With the aid of rotational invariance, the analysis of the hyperbolicity for the moment model in 2D is reduced to the real diagonalizability of the coefficient matrix in 1D. Then we analyze the real diagonalizability by deriving the analytical form of the characteristic polynomial. We find that the moment model in 2D is hyperbolic in most cases and weakly hyperbolic in a degenerate edge case. With a simple modification to the coefficient matrices, we fix this weakly hyperbolicity and propose a new global hyperbolic model. Furthermore, we extend the model to include a more general class of closure relations than the original model and establish that this set of general closure relations retains both rotational invariance and hyperbolicity.</description>

      <title>Propulsion of a chiral swimmer in viscoelastic fluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.05718v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Microswimmers often use chirality to generate translational movement from rotation motion, exhibiting distinct behaviors in complex fluids compared to simple Newtonian fluids. However, the underlying mechanism remains incompletely understood. In this study, we elucidate the precise mechanisms underlying the distinct behaviors of microswimmers in Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids. We show that the enhanced speed of chiral swimmers is attributed to the Weissenberg effect induced by normal stress differences resulting from chiral flows. Additionally, we identify swimmer-specific normal stress differences in a viscoelastic fluid and demonstrate that swimming speed varies depending on whether the swimmer acts as a pusher or a puller. Moreover, we investigate the hydrodynamic interactions between a pair of chiral squirmers. When the squirmers are aligned parallel (perpendicular) to their swimming axis, they tend to separate (approach). These findings deepen our comprehension of the rheological properties of viscoelastic fluids containing microswimmers, promising advancements in various applications.</description>
