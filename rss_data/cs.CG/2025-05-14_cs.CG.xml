      <title>Implicit Toolpath Generation for Functionally Graded Additive Manufacturing via Gradient-Aware Slicing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel gradient-aware slicing method for functionally graded additive manufacturing (FGM) that overcomes the limitations of conventional toolpath planning approaches, which struggle to produce truly continuous gradients. By integrating multi-material gradients into the toolpath generation process, our method enables the fabrication of FGMs with complex gradients that vary seamlessly along all three axes. We leverage OpenVCAD's implicit representation of geometry and material fields to directly extract iso-contours, enabling accurate, controlled gradient toolpaths. Two novel strategies are introduced to integrate these gradients into the toolpath planning process. The first strategy maintains traditional perimeter, skin, and infill structures subdivided by mixture ratios, with automated 'zippering' to mitigate stress concentrations. The second strategy fills iso-contoured regions densely, printing directly against gradients to eliminate purging and reduce waste. Both strategies accommodate gradually changing printing parameters, such as mixed filament ratios, toolhead switching, and variable nozzle temperatures for foaming materials. This capability allows for controlled variation of composition, density, and other properties within a single build, expanding the design space for functionally graded parts. Experimental results demonstrate the fabrication of high-quality FGMs with complex, multi-axis gradients, highlighting the versatility of our method. We showcase the successful implementation of both strategies on a range of geometries and material combinations, demonstrating the potential of our approach to produce intricate and functional FGMs. This work provides a robust, open-source, and automated framework for designing and fabricating advanced FGMs, accelerating research in multi-material additive manufacturing.</description>

      <title>Claycode: Stylable and Deformable 2D Scannable Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces Claycode, a novel 2D scannable code designed for extensive stylization and deformation. Unlike traditional matrix-based codes (e.g., QR codes), Claycodes encode their message in a tree structure. During the encoding process, bits are mapped into a topology tree, which is then depicted as a nesting of color regions drawn within the boundaries of a target polygon shape. When decoding, Claycodes are extracted and interpreted in real-time from a camera stream. We detail the end-to-end pipeline and show that Claycodes allow for extensive stylization without compromising their functionality. We then empirically demonstrate Claycode's high tolerance to heavy deformations, outperforming traditional 2D scannable codes in scenarios where they typically fail.</description>

      <title>Computing Projective Implicit Representations from Poset Towers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A family of simplicial complexes, connected with simplicial maps and indexed by a poset $P$, is called a poset tower. The concept of poset towers subsumes classical objects of study in the persistence literature, as, for example, one-critical multi-filtrations and zigzag filtrations, but also allows multi-critical simplices and arbitrary simplicial maps. The homology of a poset tower gives rise to a $P$-persistence module. To compute this homology globally over $P$, in the spirit of the persistence algorithm, we consider the homology of a chain complex of $P$-persistence modules, $C_{\ell-1}\xleftarrow{}C_\ell\xleftarrow{}C_{\ell+1}$, induced by the simplices of the poset tower. Contrary to the case of one-critical filtrations, the chain-modules $C_\ell$ of a poset tower can have a complicated structure. In this work, we tackle the problem of computing a representation of such a chain complex segment by projective modules and $P$-graded matrices, which we call a projective implicit representation (PiRep). We give efficient algorithms to compute asymptotically minimal projective resolutions (up to the second term) of the chain modules and the boundary maps and compute a PiRep from these resolutions. Our algorithms are tailored to the chain complexes and resolutions coming from poset towers and take advantage of their special structure. In the context of poset towers, they are fully general and could potentially serve as a foundation for developing more efficient algorithms on specific posets.</description>
