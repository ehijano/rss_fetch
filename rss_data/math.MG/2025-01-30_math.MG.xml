      <title>An analysis of Euclid's geometrical foundations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17406v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The initial techniques developed in Euclid's Elements, well before the use of the parallel postulate, are reexamined in order to clarify even the most obscure details, particularly those related to equality, superposition and angle comparison. Some commentary on modern developments is included. The known but often misunderstood implicit handling of betweenness and points of intersection is briefly treated. We also sketch a rigorous treatment of absolute geometry in a spirit similar to Euclid's, one that allows properties of angles and triangles to be derived from two simple axioms on right angles, which then leads to rigid motions of certain planar geometries.</description>

      <title>Realizations of planar graphs as Poincar'e-Reeb graphs of refined algebraic domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Algebraic domains are regions in the plane surrounded by mutually disjoint non-singular real algebraic curves. Poincar'e-Reeb Graphs of them are graphs they naturally collapse: such graphs are formally formulated by Sorea, for example, around 2020. Their studies found that nicely embedded planar graphs are Poincar'e-Reeb graphs of some algebraic domains. These graphs are generic with respect to the projection to the horizontal axis. Problems, methods and results are elementary and natural and they apply natural approximations nicely for example.
  We present our new approach to extension of the result to a non-generic case and an answer. We first formulate generalized algebraic domains, surrounded by non-singular real algebraic curves which may intersect with normal crossings. Such domains and certain classes of them appear in related studies of graphs and regions surrounded by algebraic curves explicitly.</description>

      <title>Constructing self-similar subsets within the fractal support of Lacunary Wavelet Series for their multifractal analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17712v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a fractal $\mathcal{I}$ whose Hausdorff dimension matches with the upper-box dimension, we propose a new method which consists in selecting inside $\mathcal{I}$ some subsets (called quasi-Cantor sets) of almost same dimension and with controled properties of self-similarties at prescribed scales. It allows us to estimate below the Hausdorff dimension $\mathcal{I}$ intersected to limsup sets of contracted balls selected according a Bernoulli law, in contexts where classical Mass Transference Principles cannot be applied. We apply this result to the computation of the increasing multifractal spectrum of lacunary wavelet series supported on $\mathcal{I}$.</description>

      <title>On the Genus of One Degree of Freedom Planar Linkages via Tropical Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00449v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper focuses on studying the configuration spaces of graphs realised in $\mathbb C^2$, such that the configuration space is, after normalisation, one dimensional. If this is the case, then the configuration space is, generically, a smooth complex curve, and can be seen as a Riemann surface. The property of interest in this paper is the genus of this curve. Using tropical geometry, we give an algorithm to compute this genus. We provide an implementation in Python and give various examples.</description>

      <title>The Gauss image problem for pseudo-cones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06005v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Gauss image problem for convex bodies asks for the existence of a convex body that "links" two given measures on the unit sphere in a certain way. We treat here a corresponding question for pseudo-cones, that is, for unbounded closed convex sets strictly contained in their recession cones.</description>

      <title>Transcendence and normality of complex numbers via Hurwitz continued fractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.20029v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the topological, dynamical, and descriptive set theoretic properties of Hurwitz continued fractions. Hurwitz continued fractions associate an infinite sequence of Gaussian integers to every complex number which is not a Gaussian rational. The resulting space of sequences of Gaussian integers $\Omega$ is not closed. By means of an algorithm, we show that $\Omega$ contains a natural subset whose closure $\overline{\mathsf{R}}$ encodes continued fraction expansions of complex numbers which are not Gaussian rationals. We prove that $(\overline{\mathsf{R}}, \sigma)$ is a subshift with a feeble specification property. As an application, we determine the rank in the Borel hierarchy of the set of Hurwitz normal numbers with respect to the complex Gauss measure. We also construct a family of complex transcendental numbers with bounded partial quotients.</description>
