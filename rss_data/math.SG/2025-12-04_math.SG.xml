      <title>Topological Obstructions to Dynamical Convexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the topological obstructions of dynamical convexity on contact manifolds focusing on fillability by cotangent bundles and subcritical surgeries. Using links to algebraic geometry, we motivate and define a stronger version of dynamical convexity, and investigate the topology of these manifolds. More precisely, we show that strongly dynamically convex contact manifolds cannot arise as a unit cotangent bundle $(ST^*M,\lambda_{std})$ of a closed manifold $M$ and in particular that dynamically convex contact manifolds cannot arise as the unit cotangent bundle $(ST^*M,\lambda_{std})$ of a simply connected manifold $M$. We also show obstructions to dynamical convexity that arises from studying different kinds of subcritical surgeries.</description>

      <title>A Mathematical Introduction to Geometric Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: These notes are based on a series of lectures by Kadri \.Ilker Berktav from May 2024 to November 2024, providing a detailed exposition of geometric quantization formalism and its essential components. They are organized into three parts: background in symplectic geometry, basics of geometric quantization formalism, and an application related to Edward Witten's work in knot theory and topology.</description>

      <title>Relative Thom Conjectures, symplectic and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a criterion that ensures a bounded almost complex curve in a bounded almost complex 4-manifold minimizes genus amongst all smooth surfaces that share its homology class and the transverse link on its boundary. An immediate corollary affirms the relative symplectic Thom conjecture and, moreover, yields obstructions coming from knot Floer homology to a link bounding a symplectic surface in a symplectic filling. Our results are applicable to knots in manifolds equipped with plane fields that admit no symplectic fillings; for instance, we show that symplectic surfaces in a thickening of any contact 3-manifold with non-zero Ozsvath-Szabo invariant minimize slice genus for their boundary. We conjecture that this phenomenon occurs precisely when the contact structure is tight, which would imply that tightness can be viewed as a symplecto-geometric notion.</description>

      <title>Bifurcations of Highly Inclined Near Halo Orbits using Moser Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the bifurcation structure of highly inclined near halo orbits with close approaches to the light primary, in the circular restricted three-body problem (CR3BP). Using a Hamiltonian formulation together with Moser regularization, we develop a numerical framework for the continuation of periodic orbits and the computation of their Floquet multipliers which remains effective near collision. We describe vertical collision orbits and families emerging from its pitchfork, period-doubling, and period-tripling bifurcations in the limiting Hill's problem, including the halo and butterfly families. We continue these into the CR3BP using a perturbative framework via a symplectic scaling, and construct bifurcation graphs for representative systems (Saturn-Enceladus, Earth-Moon, Copenhagen) to identify common dynamical features. Conley-Zehnder indices are computed to classify the resulting families. Together, these results provide a coherent global picture of polar orbit architecture near the light primary, offering groundwork for future mission design, such as Enceladus plume sampling missions.</description>

      <title>Maximal symplectic torus actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17126v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There are several different notions of maximal torus actions on smooth manifolds, in various contexts: symplectic, Riemannian, complex. In the symplectic context, for the so-called isotropy-maximal actions, as well as for the weaker notion of almost isotropy-maximal actions, we give classifications up to equivariant symplectomorphism. These classification results give symplectic analogues of recent classifications in the complex and Riemannian contexts. Moreover, we deduce that every almost isotropy-maximal symplectic torus action is equivariantly diffeomorphic to a product of a symplectic toric manifold and a torus, answering a question of Ishida. The classification theorems are consequences of Duistermaat and Pelayo's classification of symplectic torus actions with coisotropic orbits.</description>
