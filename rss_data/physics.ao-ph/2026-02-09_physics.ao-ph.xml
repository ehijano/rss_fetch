      <title>Toward generative machine learning for boosting ensembles of climate simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately quantifying uncertainty in predictions and projections arising from irreducible internal climate variability is critical for informed decision making. Such uncertainty is typically assessed using ensembles produced with physics based climate models. However, computational constraints impose a trade off between generating the large ensembles required for robust uncertainty estimation and increasing model resolution to better capture fine scale dynamics. Generative machine learning offers a promising pathway to alleviate these constraints. We develop a conditional Variational Autoencoder (cVAE) trained on a limited sample of climate simulations to generate arbitrary large ensembles. The approach is applied to output from monthly CMIP6 historical and future scenario experiments produced with the Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis' (CCCma's) Earth system model CanESM5. We show that the cVAE model learns the underlying distribution of the data and generates physically consistent samples that reproduce realistic low and high moment statistics, including extremes. Compared with more sophisticated generative architectures, cVAEs offer a mathematically transparent, interpretable, and computationally efficient framework. Their simplicity lead to some limitations, such as overly smooth outputs, spectral bias, and underdispersion, that we discuss along with strategies to mitigate them. Specifically, we show that incorporating output noise improves the representation of climate relevant multiscale variability, and we propose a simple method to achieve this. Finally, we show that cVAE-enhanced ensembles capture realistic global teleconnection patterns, even under climate conditions absent from the training data.</description>

      <title>On large-scale oceanic wind-drift currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Starting from the Navier--Stokes equations in rotating spherical coordinates with constant density and eddy viscosity varying only with depth, and appropriate, physically motivated boundary conditions, we derive an asymptotic model for the description of non-equatorial wind-generated oceanic drift currents. We do not invoke any tangent-plane approximations, thus allowing for large-scale flows that would not be captured by the classical $f$-plane approach. The strategy is to identify two small intrinsic scales for the flow (namely, the ratio between the depth of the Ekman layer and the Earth's radius, and the Rossby number) and, after a careful scaling, perform a double asymptotic expansion with respect to these small parameters. This leads to a system of linear ordinary differential equations with nonlinear boundary conditions for the leading-order dynamics, in addition to which we identify the governing equations for the first-order correction with respect to the Rossby number. First, we establish the existence and uniqueness of the solution to the leading-order equations and show that the solution behaves like a classical Ekman spiral for any eddy viscosity profile; moreover, we discuss the solution of the equations for the first-order correction, for which we also provide a priori bounds in terms of the leading-order solution. Finally, we discuss several cases of explicit eddy viscosity profiles (constant, linearly decreasing, linearly increasing, piecewise linear, and exponentially decaying) and compute the surface deflection angle of the wind-drift current. We obtain results that are remarkably consistent with observations.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Origin of Degree-Day Scaling in Phase-Change Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05248</link>

Abstract: Phase transitions impose topological constraints on thermodynamic state variables, masking energetic fluctuations at the phase boundary. This constraint is most apparent in melting systems, where temperature remains pinned despite continued energy input. Here we resolve this information loss by introducing a latent temperature-a counterfactual trajectory describing the system's unconstrained thermal evolution. We show that energy conservation alone enforces a rigorous duality between the total latent heat dissipated during phase change and the accumulated exceedance of the latent temperature above the melting point. This duality is mathematically equivalent to the one-dimensional Wasserstein-1 distance between the latent and observed temperature trajectories, with the transport cost set by a characteristic surface dissipation timescale and melting energy. Applied to ice-sheet surface melting, this timescale admits a direct physical interpretation in terms of radiative and turbulent heat loss. The same framework yields a first-principles derivation of the empirical Positive Degree Day law and predicts realistic degree-day factors that emerge from surface energy balance, without ad hoc calibration. More broadly, phase change emerges as an optimal transport process that projects continuous energetic variability onto a constrained thermodynamic boundary.</description>
