      <title>Generating Unseen Nonlinear Evolution in Sea Surface Temperature Using a Deep Learning-Based Latent Space Data Assimilation Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advances in data assimilation (DA) methods have greatly improved the accuracy of Earth system predictions. To fuse multi-source data and reconstruct the nonlinear evolution missing from observations, geoscientists are developing future-oriented DA methods. In this paper, we redesign a purely data-driven latent space DA framework (DeepDA) that employs a generative artificial intelligence model to capture the nonlinear evolution in sea surface temperature. Under variational constraints, DeepDA embedded with nonlinear features can effectively fuse heterogeneous data. The results show that DeepDA remains highly stable in capturing and generating nonlinear evolutions even when a large amount of observational information is missing. It can be found that when only 10% of the observation information is available, the error increase of DeepDA does not exceed 40%. Furthermore, DeepDA has been shown to be robust in the fusion of real observations and ensemble simulations. In particular, this paper provides a mechanism analysis of the nonlinear evolution generated by DeepDA from the perspective of physical patterns, which reveals the inherent explainability of our DL model in capturing multi-scale ocean signals.</description>

      <title>Decoupling of carbonate-organic carbon isotope during the Carnian Pluvial Episode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Carnian Pluvial Episode (CPE) was a major global climate change event in the early Late Triassic that significantly affected marine ecosystems and carbon cycles. One of the most prominent features of the CPE is the coupled multiple negative carbonate-organic carbon isotope excursions. However, at Erguan and Xiashulao from eastern Tethys, a decoupling between carbonate-organic carbon isotope during CPE was observed. At the end of early Carnian (Julian), the carbonate carbon isotope showed a negative excursion of 2-3 per-mille, while the organic carbon isotope exhibited a positive excursion of about 3-4 per-mille. In addition, increased terrestrial inputs is indicated by the rising C/N (3 to 10) and decreasing Y/Ho (42 to 27) that coexist with this decoupling. The coupling of carbon isotope negative excursions is from the shallow shelves and the deep slopes, whereas the decoupling occurs from the deep shelf to the shallow slope. In the deep shelf to the shallow slope, sedimentary organic matter is mainly sourced from pelagic before the CPE as evidenced by low C/N (3) and high Y/Ho (36-42). During the CPE, the increased fresh water flux (Sr/Ba &lt;1) enhanced terrestrial input in organic matter, which may cause positive excursions in the carbon isotope record with elevated TOC content. As a result, the carbonate-organic carbon isotope decoupled. In contrast, organic matter in sediments from the shallow shelf and deep slope are mainly from terrestrial and pelagic sources, respectively. This study reveals the significant impact of terrestrial inputs on marine carbon cycling during the Carnian Pluvial Episode, highlighting the crucial role of climate events in modifying the carbon isotope record.</description>

      <title>Surface Wave-Aerodynamic Roughness Length Model for Air-Sea Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A recently introduced model to evaluate the equivalent hydrodynamic length scale $z_0$ for turbulent flow over static rough surfaces is reformulated and extended to enable evaluation of $z_0$ for moving surface waves. The proposed Surface Wave-Aerodynamic Roughness Length model is based on maps of the surface height and its vertical speed as function of position, and Reynolds number. Pressure drag is estimated by approximating the local flow as ideal inviscid ramp flow (Ayala et al., 2024). Wave history effects are included through dependence on the local velocity difference between the air and wave speed. The model is applied to monochromatic and multiscale surfaces, and the predicted surface roughness length scales are compared to measured values and to commonly used wave parametrization methods found in the literature. The proposed model shows significantly improved agreement with data compared to other models.</description>

      <title>Self-attentive Transformer for Fast and Accurate Postprocessing of Temperature and Wind Speed Forecasts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current postprocessing techniques often require separate models for each lead time and disregard possible inter-ensemble relationships by either correcting each member separately or by employing distributional approaches. In this work, we tackle these shortcomings with an innovative, fast and accurate Transformer which postprocesses each ensemble member individually while allowing information exchange across variables, spatial dimensions and lead times by means of multi-headed self-attention. Weather foreacasts are postprocessed over 20 lead times simultaneously while including up to twelve meteorological predictors. We use the EUPPBench dataset for training which contains ensemble predictions from the European Center for Medium-range Weather Forecasts' integrated forecasting system alongside corresponding observations. The work presented here is the first to postprocess the ten and one hundred-meter wind speed forecasts within this benchmark dataset, while also correcting the two-meter temperature. Our approach significantly improves the original forecasts, as measured by the CRPS, with 17.5 % for two-meter temperature, nearly 5% for ten-meter wind speed and 5.3 % for one hundred-meter wind speed, outperforming a classical member-by-member approach employed as competitive benchmark. Furthermore, being up to 75 times faster, it fulfills the demand for rapid operational weather forecasts in various downstream applications, including renewable energy forecasting.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of 'Dunkelflaute' event detection methods considering grid operators' needs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weather conditions associated with low electricity production from renewable energy sources (RES) can result in challenging 'dunkelflaute' events, where 'dunkel' means dark and 'flaute' refers to low windspeeds. In a power system relying significantly on RES, such events can pose a risk for maintaining resource adequacy, i.e. the balance between generation and demand, particularly if they occur over a large geographical area and for an extended period of time. This risk is further emphasized in periods of cold ('kalte') temperature, known as 'kalte dunkelflaute'.
  In this paper, we perform a literature review of different methods to identify dunkelflaute events from hourly RES production and load data alone. We then validate three of these methods by comparing their results with periods of shortage identified from a detailed power system simulation model used by grid operators (ERAA2023). Strengths and weaknesses of these methods are discussed in terms of their data requirements, ease of application, and skill in detecting dunkelflaute events.
  We find that all three 'dunkelflaute' event detection methods have some ability to identify potential energy shortages, but none are able to detect all events. Most likely other factors such as the presence of energy storage capacity, non-weather-dependent outages, and model-related factors limit the skill of these methods. We find that all three methods perform best if the residual load is used as input, rather than hourly RES production or load alone. Overall, we find that Otero'22 is the method that yields the best results while being straightforward to implement and requiring only data with daily resolution. The results hold for countries relying on a small or a large share of RES production in their electricity mix.</description>

      <title>Navigating the Noise: Bringing Clarity to ML Parameterization Design with O(100) Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16177v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine-learning (ML) parameterizations of subgrid processes (here of turbulence, convection, and radiation) may one day replace conventional parameterizations by emulating high-resolution physics without the cost of explicit simulation. However, uncertainty about the relationship between offline and online performance (i.e., when integrated with a large-scale general circulation model (GCM)) hinders their development. Much of this uncertainty stems from limited sampling of the noisy, emergent effects of upstream ML design decisions on downstream online hybrid simulation. Our work rectifies the sampling issue via the construction of a semi-automated, end-to-end pipeline for $\mathcal{O}(100)$ size ensembles of hybrid simulations, revealing important nuances in how systematic reductions in offline error manifest in changes to online error and online stability. For example, removing dropout and switching from a Mean Squared Error (MSE) to a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) loss both reduce offline error, but they have opposite effects on online error and online stability. Other design decisions, like incorporating memory, converting moisture input from specific humidity to relative humidity, using batch normalization, and training on multiple climates do not come with any such compromises. Finally, we show that ensemble sizes of $\mathcal{O}(100)$ may be necessary to reliably detect causally relevant differences online. By enabling rapid online experimentation at scale, we can empirically settle debates regarding subgrid ML parameterization design that would have otherwise remained unresolved in the noise.</description>

      <title>A Staged Deep Learning Approach to Spatial Refinement in 3D Temporal Atmospheric Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10945v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-resolution spatiotemporal simulations effectively capture the complexities of atmospheric plume dispersion in complex terrain. However, their high computational cost makes them impractical for applications requiring rapid responses or iterative processes, such as optimization, uncertainty quantification, or inverse modeling. To address this challenge, this work introduces the Dual-Stage Temporal Three-dimensional UNet Super-resolution (DST3D-UNet-SR) model, a highly efficient deep learning model for plume dispersion prediction. DST3D-UNet-SR is composed of two sequential modules: the temporal module (TM), which predicts the transient evolution of a plume in complex terrain from low-resolution temporal data, and the spatial refinement module (SRM), which subsequently enhances the spatial resolution of the TM predictions. We train DST3DUNet- SR using a comprehensive dataset derived from high-resolution large eddy simulations (LES) of plume transport. We propose the DST3D-UNet-SR model to significantly accelerate LES simulations of three-dimensional plume dispersion by three orders of magnitude. Additionally, the model demonstrates the ability to dynamically adapt to evolving conditions through the incorporation of new observational data, substantially improving prediction accuracy in high-concentration regions near the source.
