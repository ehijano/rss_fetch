      <title>Electron Scattering at a Soft Temporal Potential Step</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We solve the problem of electron scattering at a soft temporal potential step. Given the relativistic nature of the problem, we use the Dirac equation, with its spinor wavefunction. We find solutions in terms of hypergeometric functions, which demonstrate that the observed phenomenon of later forward-wave and backward-wave electron scattering previously reported for a sharp (Heaviside) temporal potential step can be obtained experimentally and applied to new electronic devices.</description>

      <title>AltGraph: Redesigning Quantum Circuits Using Generative Graph Models for Efficient Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum circuit transformation aims to produce equivalent circuits while optimizing for various aspects such as circuit depth, gate count, and compatibility with modern Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. There are two techniques for circuit transformation. The first is a rule-based approach that greedily cancels out pairs of gates that equate to the identity unitary operation. Rule-based approaches are used in quantum compilers such as Qiskit, tket, and Quilc. The second is a search-based approach that tries to find an equivalent quantum circuit by exploring the quantum circuits search space. Search-based approaches typically rely on machine learning techniques such as generative models and Reinforcement Learning (RL). In this work, we propose AltGraph, a novel search-based circuit transformation approach that generates equivalent quantum circuits using existing generative graph models. We use three main graph models: DAG Variational Autoencoder (D-VAE) with two variants: Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), and Deep Generative Model for Graphs (DeepGMG) that take a Direct Acyclic Graph (DAG) of the quantum circuit as input and output a new DAG from which we reconstruct the equivalent quantum circuit. Next, we perturb the latent space to generate equivalent quantum circuits some of which may be more compatible with the hardware coupling map and/or enable better optimization leading to reduced gate count and circuit depth. AltGraph achieves on average a 37.55% reduction in the number of gates and a 37.75% reduction in the circuit depth post-transpiling compared to the original transpiled circuit with only 0.0074 Mean Squared Error (MSE) in the density matrix.</description>

      <title>QCEDA: Using Quantum Computers for EDA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The field of Electronic Design Automation (EDA) is crucial for microelectronics, but the increasing complexity of Integrated Circuits (ICs) poses challenges for conventional EDA: Corresponding problems are often NP-hard and are therefore in general solved by heuristics, not guaranteeing optimal solutions. Quantum computers may offer better solutions due to their potential for optimization through entanglement, superposition, and interference. Most of the works in the area of EDA and quantum computers focus on how to use EDA for building quantum circuits. However, almost no research focuses on exploiting quantum computers for solving EDA problems. Therefore, this paper investigates the feasibility and potential of quantum computing for a typical EDA optimization problem broken down to the Min-$k$-Union problem. The problem is mathematically transformed into a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem, which was successfully solved on an IBM quantum computer and a D-Wave quantum annealer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A approach for two-dimensional(2D) negative permeability in a $\Lambda$-type three-level atomic system interacting with a probe magnetic and the superposition of two orthogonal standing-wave fields is proposed. Through the theoretical analysis and numerical simulation, two equally and tunable peak maxima of negative magnetic responses are observed in the x-y plane, and around the peak maxima region the negative permeability is isotropic. A new avenue to 2D isotropic negative</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Negative refractive index (NRI) of the mescopic dissipative left-handed transmission line (LHTL) is manipulated by the displaced squeezed Fock state (DSFS) and the dissipation presented by the resistance and conductance. Comparing to the classical LHTL, some specific quantum characteristics are shown in the LHTL because of quantum effect, which will be significant to its miniaturization application in microwave frequency.</description>

      <title>Intensity product-based optical sensing to beat the diffraction limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classically defined optical phase sensitivity is known as the shot-noise limit (SNL) or standard quantum limit originating in the uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics. Based on SNL, the phase resolution (sensitivity) is inversely proportional to the square root N, where N is the number of interfering photons or individually measured events. Thus, using a high-power laser is advantageous due to the square root N gain in the signal-to-noise ratio. In an optical interferometer, however, the phase resolution remains in the N=1 case unless N probe photons are resolved in a detection process, resulting in the diffraction limit of classical optics. Here, a projective measurement is proposed for intensity product-based optical sensing to realize SNL in a typical interferometer commonly used for high-precision metrology. For this, one of the output ports of the interferometer is evenly divided into N ports and measured them for mth-intensity correlations (m is less than or equal to N), where the maximum N is given by the total number of photons of the input laser. The maximum temporal delay among N photons is constrained by the spectral bandwidth of the laser, which is the same as the effective coherence time of the photon ensemble used for coincidence detection-based quantum sensing.</description>

      <title>Accelerated quantum search using partial oracles and Grover's algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grover's algorithm, orginally conceived as a means of searching an unordered database, can also be used as a technique for extracting solutions from the result sets generated by quantum computations. The algorithm exploits the concept of an oracle function, which abstracts the process of matching a search item (returning 1 for a match and 0 otherwise). This black-box approach hides the details of a search problem and works with the assumption that the items in the search space are completely unordered. In this case, searching for 1 target item in a search space of size $N$ scales as $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N})$ oracle queries (or $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N/M})$ oracle queries for $M$ target items in a search space of size $N$). Hidden inside the typical black-box oracle, however, the process of matching an item usually involves matching multiple data bits. In this article, we explore the idea of associating a separate oracle with each bit of the matching condition, obtaining multiple partial oracle functions which can be tested independently. Exploring this idea leads to a multi-stage hybrid search algorithm, whose performance can fall within a wide range, anywhere between $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N})$ (same as Grover) or $\mathcal{O}(\log(N))$ (exponentially faster). Apparently, the search acceleration works by dynamically discovering order in the search space, where the order consists of correlations between the partial oracle functions and the search index. This new algorithm is validated against the simplest kind of search scenario.</description>

      <title>Noncommuting charges' effect on the thermalization of local observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying noncommuting conserved quantities (or `charges') has produced a conceptual puzzle. Recent results suggest that noncommuting charges hinder thermalization in some ways, yet promote it in others. To help resolve this puzzle, we demonstrate how noncommuting charges can promote thermalization by reducing the number of local observables that thermalize according to the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis. We first establish a correspondence between charges and sufficient conditions for observables to not thermalize. These conditions are known as `dynamical symmetries.' We demonstrate that for each pair of dynamical symmetries a Hamiltonian has, there exists a corresponding charge. We prove that the reciprocal relationship holds for a broad range of charges. From this correspondence, we demonstrate that introducing a new charge to a system can either contribute to or disrupt its existing non-stationary dynamics. If the new charge commutes with existing ones, the system's non-stationary dynamics remain intact, and new ones emerge; if not, the existing non-stationary dynamics are removed. We illustrate our results using variou models. Our results demonstrate a facet of thermalization which noncommuting charges promote.</description>

      <title>Strong coupling and single-photon nonlinearity in free-electron quantum optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The observation that free electrons can interact coherently with quantized electromagnetic fields and matter systems has led to a plethora of proposals leveraging the unique quantum properties of free electrons. At the heart of these proposals lies the assumption of a strong quantum interaction between a flying free electron and a photonic mode. However, existing schemes are intrinsically limited by electron diffraction, which puts an upper bound on the interaction length and therefore the quantum coupling strength. Here, we propose the use of "free-electron fibers'': effectively one-dimensional photonic systems where free electrons co-propagate with two guided modes. The first mode applies a ponderomotive trap to the free electron, effectively lifting the limitations due to electron diffraction. The second mode strongly couples to the guided free electron, with an enhanced coupling that is orders of magnitude larger than previous designs. Moreover, the extended interaction lengths enabled by our scheme allows for strong single-photon nonlinearities mediated by free electrons. We predict a few interesting observable quantum effects in our system, such as deterministic single-photon emission and complex, nonlinear multimode dynamics. Our proposal paves the way towards the realization of many anticipated effects in free-electron quantum optics, such as non-Gaussian light generation, deterministic single photon emission, and quantum gates controlled by free-electron--photon interactions.</description>

      <title>The status of the quantum PCP conjecture (games version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In classical complexity theory, the two definitions of probabilistically checkable proofs -- the constraint satisfaction and the nonlocal games version -- are computationally equal in power. In the quantum setting, the situation is far less clear. The result MIP* = RE of Ji et. al. (arXiv:2001.04383) and refinements by Natarajan and Zhang (arXiv:2302.04322) show that multiprover interactive proof systems with polylogarithmically long messages can solve any decision problem in RE, including undecidable problems like the halting problem. These results show that any connection between the "constraint satisfaction" or "Hamiltonian" quantum PCP conjecture and nonlocal games must involve restricting the players in the game to be computationally efficient. This note contains two main results: (1) we give a "quantum games PCP for AM" in the form of a new construction of a succinct MIP* protocol with efficient provers for the canonical AM-complete problem, and (2) we explain an error in the energy amplification procedure of Natarajan and Vidick (arXiv:1710.03062) which invalidates their claim to have constructed a quantum games PCP for a QMA-complete problem. In surveying the obstacles remaining towards a quantum games PCP for QMA, we highlight the importance and challenge of understanding gap amplification for Hamiltonians even when locality is replaced by much weaker constraints, such as bounds on the "Pauli spectrum" of the Hamiltonian. We hope these questions will motivate progress towards new "baby versions" of Hamiltonian quantum PCP conjecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geometrical methods in quantum information are very promising for both providing technical tools and intuition into difficult control or optimization problems. Moreover, they are of fundamental importance in connecting pure geometrical theories, like GR, to quantum mechanics, like in the AdS/CFT correspondence. In this paper, we first make a survey of the most important settings in which geometrical methods have proven useful to quantum information theory. Then, we lay down a general framework for an action principle for quantum resources like entanglement, coherence, and anti-flatness. We discuss the case of a two-qubit system.</description>

      <title>Single-Shot Readout and Weak Measurement of a Tin-Vacancy Qubit in Diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The negatively charged tin-vacancy center in diamond (SnV$^-$) is an emerging platform for building the next generation of long-distance quantum networks. This is due to the SnV$^-$'s favorable optical and spin properties including bright emission, insensitivity to electronic noise, and long spin coherence times at temperatures above 1 Kelvin. Here, we demonstrate measurement of a single SnV$^-$ electronic spin with a single-shot readout fidelity of $87.4\%$, which can be further improved to $98.5\%$ by conditioning on multiple readouts. We show this performance is compatible with rapid microwave spin control, demonstrating that the trade-off between optical readout and spin control inherent to group-IV centers in diamond can be overcome for the SnV$^-$. Finally, we use weak quantum measurement to study measurement induced dephasing; this illuminates the fundamental interplay between measurement and decoherence in quantum mechanics, and makes use of the qubit's spin coherence as a metrological tool. Taken together, these results overcome an important hurdle in the development of the SnV$^-$ based quantum technologies, and in the process, develop techniques and understanding broadly applicable to the study of solid-state quantum emitters.</description>

      <title>On Observation and The Completion of Quantum Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We start with a discussion of the use of mathematics to model the real world then justify the role of Hilbert space formalism for such modelling in the general context of quantum logic. Following this, the incompleteness of the Schr\"odinger equation is discussed as well as the incompleteness of von Neumann's measurement approach \cite{vN}. Subsequently, it is shown that quantum mechanics is indeed completed by the addition of an observer, however the observer is not described in the Hamiltonian formalism but \emph{necessarily} by the quantum stochastic formalism discovered in \cite{HP}. Consequently, the complete theory of quantum mechanics appears to be the Quantum Filtering Theory \cite{ND,NLF}. Finally, it is shown how Schr\"odinger's cat may be understood as a quantum filter, providing an intuitively realistic model and an insight into how quantum filtering works.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Information-theoretic insights have proven fruitful in many areas of quantum physics. But can the fundamental dynamics of quantum systems be derived from purely information-theoretic principles, without resorting to Hilbert space structures such as unitary evolution and self-adjoint observables? Here we provide a model where the dynamics originates from a condition of informational non-equilibrium, the deviation of the system's state from a reference state associated to a field of identically prepared systems. Combining this idea with three basic information-theoretic principles, we derive a notion of energy that captures the main features of energy in quantum theory: it is observable, bounded from below, invariant under time-evolution, in one-to-one correspondence with the generator of the dynamics, and quantitatively related to the speed of state changes. Our results provide an information-theoretic reconstruction of the Mandelstam-Tamm bound on the speed of quantum evolutions, establishing a bridge between dynamical and information-theoretic notions.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Protected Topological Phases of Mixed States in the Doubled Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay of symmetry and topology in quantum many-body mixed states has recently garnered significant interest. In a phenomenon not seen in pure states, mixed states can exhibit average symmetries -- symmetries that act on component states while leaving the ensemble invariant. In this work, we systematically characterize symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases of short-range entangled (SRE) mixed states of spin systems -- protected by both average and exact symmetries -- by studying their pure Choi states in a doubled Hilbert space, where the familiar notions and tools for SRE and SPT pure states apply. This advantage of the doubled space comes with a price: extra symmetries as well as subtleties around how hermiticity and positivity of the original density matrix constrain the possible SPT invariants. Nevertheless, the doubled space perspective allows us to obtain a systematic classification of mixed-state SPT (MSPT) phases. We also investigate the robustness of MSPT invariants under symmetric finite-depth quantum channels, the bulk-boundary correspondence for MSPT phases, and the consequences of the MSPT invariants for the separability of mixed states and the symmetry-protected sign problem. In addition to MSPT phases, we study the patterns of spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) of mixed states, including the phenomenon of exact-to-average SSB, and the order parameters that detect them. Mixed state SSB is related to an ingappability constraint on symmetric Lindbladian dynamics.</description>

      <title>Dipole-dipole-interaction-induced entanglement between two-dimensional ferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the viability of dipole-dipole interaction as a means of entangling two distant ferromagnets. To this end we make use of the Bogoliubov transformation as a symplectic transformation. We show that the coupling of the uniform magnon modes can be expressed using four squeezing parameters which we interpret in terms of hybridization, one-mode and two-mode squeezing. We utilize the expansion in terms of the squeezing parameters to obtain an analytic formula for the entanglement in the magnon ground state using the logarithmic negativity as entanglement measure. Our investigation predicts that for infinitely large two-dimensional ferromagnets, the dipole-dipole interaction does not lead to significant long-range entanglement. However, in the case of finite ferromagnets, finite entanglement can be expected</description>

      <title>Acceptable solutions of the Schrodinger radial equation for a particle in a two-dimensional central potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stationary states of a particle in a central potential are usually taken as a product of an angular part Phi and a radial part R. The function R satisfies the so-called radial equation and is usually solved by demanding R to be finite at the origin. In this work we examine the reason for this requirement in the case of a two-dimensional (2D) central force problem. In contrast to some claims commonly accepted, the reason for discarding solutions with divergent R(0) is not the need to have a normalizable wave function. In fact some wave functions can be normalized even if R is singular at the origin. Instead, here we show that if R is singular, the complete wave function psi = Phi R fails to satisfy the full Schrodinger equation, but follows a equation similar to Schrodinger's but with an additional term containing the 2D Dirac delta function or its derivatives. Thus, psi is not a true eigenfunction of the Hamiltonian. In contrast, there are no additional terms in the equation for wave functions psi built from solutions R that remain finite at the origin. A similar situation also occurs for 3D central potentials as has been shown recently. A comparison between the 2D and 3D cases is carried out.</description>

      <title>Measurement-only dynamical phase transition of topological and boundary orders in toric code and gauge-Higgs models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extensively study long-time dynamics and fate of topologically-ordered state in toric code model evolving through a projective measurement-only circuit. The circuit is composed of several measurement operators corresponding to each term of toric code Hamiltonian with magnetic-field perturbations, which is a gauge-fixed version of a (2+1)-dimensional gauge-Higgs model. We employ a cylinder geometry to classify stationary states after long-time measurement dynamics. The appearing stationary states depend on measurement probabilities for each measurement operator. The Higgs, confined and deconfined phases exist in the time evolution by the circuit. We find that both the Higgs and confined phases are clearly separated from the deconfined phase by topological entanglement entropy, whereas the phase boundary between the Higgs and confined phases is obtained by long-range orders on the boundaries supporting the recent observation that the Higgs and confined phases are both one of symmetry-protected-topological states.</description>

      <title>Quantum control by the environment: Turing uncomputability, Optimization over Stiefel manifolds, Reachable sets, and Incoherent GRAPE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to control quantum systems is necessary for many applications of quantum technologies ranging from gate generation in quantum computation to NMR and laser control of chemical reactions. In many practical situations, the controlled quantum systems are open, i.e., interacting with the environment. While often influence of the environment is considered as an obstacle for controlling the systems, in some cases it can be exploited as a useful resource. In this note, we briefly review some results on control of open quantum systems using environment as a resource, including control by engineered environments and by non-selective measurements, Turing uncomputability of discrete quantum control, parametrization of Kraus maps by points of the Stiefel manifolds and corresponding Riemanninan optimization, control by dissipation and time-dependent decoherence rates, reachable sets, and incoherent GRAPE (Gradient Ascent Pulse Engineering) -- inGRAPE -- for gradient-based optimization.</description>

      <title>Tensor Quantum Programming</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Running quantum algorithms often involves implementing complex quantum circuits with such a large number of multi-qubit gates that the challenge of tackling practical applications appears daunting. To date, no experiments have successfully demonstrated a quantum advantage due to the ease with which the results can be adequately replicated on classical computers through the use of tensor network algorithms. Additionally, it remains unclear even in theory where exactly these advantages are rooted within quantum systems because the logarithmic complexity commonly associated with quantum algorithms is also present in algorithms based on tensor networks. In this article, we propose a novel approach called Tensor Quantum Programming, which leverages tensor networks for hybrid quantum computing. Our key insight is that the primary challenge of algorithms based on tensor networks lies in their high ranks (bond dimensions). Quantum computing offers a potential solution to this challenge, as an ideal quantum computer can represent tensors with arbitrarily high ranks in contrast to classical counterparts, which indicates the way towards quantum advantage. While tensor-based vector-encoding and state-readout are known procedures, the matrix-encoding required for performing matrix-vector multiplications directly on quantum devices remained unsolved. Here, we developed an algorithm that encodes Matrix Product Operators into quantum circuits with a depth that depends linearly on the number of qubits. It demonstrates effectiveness on up to 50 qubits for several matrices frequently encountered in differential equations, optimization problems, and quantum chemistry. We view this work as an initial stride towards the creation of genuinely practical quantum algorithms.</description>

      <title>First Demonstration of 25{\lambda} x 10 Gb/s C+L Band Classical / DV-QKD Co-Existence Over Single Bidirectional Fiber Link</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As quantum key distribution has reached the maturity level for practical deployment, questions about the co-integration with existing classical communication systems are of utmost importance. To this end we demonstrate how the co-propagation of classical and quantum signals can benefit from the development of novel hollow-core fibers. We demonstrate a secure key rate of 330 bit/s for a quantum channel at 1538 nm in the presence of 25 x 10 Gb/s classical channels, transmitted at an aggregated launch power of 12 dBm, spanning over the C+L-band in the same hollow-core fiber link. Furthermore, we show the co-integration of the classical key-distillation channel onto this fiber link, turning it into a bidirectional fiber link and thereby mitigating the need for multiple fibers. We believe this to be an important step towards the deployment and integration of hollow-core fibers together with DV-QKD for the inherently secure telecom network of the future.</description>

      <title>Towards an All-Silicon QKD Transmitter Sourced by a Ge-on-Si Light Emitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a novel transmitter concept for quantum key distribution based on the polarization-encoded BB84 protocol, which is sourced by the incoherent light of a forward-biased Ge-on-Si PIN junction. We investigate two architectures for quantum state preparation, including independent polarization encoding through multiple modulators and a simplified approach leveraging on an interferometric polarization modulator. We experimentally prove that the Ge-on-Si light source can accommodate for quantum key generation by accomplishing raw-key rates of 2.15 kbit/s at a quantum bit error ratio of 7.71% at a symbol rate of 1 GHz. We further investigate the impact of depolarization along fiber-based transmission channels in combination with the broadband nature of the incoherent light source. Our results prove the feasibility of a fully-integrated silicon quantum key distribution transmitter, including its light source, for possible short-reach applications in zero-trust intra-datacenter environments.</description>

      <title>Scalability of quantum error mitigation techniques: from utility to advantage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Error mitigation has elevated quantum computing to the scale of hundreds of qubits and tens of layers; however, yet larger scales (deeper circuits) are needed to fully exploit the potential of quantum computing to solve practical problems otherwise intractable. Here we demonstrate three key results that pave the way for the leap from quantum utility to quantum advantage: (1) we present a thorough derivation of random and systematic errors associated to the most advanced error mitigation strategies, including probabilistic error cancellation (PEC), zero noise extrapolation (ZNE) with probabilistic error amplification, and tensor-network error mitigation (TEM); (2) we prove that TEM (i) has the lowest sampling overhead among all three techniques under realistic noise, (ii) is optimal, in the sense that it saturates the universal lower cost bound for error mitigation, and (iii) is therefore the most promising approach to quantum advantage; (3) we propose a concrete notion of practical quantum advantage in terms of the universality of algorithms, stemming from the commercial need for a problem-independent quantum simulation device. We also establish a connection between error mitigation, relying on additional measurements, and error correction, relying on additional qubits, by demonstrating that TEM with a sufficient bond dimension works similarly to an error correcting code of distance 3. We foresee that the interplay and trade-off between the two resources will be the key to a smooth transition between error mitigation and error correction, and hence between near-term and fault-tolerant quantum computers. Meanwhile, we argue that quantum computing with optimal error mitigation, relying on modest classical computer power for tensor network contraction, has the potential to reach larger scales in accurate simulation than classical methods alone.</description>

      <title>A non-hermitean momentum operator for the particle in a box</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a discrete non-hermitean momentum operator, which implements faithfully the non self-adjoint nature of momentum for a particle in a box. Its eigenfunctions are strictly limited to the interior of the box in the continuum limit, with the quarter wave as first non-trivial eigenstate. We show how to construct the corresponding hermitean Hamiltonian for the infinite well as concrete example to realize unitary dynamics. The resulting Hilbert space can be decomposed into a physical and unphysical subspace, which are mutually orthogonal. The physical subspace in the continuum limit reproduces that of the continuum theory and we give numerical evidence that the correct probability distributions for momentum and energy are recovered.</description>

Abstract: Quantum walks are referred to as quantum analogues to random walks in mathematics. They have been studied as quantum algorithms in quantum information for quantum computers. There are two types of quantum walks. One is the discrete-time quantum walk and the other is the continuous-time quantum walk. We study a continuous-time quantum walk on the half line and challenge to find a limit theorem for it in this paper. As a result, approximate behavior of the quantum walker is revealed after the system of quantum walk gets updated in long time.</description>

      <title>On Strong Converse Theorems for Quantum Hypothesis Testing and Channel Coding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong converse theorems refer to the study of impossibility results in information theory. In particular, Mosonyi and Ogawa established a one-shot strong converse bound for quantum hypothesis testing [Comm. Math. Phys, 334(3), 2014], which servers as a primitive tool for establishing a variety of tight strong converse theorems in quantum information theory. In this short note, we demonstrate an alternative one-line proof for this bound via the variational expression of measured R\'enyi divergences [Lett. Math. Phys, 107(12), 2017]. Then, we show that the variational expression is a direct consequence of H\"older's inequality.</description>

      <title>General criterion for non-Hermitian skin effects and Application: Fock space skin effects in many body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Hermiticity enables macroscopic accumulation of bulk states, named non-Hermitian skin effects. The non-Hermitian skin effects are well-established for single-particle systems, but their proper characterization for general systems is elusive. Here, we propose a general criterion of non-Hermitian skin effects, which works for any finite-dimensional system evolved by a linear operator. The applicable systems include many-body systems and network systems. A system meeting the criterion exhibits enhanced non-normality of the evolution operator, accompanied by exceptional characteristics intrinsic to non-Hermitian systems. Applying the criterion, we discover a new type of non-Hermitian skin effect in many-body systems, which we dub the Fock space skin effect. We also discuss the Fock space skin effect-induced slow dynamics, which gives an experimental signal for the Fock space skin effect.</description>

      <title>Nonlocality of the energy density of a spontaneously emitted single-photon from a Hydrogen atom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze through the expectation value of the energy density the spatial nonlocality of single photons emitted by the spontaneous decay of a Hydrogen atom. By using a minimal coupling between the quantized electromagnetic field and the atom, we compute the state of the photon under the assumption that only a single-photon is produced. The calculations are thus performed in the subspace of single-photon states which is essentially equivalent to the rotating wave approximation. We obtain a characterization of the spatial decay of the energy density. We compute the asymptotic limit of large distances from the atom at each given time, and find an algebraic behavior of $1/r^6$. This result confirms that the energy density of single-photon states is nonlocal and the algebraic decay is far from the maximal quasiexponential localization predicted by the theory.</description>

      <title>Fast delivery of heralded atom-photon quantum correlation over 12km fiber through multiplexing enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributing quantum entanglement between distant parties is a significant but difficult task in quantum information science, as it can enable numerous applications but suffers from exponential decay in the quantum channel. Quantum repeater is one of the most promising approaches towards this goal. In a quantum repeater protocol, it is essential that the entanglement generation speed within each elementary link is faster than the memory decoherence rate, to enable the scale-up of the quantum repeater by connecting neighboring repeater segments. This stringent requirement has not been implemented over a fiber of metropolitan scale so far. As a step towards this challenging goal, in this work we experimentally realize multiplexing-enhanced generation of heralded atom-photon quantum correlation over a 12km fiber. We excite the memory modes in a multiplexed quantum memory successively to generate 280 pairs of atom-photon quantum correlations with a train of photonic time-bin pulses filling the long fiber. After successful detection of a heralding signal, the excited memory mode can be identified and retrieved into idler photons on demand with either fixed or variable storage time. With the multiplexing enhancement, the heralding rate of atom-photon correlation can reach 1.95kHz, and the ratio between the quantum correlation generation rate to memory decoherence rate can be improved to 0.46 for a fiber length of 12km, which is so far the best for long fiber length (&gt;10km) to our knowledge. This work therefore constitutes an important step towards the realization of a large-scale quantum repeater network.</description>

      <title>Extremality of stabilizer states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the extremality of stabilizer states to reveal their exceptional role in the space of all $n$-qubit/qudit states. We establish uncertainty principles for the characteristic function and the Wigner function of states, respectively. We find that only stabilizer states achieve saturation in these principles. Furthermore, we prove a general theorem that stabilizer states are extremal for convex information measures invariant under local unitaries. We explore this extremality in the context of various quantum information and correlation measures, including entanglement entropy, conditional entropy and other entanglement measures. Additionally, leveraging the recent discovery that stabilizer states are the limit states under quantum convolution, we establish the monotonicity of the entanglement entropy and conditional entropy under quantum convolution. These results highlight the remarkable information-theoretic properties of stabilizer states. Their extremality provides valuable insights into their ability to capture information content and correlations, paving the way for further exploration of their potential in quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>A Secure Quantum Key Distribution Protocol Using Two-Particle Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) relies on innovative methods to enhance its security and efficiency. Unextendible Product Bases (UPBs) hold promise in quantum cryptography due to their inherent indistinguishability, yet they are underutilized in QKD protocols. This paper introduces a protocol utilizing UPBs to establish quantum keys between distant parties. Specifically, we propose a protocol utilizing a $3\times 3$ tile UPB, where Alice sequentially transmits subsystem states to Bob through quantum channels. The protocol's security is underpinned by the no-cloning theorem, prohibiting the cloning of orthogonal states. We analyze potential attacks, including intercept-resend and detector blinding attacks when quantum channels are noiseless, and discuss the challenges posed by the indistinguishability of our protocol for eavesdroppers, thereby enhancing QKD security.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a new optimized quantum block-ZXZ decomposition method [4,5,6] that results in the construction of more optimal quantum circuits than the quantum Shannon decomposition (QSD) [17] can achieve, which has been the most optimal decomposition method since 2006. With the proposed decomposition, a general 3-qubit gate can be decomposed using 19 CNOT gates (rather than 20). For general n-qubit gates, the proposed decomposition generates circuits that have $(22/48) 4^n - (3/2) 2^n + (5/3)$ CNOT gates , which is less that the best known exact decomposition algorithm by $(4^{n-2} -1)/3$ CNOT gates.</description>

Abstract: Our study reveals electron spin in a cavity as a stable circulating current density, characterized by a torus topology. This current density circulates concentrically beyond the cavity boundary, illustrating the concept of evanescent wave spin. While the interaction with a uniform magnetic field aligns with established spin-field observations, our analysis of regional contributions deviates from particle-based spin predictions. The integration of charge and spin properties into a single Lorentz covariant entity suggests that the electron wave constitutes the fundamental and deterministic reality of the electron.</description>

      <title>On the choice of non-linear terms in blocking cats states by energy conservations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In [Entropy 25, 564 (2023)] I considered the problem of wavefunction ensembles for spin models. To observe magnetization at finite temperature, I had to add macroscopic nonlinear terms blocking macroscopic superposition by energy conservation. The nonlinear terms were of the kind introduced in [W.D. Wick, arXiv:1710.03278 (2017)] to block spatial cats by energy conservation as solution to the Measurement Problem. Reviewing the theory from [W.D. Wick, arXiv:1710.03278 (2017), arXiv:1908.02352 (2019)], I derive a commutation relation that these nonlinear terms have to satisfy to be admitted and show that the terms of [W.D. Wick, arXiv:1710.03278 (2017), arXiv:2008.08663 (2020)] restricting the wavefunctions in space satisfies such relations. I generalize the terms of [Entropy 25, 564 (2023)] for non-pure spin models and check if they also satisfy the constraints, concluding with a negative answer. An experimental estimate to test the proposal of [W.D. Wick, arXiv:1710.03278 (2017)] is described at the end.</description>

      <title>Experimental fault-tolerant code switching</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum error correction is a crucial tool for mitigating hardware errors in quantum computers by encoding logical information into multiple physical qubits. However, no single error-correcting code allows for an intrinsically fault-tolerant implementation of all the gates needed for universal quantum computing [1-3]. One way to tackle this problem is to switch between two suitable error-correcting codes, while preserving the encoded logical information, which in combination give access to a fault-tolerant universal gate set [4-6]. In this work, we present the first experimental implementation of fault-tolerant code switching between two codes. One is the seven-qubit color code [7], which features fault-tolerant CNOT and $H$ quantum gates, while the other one, the 10-qubit code [8], allows for a fault-tolerant $T$-gate implementation. Together they form a complementary universal gate set. Building on essential code switching building blocks, we construct logical circuits and prepare 12 different logical states which are not accessible natively in a fault-tolerant way within a single code. Finally, we use code switching to entangle two logical qubits employing the full universal gate set in a single logical quantum circuit. Our results experimentally open up a new route towards deterministic control over logical qubits with low auxiliary qubit overhead, not relying on the probabilistic preparation of resource states.</description>

      <title>Quantum-limited superresolution of two incoherent point sources with unknown photon numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superresolution has been demonstrated to overcome the limitation of the Rayleigh's criterion and achieve significant improvement of the precision in resolving the centroid separation of two incoherent optical point sources. However, in recent years, it was found that if the photon numbers of the two incoherent optical sources are unknown, the precision of superresolution vanishes when the two photon numbers are actually different. In this work, we analyze the estimation precision of the centroid separation between two incoherent optical sources with the same point-spread functions and unknown photon numbers in detail, and show that when the photon numbers of the two optical sources are different but sufficiently close, the superresolution can still realized but with different precisions. We find the condition on how close the photons numbers of two optical sources need to be to realize the superresolution, and derive the precision of superresolution in different regimes of the photon number difference. We further consider the superresolution for two incoherent optical sources with different point-spread functions, and show that the competition between the difference of photon numbers, the difference of the two point-spread functions and the centroid separation of the two optical sources determines the precision of superresolution. The results exhibit various precision limits of the centroid separation distinct from that of two point sources with identical point-spread functions and equal photon numbers. The results are finally illustrated by Gaussian point-spread functions.</description>

      <title>Accurate heat currents via reorganised master equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accurate characterisation of energy exchanges between nanoscale quantum systems and their environments is of paramount importance for quantum technologies, and central to quantum thermodynamics. Here, we show that, in order to accurately approximate steady-state heat currents via perturbative master equations, the coupling-induced reorganisation correction to the system's energy must be carefully taken into account. Not doing so, may yield sizeable errors, especially at low, or even moderate temperatures. In particular, we show how a 'reorganised master equation' can produce very accurate estimates for the heat currents when the reorganisation energy is weak and one works with environments with a broad spectrum. Notably, such master equation outperforms its 'non-reorganised' counterpart in the calculation of heat currents, at modelling dynamics, and at correctly capturing equilibration. This is so even if both types of equation are derived to the same order of perturbation theory. Most importantly, working with reorganised master equations does not involve additional complications when compared with alternative approaches. Also, invoking the secular approximation to secure thermodynamic consistency does not compromise their precision.</description>

      <title>Probing Hilbert Space Fragmentation with Strongly Interacting Rydberg Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hilbert space fragmentation provides a mechanism to break ergodicity in closed many-body systems. Here, we propose a realistic scheme to comprehensively explore this exotic paradigm on a Rydberg quantum simulator. We show that the Rydberg Ising model in the large detuning regime can be mapped to a generalized folded XXZ model featuring a strongly fragmented Hilbert space. The emergent Hamiltonian, however, displays distinct time scales for the transport of a magnon and a hole excitation. This interesting property facilitates a continuous tuning of the Krylov-subspace ergodicity, from the integrable regime, to the Krylov-restricted thermal phase, and eventually to the statistical bubble localization region. By further introducing nonlocal interactions, we find that both the fragmentation behavior and the ergodicity of the Krylov subspace can be significantly enriched. We also examine the role of atomic position disorders and identify a symmetry-selective many-body localization transition. We demonstrate that these phenomena manifest themselves in quench dynamics, which can be readily probed in state-of-the-art Rydberg array setups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper examines the use of tensor networks, which can efficiently represent high-dimensional quantum states, in language modeling. It is a distillation and continuation of the work done in (van der Poel, 2023). To do so, we will abstract the problem down to modeling Motzkin spin chains, which exhibit long-range correlations reminiscent of those found in language. The Matrix Product State (MPS), also known as the tensor train, has a bond dimension which scales as the length of the sequence it models. To combat this, we use the factored core MPS, whose bond dimension scales sub-linearly. We find that the tensor models reach near perfect classifying ability, and maintain a stable level of performance as the number of valid training examples is decreased.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A non-separable wave-like integro-differential equation for the time evolution of the Wigner distribution function in phase space is educed from the corresponding separable kinetic equation. It is shown that it leads to non-local dispersion effects that may involve complex group velocities and also display non-unitary features as entropy production. By employing the quantum hydrodynamical description a non-local evolution wave equation is also derived by synthesizing the Hamilton-Jacobi equation with that of continuity, which predicts the generation of quadrupole quantum effects in the propagation of the spatial probability density. Extension of the formalism for a boson scalar field is also presented along with a brief commentary on the issue of irreversibility.</description>

      <title>Vison condensation and spinon confinement in a kagome lattice $\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin liquid: A numerical study of a quantum dimer model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum spin liquids are exotic many-body states featured with long-range entanglement and fractional anyon quasiparticles. Quantum phase transitions of spin liquids are particularly interesting problems related with novel phenomena of anyon condensation and anyon confinement. Here we study a quantum dimer model which implements a transition between a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin liquid ($\mathbb{Z}_2$SL) and a valence bond solid (VBS) on the kagome lattice. The transition is driven by the condensation of vison excitation of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin liquid, which impacts on other anyon excitations especially leading to the confinement of spinon excitations. By numerical exact diagonalization of the dimer model, we directly measure the vison condensation using vison string operators, and explicitly check a confining potential acting on spinon excitations in the VBS state. It is observed that topological degeneracy of the spin liquid state is lifted concomitantly with the vison condensation. The dimer ordering pattern of the VBS state is identified by investigating dimer structure factor. Furthermore, we find an interesting state that exhibits features of spin liquid and VBS simultaneously. We discuss the origin of the mixed behaviors and possible scenarios expected in thermodynamic limit. This work complements the previous analytical studies on the dimer model, Phys. Rev. B 87, 104408 (2013) and Phys. Rev. B 92, 205131 (2015), by providing numerical evidences on the vison condensation and the spinon confinement in the $\mathbb{Z}_2$SL-to-VBS transition.</description>

      <title>Single-frame transmission and phase imaging using off-axis holography with undetected photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Imaging with undetected photons relies upon nonlinear interferometry to extract the spatial image from an infrared probe beam and reveal it in the interference pattern of an easier-to-detect visible beam. Typically, the transmission and phase images are extracted using phase-shifting techniques and combining interferograms from multiple frames. Here we show that off-axis digital holography enables reconstruction of both transmission and phase images at the infrared wavelength from a single interferogram, and hence a single frame, recorded in the visible. This eliminates the need for phase stepping and multiple acquisitions, thereby greatly reducing total measurement time for imaging with long acquisition times at low flux or enabling video-rate imaging at higher flux. With this single-frame acquisition technique, we are able to reconstruct transmission images of an object in the infrared beam with a signal-to-noise ratio of $1.78\,\pm\,0.06$ at 10 frames per second, and record a dynamic scene in the infrared beam at 33 frames per second.</description>

Abstract: We consider $d$-dimensional quantum systems which for positive times evolve with a time-independent Hamiltonian in a nonequilibrium state that we keep generic in order to account for arbitrary evolution at negative times. We show how the one-point functions of local operators depend on the coefficients of the expansion of the nonequilibrium state on the basis of energy eigenstates. We express in this way the asymptotic offset and show under which conditions oscillations around this value stay undamped at large times. We also show how, in the case of small quenches, the structure of the general results simplifies and reproduces that known perturbatively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the electronic correlation contribution to the time delay in the photo-ionization of the excited ortho- and para-Helium states. A simple estimation, based on the ionization probability amplitudes, shows that the different form of anti-symmetrising both states can in principle lead to very different values of the correlation time delay. This result illuminates the interplay between electronic correlations and symmetrisation effects in the attosecond regime, a relation that has been studied in other contexts. Moreover, it suggests the potential of excited states to explore the role of exchange effects in that realm.</description>

      <title>New opportunities in condensed matter physics for nanoscale quantum sensors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nitrogen vacancy (NV) centre quantum sensors provide unique opportunities in studying condensed matter systems: they are quantitative, noninvasive, physically robust, offer nanoscale resolution, and may be used across a wide range of temperatures. These properties have been exploited in recent years to obtain nanoscale resolution measurements of static magnetic fields arising from spin order and current flow in condensed matter systems. Compared with other nanoscale magnetic-field sensors, NV centres have the unique advantage that they can probe quantities that go beyond average magnetic fields. Leveraging techniques from magnetic resonance, NV centres can perform high precision noise sensing, and have given access to diverse systems, such as fluctuating electrical currents in simple metals and graphene, as well as magnetic dynamics in yttrium iron garnet. In this review we summarise unique opportunities in condensed matter sensing by focusing on the connections between specific NV measurements and previously established physical characteristics that are more readily understood in the condensed matter community, such as correlation functions and order parameters that are inaccessible by other techniques, and we describe the technical frontier enabled by NV centre sensing.</description>

Abstract: Elementary cellular automata (ECA) present iconic examples of complex systems. Though described only by one-dimensional strings of binary cells evolving according to nearest-neighbour update rules, certain ECA rules manifest complex dynamics capable of universal computation. Yet, the classification of precisely which rules exhibit complex behaviour remains a significant challenge. Here we approach this question using tools from quantum stochastic modelling, where quantum statistical memory -- the memory required to model a stochastic process using a class of quantum machines -- can be used to quantify the structure of a stochastic process. By viewing ECA rules as transformations of stochastic patterns, we ask: Does an ECA generate structure as quantified by the quantum statistical memory, and if so, how quickly? We illustrate how the growth of this measure over time correctly distinguishes simple ECA from complex counterparts. Moreover, it provides a more refined means for quantitatively identifying complex ECAs -- providing a spectrum on which we can rank the complexity of ECA by the rate in which they generate structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.09371v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological data analysis (TDA) is a powerful technique for extracting complex and valuable shape-related summaries of high-dimensional data. However, the computational demands of classical algorithms for computing TDA are exorbitant, and quickly become impractical for high-order characteristics. Quantum computers offer the potential of achieving significant speedup for certain computational problems. Indeed, TDA has been purported to be one such problem, yet, quantum computing algorithms proposed for the problem, such as the original Quantum TDA (QTDA) formulation by Lloyd, Garnerone and Zanardi, require fault-tolerance qualifications that are currently unavailable. In this study, we present NISQ-TDA, a fully implemented end-to-end quantum machine learning algorithm needing only a short circuit-depth, that is applicable to high-dimensional classical data, and with provable asymptotic speedup for certain classes of problems. The algorithm neither suffers from the data-loading problem nor does it need to store the input data on the quantum computer explicitly. The algorithm was successfully executed on quantum computing devices, as well as on noisy quantum simulators, applied to small datasets. Preliminary empirical results suggest that the algorithm is robust to noise.</description>

Abstract: Quantum Annealing has proven to be a powerful tool to tackle several optimization problems. However, its performance is severely impacted by the limited connectivity of the underlying quantum hardware, compromising the quantum speedup. In this work, we present a novel approach to address these issues, by describing a method to implement non-local couplings throught the lens of Local Operations and Classical Communcations (LOCC). Non-local couplings are very versatile, harnessing the configurability of distributed quantum networks, which in turn lead to great enhancement of the physical connectivity of the underlying hardware. Furthermore, the realization of non-local couplings between distinct quantum annealing processors activates the scalability potential of distributed systems, i.e. allowing for a distributed quantum annealing system. Finally, in a more distant vision, we also show that secure multi-party quantum annealing algorithms are possible, allowing for cooperation of distrusting parties through optimization with quantum annealing and a particular type of non-local couplings.</description>

Abstract: Allowing the generation of effective interactions between distant quantum emitters (QEs) via flying photons, quantum interconnect (QI) is essentially a light-matter interface and acts as a building block in quantum technologies. A surface plasmon polariton (SPP) supported by a metallic waveguide provides an ideal interface to explore strong light-matter couplings and to realize QI. However, the loss of SPP in metal makes the mediated entanglement of the QEs damp with the increase of the distance and time, which hinders its applications. We propose a scheme of non-Markovian QI formed by the SPP of a metallic nanowire. A mechanism to make the generated entanglement of the QEs persistent is discovered. We find that, as long as bound states are formed in the energy spectrum of total QE-SPP system, the damping of the SPP-mediated entanglement is overcome even in the presence of the metal absorption to the SPP. Our finding enriches our understanding of light-matter couplings in absorptive medium and paves the way for using the SPP in designing QI.</description>

      <title>Demonstrating a long-coherence dual-rail erasure qubit using tunable transmons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.08737v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum error correction with erasure qubits promises significant advantages over standard error correction due to favorable thresholds for erasure errors. To realize this advantage in practice requires a qubit for which nearly all errors are such erasure errors, and the ability to check for erasure errors without dephasing the qubit. We demonstrate that a "dual-rail qubit" consisting of a pair of resonantly coupled transmons can form a highly coherent erasure qubit, where transmon $T_1$ errors are converted into erasure errors and residual dephasing is strongly suppressed, leading to millisecond-scale coherence within the qubit subspace. We show that single-qubit gates are limited primarily by erasure errors, with erasure probability $p_\text{erasure} = 2.19(2)\times 10^{-3}$ per gate while the residual errors are $\sim 40$ times lower. We further demonstrate mid-circuit detection of erasure errors while introducing $&lt; 0.1\%$ dephasing error per check. Finally, we show that the suppression of transmon noise allows this dual-rail qubit to preserve high coherence over a broad tunable operating range, offering an improved capacity to avoid frequency collisions. This work establishes transmon-based dual-rail qubits as an attractive building block for hardware-efficient quantum error correction.</description>

      <title>Super narrow peaks in excitation spectrum of alkali spin polarization: non-adiabatic case of spin dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.12647v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically describe the phenomenon of non-adiabatic spin dynamics, which occurs in a gas cell filled by alkali vapor in presence of a strong alternating magnetic field and pump light. Steep increase of the spin polarization occurs if frequency of the magnetic field is equal to the certain value. Although, the observable effect relies on the periodic field that consists of two perpendicular components defined by harmonics with the same amplitudes and different frequencies. Considered spin effect cannot be explained by a resonance, because the own Larmor frequency of spin precession is absent without a constant component of magnetic field. Moreover, there are some clearly visible peaks in the excitation spectrum of spin polarization, and they are super narrow in comparison to relaxation rate. Detailed analysis according to proposed quantum model results in the reasoning of the effect via qualitative properties of non-adiabatic dynamics of atomic spin.</description>

Abstract: Quantum communication offers unique features that have no classical analog, in particular, it enables provably secure quantum key distribution (QKD). Despite the benefits of quantum communication are well understood within the scientific community, the practical implementations sometimes meet with scepticism or even resistance. In a recent publication [1], NSA claims that QKD is inferior to "quantum-resistant" cryptography and does not recommend it for use. Here we show that such a sceptical approach to evaluation of quantum security is not well justified. We hope that our arguments will be helpful to clarify the issue.</description>

Abstract: Simulating the dynamics of large quantum systems is a formidable yet vital pursuit for obtaining a deeper understanding of quantum mechanical phenomena. While quantum computers hold great promise for speeding up such simulations, their practical application remains hindered by limited scale and pervasive noise. In this work, we propose an approach that addresses these challenges by employing circuit knitting to partition a large quantum system into smaller subsystems that can each be simulated on a separate device. The evolution of the system is governed by the projected variational quantum dynamics (PVQD) algorithm, supplemented with constraints on the parameters of the variational quantum circuit, ensuring that the sampling overhead imposed by the circuit knitting scheme remains controllable. We test our method on quantum spin systems with multiple weakly entangled blocks each consisting of strongly correlated spins, where we are able to accurately simulate the dynamics while keeping the sampling overhead manageable. Further, we show that the same method can be used to reduce the circuit depth by cutting long-ranged gates.</description>

      <title>Wavelet-based Ramsey magnetometry enhancement of a single NV center in diamond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.18959v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond constitute a solid-state nanosensing paradigm. Specifically for high-precision magnetometry, the so-called Ramsey interferometry is the prevalent choice where the sensing signal is extracted from time-resolved spin-state-dependent photoluminescence (PL) data. Its sensitivity is ultimately limited by the photon shot noise, which cannot be sufficiently removed by averaging or frequency filtering. Here, we propose Ramsey DC magnetometry of a single NV center enhanced by a wavelet-denoising scheme specifically tailored to suppress photon shot noise. It simply operates as a classical post-processing applied on a collected PL time series. Our implementation is based on a method that we named template margin thresholding which enables not only frequency but also time-dependent denoising. We computationally benchmark its DC magnetic field sensing signal-to-noise-ratio improvement over the raw PL data around an order of magnitude.</description>

Abstract: The quantum stabilizer formalism was originally introduced to describe quantum error correction codes more conveniently and now are also playing an important role in many other fields, e.g., quantum computing and quantum foundation. In this dissertation, we first introduce relevant background and necessary basic knowledge, then introduce the definition of quantum stabilizer and its application in quantum system evolution and measurement. Finally, we try to extend the quantum stabilizer formalism to qubit-qutrit and qubit-ququart systems which not defined before, and further define quantum stabilizers of arbitrary composite systems.</description>

Abstract: We theoretically investigate prospects for the creation of nonclassical spin states in trapped ion arrays by coupling to a squeezed state of the collective motion of the ions. The correlations of the generated spin states can be tailored for quantum-enhanced sensing of global or differential rotations of sub-ensembles of the spins by working with specific vibrational modes of the ion array. We propose a pair of protocols to utilize the generated states and determine the impact of finite size effects, inhomogeneous couplings between the spin and motional degrees of freedom and technical noise. Our work suggests new opportunities for the preparation of many-body states with tailored correlations for quantum-enhanced metrology in spin-boson systems.</description>

Abstract: In the quest for fault-tolerant quantum computation using superconducting processors, accurate performance assessment and continuous design optimization stands at the forefront. To facilitate both meticulous simulation and streamlined design optimization, we introduce a multi-level simulation framework that spans both Hamiltonian and quantum error correction levels, and is equipped with the capability to compute gradients efficiently. This toolset aids in design optimization, tailored to specific objectives like quantum memory performance. Within our framework, we investigate the often-neglected spatially correlated unitary errors, highlighting their significant impact on logical error rates. We exemplify our approach through the multi-path coupling scheme of fluxonium qubits.</description>

      <title>Does provable absence of barren plateaus imply classical simulability? Or, why we need to rethink variational quantum computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09121v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A large amount of effort has recently been put into understanding the barren plateau phenomenon. In this perspective article, we face the increasingly loud elephant in the room and ask a question that has been hinted at by many but not explicitly addressed: Can the structure that allows one to avoid barren plateaus also be leveraged to efficiently simulate the loss classically? We present strong evidence that commonly used models with provable absence of barren plateaus are also classically simulable, provided that one can collect some classical data from quantum devices during an initial data acquisition phase. This follows from the observation that barren plateaus result from a curse of dimensionality, and that current approaches for solving them end up encoding the problem into some small, classically simulable, subspaces. Thus, while stressing quantum computers can be essential for collecting data, our analysis sheds serious doubt on the non-classicality of the information processing capabilities of parametrized quantum circuits for barren plateau-free landscapes. We end by discussing caveats in our arguments, the role of smart initializations and the possibility of provably superpolynomial, or simply practical, advantages from running parametrized quantum circuits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09872v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum-enhanced auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo (QC-AFQMC) uses output from a quantum computer to increase the accuracy of its classical counterpart. The algorithm requires the estimation of overlaps between walker states and a trial wavefunction prepared on the quantum computer. We study the applicability of this algorithm in terms of the number of measurements required from the quantum computer and the classical costs of post-processing those measurements. We compare the classical post-processing costs of state-of-the-art measurement schemes using classical shadows to determine the overlaps and argue that the overall post-processing cost stemming from overlap estimations scales like $\mathcal{O}(N^9)$ per walker throughout the algorithm. With further numerical simulations, we compare the variance behavior of the classical shadows when randomizing over different ensembles, e.g., Cliffords and (particle-number restricted) matchgates beyond their respective bounds, and uncover the existence of covariances between overlap estimations of the AFQMC walkers at different imaginary time steps. Moreover, we include analyses of how the error in the overlap estimation propagates into the AFQMC energy and discuss its scaling when increasing the system size.</description>

Abstract: The problem of optimally measuring an analytic function of unknown local parameters each linearly coupled to a qubit sensor is well understood, with applications ranging from field interpolation to noise characterization. Here, we resolve a number of open questions that arise when extending this framework to Mach-Zehnder interferometers and quadrature displacement sensing. In particular, we derive lower bounds on the achievable mean square error in estimating a linear function of either local phase shifts or quadrature displacements. In the case of local phase shifts, these results prove, and somewhat generalize, a conjecture by Proctor et al. [arXiv:1702.04271 (2017)]. For quadrature displacements, we extend proofs of lower bounds to the case of arbitrary linear functions. We provide optimal protocols achieving these bounds up to small (multiplicative) constants and describe an algebraic approach to deriving new optimal protocols, possibly subject to additional constraints. Using this approach, we prove necessary conditions for the amount of entanglement needed for any optimal protocol for both local phase and displacement sensing.</description>

Abstract: Models based on vision transformer architectures are considered state-of-the-art when it comes to image classification tasks. However, they require extensive computational resources both for training and deployment. The problem is exacerbated as the amount and complexity of the data increases. Quantum-based vision transformer models could potentially alleviate this issue by reducing the training and operating time while maintaining the same predictive power. Although current quantum computers are not yet able to perform high-dimensional tasks yet, they do offer one of the most efficient solutions for the future. In this work, we construct several variations of a quantum hybrid vision transformer for a classification problem in high energy physics (distinguishing photons and electrons in the electromagnetic calorimeter). We test them against classical vision transformer architectures. Our findings indicate that the hybrid models can achieve comparable performance to their classical analogues with a similar number of parameters.</description>

Abstract: The intricate interplay between unitary evolution and projective measurements could induce entanglement phase transitions in the nonequilibrium dynamics of quantum many-particle systems. In this work, we uncover loss-induced entanglement transitions in non-Hermitian topological superconductors. In prototypical Kitaev chains with local particle losses and varying hopping and pairing ranges, the bipartite entanglement entropy of steady states is found to scale logarithmically versus the system size in topologically nontrivial phases and become independent of the system size in the trivial phase. Notably, the scaling coefficients of log-law entangled phases are distinguishable when the underlying system resides in different topological phases. Log-law to log-law and log-law to area-law entanglement phase transitions are further identified when the system switches between different topological phases and goes from a topologically nontrivial to a trivial phase, respectively. These findings not only establish the relationships among spectral, topological and entanglement properties in a class of non-Hermitian topological superconductors, but also provide an efficient means to dynamically reveal their distinctive topological features.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12807v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss a general formalism to optimize quasi-adiabatic state-transfer protocols, where high fidelity is achieved by maintaining the system in a dark subspace protected from the dominant dissipative channels. We cast the residual fidelity loss, induced by a combination of dissipation and non-adiabatic transitions, in the form of a classical action where the time-dependent control parameters act as coordinates. This allows us to apply the least action principle, yielding the fidelity upper-bound and the corresponding optimal transfer time. As an application, we analyze a system of two qubits subject to weak relaxation and dephasing, interacting through a strongly dissipative quantum bus. In this case, our formalism, we obtain a full characterization of the optimal state-transfer fidelity.</description>

Abstract: Noise is both ubiquitous and generally deleterious in settings where precision is required. This is especially true in the quantum technology sector where system utility typically decays rapidly under its influence. Understanding the noise in quantum devices is thus a prerequisite for efficient strategies to mitigate or even eliminate its harmful effects. However, this requires resources that are often prohibitive, such that the typically-used noise models rely on simplifications that sometimes depart from experimental reality. Here we derive a compact microscopic error model for single-qubit gates that only requires a single experimental input -the noise power spectral density. Our model goes beyond standard depolarizing or Pauli-twirled noise models, explicitly including non-Clifford and non-Markovian contributions to the dynamical error map. We gauge our predictions for experimentally relevant metrics against established characterization techniques run on a trapped-ion quantum computer. In particular, we find that experimental estimates of average gate errors measured through randomized benchmarking and reconstructed via quantum process tomography are tightly lower-bounded by our analytical estimates, while the depolarizing model overestimates the gate error. Our noise modeling including non-Markovian contributions can be readily applied to established frameworks such as dynamical decoupling and dynamically-corrected gates, or to provide more realistic thresholds for quantum error correction.</description>

      <title>Estimating the electrical energy cost of performing arbitrary state preparation using qubits and qudits in integrated photonic circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16603v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When using single photons and photonic integrated circuits (PICs) for quantum information processing, quantum states can be encoded using either qubits or qudits. Qudits are more efficient in terms of requiring less photons (in principle, only one) to encode the state, while qubits are more efficient in terms of the number of waveguides used to reach the same dimension $d$, as qudits need $d$ waveguides in comparison to the $2\log_2d$ waveguides used by qubits. For dimensions large enough for useful tasks, this would indicate that qubits are clearly the best option, as other resources scale at least polynomially with the number of waveguides in the PIC. The comparison, however, is not so direct. We consider the task of quantum state preparation, which is relevant for variational quantum algorithms, for instance. For n qubits, this task requires the circuit to have a number of Controlled-NOT (CNOT) gates that is exponential in n. Since both implementations suffer from an exponential resource cost, a more detailed evaluation is required. We compare the qubit and qudit approaches in terms of the amount of electrical energy that must be spent, on average, to program a photonic circuit to perform quantum state preparation. We find that if a PIC with a fully reconfigurable array of interferometers is to be used, using qubits requires more energy than using qudits. We show, however, that a circuit with dedicated CNOT blocks has a much smaller energy consumption, remaining viable even at large qubit numbers, where more important bottlenecks come into play, such as the probabilistic nature of the CNOT gates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00291v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bosonic quantum systems offer the hardware-efficient construction of error detection/error correction codes by using the infinitely large Hilbert space. However, due to the encoding, arbitrary gate rotations usually require magic state teleportation or complicated optimized pulse sequences involving an ancilla qubit. Here, we propose a simple and hardware-efficient bosonic 02 error detection code that allows for the implementation of arbitrary X and Z rotations and a controlled phase gate by using a Kerr nonlinear resonator. Our code can detect a single photon loss, and we observe significant error suppression by simulating the frequently used hardware-efficient ansatz quantum circuit in near-term quantum computing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02749v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum theory is in principle compatible with processes that violate causal inequalities, an analogue of Bell inequalities that constrain the correlations observed by a set of parties operating in a definite causal order. Since the introduction of causal inequalities, determining their maximum quantum violation, analogue to Tsirelson's bound for Bell inequalities, has remained an open problem. Here we provide a general method for bounding the violation of arbitrary causal inequalities, establishing limits on the correlations achievable by arbitrary local experiments and by arbitrary quantum processes with indefinite causal order. We prove that the maximum violation is generally smaller than the algebraic maximum, and determine Tsirelson-like bounds for a class of causal inequalities including some of the most paradigmatic examples. Surprisingly, we find that the algebraic maximum of arbitrary causal inequalities can be achieved by a new type of processes that allow for information to flow in an indefinite temporal direction within the parties' laboratories.</description>

      <title>A multiplexed control architecture for superconducting qubits with row-column addressing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03717v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In state-of-the-art superconducting quantum processors, each qubit is controlled by at least one control line that delivers control pulses generated at room temperature to qubits operating at millikelvin temperatures. While this strategy has been successfully applied to control hundreds of qubits, it is unlikely to be scalable to control thousands of qubits, let alone millions or even billions of qubits needed in fault-tolerance quantum computing. The primary obstacle lies in the wiring challenge, wherein the number of accommodated control lines is limited by factors, such as the cooling power, physical space of the cryogenic system, the control footprint area at the qubit chip level, and so on. Here, we introduce a multiplexed control architecture for superconducting qubits with two types of shared control lines, row and column lines, providing an efficient approach for parallel controlling $N$ qubits with $O(\sqrt{N})$ control lines. With the combination of the two-type shared lines, unique pairs of control pulses are delivered to qubits at each row-column intersection, enabling parallel qubit addressing. Of particular concern here is that, unlike traditional gate schemes, both single- and two-qubit gates are implemented with pairs of control pulses. Considering the inherent parallelism and the control limitations, the integration of the architecture into quantum computing systems should be tailored as much as possible to the specific properties of the quantum circuits to be executed. As such, the architecture could be scalable for executing structured quantum circuits, such as quantum error correction circuits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05449v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The complete reducibility property for bipartite states reduced the separability problem to a proper subset of positive under partial transpose states and was used to prove several theorems inside and outside entanglement theory. So far only three types of bipartite states were proved to possess this property. In this work, we provide some procedures to create states with this property, we call these states by the name of completely reducible states. The convex combination of such states is the first procedure, showing that the set of completely reducible states is a convex cone. We also provide a complete description of the extreme rays of this set. Then we show that powers, roots and partial traces of completely reducible states result in states of the same type. Finally, we consider a shuffle of states that preserves this property. This shuffle allows us to construct states with the complete reducibility property avoiding the only three conditions known to date that imply this property.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09033v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This note shows that adaptive strategies do not offer additional advantages for learning and testing Pauli channels with entangled input. First, the tight query complexity of learning Pauli channels with entangled input is established for the general norm $l_p$. In particular, the complexities for the $l_{1}$, $l_2$ and $l_\infty$ norms are improved or matched compared to previous results using entanglement in the literature. We also settle the query complexity to test if Pauli channels are white noise sources across $l_p$. Additionally, we demonstrate that the query complexity of estimating the noise level of a Pauli channel, characterized by the entropy of its error distribution and the count of non-zero probabilities, is $\Theta(4^n/n)$. Further, $\Theta(4^n/n)$ queries are sufficient to estimate the diamond norm between two Pauli channels.</description>

      <title>Cutting a Wire with Non-Maximally Entangled States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09690v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Distributed quantum computing supports combining the computational power of multiple quantum devices to overcome the limitations of individual devices. Circuit cutting techniques enable the distribution of quantum computations via classical communication. These techniques involve partitioning a quantum circuit into smaller subcircuits, each containing fewer qubits. The original circuit's outcome can be replicated by executing these subcircuits on separate devices and combining their results. However, the number of circuit executions required to achieve a fixed result accuracy with circuit cutting grows exponentially with the number of cuts, posing significant costs. In contrast, quantum teleportation allows the distribution of quantum computations without an exponential increase in circuit executions. Nevertheless, each teleportation requires a pre-shared pair of maximally entangled qubits for transmitting a quantum state, and non-maximally entangled qubits cannot be used for this purpose. Addressing this, our work explores utilizing non-maximally entangled qubit pairs in wire cutting, a specific form of circuit cutting, to mitigate the associated costs. The cost of this cutting procedure reduces with the increasing degree of entanglement in the pre-shared qubit pairs. We derive the optimal sampling overhead in this context and present a wire cutting technique employing pure non-maximally entangled states that achieves this optimal sampling overhead. Hence, this offers a continuum between existing wire cutting and quantum teleportation.</description>

      <title>Kinetic inductance traveling wave amplifier designs for practical microwave readout applications</title>

Abstract: A Kinetic Inductance Traveling Wave amplifier (KIT) utilizes the nonlinear kinetic inductance of superconducting films, particularly Niobium Titanium Nitride (NbTiN), for parametric amplification. These amplifiers achieve remarkable performance in terms of gain, bandwidth, compression power, and frequently approach the quantum limit for noise. However, most KIT demonstrations have been isolated from practical device readout systems. Using a KIT as the first amplifier in the readout chain of an unoptimized microwave SQUID multiplexer coupled to a transition-edge sensor microcalorimeter we see an initial improvement in the flux noise. One challenge in KIT integration is the considerable microwave pump power required to drive the non-linearity. To address this, we have initiated efforts to reduce the pump power by using thinner NbTiN films and an inverted microstrip transmission line design. In this article, we present the new transmission line design, fabrication procedure, and initial device characterization -- including gain and added noise. These devices exhibit over 10 dB of gain with a 3 dB bandwidth of approximately 5.5-7.25 GHz, a maximum practical gain of 12 dB and typical gain ripple under 4 dB peak-to-peak. We observe an appreciable impedance mismatch in the NbTiN transmission line, which is likely the source of the majority of the gain ripple. Finally we perform an initial noise characterization and demonstrate system-added noise of three quanta or less over nearly the entire 3 dB bandwidth.</description>

      <title>Average circuit eigenvalue sampling on NISQ devices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12857v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Average circuit eigenvalue sampling (ACES) was introduced by Flammia in arXiv:2108.05803 as a protocol to characterize the Pauli error channels of individual gates across the device simultaneously. The original paper posed using ACES to characterize near-term devices as an open problem. This work advances in this direction by presenting a full implementation of ACES for real devices and deploying it to Superstaq arXiv:2309.05157, along with a device-tailored resource estimation obtained through simulations and experiments. Our simulations show that ACES is able to estimate one- and two-qubit non-uniform Pauli error channels to an average eigenvalue absolute error of under $0.003$ and total variation distance of under 0.001 between simulated and reconstructed probability distributions over Pauli errors with $10^5$ shots per circuit using 5 circuits of depth 14. The question of estimating general error channels through twirling techniques in real devices remains open, as it is dependent on a device's native gates, but simulations with the Clifford set show results in agreement with reported hardware data. Experimental results on IBM's Algiers and Osaka devices are presented, where we characterize their error channels as Pauli channels without twirling.</description>

      <title>Introducing Quantum Entanglement to First-Year Students: Resolving the Trilemma</title>

      <description>arXiv:2106.12043v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While quantum mechanics (QM) is covered at length in introductory physics textbooks, the concept of quantum entanglement is typically not covered at all, despite its importance in the rapidly growing area of quantum information science and its extensive experimental confirmation. Thus, physics educators are left to their own devices as to how to introduce this important concept. Regardless of how a physics educator chooses to introduce quantum entanglement, they face a trilemma involving its mysterious Bell-inequality-violating correlations. They can compromise on the the completeness of their introduction and simply choose not to share that fact, totally ignoring the 2022 Nobel Prize in Physics. They can frustrate their more curious students by introducing the mystery and simply telling them that the QM formalism with its associated (equally mysterious) conservation law maps beautifully to the experiments, so there is nothing else that needs to be said. Or, they can compromise the rigor of their presentation and attempt to resolve the mystery by venturing into the metaphysical quagmire of competing QM interpretations. Herein, we resolve this trilemma in precisely the same way that Einstein resolved the mysteries of time dilation and length contraction that existed in the late nineteenth century. That is, we resort to "principle" explanation based on the mathematical consequences of "empirically discovered" facts. Indeed, our principle account of quantum entanglement is even based on the same principle Einstein used, i.e., the relativity principle or "no preferred reference frame." Thus, this principle resolution of the trilemma is as complete, satisfying, analytically rigorous, and accessible as the standard introduction of special relativity for first-year physics students.</description>

      <title>Using machine learning to find exact analytic solutions to analytically posed physics problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.02528v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the use of machine learning for solving analytic problems in theoretical physics. In particular, symbolic regression (SR) is making rapid progress in recent years as a tool to fit data using functions whose overall form is not known in advance. Assuming that we have a mathematical problem that is posed analytically, e.g.~through equations, but allows easy numerical evaluation of the solution for any given set of input variable values, one can generate data numerically and then use SR to identify the closed-form function that describes the data, assuming that such a function exists. In addition to providing a concise way to represent the solution of the problem, such an obtained function can play a key role in providing insight and allow us to find an intuitive explanation for the studied phenomenon. We use a state-of-the-art SR package to demonstrate how an exact solution can be found and make an attempt at solving an unsolved physics problem. We use the Landau-Zener problem and a few of its generalizations as examples to motivate our approach and illustrate how the calculations become increasingly complicated with increasing problem difficulty. Our results highlight the capabilities and limitations of the presently available SR packages, and they point to possible modifications of these packages to make them better suited for the purpose of finding exact solutions as opposed to good approximations. Our results also demonstrate the potential for machine learning to tackle analytically posed problems in theoretical physics.</description>

Abstract: We study the temporal evolution of quantum mechanical fermionic particles exhibiting one bound state within a one-dimensional attractive square-well potential in a heat bath of bosonic particles. For this open quantum system we formulate the non-equilibrium Kadanoff-Baym equations for the system particles by taking the interactions to be elastic 2-2 scatterings with the heat-bath particles. The corresponding spatially imhomogeneous integro-differential equations for the one-particle Greens's function are solved numerically. We demonstrate how the system particles equilibrate and thermalize with the heat bath and how the off-diagonal elements of the density matrix, expressed in the one-particle energy eigenbasis, decohere, so that only the diagonal entries, i.e. the occupation numbers, survive. In addition, the time evolution of the (retarded) Green's function also determines the spectral properties of the various one-particle quantum states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.04556v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the effects of driving a cavity at a large photon number in a circuit-QED experiment where the ``matter-like'' part corresponds to an unique Andreev level in a superconducting weak link. The three many-body states of the weak link, corresponding to the occupation of the Andreev level by 0, 1 or 2 quasiparticles, lead to different cavity frequency shifts. We show how the non-linearity inherited by the cavity from its coupling to the weak link affects the state discrimination and the photon number calibration. Both effects require treating the evolution of the driven system beyond the dispersive limit. In addition, we observe how transition rates between the circuit states (quantum and parity jumps) are affected by the microwave power, and compare the measurements with a theory accounting for the ``dressing'' of the Andreev states by the cavity.</description>

Abstract: A chiral coordinate Bethe ansatz method is developed to study the periodic XYZ chain. We construct a set of chiral vectors with fixed number of kinks. All vectors are factorized and have simple structures. Under roots of unity conditions, the Hilbert space has an invariant subspace and our vectors form a basis of this subspace. We propose a Bethe ansatz solely based on the action of the Hamiltonian on the chiral vectors, avoiding the use of transfer matrix techniques. This allows to parameterize the expansion coefficients and derive the homogeneous Bethe ansatz equations whose solutions give the exact energies and eigenstates. Our analytic results agree with earlier approaches, notably by Baxter, and are supported by numerical calculations.</description>

Abstract: Modeling the underlying pairing mechanism of charge carriers in strongly correlated electrons, starting from a microscopic theory, is among the central challenges of condensed-matter physics. Hereby, the key task is to understand what causes the appearance of superconductivity at comparatively high temperatures upon hole doping an antiferromagnetic (AFM) Mott insulator. Recently, it has been proposed that at strong coupling and low doping, the fundamental one- and two-hole meson-type constituents -- magnetic polarons and bipolaronic pairs -- likely realize an emergent Feshbach resonance producing near-resonant $d_{x^2-y^2}$ interactions between charge carriers. Here, we provide detailed calculations of the proposed scenario by describing the open and closed meson scattering channels in the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model using a truncated basis method. After integrating out the closed channel constituted by bipolaronic pairs, we find $d_{x^2-y^2}$ attractive interactions between open channel magnetic polarons. The closed form of the derived interactions allows us analyze the resonant pairing interactions and we find enhanced (suppressed) attraction for hole (electron) doping in our model. The formalism we introduce provides a framework to analyze the implications of a possible Feshbach scenario, e.g. in the context of BEC-BCS crossover, and establishes a foundation to test quantitative aspects of the proposed Feshbach pairing mechanisms in doped antiferromagnets.</description>

      <title>Cryptographic Censorship</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03425v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate and take two large strides towards proving a quantum version of the weak cosmic censorship conjecture. We first prove "Cryptographic Censorship": a theorem showing that when the time evolution operator of a holographic CFT is approximately pseudorandom (or Haar random) on some code subspace, then there must be an event horizon in the corresponding bulk dual. This result provides a general condition that guarantees (in finite time) event horizon formation, with minimal assumptions about the global spacetime structure. Our theorem relies on an extension of a recent quantum learning no-go theorem and is proved using new techniques of pseudorandom measure concentration. To apply this result to cosmic censorship, we separate singularities into classical, semi-Planckian, and Planckian types. We illustrate that classical and semi-Planckian singularities are compatible with approximately pseudorandom CFT time evolution; thus, if such singularities are indeed approximately pseudorandom, by Cryptographic Censorship, they cannot exist in the absence of event horizons. This result provides a sufficient condition guaranteeing that seminal holographic results on quantum chaos and thermalization, whose general applicability relies on typicality of horizons, will not be invalidated by the formation of naked singularities in AdS/CFT.</description>

      <title>Tailoring Polarization in WSe$_2$ Quantum Emitters through Deterministic Strain Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11075v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum emitters in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have recently emerged as a promising platform for generating single photons for optical quantum information processing. In this work, we present an approach for deterministically controlling the polarization of fabricated quantum emitters in a tungsten diselenide (WSe$_2$) monolayer. We employ novel nanopillar geometries with long and sharp tips to induce a controlled directional strain in the monolayer, and we report on fabricated WSe$_2$ emitters producing single photons with a high degree of polarization $(99\pm 4 \%)$ and high purity ($g^{(2)}(0) = 0.030 \pm 0.025$). Our work paves the way for the deterministic integration of TMD-based quantum emitters for future photonic quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Quantum nonlinear optics on the edge of small lattice fractional quantum Hall fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10598v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the quantum dynamics of the edge modes of lattice fractional quantum Hall liquids in response to time-dependent external potentials. We show that the nonlinear chiral Luttinger liquid theory provides a quantitatively accurate description even for the small lattice geometries away from the continuum limit that are available in state-of-the-art experiments. Experimentally accessible signatures of the quantized value of the bulk transverse Hall conductivity are identified both in the linear and the non-linear response to an external excitation. The strong nonlinearity induced by the open boundaries is responsible for sizable quantum blockade effects, leading to the generation of nonclassical states of the edge modes.</description>
