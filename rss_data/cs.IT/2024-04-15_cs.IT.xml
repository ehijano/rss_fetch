      <title>Capacity Maximization for RIS-assisted Multi-user MISO Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a multi-user multiple input single output (MU-MISO) system assisted by a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS). For such a system, we aim to optimally select the RIS phase shifts and precoding vectors for maximizing the effective rank of the weighted channel covariance matrix which in turn improves the channel capacity. For a low-complex transmitter design, we employ maximum ratio transmission (MRT) and minimum-mean square error (MMSE) precoding schemes along with water-filling algorithm-based power allocation. Further, we show that MRT and MMSE exhibit equivalent performance and become optimal when the channel effective rank is maximized by optimally configuring the RIS consisting of a large number of elements.</description>

      <title>Towards Efficient Device Identification in Massive Random Access: A Multi-stage Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient and low-latency wireless connectivity between the base station (BS) and a sparse set of sporadically active devices from a massive number of devices is crucial for random access in emerging massive machine-type communications (mMTC). This paper addresses the challenge of identifying active devices while meeting stringent access delay and reliability constraints in mMTC environments. A novel multi-stage active device identification framework is proposed where we aim to refine a partial estimate of the active device set using feedback and hypothesis testing across multiple stages eventually leading to an exact recovery of active devices after the final stage of processing. In our proposed approach, active devices independently transmit binary preambles during each stage, leveraging feedback signals from the BS, whereas the BS employs a non-coherent binary energy detection. The minimum user identification cost associated with our multi-stage non-coherent active device identification framework with feedback, in terms of the required number of channel-uses, is quantified using information-theoretic techniques in the asymptotic regime of total number of devices $\ell$ when the number of active devices $k$ scales as $k = {\Theta}(1)$. Practical implementations of our multi-stage active device identification schemes, leveraging Belief Propagation (BP) techniques, are also presented and evaluated. Simulation results show that our multi-stage BP strategies exhibit superior performance over single-stage strategies, even when considering overhead costs associated with feedback and hypothesis testing.</description>

      <title>Blind Interference Alignment for MapReduce: Exploiting Side-information with Reconfigurable Antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to explore how blind interference alignment (BIA) schemes may take advantage of side-information in computation tasks, we study the degrees of freedom (DoF) of a $K$ user wireless network setting that arises in full-duplex wireless MapReduce applications. In this setting the receivers are assumed to have reconfigurable antennas and channel knowledge, while the transmitters have neither, i.e., the transmitters lack channel knowledge and are only equipped with conventional antennas. The central ingredient of the problem formulation is the message structure arising out of MapReduce, whereby each transmitter has a subset of messages that need to be delivered to various receivers, and each receiver has a subset of messages available to it in advance as side-information. The challenge resides in both achievability and converse arguments. Unlike conventional BIA where alignments occur only within the symbols of the same message (intra-message) the new achievable scheme also requires inter-message alignments, as well as an outer MDS (maximum distance separable) code structure. The scheme emerges from two essential ideas: 1) understanding the DoF of a $K$ user vector broadcast channel with groupcast messages, and 2) a mapping of messages from the broadcast setting to the MapReduce setting that makes use of inter-message alignment. On the converse side, whereas prior BIA converse bounds relied only on a compound channel argument, in the new setting our converse bounds also require a statistical equivalence assumption.</description>

      <title>Private Multiple Linear Computation: A Flexible Communication-Computation Tradeoff</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of private multiple linear computation (PMLC) over a replicated storage system with colluding and unresponsive constraints. In this scenario, the user wishes to privately compute $P$ linear combinations of $M$ files from a set of $N$ replicated servers without revealing any information about the coefficients of these linear combinations to any $T$ colluding servers, in the presence of $S$ unresponsive servers that do not provide any information in response to user queries. Our focus is on more general performance metrics where the communication and computational overheads incurred by the user are not neglected. Additionally, the communication and computational overheads for servers are also taken into consideration. Unlike most previous literature that primarily focused on download cost from servers as a performance metric, we propose a novel PMLC scheme to establish a flexible tradeoff between communication costs and computational complexities.</description>

      <title>Unsourced Random Access in MIMO Quasi-Static Rayleigh Fading Channels with Finite Blocklength</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the fundamental limits of unsourced random access (URA) with a random and unknown number ${\rm{K}}_a$ of active users in MIMO quasi-static Rayleigh fading channels. First, we derive an upper bound on the probability of incorrectly estimating the number of active users. We prove that it exponentially decays with the number of receive antennas and eventually vanishes, whereas reaches a plateau as the power and blocklength increase. Then, we derive non-asymptotic achievability and converse bounds on the minimum energy-per-bit required by each active user to reliably transmit $J$ bits with blocklength $n$. Numerical results verify the tightness of our bounds, suggesting that they provide benchmarks to evaluate existing schemes. The extra required energy-per-bit due to the uncertainty of the number of active users decreases as $\mathbb{E}[{\rm{K}}_a]$ increases. Compared to random access with individual codebooks, the URA paradigm achieves higher spectral and energy efficiency. Moreover, using codewords distributed on a sphere is shown to outperform the Gaussian random coding scheme in the non-asymptotic regime.</description>

      <title>Joint Near Field Uplink Communication and Localization Using Message Passing-Based Sparse Bayesian Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work deals with the problem of uplink communication and localization in an integrated sensing and communication system, where users are in the near field (NF) of antenna aperture due to the use of high carrier frequency and large antenna arrays at base stations. We formulate joint NF signal detection and localization as a problem of recovering signals with a sparse pattern. To solve the problem, we develop a message passing based sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) algorithm, where multiple unitary approximate message passing (UAMP)-based sparse signal estimators work jointly to recover the sparse signals with low complexity. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>An Autoencoder-Based Constellation Design for AirComp in Wireless Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wireless federated learning (FL) relies on efficient uplink communications to aggregate model updates across distributed edge devices. Over-the-air computation (a.k.a. AirComp) has emerged as a promising approach for addressing the scalability challenge of FL over wireless links with limited communication resources. Unlike conventional methods, AirComp allows multiple edge devices to transmit uplink signals simultaneously, enabling the parameter server to directly decode the average global model. However, existing AirComp solutions are intrinsically analog, while modern wireless systems predominantly adopt digital modulations. Consequently, careful constellation designs are necessary to accurately decode the sum model updates without ambiguity. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end communication system supporting AirComp with digital modulation, aiming to overcome the challenges associated with accurate decoding of the sum signal with constellation designs. We leverage autoencoder network structures and explore the joint optimization of transmitter and receiver components. Our approach fills an important gap in the context of accurately decoding the sum signal in digital modulation-based AirComp, which can advance the deployment of FL in contemporary wireless systems.</description>

      <title>Feedback Communication Over the BSC with Sparse Feedback times and Causal Encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Posterior matching uses variable-length encoding of the message controlled by noiseless feedback of the received symbols to achieve high rates for short average blocklengths. Traditionally, the feedback of a received symbol occurs before the next symbol is transmitted. The transmitter optimizes the next symbol transmission with full knowledge of every past received symbol.
  To move posterior matching closer to practical communication, this paper seeks to constrain how often feedback can be sent back to the transmitter. We focus on reducing the frequency of the feedback while still maintaining the high rates that posterior matching achieves with feedback after every symbol. As it turns out, the frequency of the feedback can be reduced significantly with no noticeable reduction in rate.</description>

      <title>Performance analysis of satellite-terrestrial integrated radio access networks based on stochastic geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To enhance coverage and improve service continuity, satellite-terrestrial integrated radio access network (STIRAN) has been seen as an essential trend in the development of 6G. However, there is still a lack of theoretical analysis on its coverage performance. To fill this gap, we first establish a system model to characterize a typical scenario where low-earth-orbit (LEO) satellites and terrestrial base stations are both deployed. Then, stochastic geometry is utilized to analyze the downlink coverage probability under the setting of shared frequency and distinct frequencies. Specifically, we derive mathematical expressions for the distances distribution from the serving station to the typical user and the associated probability based on the maximum bias power selection strategy (Max-BPR). Taking into account real-world satellite antenna beamforming patterns in two system scenarios, we derive the downlink coverage probabilities in terms of parameters such as base station density and orbital inclination. Finally, the correctness of the theoretical derivations is verified through experimental simulations, and the influence of network design parameters on the downlink coverage probability is analyzed.</description>

      <title>Generalization the parameters of minimal linear codes over the ring $\mathbb{Z}_{p^l}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, We introduce a condition that is both necessary and sufficient for a linear code to achieve minimality when analyzed over the ring $\mathbb{Z}_{p^l}$. The fundamental inquiry in minimal linear codes is the existence of a $[n,k]$ minimal linear code where $k$ is less than or equal to $n$. W. Lu et al. ( see \cite{nine}) showed that there exists a positive integer $n(k;q)$ such that for $n\geq n(k;q)$ a minimal linear code of length $n$ and dimension $k$ over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$ must exist. They give the upper and lower bound of $n(k;q)$. In this manuscript, we establish both an upper and lower bound for $n(k;p^l)$ within the ring $\mathbb{Z}_{p^l}$.</description>

      <title>Finite-sample expansions for the optimal error probability in asymmetric binary hypothesis testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of binary hypothesis testing between two probability measures is considered. New sharp bounds are derived for the best achievable error probability of such tests based on independent and identically distributed observations. Specifically, the asymmetric version of the problem is examined, where different requirements are placed on the two error probabilities. Accurate nonasymptotic expansions with explicit constants are obtained for the error probability, using tools from large deviations and Gaussian approximation. Examples are shown indicating that, in the asymmetric regime, the approximations suggested by the new bounds are significantly more accurate than the approximations provided by either of the two main earlier approaches -- normal approximation and error exponents.</description>

      <title>Leveraging the Doppler Effect for Channel Charting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Channel Charting is a dimensionality reduction technique that reconstructs a map of the radio environment from similarity relationships found in channel state information. Distances in the channel chart are often computed based on some dissimilarity metric, which can be derived from angular-domain information, channel impulse responses, measured phase differences or simply timestamps. Using such information implicitly makes strong assumptions about the level of phase and time synchronization between base station antennas or assumes approximately constant transmitter velocity. Many practical systems, however, may not provide phase and time synchronization and single-antenna base stations may not even have angular-domain information. We propose a Doppler effect-based loss function for Channel Charting that only requires frequency synchronization between spatially distributed base station antennas, which is a much weaker assumption. We use a dataset measured in an indoor environment to demonstrate that the proposed method is practically feasible with just four base station antennas, that it produces a channel chart that is suitable for localization in the global coordinate frame and that it outperforms other state-of-the-art methods under the given limitations.</description>

      <title>Weighted Sum-Rate Maximization for Movable Antenna-Enhanced Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter investigates the weighted sum rate maximization problem in movable antenna (MA)-enhanced systems. To reduce the computational complexity, we transform it into a more tractable weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) problem well-suited for MA. We then adopt the WMMSE algorithm and majorization-minimization algorithm to optimize the beamforming and antenna positions, respectively. Moreover, we propose a planar movement mode, which constrains each MA to a specified area, we obtain a low-complexity closed-form solution. Numerical results demonstrate that the MA-enhanced system outperforms the conventional system. Besides, the computation time for the planar movement mode is reduced by approximately 30\% at a little performance expense.</description>

      <title>A Novel HARQ-CC Assisted SCMA Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter proposes a novel hybrid automatic repeat request with chase combining assisted sparse code multiple access (HARQ-CC-SCMA) scheme. Depending on whether the same superimposed packet are retransmitted, synchronous and asynchronous modes are considered for retransmissions. Moreover, factor graph aggregation (FGA) and Log-likelihood ratio combination (LLRC) are proposed for multi-user detection. Regarding FGA, a large-scale factor graph is constructed by combining all the received superimposed signals and message passing algorithm (MAP) is applied to calculate log-likelihood ratio (LLR). Whereas, owing to the same unsuccessful messages required to be retransmitted, LLRC adds up LLRs of erroneously received packets in previous HARQ rounds together with currently received packets for channel decoding and saves the LLRs for failed users. Finally, Monte Carlo simulations are preformed to show that FGA surpasses LLRC and HARQ with incremental redundancy (HARQ-IR) in synchronous mode. However, LLRC performs better than FGA at low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in asynchronous mode. This is because failed messages after the maximum allowable HARQ rounds in this mode can yield significant error propagation in low SNR regime.</description>

      <title>Pilot-Attacks Can Enable Positive-Rate Covert Communications of Wireless Hardware Trojans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hardware Trojans, by exploiting the link margins inherent in communication systems, can inflict harm on wireless networks. This paper investigates a four-terminal setting where, alongside the legitimate communication link, a hardware Trojan embedded in the legitimate transmitter attempts to establish communication with its intended rogue receiver. In the channel estimation phase, the Trojan carries out a covert pilot scaling attack to corrupt the channel estimation of the legitimate receiver. Subsequently, in the communication phase, the Trojan exploits the ensuing imperfect channel estimation to covertly communicate with its receiver. By analyzing the corresponding hypothesis tests conducted by the legitimate receiver in both phases, we establish that the pilot scaling attack allows the Trojan to operate in the so-called "linear regime" i.e., covertly and reliably transmitting at a positive rate to the rogue receiver. Overall, our results highlight the vulnerability of the channel estimation process in wireless communication systems against hardware Trojans.</description>

      <title>Novel Joint Estimation and Decoding Metrics for Short-Block length Transmission Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents Bit-Interleaved Coded Modulation metrics for joint estimation detection using training or reference signal transmission strategies for short to long block length channels. We show that it is possible to enhance the performance and sensitivity through joint detection-estimation compared to standard receivers, especially when the channel state information is unknown and the density of the training dimensions is low. The performance analysis makes use of a full 5G transmitter and receiver chains for both Polar and LDPC coded transmissions paired with BPSK/QPSK modulation schemes. We consider transmissions where reference signals are interleaved with data and both are transmitted over a small number of OFDM symbols so that near-perfect channel estimation cannot be achieved. This is particularly adapted to mini-slot transmissions for ultra-reliable, low-latency communications (URLLC) or for short packet random access use cases. We characterize the performance for up to eight receiving antennas in order to determine the performance gain offered by the proposed BICM detection in realistic base station receiver scenarios. Our findings demonstrate that when the detection windows used in the metric units is on the order of four modulated symbols the proposed BICM metrics can be used to achieve detection performance that is close to that of a coherent receiver with perfect channel state information for both polar and LDPC coded configurations. Furthermore, we show that for transmissions with low DMRS density, a good trade-off can be achieved in terms of additional coding gain and improved channel estimation quality by adaptive DMRS power adjustment.</description>

Abstract: In recent years, RIS has made significant progress in engineering application research and industrialization and academic research. However, the engineering application research field of RIS still faces several challenges. This article analyzes and discusses the two deployment modes of RIs-assisted wireless networks: Network Controlled Mode and Standalone mode. It also presents three typical collaboration scenarios of RIS networks, including multi-RIS collaboration, multi-user access, and multi-cell coordination, which reflect the differences between the two deployment modes of RIS. The article proposes collaborative regulation mechanisms for RIS and analyzes their applications in the two network deployment modes in-depth. Furthermore, the article establishes simulation models of three scenarios and provides rich numerical simulation results. An actual field test environment was also built, where a specially designed and processed RIS prototype was used for preliminary field test and verification. Finally, this article puts forward future trends and challenges.</description>

      <title>Measuring the Predictability of Recommender Systems using Structural Complexity Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recommender systems (RS) are central to the filtering and curation of online content. These algorithms predict user ratings for unseen items based on past preferences. Despite their importance, the innate predictability of RS has received limited attention. This study introduces data-driven metrics to measure the predictability of RS based on the structural complexity of the user-item rating matrix. A low predictability score indicates complex and unpredictable user-item interactions, while a high predictability score reveals less complex patterns with predictive potential. We propose two strategies that use singular value decomposition (SVD) and matrix factorization (MF) to measure structural complexity. By perturbing the data and evaluating the prediction of the perturbed version, we explore the structural consistency indicated by the SVD singular vectors. The assumption is that a random perturbation of highly structured data does not change its structure. Empirical results show a high correlation between our metrics and the accuracy of the best-performing prediction algorithms on real data sets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Next-generation multiple input multiple output (MIMO) is expected to be intelligent and scalable. In this paper, we study generative artificial intelligence (AI) agent-enabled next-generation MIMO design. Firstly, we provide an overview of the development, fundamentals, and challenges of the next-generation MIMO. Then, we propose the concept of the generative AI agent, which is capable of generating tailored and specialized contents with the aid of large language model (LLM) and retrieval augmented generation (RAG). Next, we comprehensively discuss the features and advantages of the generative AI agent framework. More importantly, to tackle existing challenges of next-generation MIMO, we discuss generative AI agent-enabled next-generation MIMO design, from the perspective of performance analysis, signal processing, and resource allocation. Furthermore, we present two compelling case studies that demonstrate the effectiveness of leveraging the generative AI agent for performance analysis in complex configuration scenarios. These examples highlight how the integration of generative AI agents can significantly enhance the analysis and design of next-generation MIMO systems. Finally, we discuss important potential research future directions.</description>

      <title>On the best approximation by finite Gaussian mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of approximating a general Gaussian location mixture by finite mixtures. The minimum order of finite mixtures that achieve a prescribed accuracy (measured by various $f$-divergences) is determined within constant factors for the family of mixing distributions with compactly support or appropriate assumptions on the tail probability including subgaussian and subexponential. While the upper bound is achieved using the technique of local moment matching, the lower bound is established by relating the best approximation error to the low-rank approximation of certain trigonometric moment matrices, followed by a refined spectral analysis of their minimum eigenvalue. In the case of Gaussian mixing distributions, this result corrects a previous lower bound in [Allerton Conference 48 (2010) 620-628].</description>

      <title>A Parametric Rate-Distortion Model for Video Transcoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past two decades, the surge in video streaming applications has been fueled by the increasing accessibility of the internet and the growing demand for network video. As users with varying internet speeds and devices seek high-quality video, transcoding becomes essential for service providers. In this paper, we introduce a parametric rate-distortion (R-D) transcoding model. Our model excels at predicting transcoding distortion at various rates without the need for encoding the video. This model serves as a versatile tool that can be used to achieve visual quality improvement (in terms of PSNR) via trans-sizing. Moreover, we use our model to identify visually lossless and near-zero-slope bitrate ranges for an ingest video. Having this information allows us to adjust the transcoding target bitrate while introducing visually negligible quality degradations. By utilizing our model in this manner, quality improvements up to 2 dB and bitrate savings of up to 46% of the original target bitrate are possible. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our model in video transcoding rate distortion prediction.</description>

      <title>RF-Diffusion: Radio Signal Generation via Time-Frequency Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Along with AIGC shines in CV and NLP, its potential in the wireless domain has also emerged in recent years. Yet, existing RF-oriented generative solutions are ill-suited for generating high-quality, time-series RF data due to limited representation capabilities. In this work, inspired by the stellar achievements of the diffusion model in CV and NLP, we adapt it to the RF domain and propose RF-Diffusion. To accommodate the unique characteristics of RF signals, we first introduce a novel Time-Frequency Diffusion theory to enhance the original diffusion model, enabling it to tap into the information within the time, frequency, and complex-valued domains of RF signals. On this basis, we propose a Hierarchical Diffusion Transformer to translate the theory into a practical generative DNN through elaborated design spanning network architecture, functional block, and complex-valued operator, making RF-Diffusion a versatile solution to generate diverse, high-quality, and time-series RF data. Performance comparison with three prevalent generative models demonstrates the RF-Diffusion's superior performance in synthesizing Wi-Fi and FMCW signals. We also showcase the versatility of RF-Diffusion in boosting Wi-Fi sensing systems and performing channel estimation in 5G networks.</description>

      <title>Amplitude-Phase Fusion for Enhanced Electrocardiogram Morphological Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Considering the variability of amplitude and phase patterns in electrocardiogram (ECG) signals due to cardiac activity and individual differences, existing entropy-based studies have not fully utilized these two patterns and lack integration. To address this gap, this paper proposes a novel fusion entropy metric, morphological ECG entropy (MEE) for the first time, specifically designed for ECG morphology, to comprehensively describe the fusion of amplitude and phase patterns. MEE is computed based on beat-level samples, enabling detailed analysis of each cardiac cycle. Experimental results demonstrate that MEE achieves rapid, accurate, and label-free localization of abnormal ECG arrhythmia regions. Furthermore, MEE provides a method for assessing sample diversity, facilitating compression of imbalanced training sets (via representative sample selection), and outperforms random pruning. Additionally, MEE exhibits the ability to describe areas of poor quality. By discussing, it proves the robustness of MEE value calculation to noise interference and its low computational complexity. Finally, we integrate this method into a clinical interactive interface to provide a more convenient and intuitive user experience. These findings indicate that MEE serves as a valuable clinical descriptor for ECG characterization. The implementation code can be referenced at the following link: https://github.com/fdu-harry/ECG-MEE-metric.</description>

      <title>Compression Represents Intelligence Linearly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is a belief that learning to compress well will lead to intelligence. Recently, language modeling has been shown to be equivalent to compression, which offers a compelling rationale for the success of large language models (LLMs): the development of more advanced language models is essentially enhancing compression which facilitates intelligence. Despite such appealing discussions, little empirical evidence is present for the interplay between compression and intelligence. In this work, we examine their relationship in the context of LLMs, treating LLMs as data compressors. Given the abstract concept of "intelligence", we adopt the average downstream benchmark scores as a surrogate, specifically targeting intelligence related to knowledge and commonsense, coding, and mathematical reasoning. Across 12 benchmarks, our study brings together 30 public LLMs that originate from diverse organizations. Remarkably, we find that LLMs' intelligence -- reflected by average benchmark scores -- almost linearly correlates with their ability to compress external text corpora. These results provide concrete evidence supporting the belief that superior compression indicates greater intelligence. Furthermore, our findings suggest that compression efficiency, as an unsupervised metric derived from raw text corpora, serves as a reliable evaluation measure that is linearly associated with the model capabilities. We open-source our compression datasets as well as our data collection pipelines to facilitate future researchers to assess compression properly.</description>

      <title>Message Passing-Based Joint Channel Estimation and Signal Detection for OTFS with Superimposed Pilots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.08177v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Receivers with joint channel estimation and signal detection using superimposed pilots (SP) can achieve high transmission efficiency in orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) systems. However, existing receivers have high computational complexity, hindering their practical applications. In this work, with SP in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain and the generalized complex exponential (GCE) basis expansion modeling (BEM) for channels, a message passing-based SP-DD iterative receiver is proposed, which drastically reduces the computational complexity while with marginal performance loss, compared to existing ones. To facilitate channel estimation (CE) in the proposed receiver, we design pilot signal to achieve pilot power concentration in the frequency domain, thereby developing an SP-DD-D receiver that can effectively reduce the power of the pilot signal and almost no loss of CE accuracy. Extensive simulation results are provided to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed SP-DD-D receiver.</description>

      <title>Modeling and Analysis of Near-Field ISAC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.10917v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As the technical trends for the next-generation wireless network significantly extend the near-field region, a performance reevaluation of integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) with an appropriate channel model to account for the effects introduced by the near field becomes essential. In this paper, a near-field ISAC framework is proposed for both downlink and uplink scenarios based on an accurate channel model. A uniform planar array is equipped at a base station, where the impacts of the effective aperture and polarization of antennas are considered. For the downlink case, three distinct designs are studied: a communications-centric (C-C) design, a sensing-centric (S-C) design, and a Pareto optimal design. Regarding the uplink case, the C-C design, the S-C design and a time-sharing strategy are considered. Within each design, sensing rates (SRs) and communication rates (CRs) are derived. To gain further insights, high signal-to-noise ratio slopes and rate scaling laws concerning the number of antennas are examined. The attainable near-field SR-CR regions of ISAC and the baseline frequency-division S&amp;C are also characterized. Numerical results reveal that, as the number of antennas in the array grows, the SRs and CRs under our accurate model converge to finite values, while those under conventional far- and near-field models exhibit unbounded growth, highlighting the importance of precisely modeling the channels for near-field ISAC.</description>

      <title>RIS-Aided Receive Generalized Spatial Modulation Design with Reflecting Modulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15566v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spatial modulation (SM) transmits additional information bits by the selection of antennas. Generalized spatial modulation (GSM), as an advanced type of SM, can be divided into diversity and multiplexing (MUX) schemes according to the symbols carried on the selected antennas are identical or different. Recently, reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) assisted SM exhibits better reception performance compared to conventional SM. To overcome the limitations of SM, this paper combines GSM with RIS and proposes the RIS-aided receive generalized spatial modulation (RIS-RGSM) scheme. The RIS-RGSM diversity scheme is realized via a simple improvement based on the state-of-the-art scheme. To further increase the transmission rate, a novel RIS-RGSM MUX scheme is proposed, where the reflection phase shifts and on/off states of RIS elements are configured to achieve bit mapping. The theoretical bit error rate (BER) of the proposed scheme is derived and agrees well with the simulation results. Numerical simulations show that the RIS-RGSM MUX scheme has better BER performance than the diversity scheme. The proposed scheme can significantly increase the transmission rate and maintain good performance compared to the existing scheme under a limited number of antennas.</description>

Abstract: Mathematical optimization is now widely regarded as an indispensable modeling and solution tool for the design of wireless communications systems. While optimization has played a significant role in the revolutionary progress in wireless communication and networking technologies from 1G to 5G and onto the future 6G, the innovations in wireless technologies have also substantially transformed the nature of the underlying mathematical optimization problems upon which the system designs are based and have sparked significant innovations in the development of methodologies to understand, to analyze, and to solve those problems. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of recent advances in mathematical optimization theory and algorithms for wireless communication system design. We begin by illustrating common features of mathematical optimization problems arising in wireless communication system design. We discuss various scenarios and use cases and their associated mathematical structures from an optimization perspective. We then provide an overview of recently developed optimization techniques in areas ranging from nonconvex optimization, global optimization, and integer programming, to distributed optimization and learning-based optimization. The key to successful solution of mathematical optimization problems is in carefully choosing or developing suitable algorithms (or neural network architectures) that can exploit the underlying problem structure. We conclude the paper by identifying several open research challenges and outlining future research directions.</description>

      <title>Energy-aware Trajectory Optimization for UAV-mounted RIS and Full-duplex Relay</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12107v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the evolving landscape of sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as transformative tools for dynamic and adaptive connectivity. However, dynamically adjusting their position to offer favorable communication channels introduces operational challenges in terms of energy consumption, especially when integrating advanced communication technologies like reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) and full-duplex relays (FDRs). To this end, by recognizing the pivotal role of UAV mobility, the paper introduces an energy-aware trajectory design for UAV-mounted RISs and UAV-mounted FDRs using the decode and forward (DF) protocol, aiming to maximize the network minimum rate and enhance user fairness, while taking into consideration the available on-board energy. Specifically, this work highlights their distinct energy consumption characteristics and their associated integration challenges by developing appropriate energy consumption models for both UAV-mounted RISs and FDRs that capture the intricate relationship between key factors such as weight, and their operational characteristics. Furthermore, a joint time-division multiple access (TDMA) user scheduling-UAV trajectory optimization problem is formulated, considering the power dynamics of both systems, while assuring that the UAV energy is not depleted mid-air. Finally, simulation results underscore the importance of energy considerations in determining the optimal trajectory and scheduling and provide insights into the performance comparison of UAV-mounted RISs and FDRs in UAV-assisted wireless networks.</description>

Abstract: The automorphism groups of various linear codes are extensively studied yielding insights into the respective code structure. This knowledge is used in, e.g., theoretical analysis and in improving decoding performance, motivating the analyses of endomorphisms of linear codes. In this work, we discuss the structure of the set of transformation matrices of code endomorphisms, defined as a generalization of code automorphisms, and provide an explicit construction of a bijective mapping between the image of an endomorphism and its canonical quotient space. Furthermore, we introduce a one-to-one mapping between the set of transformation matrices of endomorphisms and a larger linear block code enabling the use of well-known algorithms for the search for suitable endomorphisms. Additionally, we propose an approach to obtain unknown code endomorphisms based on automorphisms of the code. Furthermore, we consider ensemble decoding as a possible use case for endomorphisms by introducing endomorphism ensemble decoding. Interestingly, EED can improve decoding performance when other ensemble decoding schemes are not applicable.</description>

      <title>LIGHTCODE: Light Analytical and Neural Codes for Channels with Feedback</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10751v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The design of reliable and efficient codes for channels with feedback remains a longstanding challenge in communication theory. While significant improvements have been achieved by leveraging deep learning techniques, neural codes often suffer from high computational costs, a lack of interpretability, and limited practicality in resource-constrained settings. We focus on designing low-complexity coding schemes that are interpretable and more suitable for communication systems. We advance both analytical and neural codes. First, we demonstrate that POWERBLAST, an analytical coding scheme inspired by Schalkwijk-Kailath (SK) and Gallager-Nakiboglu (GN) schemes, achieves notable reliability improvements over both SK and GN schemes, outperforming neural codes in high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regions. Next, to enhance reliability in low-SNR regions, we propose LIGHTCODE, a lightweight neural code that achieves state-of-the-art reliability while using a fraction of memory and compute compared to existing deep-learning-based codes. Finally, we systematically analyze the learned codes, establishing connections between LIGHTCODE and POWERBLAST, identifying components crucial for performance, and providing interpretation aided by linear regression analysis.</description>

      <title>Simultaneously Transmitting and Reflecting Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces Empowered Cooperative Rate Splitting with User Relaying</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10921v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we unveil the advantages of synergizing cooperative rate splitting (CRS) with user relaying and simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR RIS). Specifically, we propose a novel STAR RIS-assisted CRS transmission framework, featuring six unique transmission modes that leverage various combination of the relaying protocols (including full duplex-FD and half duplex-HD) and the STAR RIS configuration protocols (including energy splitting-ES, mode switching-MS, and time splitting-TS). With the objective of maximizing the minimum user rate, we then propose a unified successive convex approximation (SCA)-based alternative optimization (AO) algorithm to jointly optimize the transmit active beamforming, common rate allocation, STAR RIS passive beamforming, as well as time allocation (for HD or TS protocols) subject to the transmit power constraint at the base station (BS) and the law of energy conservation at the STAR RIS. To alleviate the computational burden, we further propose a low-complexity algorithm that incorporates a closed-form passive beamforming design. Numerical results show that our proposed framework significantly enhances user fairness compared with conventional CRS schemes without STAR RIS or other STAR RIS empowered multiple access schemes. Moreover, the proposed low-complexity algorithm dramatically reduces the computational complexity while achieving very close performance to the AO method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08132v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study some codes of algebraic geometry related to certain maximal curves. Quantum stabilizer codes obtained through the self orthogonality of Hermitian codes of this error correcting do not always have good parameters. However, appropriate parameters found that the Hermitian self-orthogonal code quantum stabilizer code has good parameters. Therefore, we investigated the quantum stabilizer code at a certain maximum curve and modified its parameters. Algebraic geometry codes show promise for enabling high data rate transmission over noisy power line communication channels.</description>

      <title>Age of Information Optimization and State Error Analysis for Correlated Multi-Process Multi-Sensor Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08638v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine a multi-sensor system where each sensor may monitor more than one time-varying information process and send status updates to a remote monitor over a common channel. We consider that each sensor's status update may contain information about more than one information process in the system subject to the system's constraints. To investigate the impact of this correlation on the overall system's performance, we conduct an analysis of both the average Age of Information (AoI) and source state estimation error at the monitor. Building upon this analysis, we subsequently explore the impact of the packet arrivals, correlation probabilities, and rate of processes' state change on the system's performance. Next, we consider the case where sensors have limited sensing abilities and distribute a portion of their sensing abilities across the different processes. We optimize this distribution to minimize the total AoI of the system. Interestingly, we show that monitoring multiple processes from a single source may not always be beneficial. Our results also reveal that the optimal sensing distribution for diverse arrival rates may exhibit a rapid regime switch, rather than smooth transitions, after crossing critical system values. This highlights the importance of identifying these critical thresholds to ensure effective system performance.</description>

      <title>A Lightweight Method for Tackling Unknown Participation Statistics in Federated Averaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.03401v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In federated learning (FL), clients usually have diverse participation statistics that are unknown a priori, which can significantly harm the performance of FL if not handled properly. Existing works aiming at addressing this problem are usually based on global variance reduction, which requires a substantial amount of additional memory in a multiplicative factor equal to the total number of clients. An important open problem is to find a lightweight method for FL in the presence of clients with unknown participation rates. In this paper, we address this problem by adapting the aggregation weights in federated averaging (FedAvg) based on the participation history of each client. We first show that, with heterogeneous participation statistics, FedAvg with non-optimal aggregation weights can diverge from the optimal solution of the original FL objective, indicating the need of finding optimal aggregation weights. However, it is difficult to compute the optimal weights when the participation statistics are unknown. To address this problem, we present a new algorithm called FedAU, which improves FedAvg by adaptively weighting the client updates based on online estimates of the optimal weights without knowing the statistics of client participation. We provide a theoretical convergence analysis of FedAU using a novel methodology to connect the estimation error and convergence. Our theoretical results reveal important and interesting insights, while showing that FedAU converges to an optimal solution of the original objective and has desirable properties such as linear speedup. Our experimental results also verify the advantage of FedAU over baseline methods with various participation patterns.</description>

      <title>A Characterization of Entropy as a Universal Monoidal Natural Transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05742v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the essential properties of entropy (monotonicity, additivity and subadditivity) are consequences of entropy being a monoidal natural transformation from the under category functor $-/\mathsf{LProb}_{\rho}$ (where $\mathsf{LProb}_{\rho}$ is category of $\rho$-th-power-summable probability distributions, $0&lt;\rho&lt;1$) to $\Delta_{\mathbb{R}}$. Moreover, the Shannon entropy can be characterized as the universal monoidal natural transformation from $-/\mathsf{LProb}_{\rho}$ to the category of integrally closed partially ordered abelian groups (a reflective subcategory of the lax-slice 2-category over $\mathsf{MonCat}_{\ell}$ in the 2-category of monoidal categories), providing a succinct characterization of Shannon entropy as a reflection arrow. We can likewise define entropy for every monoidal category with a monoidal structure on its under categories (e.g. the category of finite abelian groups, the category of finite inhabited sets, the category of finite dimensional vector spaces, and the augmented simplex category) via the reflection arrow. This implies that all these entropies over different categories are components of a single natural transformation (the unit of the idempotent monad), allowing us to connect these entropies in a natural manner. We also provide a universal characterization of the conditional Shannon entropy based on the chain rule which, unlike the characterization of information loss by Baez, Fritz and Leinster, does not require any continuity assumption.</description>

      <title>Concentrated Differential Privacy for Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.00557v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bandits serve as the theoretical foundation of sequential learning and an algorithmic foundation of modern recommender systems. However, recommender systems often rely on user-sensitive data, making privacy a critical concern. This paper contributes to the understanding of Differential Privacy (DP) in bandits with a trusted centralised decision-maker, and especially the implications of ensuring zero Concentrated Differential Privacy (zCDP). First, we formalise and compare different adaptations of DP to bandits, depending on the considered input and the interaction protocol. Then, we propose three private algorithms, namely AdaC-UCB, AdaC-GOPE and AdaC-OFUL, for three bandit settings, namely finite-armed bandits, linear bandits, and linear contextual bandits. The three algorithms share a generic algorithmic blueprint, i.e. the Gaussian mechanism and adaptive episodes, to ensure a good privacy-utility trade-off. We analyse and upper bound the regret of these three algorithms. Our analysis shows that in all of these settings, the prices of imposing zCDP are (asymptotically) negligible in comparison with the regrets incurred oblivious to privacy. Next, we complement our regret upper bounds with the first minimax lower bounds on the regret of bandits with zCDP. To prove the lower bounds, we elaborate a new proof technique based on couplings and optimal transport. We conclude by experimentally validating our theoretical results for the three different settings of bandits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.00102v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let \({\mathbb K}\) be any field, let \(X\subset {\mathbb P}^{k-1}\) be a set of \(n\) distinct \({\mathbb K}\)-rational points, and let \(a\geq 1\) be an integer. In this paper we find lower bounds for the minimum distance \(d(X)_a\) of the evaluation code of order \(a\) associated to \(X\). The first results use \(\alpha(X)\), the initial degree of the defining ideal of \(X\), and the bounds are true for any set \(X\). In another result we use \(s(X)\), the minimum socle degree, to find a lower bound for the case when \(X\) is in general linear position. In both situations we improve and generalize known results.</description>

      <title>A family of permutationally invariant quantum codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05358v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a new family of permutationally invariant codes that correct $t$ Pauli errors for any $t\ge 1$. We also show that codes in the new family correct quantum deletion errors as well as spontaneous decay errors. Our construction contains some of the previously known permutationally invariant quantum codes as particular cases, which also admit transversal gates. In many cases, the codes in the new family are shorter than the best previously known explicit permutationally invariant codes for Pauli errors and deletions. Furthermore, our new code family includes a new $((4,2,2))$ optimal single-deletion-correcting code. As a separate result, we generalize the conditions for permutationally invariant codes to correct $t$ Pauli errors from the previously known results for $t=1$ to any number of errors. For small $t$, these conditions can be used to construct new examples of codes by computer.</description>

      <title>Approximate Message Passing-Enhanced Graph Neural Network for OTFS Data Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10071v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation has emerged as a promising solution to support high-mobility wireless communications, for which, cost-effective data detectors are critical. Although graph neural network (GNN)-based data detectors can achieve decent detection accuracy at reasonable computational cost, they fail to best harness prior information of transmitted data. To further minimize the data detection error of OTFS systems, this letter develops an AMP-GNN-based detector, leveraging the approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm to iteratively improve the symbol estimates of a GNN. Given the inter-Doppler interference (IDI) symbols incur substantial computational overhead to the constructed GNN, learning-based IDI approximation is implemented to sustain low detection complexity. Simulation results demonstrate a remarkable bit error rate (BER) performance achieved by the proposed AMP-GNN-based detector compared to existing baselines. Meanwhile, the proposed IDI approximation scheme avoids a large amount of computations with negligible BER degradation.</description>

      <title>Joint Optimization on Uplink OFDMA and MU-MIMO for IEEE 802.11ax: Deep Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02486v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This letter tackles a joint user scheduling, frequency resource allocation (USRA), multi-input-multi-output mode selection (MIMO MS) between single-user MIMO and multi-user (MU) MIMO, and MU-MIMO user selection problem, integrating uplink orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) in IEEE 802.11ax. Specifically, we focus on \textit{unsaturated traffic conditions} where users' data demands fluctuate. In unsaturated traffic conditions, considering packet volumes per user introduces a combinatorial problem, requiring the simultaneous optimization of MU-MIMO user selection and RA along the time-frequency-space axis. Consequently, dealing with the combinatorial nature of this problem, characterized by a large cardinality of unknown variables, poses a challenge that conventional optimization methods find nearly impossible to address. In response, this letter proposes an approach with deep hierarchical reinforcement learning (DHRL) to solve the joint problem. Rather than simply adopting off-the-shelf DHRL, we \textit{tailor} the DHRL to the joint USRA and MS problem, thereby significantly improving the convergence speed and throughput. Extensive simulation results show that the proposed algorithm achieves significantly improved throughput compared to the existing schemes under various unsaturated traffic conditions.</description>

      <title>A Mathematical Theory for Learning Semantic Languages by Abstract Learners</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07009v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated the emergence of capabilities (learned skills) when the number of system parameters and the size of training data surpass certain thresholds. The exact mechanisms behind such phenomena are not fully understood and remain a topic of active research. Inspired by the skill-text bipartite graph model presented in [1] for modeling semantic language, we develop a mathematical theory to explain the emergence of learned skills, taking the learning (or training) process into account. Our approach models the learning process for skills in the skill-text bipartite graph as an iterative decoding process in Low-Density Parity Check (LDPC) codes and Irregular Repetition Slotted ALOHA (IRSA). Using density evolution analysis, we demonstrate the emergence of learned skills when the ratio of the size of training texts to the number of skills exceeds a certain threshold. Our analysis also yields a scaling law for testing errors relative to the size of training texts. Upon completion of the training, we propose a method for semantic compression and discuss its application in semantic communication.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08455v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we formalize an optimization framework for analog beamforming in the context of monostatic integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), where we also address the problem of self-interference in the analog domain. As a result, we derive semidefinite programs to approach detection-optimal transmit and receive beamformers, and we devise a superiorized iterative projection algorithm to approximate them. Our simulations show that this approach outperforms the detection performance of well-known design techniques for ISAC beamforming, while it achieves satisfactory self-interference suppression.</description>
