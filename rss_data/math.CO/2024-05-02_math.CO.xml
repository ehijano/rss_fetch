      <title>Tree independence number II. Three-path-configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A \textit{three-paths-configuration} is a graph consisting of three pairwise internally-disjoint paths the union of every two of which is an induced cycle of length at least four. A graph is \textit{3PC-free} if no induced subgraph of it is a three-paths-configuration. We prove that 3PC-free graphs have poly-logarithmic tree-independence number. More explicitly, we show that there exists a constant $c$ such that every $n$-vertex 3PC-free graph graph has a tree decomposition in which every bag has stability number at most $c (\log n)^2$. This implies that the \textsc{Maximum Weight Independent Set} problem, as well as several other natural algorithmic problems, that are known to be \textsf{NP}-hard in general, can be solved in quasi-polynomial time if the input graph is 3PC-free.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A group $G$ is complete group if it satisfies $Z(G) = e$ and Aut$(G)$ = Inn$(G)$. In this paper, we study the basic properties of generalized Cayley graphs and characterize several classes of isomorphic generalized Cayley graphs of complete group. As an application, we complete the classification of restricted GCI-groups for symmetric groups.</description>

      <title>Shallow vertex minors, stability, and dependence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stability and dependence are model-theoretic notions that have recently proved highly effective in the study of structural and algorithmic properties of hereditary graph classes, and are considered key notions for generalizing to hereditary graph classes the theory of sparsity developed for monotone graph classes (where an essential notion is that of nowhere dense class). The theory of sparsity was initially built on the notion of shallow minors and on the idea of excluding different sets of minors, depending on the depth at which these minors can appear.
  In this paper, we follow a similar path, where shallow vertex minors replace shallow minors. In this setting, we provide a neat characterization of stable / dependent hereditary classes of graphs: A hereditary class of graphs $\mathscr C$ is
  (1) dependent if and only if it does not contain all permutation graphs and, for each integer $r$, it excludes some split interval graph as a depth-$r$ vertex minor;
  (2) stable if and only if, for each integer $r$, it excludes some half-graph as a depth-$r$ vertex minor.
  A key ingredient in proving these results is the preservation of stability and dependence of a class when taking bounded depth shallow vertex minors. We extend this preservation result to binary structures and get, as a direct consequence, that bounded depth shallow vertex minors of graphs with bounded twin-width have bounded twin-width.</description>

      <title>Lorentzian polynomials and the independence sequences of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the multivariate independence polynomials of graphs and the log-concavity of the coefficients of their univariate restrictions. Let $R_{W_4}$ be the operator defined on simple and undirected graphs which replaces each edge with a caterpillar of size $4$. We prove that all graphs in the image of $R_{W_4}$ are what we call pre-Lorentzian, that is, their multivariate independence polynomial becomes Lorentzian after appropriate manipulations. In particular, as pre-Lorentzian graphs have log-concave (and therefore unimodal) independence sequences, our result makes progress on a conjecture of Alavi, Malde, Schwenk and Erd\H{o}s which asks if the independence sequence of trees or forests is unimodal.</description>

      <title>Graph-Based Multivariate Multiscale Dispersion Entropy: Efficient Implementation and Applications to Real-World Network Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Multivariate Multiscale Graph-based Dispersion Entropy (mvDEG), a novel, computationally efficient method for analyzing multivariate time series data in graph and complex network frameworks, and demonstrate its application in real-world data. mvDEG effectively combines temporal dynamics with topological relationships, offering enhanced analysis compared to traditional nonlinear entropy methods. Its efficacy is established through testing on synthetic signals, such as uncorrelated and correlated noise, showcasing its adeptness in discerning various levels of dependency and complexity.
  The robustness of mvDEG is further validated with real-world datasets, effectively differentiating various two-phase flow regimes and capturing distinct dynamics in weather data analysis. An important advancement of mvDEG is its computational efficiency. Our optimized algorithm displays a computational time that grows linearly with the number of vertices or nodes, in contrast to the exponential growth observed in classical methods. This efficiency is achieved through refined matrix power calculations that exploit matrix and Kronecker product properties, making our method faster than the state of the art. The significant acceleration in computational time positions mvDEG as a transformative tool for extensive and real-time applications, setting a new benchmark in the analysis of time series recorded at distributed locations and opening avenues for innovative applications.</description>

      <title>Clique packings in random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the question of how many edge-disjoint near-maximal cliques may be found in the dense Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph $G(n,p)$. Recently Acan and Kahn showed that the largest such family contains only $O(n^2/(\log{n})^3)$ cliques, with high probability, which disproved a conjecture of Alon and Spencer. We prove the corresponding lower bound, $\Omega(n^2/(\log{n})^3)$, by considering a random graph process which sequentially selects and deletes near-maximal cliques. To analyse this process we use the Differential Equation Method. We also give a new proof of the upper bound $O(n^2/(\log{n})^3)$ and discuss the problem of the precise size of the largest such clique packing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-stable, Lorentzian, and log-concave polynomials are well-studied classes of polynomials, and have been powerful tools in resolving several conjectures. We show that the problems of deciding whether a polynomial of fixed degree is real stable or log concave are coNP-complete. On the other hand, while all homogeneous real-stable polynomials are Lorentzian and all Lorentzian polynomials are log concave on the positive orthant, the problem of deciding whether a polynomial of fixed degree is Lorentzian can be solved in polynomial time.</description>

      <title>The directed landscape from Brownian motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define an almost sure bijection which constructs the directed landscape from a sequence of infinitely many independent Brownian motions. This is the analogue of the RSK correspondence in this setting. The Brownian motions arise as a marginal of the extended Busemann process for the directed landscape, and the inverse map gives an explicit and natural coupling where Brownian last passage percolation converges in probability to the directed landscape. We use this map to prove that the directed landscape on a strip can be reconstructed from the Airy line ensemble. Along the way, we describe two more new versions of RSK in the semi-discrete setting, build a general theory of sorting via Pitman operators, and construct extended Busemann processes for the directed landscape and Brownian last passage percolation.</description>

Abstract: We give an explicit formula for Euler characteristics of line bundles on the Hilbert scheme of points on $\mathbb{P}^1\times\mathbb{P}^1$. Combined with structural results of Ellingsrud, G\"ottsche, and Lehn, this determines the Euler characteristic of any line bundle on the Hilbert scheme of points on any smooth, projective surface. We also give an enumerative description of the dimensions of spaces of global sections of ample line bundles on Hilbert schemes of points on Hirzebruch surfaces, extending the polytope-line bundle correspondence on the underlying toric surface.</description>

      <title>Measuring the convexity of compact sumsets with the Schneider non-convexity index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent work, Franck Barthe and Mokshay Madiman introduced the concept of the Lyusternik region, denoted by $\Lambda_{n}(m)$, to better understand volumes of sumsets. They gave a characterization of $\Lambda_{n}(2)$ (the volumes of compact sets in $\mathbb{R}^n$ when at most $m=2$ sets are added together) and proved that Lebesgue measure satisfies a fractional superadditive property. We attempt to imitate the idea of the Lyusternik region by defining a region based on the Schneider non-convexity index function, which was originally defined by Rolf Schneider in 1975. We call this region the Schneider region, denoted by $S_{n}(m)$. In this paper, we will give an initial characterization of the region $S_{1}(2)$ and in doing so, we will prove that the Schneider non-convexity index of a sumset $c(A_1+A_2)$ has a best lower bound in terms of $c(A_1)$ and $c(A_2)$. We will pose some open questions about extending this lower bound to higher dimensions and large sums. We will also show that, analogous to Lebesgue measure, the Schneider non-convexity index has a fractional subadditive property. Regarding the Lyusternik region, we will show that when the number of sets being added is $m\geq3$, that the region $\Lambda_{n}(m)$ is not closed, proving a new qualitative property for the region.</description>

      <title>Clique-free t-matchings in degree-bounded graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider problems of finding a maximum size/weight $t$-matching without forbidden subgraphs in an undirected graph $G$ with the maximum degree bounded by $t+1$, where $t$ is an integer greater than $2$. Depending on the variant forbidden subgraphs denote certain subsets of $t$-regular complete partite subgraphs of $G$. A graph is complete partite if there exists a partition of its vertex set such that every pair of vertices from different sets is connected by an edge and vertices from the same set form an independent set. A clique $K_t$ and a bipartite clique $K_{t,t}$ are examples of complete partite graphs. These problems are natural generalizations of the triangle-free and square-free $2$-matching problems in subcubic graphs. In the weighted setting we assume that the weights of edges of $G$ are vertex-induced on every forbidden subgraph. We present simple and fast combinatorial algorithms for these problems. The presented algorithms are the first ones for the weighted versions, and for the unweighted ones, are faster than those known previously. Our approach relies on the use of gadgets with so-called half-edges. A half-edge of edge $e$ is, informally speaking, a half of $e$ containing exactly one of its endpoints.</description>

      <title>Construction of extremal Type II $\mathbb{Z}_{8}$-codes via doubling method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extremal Type II $\mathbb{Z}_{8}$-codes are a class of self-dual $\mathbb{Z}_{8}$-codes with Euclidean weights divisible by $16$ and the largest possible minimum Euclidean weight for a given length. We introduce a doubling method for constructing a Type II $\mathbb{Z}_{2k}$-code of length $n$ from a known Type II $\mathbb{Z}_{2k}$-code of length $n$. Based on this method, we develop an algorithm to construct new extremal Type II $\mathbb{Z}_8$-codes starting from an extremal Type II $\mathbb{Z}_8$-code of type $(\frac{n}{2},0,0)$ with an extremal $\mathbb{Z}_4$-residue code and length $24, 32$ or $40$.
  We construct at least ten new extremal Type II $\mathbb{Z}_8$-codes of length $32$ and type $(15,1,1)$. Extremal Type II $\mathbb{Z}_8$-codes of length $32$ of this type were not known before. Moreover, the binary residue codes of the constructed extremal $\mathbb{Z}_8$-codes are optimal $[32,15]$ binary codes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problems that we consider in this paper are as follows. Let A and B be 2x2 matrices (over reals). Let w(A, B) be a word of length n. After evaluating w(A, B) as a product of matrices, we get a 2x2 matrix, call it W. What is the largest (by the absolute value) possible entry of W, over all w(A, B) of length n, as a function of n? What is the expected absolute value of the largest (by the absolute value) entry in a random product of n matrices, where each matrix is A or B with probability 0.5? What is the Lyapunov exponent for a random matrix product like that? We give partial answer to the first of these questions and an essentially complete answer to the second question. For the third question (the most difficult of the three), we offer a very simple method to produce an upper bound on the Lyapunov exponent in the case where all entries of the matrices A and B are nonnegative.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2204.02487v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a finite point set $P \subset \mathbb{R}^d$, denote by $\text{diam}(P)$ the ratio of the largest to the smallest distances between pairs of points in $P$. Let $c_{d, \alpha}(n)$ be the largest integer $c$ such that any $n$-point set $P \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ in general position, satisfying $\text{diam}(P) &lt; \alpha\sqrt[d]{n}$, contains an $c$-point convex independent subset. We determine the asymptotics of $c_{d, \alpha}(n)$ as $n \to \infty$ by showing the existence of positive constants $\beta = \beta(d, \alpha)$ and $\gamma = \gamma(d)$ such that $\beta n^{\frac{d-1}{d+1}} \le c_{d, \alpha}(n) \le \gamma n^{\frac{d-1}{d+1}}$ for $\alpha\geq 2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.04636v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a strong dichotomy result for countably-infinite oriented graphs; that is, we prove that for all countably-infinite oriented graphs $G$, either (i) there is a countably-infinite tournament $K$ such that $G\not\subseteq K$, or (ii) every countably-infinite tournament contains a \emph{spanning} copy of $G$. Furthermore, we are able to give a concise characterization of such oriented graphs. Our characterization becomes even simpler in the case of transitive acyclic oriented graphs (i.e. strict partial orders).
  For uncountable oriented graphs, we are able to extend the dichotomy result mentioned above to all regular cardinals $\kappa$; however, we are only able to provide a concise characterization in the case when $\kappa=\aleph_1$.</description>

      <title>A sufficient condition for cubic 3-connected plane bipartite graphs to be hamiltonian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.09578v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Barnette's conjecture asserts that every cubic $3$-connected plane bipartite graph is hamiltonian. Although, in general, the problem is still open, some partial results are known. In particular, let us call a face of a plane graph big (small) if it has at least six edges (it has four edges, respectively). Goodey proved for a $3$-connected bipartite cubic plane graph $P$, that if all big faces in $P$ have exactly six edges, then $P$ is hamiltonian. In this paper we prove that the same is true under the condition that no face in $P$ has more than four big neighbours. We also prove, that if each vertex in $P$ is incident both with a small and a big face, then~$P$ has at least $2^{k}$ different Hamilton cycles, where $k = \left\lceil\frac{|B|-2}{4\Delta(B) - 7}\right\rceil$, $|B|$ is the number of big faces in $P$ and $\Delta(B)$ is the maximum size of faces in $P$. 15 pages</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05595v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ denote a distance-regular graph with diameter $D\geq 3$. Juri\v{s}i\'c and Vidali conjectured that if $\Gamma$ is tight with classical parameters $(D,b,\alpha,\beta)$, $b\geq 2$, then $\Gamma$ is not locally the block graph of an orthogonal array nor the block graph of a Steiner system. In the present paper, we prove this conjecture and, furthermore, extend it from the following aspect. Assume that for every triple of vertices $x, y, z$ of $\Gamma$, where $x$ and $y$ are adjacent, and $z$ is at distance $2$ from both $x$ and $y$, the number of common neighbors of $x$, $y$, $z$ is constant. We then show that if $\Gamma$ is locally the block graph of an orthogonal array (resp. a Steiner system) with smallest eigenvalue $-m$, $m\geq 3$, then the intersection number $c_2$ is not equal to $m^2$ (resp. $m(m+1)$). Using this result, we prove that if a tight distance-regular graph $\Gamma$ is not locally the block graph of an orthogonal array or a Steiner system, then the valency (and hence diameter) of $\Gamma$ is bounded by a function in the parameter $b=b_1/(1+\theta_1)$, where $b_1$ is the intersection number of $\Gamma$ and $\theta_1$ is the second largest eigenvalue of $\Gamma$.</description>

      <title>Palindromic Periodicities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05381v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A palindromic periodicity is a factor of an infinite word $(ps)^\omega$ where $p$ and $s$ are palindromes and the factor has length at least $|ps|$, for example, $accabaccab$. In this paper we describe several ways in which a palindromic periodicity may arise through the interaction of palindromes and periodicity, the simplest case being when a palindrome is itself periodic. We then consider what happens when a word is a palindromic periodicity in two ways, a situation similar to that considered in the Fine and Wilf Lemma and obtain something slightly stronger than that lemma. The paper ends with suggestions for further work.</description>

      <title>On the chromatic number of powers of subdivisions of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05542v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a given graph $G=(V,E)$, we define its \emph{$n$th subdivision} as the graph obtained from $G$ by replacing every edge by a path of length $n$. We also define the \emph{$m$th power} of $G$ as the graph on vertex set $V$ where we connect every pair of vertices at distance at most $m$ in $G$. In this paper we study the chromatic number of powers of subdivisions of graphs and resolve the case $m=n$ asymptotically. In particular, our result confirms a conjecture of Mozafari-Nia and Iradmusa in the case $m=n=3$ in a strong sense.</description>

Abstract: We find the area between $\cos^p x$ and $\cos^p nx$ as $n$ heads to infinity, and we establish a connection between these limiting values and the exponential generating function for $\arcsin x/(1-x)$ at sequence number A296726 on the OEIS.</description>

      <title>Quantitative twisted patterns in positive density subsets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.05862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.05862v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We make quantitative improvements to recently obtained results on the structure of the image of a large difference set under certain quadratic forms and other homogeneous polynomials. Previous proofs used deep results of Benoist-Quint on random walks in certain subgroups of $\operatorname{SL}_r(\mathbb{Z})$ (the symmetry groups of these quadratic forms) that were not of a quantitative nature. Our new observation relies on noticing that rather than studying random walks, one can obtain more quantitative results by considering polynomial orbits of these group actions that are not contained in cosets of submodules of $\mathbb{Z}^r$ of small index. Our main new technical tool is a uniform Furstenberg-S\'{a}rk\"{o}zy theorem that holds for a large class of polynomials not necessarily vanishing at zero, which may be of independent interest and is derived from a density increment argument and Hua's bound on polynomial exponential sums.</description>

      <title>Dips at small sizes for topological graph obstruction sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.14255v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Graph Minor Theorem of Robertson and Seymour implies a finite set of obstructions for any minor closed graph property. We show that there are only three obstructions to knotless embedding of size 23, which is far fewer than the 92 of size 22 and the hundreds known to exist at larger sizes. We describe several other topological properties whose obstruction set demonstrates a similar dip at small size. For order ten graphs, we classify the 35 obstructions to knotless embedding and the 49 maximal knotless graphs.</description>

      <title>Cover and Hitting Times of Hyperbolic Random Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.06956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.06956v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study random walks on the giant component of Hyperbolic Random Graphs (HRGs), in the regime when the degree distribution obeys a power law with exponent in the range $(2,3)$. In particular, we first focus on the expected time for a random walk to hit a given vertex or visit, i.e. cover, all vertices. We show that, a.a.s. (with respect to the HRG), and up to multiplicative constants: the cover time is $n(\log n)^2$, the maximum hitting time is $n\log n$, and the average hitting time is $n$. We then determine the expected time to commute between two given vertices a.a.s., up to a small factor polylogarithmic in $n$, and under some mild hypothesis on the pair of vertices involved. Our results are proved by controlling effective resistances using the energy dissipated by carefully designed network flows associated to a tiling of the hyperbolic plane, on which we overlay a forest-like structure.</description>

      <title>New cluster algebras from old: integrability beyond Zamolodchikov periodicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00721v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider discrete dynamical systems obtained as deformations of mutations in cluster algebras associated with finite-dimensional simple Lie algebras. The original (undeformed) dynamical systems provide the simplest examples of Zamolodchikov periodicity: they are affine birational maps for which every orbit is periodic with the same period. Following on from preliminary work by one of us with Kouloukas, here we present integrable maps obtained from deformations of cluster mutations related to the following simple root systems: $A_3$, $B_2$, $B_3$ and $D_4$. We further show how new cluster algebras arise, by considering Laurentification, that is, a lifting to a higher-dimensional map expressed in a set of new variables (tau functions), for which the dynamics exhibits the Laurent property. For the integrable map obtained by deformation of type $A_3$, which already appeared in our previous work, we show that there is a commuting map of Quispel-Roberts-Thompson (QRT) type which is built from a composition of mutations and a permutation applied to the same cluster algebra of rank 6, with an additional 2 frozen variables. Furthermore, both the deformed $A_3$ map and the QRT map correspond to addition of a point in the Mordell-Weil group of a rational elliptic surface of rank two, and the underlying cluster algebra comes from a quiver that mutation equivalent to the $q$-Painlev\'e III quiver found by Okubo. The deformed integrable maps of types $B_2$, $B_3$ and $D_4$ are also related to elliptic surfaces.
  From a dynamical systems viewpoint, the message of the paper is that special families of birational maps with completely periodic dynamics under iteration admit natural deformations that are aperiodic yet completely integrable.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic estimates of the diameters of the Rubik's Cube groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07337v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The diameter of the Cayley graph of the Rubik's Cube group is the fewest number of turns needed to solve the Cube from any initial configurations. For the 2$\times$2$\times$2 Cube, the diameter is 11 in the half-turn metric, 14 in the quarter-turn metric, 19 in the semi-quarter-turn metric, and 10 in the bi-quarter-turn metric. For the 3$\times$3$\times$3 Cube, the diameter was determined by Rokicki et al. to be 20 in the half-turn metric and 26 in the quarter-turn metric. This study shows that a modified version of the coupon collector's problem in probabilistic theory can predict the diameters correctly for both 2$\times$2$\times$2 and 3$\times$3$\times$3 Cubes insofar as the quarter-turn metric is adopted. In the half-turn metric, the diameters are overestimated by one and two, respectively, for the 2$\times$2$\times$2 and 3$\times$3$\times$3 Cubes, whereas for the 2$\times$2$\times$2 Cube in the semi-quarter-turn and bi-quarter-turn metrics, they are overestimated by two and underestimated by one, respectively. Invoking the same probabilistic logic, the diameters of the 4$\times$4$\times$4 and 5$\times$5$\times$5 Cubes are predicted to be 48 (41) and 68 (58) in the quarter-turn (half-turn) metric, whose precise determinations are far beyond reach of classical supercomputing. It is shown that the probabilistically estimated diameter is approximated by $\ln N / \ln r + \ln N / r$, where $N$ is the number of configurations and $r$ is the branching ratio.</description>
