      <title>Photodetachment of negative hydrogen ion beam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The method of H- photoionization is interesting for laser assisted charge exchange injection. In this paper, the model and computation of photoionization of negative hydrogen ion by using strong lasers is considered. The development of this work is motivated by using pure lasers for photodetachment of electron from negative hydrogen ion when it is not convenient or not possible to use stripping magnet. Herein we develop a method of calculation of high efficiency photoionization using time dependent wave equation with application of powerful lasers. We compare this precise method of calculation with simplified method of calculation through linear model of cross section interaction. Another mechanism of photodetachment through excitation of the Feshbach resonance is also considered.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Prior Mean Models for Faster Bayesian Optimization of Particle Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03225v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tuning particle accelerators is a challenging and time-consuming task that can be automated and carried out efficiently using suitable optimization algorithms, such as model-based Bayesian optimization techniques. One of the major advantages of Bayesian algorithms is the ability to incorporate prior information about beam physics and historical behavior into the model used to make control decisions. In this work, we examine incorporating prior accelerator physics information into Bayesian optimization algorithms by utilizing fast executing, neural network models trained on simulated or historical datasets as prior mean functions in Gaussian process models. We show that in ideal cases, this technique substantially increases convergence speed to optimal solutions in high-dimensional tuning parameter spaces. Additionally, we demonstrate that even in non-ideal cases, where prior models of beam dynamics do not exactly match experimental conditions, the use of this technique can still enhance convergence speed. Finally, we demonstrate how these methods can be used to improve optimization in practical applications, such as transferring information gained from beam dynamics simulations to online control of the LCLS injector, and transferring knowledge gained from experimental measurements across different operating modes, such as accelerating different ion species at the ATLAS heavy ion accelerator.</description>
