      <title>Patchy Helium and Hydrogen Reionization from the Kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Effect and Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Upcoming cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments will measure temperature fluctuations on small angular scales with unprecedented precision, enabling improved measurements of the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect. This secondary anisotropy has emerged as a valuable probe of the distribution of ionized electrons in the post-recombination Universe. Although the sensitivity of the kSZ effect has recently been utilized to study the high-redshift epoch of hydrogen (H) reionization, its redshift-integrated nature -- combined with anticipated improvements in measurement precision -- suggests that accounting for the later epoch of helium (He) reionization will become increasingly important in the near future. Joint characterization of the epochs will allow for a more coherent understanding of early-star and -quasar formation, as these sources drive the ionization of H and He in the intergalactic medium. In this paper, we extend the kSZ higher-order statistic introduced by Smith \&amp; Ferraro (2017) to forecast the ability of upcoming CMB surveys to probe the morphology of both H and He reionization. Moreover, given that upcoming large-scale structure surveys will trace density fluctuations at redshifts overlapping with the epoch of He reionization, we propose a novel cross-correlation between the kSZ higher-order statistic and galaxy survey measurements. Using a joint information-matrix analysis of H and He reionization, we show that next-generation CMB and galaxy surveys will have sufficient statistical power to characterize the patchy morphology of H reionization and set constraints on the redshift evolution of its He counterpart.</description>

      <title>JWST lens model for A370: A very low dark matter fraction for a brightest cluster galaxy and lensing properties for the Dragon arc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new lens model for the $z=0.375$ galaxy cluster Abell 370 based on previously spectroscopically confirmed lensed galaxies and new lensed systems identified in JWST data, including recent data from the MAGNIF program. Based on the best models able to reproduce two radial arcs near the BCGs, we compare the stellar mass to the total mass from the lens model and find that the fraction of dark matter in the south BCG is consistent with $\Lambda$CDM while in the north BCG we find a very small amount of dark matter, more consistent with alternative models to $\Lambda$CDM. We discuss possible causes for this and conclude that additional data is needed to clarify the situation. We study the lensing properties, magnification, time delay and strength of the critical curve, along the Dragon arc, where previous studies have reported tens of alleged microlensing events from supergiant stars at $z=0.7251$. The new lens model is able to reproduce the distribution of microlensing events with great accuracy. Some of the microlensing events may be reinterpreted as long-period Cepheid in future observations. We consider this possibility and study in more detail the challenges for such detection from intervening microlenses.</description>

      <title>Large-Scale-Structure Observables in General Relativity Validated at Second Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a second-order calculation of relativistic large-scale-structure observables in cosmological perturbation theory, specifically the "cosmic rulers and clock", which are the building-blocks of any other large-scale-structure observable, including galaxy number counts, on large scales. We calculate the scalar rulers (longitudinal perturbation and magnification) and the cosmic clock to second order, using a fully non-linear covariant definition of the observables. We validate our formulae on three non-trivial space-time metrics: two of them are null tests on metrics which are obtained by applying a gauge transformation to the background space-time, while the third is the "separate universe" curved background, for which we can also compute the observables exactly. We then illustrate the results by evaluating the second-order observables in a simplified symmetric setup. On large scales, they are suppressed over the linear contributions by $\sim 10^{-4}$, while they become comparable to the linear contributions on mildly non-linear scales. The results of this paper form a significant (and the most complicated) part of the relativistic galaxy number density at second order.</description>

      <title>Merger History of Clustered Primordial Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Primordial black hole (PBH) binaries experience strong gravitational perturbations in the case of their initial clustering, which significantly affects the dynamics of their mergers. In this work, we develop a new formalism to account for these perturbations and track the evolution of the binary orbital parameters distribution. Based on this approach, we calculate the merger rate of PBH binaries and demonstrate that its temporal evolution differs greatly from that of isolated binary systems. Moreover, PBH clustering produces distinctive features in the stochastic gravitational-wave background: the canonical $2/3$ spectral slope transforms to $\Omega_{\rm gw} \propto \nu^{-65/28}$ in a certain frequency band. These predictions can be probed in future gravitational wave observations, opening up new opportunities to test the clustering of PBHs and their contribution to dark matter.</description>

      <title>Geometric Cosmology models: statistical analysis with observational data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although the standard cosmological model is capable of explaining most current observational data, it faces some theoretical and observational issues. This is the main motivation for exploring alternative cosmological models. In this paper, we focus on a novel proposal that consists in adding an infinite tower of higher-order curvature invariants to the usual Einstein-Hilbert action. We obtain the late-time background evolution for three families of models that can be obtained from this proposal. We use recent data from Cosmic Chronometers and type Ia supernovae to test the late-time predictions of our models. In addition, we consider estimations from the Age of the Older Globular Clusters to constrain our models. While some of the studied cases are ruled out by the data, we show that there are particular cases of the GILA model that can explain current data.</description>

      <title>X-ray investigation of the remarkable galaxy group Nest200047</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11312v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy groups are more susceptible to feedback from the central active galactic nuclei (AGN) due to their lower gravitational binding energy compared to clusters. This makes them ideal laboratories to study feedback effects on the overall energy and baryonic mass budget. We study the LOFAR-detected galaxy group Nest200047, where there is clear evidence of multiple generations of radio lobes from the AGN. Using 140 ks Chandra and 25 ks XMM-Newton data, we investigate thermodynamic properties of the the intragroup medium including any excess energy due to the central AGN. We also investigate X-ray properties of the central black hole and constrain the $2-10$ keV X-ray flux. We used spectral analysis techniques to measure various thermodynamic profiles across the whole field of view. We also used both imaging and spectral analysis to detect and estimate the energy deposited by potential shocks and cavities. Due to the faint emission from the object beyond the core, various background effects were considered. Nest200047 has significant excess entropy, and the AGN likely contributes to a part of it. There is an excess energy of $(5-6.5) \times 10^{60}$ erg within 400 kpc, exceeding the binding energy. The pressure profile indicates that gas is likely being ejected from the system, resulting in a baryon fraction of $\sim4\%$ inside $r_{500}$. From scaling relations, we estimate a black hole mass of $(1-4)\times 10^9 M_{\odot}$. An upper limit of $2.1 \times 10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$ was derived on the black hole bolometric luminosity, which is $\sim$2.5% of the Bondi accretion power. Nest200047 is likely part of a class of over-heated galaxy groups like ESO 3060170, AWM 4 and AWM 5. Such excessive heating may lead to high quenching of star formation. Moreover, the faint X-ray nuclear emission in Nest is likely due to the accretion energy being converted into jets rather than radiation.</description>

      <title>Addressing the $H_0$ tension through matter with pressure and no early dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose that the Hubble tension arises due to an unaccounted additional component, that behaves as \emph{matter with pressure}. We demonstrate that this fluid remains subdominant compared to both dust and radiation throughout nearly the entire universe expansion history. Specifically, the additional fluid satisfies the Zel'dovic limit with a constant equation of state, $\omega_s &gt; 0$, and a quite small normalized energy density, $\Omega_s$. Accordingly, this component modifies both the sound horizon and the background expansion rate, \emph{acting quite differently from early dark energy models}, without significantly affecting the other cosmological parameters. To show this, we perform a Monte Carlo Markov chain analysis of our model, hereafter dubbed $\Lambda_{\omega_s}$CDM paradigm, using the publicly available \texttt{CLASS} Boltzmann code. Our results confirm the presence of this fluid, with properties that closely resemble those of radiation. We find best-fit values that satisfy $\omega_s \lesssim \omega_\gamma$ and a relative energy density $\Omega_s / \Omega_\gamma = 0.45$, with $\omega_r$ and $\Omega_r$ the equation of state and density of photons, respectively. The effective fluid may be associated with generalized K-essence models or, alternatively, with Proca-type vector fields, albeit we do not exclude \emph{a priori} more exotic possibilities, i.e., dark radiation, axions, and so on. Physical implications of our results are analyzed in detail, indicating a statistical preference for the $\Lambda_{\omega_s}$CDM scenario over the conventional $\Lambda$CDM background.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of dark energy and late-time cosmic expansion using the Weighted Function Regression method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent data from multiple supernova catalogs and DESI, when combined with CMB, suggest a non-trivial evolution of dark energy (DE) at the $2.5-4\sigma$ CL. This evidence is typically quantified using the CPL parametrization of the DE equation-of-state parameter which corresponds to a first-order Taylor expansion around $a = 1$. However, this truncation is to some extent arbitrary and may bias our interpretation of the data, potentially leading us to mistake spurious features of the best-fit CPL model for genuine physical properties of DE. In this work, we apply the Weighted Function Regression (WFR) method to eliminate the subjectivity associated with the choice of truncation order. We assign Bayesian weights to the various orders and compute weighted posterior distributions of the quantities of interest. Using this model-agnostic approach, we reconstruct some of the most relevant background quantities, examining the robustness of our results against variations in the CMB and SNIa likelihoods. Furthermore, we extend our analysis by allowing for negative DE. Our results corroborate previous indications of dynamical DE, now confirmed for the first time using the WFR method. The combined analysis of CMB, BAO, and SNIa data favors a DE component that transitions from phantom to quintessence at redshift $z_{\rm cross}\sim 0.4$. The probability of phantom crossing lies between 96.21% and 99.97%, depending on the SNIa data set used, and hence a simple monotonic evolution of the DE density is excluded at the $\sim 2-4\sigma$ CL. Moreover, we find no significant evidence for a negative dark energy density below $z\sim 2.5-3$. Our reconstructions do not address the Hubble tension, yielding values of $H_0$ consistent with the Planck/$\Lambda$CDM range. If SH0ES measurements are not affected by systematic biases, the evidence for dynamical dark energy may need to be reassessed.</description>

      <title>Ultra-Slow-Roll Inflation on the Lattice II: Nonperturbative Curvature Perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building on the recent lattice simulations of ultra-slow-roll (USR) dynamics presented in arXiv:2410.23942, we investigate the role of the nonlinear relation between the inflaton field configuration and the curvature perturbation $\zeta$, the key observable after inflation. Using a nonperturbative $\delta N$ approach applied to the lattice output, we generate fully nonlinear three-dimensional maps of $\zeta$. This calculation captures both the non-Gaussianity arising from the nonlinear mapping between $\phi$ and $\zeta$, and the intrinsic non-Gaussianity generated around Hubble crossing by the nonlinear field dynamics, which is neglected in stochastic approaches. We find that the nonlinear mapping has a profound impact on the statistics, significantly enhancing the positive tail of the $\zeta$ probability distribution, with important implications for observable quantities. A central part of this work is the comparison with the standard perturbative treatment based on a gauge transformation, which allows us to quantify when and how the perturbative picture breaks down as fluctuations grow large. Together with arXiv:2410.23942, this work sets the basis for robust, nonperturbative predictions of primordial black hole production and scalar-induced gravitational wave emission from inflation using lattice simulations.</description>

      <title>InflationEasy: A C++ Lattice Code for Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: InflationEasy is the first lattice code specifically developed for cosmological inflation. It simulates the nonlinear dynamics of a scalar field on a three-dimensional lattice in an expanding FLRW universe, using finite-difference spatial derivatives and a staggered leapfrog integrator for time evolution. Based in part on the well-known LATTICEEASY, it incorporates several improvements tailored to inflationary applications. Among other features, InflationEasy implements a nonperturbative $\delta N$ method to compute the curvature perturbation at the end of inflation $\zeta$ directly from the lattice, enabling fully nonlinear studies of scenarios with large fluctuations or nonperturbative non-Gaussianities. The code supports a broad range of inflationary models, including those relevant for primordial black hole formation, gravitational wave production, and large-scale structure. This makes InflationEasy a versatile and lightweight tool for studying inflationary dynamics beyond the reach of perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>Testing Coasting Cosmologies with Large-Scale Structure Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive analytical expressions for the growth factor, $D(z)$, and density-weighted growth rate, $f\sigma_8(z)$, for coasting cosmologies, in which the scale factor is a linear function of time. We fit the latter to data from redshift space distortion measurements in the redshift range $z&lt;2$ using the \texttt{dynesty} implementation of a nested sampling algorithm. In total, four models are tested: three coasting models with curvature parameters ${k=\{-1, 0, +1\}}$ in $H^2_0c^{-2}$ units, as well as a flat $\Lambda$CDM model. We evaluate each model's consistency with the data by applying an Anderson-Darling test for normality on the normalized residuals. For the coasting models, we obtained ${\Omega_\mathrm{m,0}=\{ 0.206^{+0.073}_{-0.061},\, 0.297^{+0.085}_{-0.073},\, 0.412^{+0.097}_{-0.086}}\}$ and ${\sigma_{8}(z=0)=\{1.071^{+0.213}_{-0.151},\,0.867^{+0.128}_{-0.097},\,0.725^{+0.080}_{-0.065}\}}$. Fitting the $\Lambda$CDM model yielded ${\{\Omega_\mathrm{m,0}=0.286_{-0.047}^{+0.053},\,\sigma_{8}(z=0)= 0.764_{-0.035}^{+0.039}\}}$. All four models are consistent with the data, though coasting models are weakly favored over the $\Lambda$CDM model, with $\log$-Bayes factors of ${\log_{10}{\mathcal{B}} = \{0.197,\, 0.234,\,0.272\}}$. We also examined whether the $S_8$ tension can be resolved by linear expansion restricted to $z&lt;2$. The curve fitting yielded ${S_8=\{0.890^{+0.024}_{-0.024},\,0.865^{+0.024}_{-0.024},\,0.850^{+0.026}_{-0.026}\}}$ for the ${k=\{-1, 0, +1\}}$ coasting models, respectively, resulting in ${\Delta S^\mathrm{Coasting}_8=\{1.94\sigma,\,1.07\sigma,\,0.52\sigma\}}$ discrepancies with the standard $\textit{Planck}$ 2018 value. The tension level was the highest for the $\Lambda$CDM model, as the constraint from our fit is $S_8=0.746^{+0.041}_{-0.039}$, indicating a tension level of ${\Delta S_8^{\Lambda\mathrm{CDM}}=2.00\sigma}$.</description>

      <title>On the prospects of thermalization of axion-SU(2) inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Axion inflation models coupled to a gauge sector via a Chern-Simons term exhibit an array of interesting phenomenology including a chiral gravitational wave spectrum and primordial black hole production. They may also provide a useful mechanism for generating lepton asymmetry. The possibility to embed this class of models in UV-finite theories and their intriguing, testable, signatures make for a compelling candidate for early acceleration. Due to the Chern-Simons coupling, gauge modes may undergo a finite tachyonic growth during which non-linearities become important. Naturally, this raises the question of whether such (self) interactions can lead to thermalization during inflation. We provide a set of conservative criteria for sustained thermalization in an axion-$SU(2)$ model and chart the parameter space of the model accordingly. We find that the cold inflation regime constitutes a very significant fraction of the parameter space. Our analysis accounts for a initially vanishing as well as non-zero gauge field vacuum expectation value (VEV). We also consider the possibility of a dynamically generated VEV.</description>

Abstract: Cosmological constraints derived from weak lensing (WL) surveys are limited by baryonic effects, which suppress the non-linear matter power spectrum on small scales. By combining WL measurements with data from external tracers of the gas around massive structures, it is possible to calibrate baryonic effects and, therefore, obtain more precise cosmological constraints. In this study, we generate mock data for a Stage-IV weak lensing survey such as the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), X-ray gas fractions, and stacked kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) measurements, to jointly constrain cosmological and astrophysical parameters describing baryonic effects (using the Baryon Correction Model - BCM). First, using WL data alone, we quantify the level to which the BCM parameters will need to be constrained to recover the cosmological constraints obtained under the assumption of perfect knowledge of baryonic feedback. We identify the most relevant baryonic parameters and determine that they must be calibrated to a precision of $\sim 10$-$20\%$ to avoid significant degradation of the fiducial WL constraints. We forecast that long-term X-ray data from $\sim 5000$ clusters should be able to reach this threshold for the parameters that characterise the abundance of hot virialised gas. Constraining the distribution of ejected gas presents a greater challenge, however, but we forecast that long-term kSZ data from a CMB-S4-like experiment should achieve the level of precision required for full self-calibration.</description>

      <title>Bayesian and frequentist perspectives agree on dynamical dark energy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Baryon acoustic oscillation data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) show evidence of a deviation from a cosmological constant $\Lambda$ within a Bayesian analysis. In this work, we validate that frequentist constraints from profile likelihoods on the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder parameters $w_0$, $w_a$ are in excellent agreement with the Bayesian constraints when combining with Planck cosmic microwave background, Planck and Atacama Cosmology Telescope lensing, and either Pantheon+ or Dark Energy Survey Y5 supernova data. Further, we assess which datasets drive these constraints by considering the contributions to the $\chi^2$ from the individual datasets. For profile likelihoods of the matter fraction $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$, such an investigation shows internal inconsistencies when assuming $\Lambda$, which are resolved when assuming a $w_0w_a$ dark-energy model. We infer the equations of state $w(z)$ at the pivot redshifts, supporting previous interpretations that current data appears to be more sensitive to the derivative of $w(z)$ rather than a mean offset from $\Lambda$. Thus our frequentist analysis corroborates previous findings on dynamical DE.</description>

      <title>Modeling Gravitational Wave Bias from 3D Power Spectra of Spectroscopic Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a framework for relating gravitational wave (GW) sources to the astrophysical properties of spectroscopic galaxy samples. We show how this can enable using clustering measurements of gravitational wave (GW) sources to infer the relationship between the GW sources and the astrophysical properties of their host galaxies. We accomplish this by creating mock GW catalogs from the spectroscopic Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) DR7 galaxy survey. We populate the GWs using a joint host-galaxy probability function defined over stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR), and metallicity. This probability is modeled as the product of three broken power-law distributions, each with a turnover point motivated by astrophysical processes governing the relation between current-day galaxy properties and BBH mergers, such as galaxy quenching and BBH delay time. Our results show that GW bias is most sensitive to host-galaxy probability dependence on stellar mass, with increases of up to $\sim O (10)\%$ relative to galaxy bias as the stellar mass pivot scale rises. We also find a notable relationship between GW bias and SFR: when the host-galaxy probability favors low-SFR galaxies, the GW bias significantly increases. In contrast, we observe no strong correlation between GW bias and metallicity. These findings suggest that the spatial clustering of GW sources is primarily driven by the stellar mass and SFR of their host galaxies and shows how GW bias measurements can inform models of the host-galaxy probability function.</description>

      <title>Primordial black holes in cosmological simulations: growth prospects for supermassive black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has long been suggested that a fraction of the dark matter in the Universe could exist in the form of primordial black holes (PBHs) that have existed since the radiation dominated era. Recent studies have suggested that these PBHs may be the progenitors to the population of high-redshift, supermassive black holes (SMBHs) observed since the launch of JWST. For the first time, we have included PBHs in cosmological simulations, to test whether PBHs can sink to the center of collapsing halos, locate dense gaseous regions experience significant growth. We tested PBH-to-DM mass ratios of $f_{\rm PBH}$ = $10^{-4}$ and $10^{-3}$, with an initial PBH mass of 1000 M$_\odot$, as inspired by recent observational constraints. We find that at $f_{\rm PBH} = 10^{-3}$, a number of PBHs were able to embed themselves in dense gas and grow to $10^{4}$-$10^{5}$ M$_\odot$ by $z=20$. These intermediate black holes (IMBHs) are possible progenitors to the highest redshift SMBH observations such as GNZ-11 ($10^{6}$ M$_\odot$ by $z=10$), outperforming light seed black hole (BH) growth seen in recent simulations without the need to invoke heavy seeding prescriptions. On the other hand, $f_{\rm PBH} = 10^{-4}$ resulted in no significant BH growth, emphasizing that the ability of PBHs to act as SMBH seeds is sensitive to the true value of $f_{\rm PBH}$ in the Universe, and showing that the $f_{\rm PBH} =10^{-4}-10^{-3}$ boundary marks the threshold above which SMBH seeding via 1000 M$_\odot$ PBHs becomes effective. This is the first step towards building a realistic PBH framework in cosmological simulations.</description>

      <title>Semi-empirical constraints on the HI mass function of star-forming galaxies and $\Omega_{\rm HI}$ at $z\sim 0.37$ from interferometric surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The HI mass function is a crucial tool to understand the evolution of the HI content in galaxies over cosmic times and to constrain both the baryon cycle in galaxy evolution and the reionization history of the Universe. We aim to derive semi-empirical constraints at $z\sim 0.37$ by combining literature results on the stellar mass function from optical surveys with recent findings on the $M_{\rm HI}-M_\star$ scaling relation derived via spectral stacking analysis applied to 21-cm line interferometric data from the MIGHTEE and CHILES surveys, conducted with MeerKAT and the VLA, respectively. We draw synthetic stellar mass samples directly from the publicly-available results underlying the analysis of the COSMOS2020 galaxy photometric sample. Afterwards, we convert $M_\star$ into $M_{\rm HI}$ using analytical fitting functions to the data points from HI stacking. We then fit a Schechter function to the median HIMF from all the samples via MCMC. We finally derive the posterior distribution for $\Omega_{\rm HI}$ by integrating the models for the HIMF built from the posteriors samples of the Schechter parameters. We find evolution of the HIMF at $z\sim 0.37$ with respect to results at $z\sim 0$ from the ALFALFA survey and at $z\sim 1$ from uGMRT data. Our results for $\Omega_{\rm HI}$ are in broad agreement with other literature results, and follow the trend on $\Omega_{\rm HI}$ as a function of redshift. The derived value $\Omega_{\rm HI}=\left(7.02^{+0.59}_{-0.52}\right)\times10^{-4}$ at $z\sim 0.37$ from the combined analysis deviates at $ \sim 2.9\sigma$ from the ALFALFA result at $z\sim 0$. We conclude that the HIMF and $\Omega_{\rm HI}$ constraints that we derive from state-of-the-art deep interferometric surveys suggest an evolution of the HIMF and of the cosmic HI density, supporting a picture of smooth transition of the HI content of galaxies from $z\sim 0$ to $z\sim 1$.</description>

      <title>Unveiling a Population of Strong Galaxy-Galaxy Lensed Faint Dusty Star-Forming Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The measurements of the number density of galaxy-galaxy strong lenses can be used to put statistical constraints on the foreground mass distributions. Dusty galaxies uncovered in submillimeter surveys are particularly useful in this regard because of the large volume probed by these surveys. Previous discoveries of strong galaxy-galaxy lensed dusty galaxies are predominantly the brightest in the sky discovered by Herschel, SPT, and Planck. However, models have also predicted a non-negligible fraction of strong galaxy-galaxy lensed faint dusty galaxies, which were difficult to confirm due to technical difficulties. Utilizing the deepest SCUBA-2 submillimeter survey, STUDIES, in both the COSMOS and the UDS fields, together with a red JWST color selection method, we discover a population of 13 strong galaxy-galaxy lensed faint dusty galaxies. The rich ancillary data allow us to confirm their strongly lensed nature via estimates of redshifts and lens modeling. Our systematic search has allowed us to construct the 450$\mu$m number counts of strongly lensed sources down to the flux levels about an order of magnitude fainter than previous measurements. The measured lensing fractions of $\sim$1% are consistent with predictions from models that also successfully produce the number density of the strong galaxy-galaxy lensed bright dusty galaxies. Future searches from Euclid and Roman are expected to discover orders of magnitude more strongly lensed faint dusty galaxies.</description>

      <title>Phase space and Data analyses of a non-minimally coupled scalar field system with decaying dark energy model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a class of scalar field dark energy models non-minimally coupled to gravity, characterized by a double exponential potential and parameterized coupling {\xi}. First, we study the cosmological dynamics for a recently proposed Q-SC-CDM model. Initially, we choose two distinct values of {\xi}: 0.1 and 0.5. In case of {\xi}=0.1, the evolution of the universe is split up into three different phases: deceleration, acceleration and slow-contraction, and provide Big Crunch Singularity at distant future. However, in case of {\xi}=0.5, the phase of slow-contraction vanishes, correspondingly Big Crunch Singularity is redundant. Second, we perform the phase space analysis for Q-SC-CDM, bring new asymptotic regimes and find stable de-Sitter solution. Finally, fixing {\xi} to two representative values: {\xi} = 0.1 and 0.05, we perform a comprehensive Bayesian analysis using recent late-time cosmological observations, including Cosmic Chronometers (CC), Type Ia Supernovae (Pantheon+ and DES-SN5YR), and Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (DESI DR2) data. Our results demonstrate that both models yield constraints on key cosmological parameters \Omega_{0m}, H_0 and the sound horizon r_d that are consistent with {\Lambda}CDM within 68\% confidence level, yet exhibit mild tension with Pantheon+ measurements. We analyze the evolution of the effective equation of state, showing that the model transitions from a stiff matter phase at high redshift to a dark energy dominated phase with effective equation of state less than -0.5 at late times. Additionally, we employ the Om(z) diagnostic to distinguish our model from {\Lambda}CDM, finding minimal deviation up to redshift z \sim 2. Statistical model comparison using Akaike (AIC) and Bayesian (BIC) Information Criteria reveals moderate support for the model with {\xi} = 0.1, though {\Lambda}CDM remains statistically preferred.</description>

Abstract: We extend the study of the effect of density perturbations to the well known thermal dark matter freeze-out scenario. We find $\sim 10 \, \%$ enhancements in the cross section are required to match onto the observed relic abundance for primordial curvature perturbations $\sim 0.2$ at length scales $\sim 1/$Hubble at freeze-out. Such corrections may be of importance in scenarios in which such perturbations are present and observational signals, such as the indirect detection rate, depend sensitively on the DM mass and freeze-out cross section, e.g. near resonances associated with DM bound states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atomic hydrogen constitutes the gas reservoir from which molecular gas and star formation in galaxies emerges. However, the weakness of the line means it has been difficult to directly detect in all but the very local Universe. Here we present results from the first search using the MeerKAT International Tiered Extragalactic Exploration (MIGHTEE) Survey for high-redshift ($z&gt;0.25$) H{\sc i} emission from individual galaxies. By searching for 21-cm emission centered on the position and redshift of optically-selected emission-line galaxies we overcome difficulties that hinder untargeted searches. We detect 11 galaxies at $z&gt;0.25$, forming the first sample of $z&gt;0.25$ detections with an interferometer, with the highest redshift detection at $z = 0.3841$. We find they have much larger H{\sc i} masses than their low-redshift H{\sc i}-selected counterparts for a given stellar mass. This can be explained by the much larger cosmological volume probed at these high redshifts, and does not require any evolution of the H{\sc i} mass function. We make the first-ever measurement of the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation (bTFr) with H{\sc i} at $z&gt;0.25$ and find consistency with the local bTFr, but with tentative evidence of a flattening in the relation at these redshifts for higher-mass objects. This may signify evolution, in line with predictions from hydrodynamic simulations, or that the molecular gas mass in these high-mass galaxies could be significant. This study paves the way for future studies of H{\sc i} beyond the local Universe, using both searches targeted at known objects and via pure H{\sc i} selection.</description>

      <title>Simulation-Based Inference of the sky-averaged 21-cm signal from CD-EoR with REACH</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14618v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The redshifted 21-cm signal from the Cosmic Dawn and Epoch of Reionization carries invaluable information about the cosmology and astrophysics of the early Universe. Analyzing data from a sky-averaged 21-cm signal experiment requires navigating through an intricate parameter space addressing various factors such as foregrounds, beam uncertainties, ionospheric distortions, and receiver noise for the search of the 21-cm signal. The traditional likelihood-based sampling methods for modeling these effects could become computationally demanding for such complex models, which makes it infeasible to include physically motivated 21-cm signal models in the analysis. Moreover, the inference is driven by the assumed functional form of the likelihood. We demonstrate how Simulation-Based Inference through Truncated Marginal Neural Ratio Estimation (TMNRE) can naturally handle these issues at a reduced computational cost. We estimate the posterior distribution on our model parameters with TMNRE for simulated mock observations, incorporating beam-weighted foregrounds, physically motivated 21-cm signal, and radiometric noise. We find that maximizing information content by analyzing data from multiple time slices and antennas significantly improves the parameter constraints and enhances the exploration of the cosmological signal. We discuss the application of TMNRE for the current configuration of the REACH experiment and demonstrate its potential for exploring new avenues.</description>

      <title>Primordial non-Gaussianity systematics from redshift mismatch with SPHEREx</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03078v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ability to differentiate between different models of inflation through the imprint of primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG) requires stringent constraints on the local PNG parameter $f_{\text{NL}}^{\text{loc}}$. Upcoming data from the large scale structure surveys like \textit{Euclid}, Vera C. Rubin Observatory, and the Spectro-Photometer for the History of the Universe, Epoch of Reionization, and Ices Explorer (SPHEREx) will be instrumental in advancing our understanding of the inflationary epoch. In this context, we present forecasts on PNG with tomographic angular power spectra derived from simulations of SPHEREx. We put forward the effects of redshift bin mismatch of galaxies as a significant source of systematic uncertainty in the estimation of both $f_{\text{NL}}^{\text{loc}}$ and galaxy linear halo bias. We simulate $500$ SPHEREx-like galaxy density fields, and divide the galaxies into redshift bins assuming Gaussian photometric redshift errors. We show that the misclassification of galaxies in redshift bins can result in strong apparent tensions on $f_{\text{NL}}^{\text{loc}}$ up to $\sim 3-6\sigma$ and up to $\sim 9-12\sigma$ on galaxy bias. To address this, we propose a scattering matrix formalism that mitigates bin mismatch of galaxies and enables unbiased estimation of cosmological parameters from tomographic angular clustering measurements.</description>

      <title>Evidence for dynamical dark energy from DESI-DR2 and SN data? A symbolic regression analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10506v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent measurements of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Survey (DESI DR2), combined with data from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and Type Ia supernovae (SNe), challenge the $\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) paradigm. They indicate a potential evolution in the dark energy equation of state (EoS), $w(z)$, as suggested by analyses that employ parametric models. In this paper, we use a model-independent approach known as high performance symbolic regression (PySR) to reconstruct $w(z)$ directly from observational data, allowing us to bypass prior assumptions about the underlying cosmological model. Our findings confirm that the DESI DR2 data alone agree with the $\Lambda$CDM model ($w(z) = -1$) at the redshift range considered. Additionally, when combining DESI data with existing compilations of SN distance measurements, such as Patheon+ and DESY5, we observe no deviation from the $\Lambda$CDM model within $3\sigma$ (C.L.) for the interval of values of present-day matter density parameter $\Omega_m$ and the sound horizon at the drag epoch $r_d$ currently constrained by observational data. Therefore, similarly to the DESI DR1 case, these results suggest that it is still premature to claim statistically significant evidence for a dynamical EoS or deviations from the $\Lambda$CDM model based on the current DESI data in combination with supernova measurements.</description>

Abstract: We develop a machine learning approach to reconstructing the cosmological initial conditions from late-time dark matter halo number density fields in redshift space, with the goal of improving sensitivity to cosmological parameters, and in particular primordial non-Gaussianity. Using an U-Net architecture, our model achieves a cross-correlation accuracy of 44% for scales out to $k = 0.4 \text{ h}/\text{Mpc}$ between reconstructed and true initial conditions of Quijote 1 Gpc$^3$ simulation boxes with an average halo number density of $\bar{n} = 4\times 10^{-4}$ (h/Mpc)$^{3}$ in the tracer field at $z=0$ . We demonstrate that our reconstruction is likely to be optimal for this setup and that it is highly effective at reducing redshift-space distortions. Using a Fisher analysis, we show that reconstruction improves cosmological parameter constraints derived from the power spectrum and bispectrum. By combining the power spectrum monopole, quadrupole, and bispectrum monopole up to $k_{\rm{max}} = 0.52 \text{ h}/\text{Mpc}$, our joint analysis of pre- and post-reconstructed fields from the Quijote simulation suite finds improved marginalized errors on all cosmological parameters. In particular, reconstruction improves constraints on $f_{\rm{NL}}$ by factors of 1.33, 1.88, and 1.57 for local, equilateral, and orthogonal shapes. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of reconstruction in decoupling modes, mitigating redshift-space distortions and maximizing information on cosmology. The results provide important insights into the amount of cosmological information that can be extracted from small scales, and can potentially be used to complement standard analysis of observational data, upon further development.</description>

      <title>Back-Reaction of Super-Hubble Fluctuations, Late Time Tracking and Recent Observational Results</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17395v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Previous studies suggested that the back-reaction of super-Hubble cosmological fluctuations could lead to a dynamical relaxation of the cosmological constant. Moreover, this mechanism appears to be self-regulatory, potentially leading to an oscillatory behavior in the effective dark energy. Such an effect would occur in any cosmological model with super-Hubble matter fluctuations, including the standard $\Lambda\text{CDM}$ model. The recent DESI data, which indicate that dark energy may be dynamical, has renewed interest in exploring scenarios leading to such oscillatory behavior. In this work we propose a parametrization to account for the impact of super-Hubble fluctuations on the background energy density of the Universe. We model the total effective cosmological constant as the sum of a constant piece and an oscillating contribution. We perform a preliminary comparison of the background dynamics of this model with the recent radial BAO data from DESI. We also discuss the status of the $H_0$ tension problem in this model.</description>

      <title>SHAM-OT: Rapid Subhalo Abundance Matching with Optimal Transport</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17553v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Subhalo abundance matching (SHAM) is widely used for connecting galaxies to dark matter haloes. In SHAM, galaxies and (sub-)haloes are sorted according to their mass (or mass proxy) and matched by their rank order. In this work, we show that SHAM is the solution of the optimal transport (OT) problem on empirical distributions (samples or catalogues) for any metric transport cost function. In the limit of large number of samples, it converges to the solution of the OT problem between continuous distributions. We propose SHAM-OT: a formulation of abundance matching where the halo-galaxy relation is obtained as the optimal transport plan between galaxy and halo mass functions. By working directly on these (discretized) functions, SHAM-OT eliminates the need for sampling or sorting and is solved using efficient OT algorithms at negligible compute and memory cost. Scatter in the galaxy-halo relation can be naturally incorporated through regularization of the transport plan. SHAM-OT can easily be generalized to multiple marginal distributions. We validate our method using analytical tests with varying cosmology and luminosity function parameters, and on simulated halo catalogues. The efficiency of SHAM-OT makes it particularly advantageous for Bayesian inference that requires marginalization over stellar mass or luminosity function uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Detection of cosmological dipoles aligned with transverse peculiar velocities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02525v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Peculiar velocities encode rich cosmological information, but their transverse components are hard to measure. Here, we present the first observations of a novel effect of transverse velocities: the dipole signatures that they imprint on the Cosmic Microwave Background. The peculiar velocity field points towards gravitational wells and away from potential hills, reflecting a large-scale dipole in the gravitational potential, coherent over hundreds of Mpc. Analogous dipoles will also exist in all other fields that correlate with the potential. These dipoles are readily observed in projection on the CMB sky via gravitational lensing and the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect -- both of which correlate with transverse peculiar velocities. The large-scale ISW dipole is distinct from the small-scale moving lens effect, which has a dipole of the opposite sign. We provide a unified framework for analysing these velocity-related dipoles and demonstrate how stacking can extract the signal from sky maps of galaxy properties, CMB temperature, and lensing. We show that the CMB dipole signal is independent of galaxy bias, and orthogonal to the usual direction-averaged correlation function, so this new observable provides additional cosmological information. We present the first detections of the dipole signal in (i) galaxy density; (ii) CMB lensing convergence; and (iii) CMB temperature -- interpreted as the ISW effect -- using galaxies from the SDSS-III BOSS survey and CMB maps from Planck. We show that the observed signals are consistent with $\Lambda$CDM predictions, and use the combined lensing and ISW results to set limits on linearised models of modified gravity.</description>

      <title>Constraining the z $\sim$ 1 Initial Mass Function with {\it HST} and {\it JWST} Lensed Stars in MACS J0416.1-2403</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06992v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our understanding of galaxy properties and evolution is contingent on knowing the initial mass function (IMF), and yet to date, the IMF is constrained only to local galaxies. Individual stars are now becoming routinely detected at cosmological distances, where luminous stars such as supergiants in background galaxies strongly lensed by galaxy clusters are temporarily further magnified by huge factors (up to $10^{4}$) by intracluster stars, thus being detected as transients. The detection rate of these events depends on the abundance of luminous stars in the background galaxy and is thus sensitive to the IMF and the star-formation history (SFH), especially for the blue supergiants detected as transients in the rest-frame ultraviolet/optical filters. As a proof of concept, we use simple SFH and IMF models constrained by spectral energy distributions (SEDs) to see how well we can predict the {\it HST} and {\it JWST} transient detection rate in a lensed arc dubbed ``Spock'' ($z = 1.0054$). We find that demanding a simultaneous fit of the SED and the transient detection rate places constraints on the IMF, independent of the assumed simple SFH model. We conclude our likelihood analysis indicates that the data definitively prefers the ``Spock'' galaxy to have a Salpeter IMF ($\alpha = 2.35$) rather than a Top-heavy IMF ($\alpha = 1$) -- which is thought to be the case in the early universe -- with no clear excess of supergiants above the standard IMF.</description>

      <title>Dynamical analysis of stacked samples of asymmetric, non-static, self-gravitating systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19922v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use numerical simulations to explore biases that arise in dynamical estimates of the mean mass profile for a collection of galaxy clusters that have been stacked to make a composite. There are three types of bias. One arises from anisotropy of the kinematic pressure tensor and has been already well studied; a second arises from departures from equilibrium; and a third arises because of heterogeneity of the clusters used, from their individual non-sphericity, and because velocities used are measured with respect to centres that are, in general, accelerating. Here we focus on the latter two. We stack clusters to measure the pressure tensor and density profiles and then estimate the dynamical mass profile using the Jeans equation, and compare to the actual mean mass profile. The main result of this paper is an estimate of the bias, that can be used to correct the dynamical mass estimate, and we show how it depends on the cluster sample selection. We find that Jeans equation typically overestimates the true mass by about 20\% at the virial radius.</description>

      <title>One-loop kernels in scale-dependent Horndeski theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16767v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the nonlinear evolution of cosmological perturbations in theories with scale-dependent perturbation growth, first in general and then focusing on Horndeski gravity. Within the framework of standard perturbation theory, we derive the second- and third-order kernels and show that they are fully determined by two effective functions, $h_1$ and $h_c$, which parametrize deviations from general relativity. Using the Wronskian method, we obtain solutions for the nonlinear growth functions and present explicit expressions for the resulting kernels, including bias and redshift space distortions. We show that the kernels are entirely dependent on the linear growing mode: once this is calculated, the kernels are analytic up to a time integral. Our approach provides a physically motivated framework for evaluating the one-loop galaxy power spectrum in scale-dependent theories, suitable for the forecasts and actual data analysis.</description>

      <title>Refining lower bounds on sterile neutrino dark matter mass from estimates of phase space densities in dwarf galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20585v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) are recognized as being highly dominated by Dark Matter (DM), making them excellent targets for testing DM models through astrophysical observations. One effective method involves estimating the coarse-grained phase-space density (PSD) of the galactic DM component. By comparing this PSD with that of DM particles produced in the early Universe, it is possible to establish lower bounds on the DM particle mass. These constraints are particularly relevant for models of warm DM, such as those involving sterile neutrinos. Utilizing the GravSphere code, we obtain a fit of the DM PSD based on the latest reliable stellar dynamics data for twenty of the darkest dSphs, refining earlier lower bounds on sterile neutrino masses in non-resonant production scenarios. Additionally, we introduce an alternative approach involving the Excess Mass Function (EMF), which yields even tighter constraints. Specifically, using the maximum PSD, we derive a lower bound of $m&gt;1.02\,$keV at 95% confidence level, while the EMF method provides a stronger limit of $m&gt;1.98\,$keV at 95% CL. For the general thermal relic fermion dark matter mass the limits translate into $m&gt;0.28\,$keV and $m&gt;0.49\,$keV, respectively. Both methods are versatile and can be extended to more complex DM production mechanisms in the early Universe. For the first time, we also constrain parameters of models involving non-standard cosmologies during the epoch of neutrino production. Our analysis yields $m&gt;2.54\,$keV for models with kination domination and $m&gt;4.71\,$keV for scenarios with extremely low reheating temperature.</description>

      <title>Deep Neural Networks Hunting Ultra-Light Dark Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04100v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultra-light dark matter (ULDM) is a compelling candidate for cosmological dark matter. If ULDM interacts with ordinary matter, it can induce measurable, characteristic signals in pulsar-timing data because it causes the orbits of pulsars in binary systems to osculate. In this work, we investigate the potential of machine learning (ML) techniques to detect such ULDM signals. To this end, we construct three types of neural networks: an autoencoder, a binary classifier, and a multiclass classifier. We apply these methods to four theoretically well-motivated ULDM models: a linearly coupled scalar field, a quadratically coupled scalar field, a vector field and a tensor field. We show that the sensitivity achieved using ML methods is comparable to that of a semi-analytical Bayesian approach, which to date has only been applied to the linear scalar case. The ML approach is readily applicable to all four ULDM models and, in the case of the multiclass classifier, can distinguish between them. Our results, derived from simulated data, lay the foundation for future applications to real pulsar-timing observations.</description>

      <title>Impact of initial mass function on the chemical evolution of high-redshift galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06139v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Star formation and metal enrichment in galaxies are regulated by supernova (SN) explosions and metal yields from massive stars, which are sensitive to the high-mass end of the initial mass function (IMF). Recent JWST observations found evidence for an invariant relation between stellar mass, metallicity, and star formation rate up to $z\sim 8$ and its breakdown at higher redshifts. It is crucial to understand the underlying physics, especially the role played by the IMF. We explore the impact of IMF on the chemical evolution of high-redshift galaxies and the interplay between IMF and galactic outflow parameters. The ultimate goal is to constrain the high-mass end of the IMF by the cosmic star formation history and stellar mass-metallicity-star formation rate relation (MZSFR) inferred from observations at $z\sim 4-10$. Using the semi-analytical galaxy evolution code A-SLOTH, we follow galactic baryon cycles along merger trees built from a high-resolution cosmological simulation. Stellar feedback is modeled with up-to-date stellar evolution tracks covering the full metallicity range ($Z \sim 10^{-11} - 0.03$) and a broad stellar mass range ($m_\star\sim2 - 600\ \rm M_\odot$) including the metal yields from stellar winds and all types of SNe. Assuming a Kroupa-like shape of the IMF with a varying upper mass limit $m_{\max}$, we find $m_{\max} \gtrsim 200\ \rm M_\odot$ is required to reproduce the observed MZSFR. Observational data at $z\gtrsim 6$ favor a galactic outflow model where the outflow rate is proportional to the supernova energy injection rate divided by the halo binding energy. We conclude that very massive ($\gtrsim 200\ \rm M_\odot$) stars can play important roles in the star formation and chemical enrichment histories of high-$z$ galaxies and discuss the implications of our results for reionization and transient sources of both electromagnetic waves and gravitational waves.</description>
