      <title>Understanding Xe isotopes near $A=130$ through the prolate-oblate shape phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A simple algebraic scheme incorporating the prolate-oblate shape phase transition (SPT) is proposed within the framework of the interacting boson model to describe the quadrupole deformation features of Xe isotopes near $A=130$. The analysis demonstrates that novel $\gamma$-soft modes, characterized by the unusual quadrupole moments $Q(2_1^+)&lt;0$ and $0&lt;Q(2_2^+)\ll |Q(2_1^+)|$, can emerge near the critical point of this SPT. This finding is further applied to interpret the properties of low-lying states in the relevant Xe nuclei, particularly the experimentally observed nearly vanishing spectroscopic quadrupole moment $Q(2_2^+)$, thereby offering new insights into the structure of a $\gamma$-soft deformed nucleus.</description>

      <title>Anomalous collective modes in atomic nuclei within the proton-neutron interacting boson model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Novel collective modes characterized by a $B_{4/2}$ ratio ($\equiv B(E2;4_1^+\rightarrow 2_1^+)/B(E2;2_1^+\rightarrow 0_1^+)$) less than 1.0 that were observed recently have been identified within the proton-neutron interacting boson model (IBM-2) using the consistent-$Q$ Hamiltonian. These modes are shown to give rise to triaxial spectral features, including significant band mixing. The results provide a compelling explanation for the deeply suppressed $B_{4/2}$ ratio observed in $^{166}$W, $^{168,170}$Os, and $^{172}$Pt, offering new insights into the $B(E2)$ anomaly phenomenon in neutron-deficient nuclei.</description>

      <title>Determination of nuclear deformations with an emulator for sub-barrier fusion reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the eigenvector continuation, we construct an emulator for coupled-channels calculations for heavy-ion fusion reactions at energies around the Coulomb barrier. We apply this to the $^{16}$O+$^{144,154}$Sm, $^{186}$W reactions and examine whether the emulator can be used to extract the deformation parameters of the target nuclei. We show that the emulator not only accelerates the calculations but also has an ability to accurately extract the nuclear shapes. This indicates that the emulator provides a powerful tool to systematically explore intrinsic shapes of atomic nuclei, enhancing our understanding of the fundamental properties of nuclear systems.</description>

      <title>Renormalizing Two-Neutron Halo Nuclei Without Neutron-Core Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Effective Field Theory (EFT) proposed by Hongo and Son to describe two-neutron halo nuclei where the neutron-core interaction is subleading. In this EFT, the ratio of the mean-square matter radius and charge radius is universal in so far that it only depends on the two-neutron separation energy of the nucleus and the neutron-neutron scattering length. By investigating the divergence structure of this theory, we find that one further renormalization condition is required to predict both radii separately. Our renormalization scheme uses one of the mean square radii or the scattering amplitude as input. We use Hongo and Son's theory to calculate the matter radii of the two-neutron halo nuclei $^{11}$Li, $^{14}$Be, $^{17}$B, $^{19}$B, and $^{22}$C and compare to the values obtained with standard Halo EFT. In this comparison we use both the physical value of the neutron-core scattering length and rescaled values. We observe good convergence against Hongo and Son's results for the case of a negligible neutron-core interaction. Similar agreement for the radii is also found in the case of the halo nucleus $^6$He, where the $nc$ interaction is in the p-wave. Our renormalization scheme makes the restriction in the ultraviolet cutoff range from the Landau pole explicit. We calculate the position of the Landau pole for various halo nuclei. In all cases the Landau pole restricts the cutoff to rather low values. Finally, we derive an explicit expression for the three-to-three neutron-neutron-core scattering amplitude and discuss its cut structure.</description>

      <title>Dispersive determination of resonances from $\pi\pi$ scattering data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a precise, model- and parametrization-independent dispersive determination of the $f_0(500)$, $\rho(770)$, $f_0(980)$, $f_2(1270)$, $f_0(1370)$, $\rho(1450)$, $f_0(1500)$, and $\rho_3(1690)$ resonance pole parameters. They are obtained from the analytic continuation, by means of continued fractions, of forward dispersion relations, whose input is a recent global dispersive analysis of $\pi \pi$ scattering data. From this dispersive study, we find no indications of other resonant poles below 1.7 GeV. Beyond this energy, we also provide resonance pole parameters from the direct analytic continuation of Global Fits to the three existing incompatible data sets. Depending on the data set we find poles for the $\rho(1700)$, $f_0(1710)$, $\rho(1900)$, $f_2(1950)$, and $f_0(2020)$ resonances. We also present the Argand diagrams of these Global Fits and illustrate that each resonance does not necessarily have to trace a full circle in the diagram.</description>

      <title>System Energies for Pentaquark Family Using Thomas-Fermi Quark Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study calculates the system energies of families of pentaquarks, $uudc\bar{c}$, starting from 5 quarks up to 70 using Thomas-Fermi statistical quark model. The model assumes spherical symmetry with the particles continuously distributed with varying densities and boundaries. The particles interact with Coulombic forces and a discontinuity in the light quark density function is energetically favored. Total energies of the system are calculated for each multiquark system and compared to determine family stability characteristics. A remarkable stability for multiquark combinations with multiples of four pentaquarks, which we term an icosaquark, is identified. The first icosaquark system is found to have lowest energy per quark, suggesting stability of a system consisting of four charm, four anticharm and twelve light quarks.</description>

      <title>Insights into Nucleon Resonances via Continuum Schwinger Function Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09160v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The first baryon resonance was discovered in the early 1950s. The Roper resonance joined the collection ten years later. Today, many baryon resonances are known and more are being discovered. As baryons, these states are the most fundamental three-body systems in Nature. They must all be understood, not just the isolated ground state nucleon. This contribution sketches applications of continuum Schwinger function methods to the baryon resonance problem. Whilst spectroscopy is of value, particular emphasis is placed on resonance electroproduction because transition form factors extracted from electroproduction data provide a keen tool for revealing resonance structure.</description>

      <title>Thermal liquid-gas phase transition in a quasi-one-dimensional dipolar Fermi gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate thermodynamic properties in a quasi-one-dimensional single-component dipolar Fermi gas at finite temperatures. The self-bound fermionic droplet can be achieved by exchange correlations with the long-range dipole-dipole interactions under the quasi-one-dimensional confinement, where the interaction can be tuned by tilting the dipoles along the system coordinate. Using the Hartree-Fock approximation, we show how the liquid-gas phase transition occurs in this system, and elucidate the finite-temperature phase structure consisting of the gas phase, liquid phase, their coexistence, and the spinodal phase. We also discuss its similarity with the liquid-gas phase transition in nuclear matter through the comparison with phenomenological models. Our results would be useful for an interdisciplinary understanding of self-bound fermionic matter as well as an analog quantum simulation of nuclear systems.</description>

      <title>Scattering amplitudes versus potentials in nuclear effective field theory: search for a potential compromise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.08172</link>
      <description>arXiv:1902.08172v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In effective field theory physical quantities, in particular observables, are expressed as a power series in terms of a small expansion parameter. For non-perturbative systems, for instance nuclear physics, this requires the non-perturbative treatment of at least part of the interaction (or the potential, if one is dealing with a non-relativistic system), while the rest of the interaction is included as perturbations. This is not entirely trivial and as a consequence different interpretations on how to treat these systems have appeared. A practical approach is to expand the effective potential, where this potential is later fully iterated in the Schroedinger equation for obtaining amplitudes and observables. The expectation is that this will lead to observables that will have an implicit power counting expansion. Here I explicitly check whether the amplitudes (when expanded according to the counting) are actually following the same power counting as the potential. It happens that reality does not necessarily conform to expectations and the amplitudes will sometimes violate the power counting with which the potential has been expanded. A more formal approach is to formulate the expansion directly in terms of amplitudes and observables, which is the original aim of the effective field theory idea. Yet this second approach is technically complicated. I explore here the possibility of constructing potentials that when fully iterated will make sure that amplitudes are indeed expansible in terms of a small expansion parameter.</description>

      <title>From spin to pseudospin symmetry: The origin of magic numbers in nuclear structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09148v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magic numbers lie at the heart of nuclear structure, reflecting enhanced stability in nuclei with closed shells. While the emergence of magic numbers beyond 20 is commonly attributed to strong spin-orbit coupling, the microscopic origin of the spin-orbit potential remains elusive, owing to its dependence on the resolution scale and renormalization scheme of nuclear forces. Here, we investigate the evolution of shell structure with varying momentum resolution in nuclear interactions derived from chiral effective field theory, using the similarity renormalization group to link different scales. We uncover a novel transition from spin symmetry to pseudospin symmetry as the resolution scale decreases, during which magic numbers emerge naturally. A similar pattern is found in calculations using relativistic one-boson-exchange potentials, underscoring the robustness of the phenomenon. This establishes a direct connection between realistic nuclear forces with a high resolution scale and effective nuclear forces at coarse-grained scales, offering a first-principles explanation for the origin of magic numbers and pseudospin symmetry in nuclear shell structure, and new insights into the structure of exotic nuclei far from stability.</description>

      <title>Probing of EoS with clusters and hypernuclei</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14255v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of the nuclear equation-of-state (EoS) is a one of the primary goals of experimental and theoretical heavy-ion physics. The comparison of recent high statistics data from the STAR Collaboration with transport models provides a unique possibility to address this topic in a yet unexplored energy domain. Employing the microscopic N-body Parton-Hadron-Quantum-Molecular Dynamics (PHQMD) transport approach, which allows to describe the propagation and interactions of hadronic and partonic degrees of freedom including cluster and hyper-nucleus formation and dynamics, we investigate the influence of different EoS on bulk observables, the multiplicity, $p_T$ and rapidity distributions of protons, $\Lambda$s and clusters up to A=4 as well as their influence on the collective flow. We explore three different EoS: two static EoS, dubbed 'soft' and 'hard', which differ in the compressibility modulus, as well as a soft momentum dependent EoS. We find that a soft momentum dependent EoS reproduces most baryon and cluster observables, including the flow observables, quantitatively, however, hard EOS show a similar trend.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13616v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform a comprehensive global QCD analysis of spin-dependent parton distribution functions (PDFs), combining all available data on inclusive and semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering (DIS), as well as inclusive weak boson and jet production in polarized $pp$ collisions, simultaneously extracting spin-averaged PDFs and fragmentation functions. Including recent Jefferson Lab DIS data at high $x$, together with subleading power corrections to the leading twist framework, allows us to verify the stability of the PDFs for $W^2 \geq 4$ GeV$^2$ and quantify the uncertainties on the spin structure functions more reliably. We explore the use of new lattice QCD data on gluonic pseudo Ioffe-time distributions, which, together with jet production and high-$x$ DIS data, improve the constraints on the polarized gluon PDF. The expanded kinematic reach afforded by the data into the high-$x$ region allows us to refine the bounds on higher twist contributions to the spin structure functions, and test the validity of the Bjorken sum rule.</description>

      <title>A NICER view of the 1.4 solar-mass edge-on pulsar PSR J0614-3329</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14883v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Four neutron star radius measurements have already been obtained by modeling the X-ray pulses of rotation-powered millisecond pulsars observed by the Neutron Star Interior Composition ExploreR (NICER). We report here the radius measurement of PSR J0614-3329 employing the same method with NICER and XMM-Newton data using Bayesian Inference. For all different models tested, including one with unrestricted inclination prior, we retrieve very similar non-antipodal hot regions geometries and radii. For the preferred model, we infer an equatorial radius of $R_{\rm eq}=10.29^{+1.01}_{-0.86}\,$km for a mass of $M=1.44^{+0.06}_{-0.07} \, M_{\odot}$ (median values with equal-tailed $68\%$ credible interval), the latter being essentially constrained from radio timing priors obtained by MeerKAT. A more complex model, fitting the data equally well, resulted in a consistent inferred radius. We find that, for all different models, the pulse emission originates from two hot regions, one at the pole and the other at the equator. The resulting radius constraint is consistent with previous X-ray and gravitational wave measurements of neutron stars in the same mass range. Equation of state inferences, including previous NICER and gravitational wave results, slightly soften the equation of state with PSR J0614$-$3329 included and shift the allowed mass-radius region toward lower radii by $\sim 300\,$m, which is compatible with previous analyses to within less than one standard deviation.</description>

      <title>Model-independent determination of nuclear charge radii from Li-like ions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.27427v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that recent advances in QED theory of Li-like ions [V. A. Yerokhin et al., Phys. Rev. A 112, 042801 (2025)] enable determinations of absolute nuclear charge radii for heavy elements. By incorporating constraints derived from electron-scattering data, we obtain radii that are independent of the assumed model of the nuclear charge distribution. Our approach is validated for $^{208}$Pb, a well-studied spherical nucleus, and is then applied to $^{209}$Bi, where low-lying nuclear excitations complicate the interpretation of muonic-atom data.</description>
