      <title>$\K$-Lorentzian and $\K$-CLC Polynomials in Stability Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the class of $\K$-Lorentzian polynomials, a generalization of the distinguished class of Lorentzian polynomials. As shown in \cite{GPlorentzian}, the set of $\K$-Lorentzian polynomials is equivalent to the set of $\K$-completely log-concave (aka $\K$-CLC) forms. Throughout this paper, we interchangeably use the terms $\K$-Lorentzian polynomials for the homogeneous setting and $\K$-CLC polynomials for the non-homogeneous setting. By introducing an alternative definition of $\K$-CLC polynomials through univariate restrictions, we establish that any strictly $\K$-CLC polynomial of degree $d \leq 4$ is Hurwitz-stable polynomial over $\K$. Additionally, we characterize the conditions under which a strictly $\K$-CLC of degree $d \geq 5$ is Hurwitz-stable over $\K$. Furthermore, we associate the largest possible proper cone, denoted by $\K(f,v)$, with a given $\K$-Lorentzian polynomial $f$ in the direction $v \in \inter \K$. Finally, we investigate applications of $\K$-CLC polynomials in the stability analysis of evolution variational inequalities (EVI) dynamical systems governed by differential equations and inequality constraints.</description>

      <title>Bifurcation Analysis of Predator-Prey System using Conformable Fractional Order Discretization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, conformal fractional order discretization [31, 35, 36] is used to analyze bifurcation analysis and stability of a predator-prey system. A continuous model has been discretized into a discrete one while preserving the fractional-order dynamics. This allows us to look more closely at the stability properties of the system and bifurcation phenomena, including period-doubling and Neimark-Sacker bifurcation. Through numerical and theoretical methods, this research investigated how the modification in system parameters affects the overall dynamics, which may have implications for ecological management and conservation strategies.</description>

      <title>Optimal Response for Hyperbolic Systems by the fast adjoint response method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a uniformly hyperbolic system, we consider the problem of finding the optimal infinitesimal perturbation to apply to the system, from a certain set $P$ of feasible ones, to maximally increase the expectation of a given observation function. We perturb the system both by composing with a diffeomorphism near the identity or by adding a deterministic perturbation to the dynamics. In both cases, using the fast adjoint response formula, we show that the linear response operator, which associates the response of the expectation to the perturbation on the dynamics, is bounded in terms of the $C^{1,\alpha}$ norm of the perturbation. Under the assumption that $P$ is a strictly convex, closed subset of a Hilbert space $\cH$ that can be continuously mapped in the space of $C^3$ vector fields on our phase space, we show that there is a unique optimal perturbation in $P$ that maximizes the increase of the given observation function. Furthermore since the response operator is represented by a certain element $v$ of $\cH$, when the feasible set $P$ is the unit ball of $\cH$, the optimal perturbation is $v/||v||_{\cH}$. We also show how to compute the Fourier expansion $v$ in different cases. Our approach can work even on high dimensional systems. We demonstrate our method on numerical examples in dimensions 2, 3, and 21.</description>

      <title>Point-wise doubling indices of measures and its application to bi-Lipschitz classification of Bedford-McMullen carpets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Doubling measure was introduced by Beurling and Ahlfors in 1956 and now it becomes a basic concept in analysis on metric space. In this paper, for a measure which is not doubling, we introduce a notion of point-wise doubling index, and calculate the point-wise doubling indices of uniform Bernoulli measures on Bedford-McMullen carpets. As an application, we show that, except a small class of Bedford-McMullen carpets, if two Bedford-McMullen carpets are bi-Lipschitz equivalent, then they have the same fiber sequence up to a permutation.</description>

      <title>Semi-analytic construction of global transfers between quasi-periodic orbits in the spatial R3BP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider the spatial restricted three-body problem, as a model for the motion of a spacecraft relative to the Sun-Earth system. We focus on the dynamics near the equilibrium point $L_1$, located between the Sun and the Earth. We show that we can transfer the spacecraft from a quasi-periodic orbit that is nearly planar relative to the ecliptic to a quasi-periodic orbit that has large out-of-plane amplitude, at zero energy cost. (In fact, the final orbit has the maximum out-of-plane amplitude that can be obtained through the particular mechanism that we consider. Moreover, the transfer can be made through any prescribed sequence of quasi-periodic orbits in between).
  Our transfer mechanism is based on selecting trajectories homoclinic to a normally hyperbolic invariant manifold (NHIM) near $L_1$, and then gluing them together. We provide several explicit constructions of such transfers, and also develop an algorithm to design trajectories that achieve the \emph{shortest transfer time} for this particular mechanism.
  The change in the out-of-plane amplitude along a homoclic trajectory can be described via the scattering map. We develop a new tool, the `Standard Scattering Map' (SSM), which is a series representation of the exact scattering map. We use the SSM to obtain a complete description of the dynamics along homoclinic trajectories. The SSM can be used in many other situations, from Arnold diffusion problems to transport phenomena in applications.</description>

      <title>Gibbs measures for contact Anosov flows are all exponentially mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we study strong spectral properties of Ruelle transfer operators related to Gibbs measures for contact Anosov flows. As a consequence we establish exponential decay of correlations for H\"older observables with respect to any Gibbs measure. The approach invented in 1997 by Dolgopyat, and further developed in our papers in 2011 and 2023, is substantially enhanced here, allowing to deal with the general case of arbitrary contact Anosov flows and arbitrary Gibbs measures. The results obtained here naturally apply to geodesic flows on compact Riemannian maniflds.
  As is now well-known, the strong spectral estimates for Ruelle operators and well-established techniques lead to exponential decay of correlations for H\"older continuous observables. Other immediate consequences are: (a) existence of a non-zero analytic continuation of the Ruelle zeta function with a pole at the entropy in a vertical strip containing the entropy in its interior; (b) a Prime Orbit Theorem with an exponentially small error.</description>

      <title>Indefinite Descriptive Proximities Inherent in Dynamical Systems. An Axiomatic Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces indefinite proximities inherent in the collection of physical objects found in a dynamical system. Axiomatically, these indefinite proximities lead to a new form of Hausdorff topology, which is indefinite descriptively. The main results in this paper are (1) Every descriptive proximity space on a dynamical system is indefinite (Theorem 1), (2) Every dynamical system has an indefinite descriptive Hausdorff topology (Theorem 3), and (3) The energy of a dynamical system varies with every clock tick (Theorem 4). An application of these results is given in terms of the detection of those portions of a dynamical system that are stable and that have low energy dissipation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given $1\leq p&lt;\infty$, we show that ergodic flows in the $L^p$-space over a $\sigma$-finite measure space generated by strongly continuous semigroups of Dunford-Schwartz operators and modulated by bounded Besicovitch almost periodic functions converge almost uniformly (in Egorov's sense). The corresponding local ergodic theorem is proved with identification of the limit. Then we extend these results to arbitrary fully symmetric spaces, including Orlicz, Lorentz, and Marcinkiewicz spaces.</description>

      <title>Parsings of Stationary Processes, Stopping Times and the Fundamental Pointwise Convergence Theorems of Ergodic Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The idea of a parsing of a stationary process according to a collection of words is introduced, and the basic framework required for the asymptotic analysis of these parsings is presented. We demonstrate how the pointwise ergodic theorem and the Shannon-McMillan-Breiman theorem can be deduced from their respective weaker convergence in probability versions combined with our observations regarding parsings, where the parsings are done according to collections that originate in stopping times tailored for that purpose.</description>

      <title>New Characterization of regional controllability and controllability of deterministic cellular automata via topological and symbolic dynamics notions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents a new characterization of controllability and regional controllability of Deterministic Cellular Automata (CA for short). It focuses on analyzing these problems within the framework of control theory, which have been extensively studied for continuous systems modeled by partial differential equations (PDEs). In the analysis of linear systems, the Kalman rank condition is ubiquitous and has been used to obtain the main results characterizing controllability. The aim of this paper is to highlight new ways to prove the regional controllability and controllability of CA using concepts from symbolic dynamics instead of using the Kalman condition. Necessary and sufficient conditions are given using the notions of chain transitive, chain mixing, trace approximation, transitive SFT and mixing SFT. Finally, we demonstrate that the presence of visibly blocking words implies that the cellular automaton is not controllable.</description>

      <title>Bifurcations and stability of synchronized solutions in the Kuramoto model with uniformly spaced natural frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the classical Kuramoto model (KM) with natural frequencies and its continuum limit (CL), and discuss the existence of synchronized solutions and their bifurcations and stability. We specifically assume that the frequency function is symmetric and linear in the CL, so that the natural frequencies are evenly spaced in the KM. We show that in the KM, $O(2^n)$ one-parameter families of synchronized solutions are born and $O(2^n)$ {saddle-node and} pitchfork bifurcations occur at least, when the node number $n$ is odd and tends to infinity. Moreover, we prove that the family of synchronized solutions obtained in the previous work suffers a saddle-node bifurcation at which its stability changes from asymptotically stable to unstable and the other families of synchronized solutions are unstable in the KM. For the CL, we show that the one-parameter family of synchronized solutions obtained in the previous work is the only continuous one and there exist uncountably many one-parameter families of noncontinuous synchronized solutions and that the former is asymptotically stable and the latter are unstable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a new quasi-shadowing property for any nonuiformly partially hyperbolic set of a $C^{1+\alpha}$ diffeomorphism, which is adaptive to the movement of the pseudo-orbit. Moreover, the quasi-specification property and quasi-closing property are also investigated. As an application of quasi-closing property, we extend Katok's reslut on the growth of periodoc orbits for hyperbolic ergodic measure to any ergodic measure: the number of quasi-periodic points grows exponentially at least the metric entropy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we show that the chain recurrent set of a flow of automorphisms on a connected Lie group coincides with the central subgroup of the flow, if the group is decomposable. Moreover, in the decomposable case, the flow satisfies the restriction property. Furthermore, the restriction of any flow of automorphisms to the connected component of the identity of its central subgroup is chain transitive.</description>

      <title>Gain modulation of actions selection without synaptic relearning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adaptation of behavior requires the brain to change goals in a changing environment. Synaptic learning has demonstrated its effectiveness in changing the probability of selecting actions based on their outcome. In the extreme case, it is vital not to repeat an action to a given goal that led to harmful punishment. The present model proposes a simple neural mechanism of gain modulation that makes possible immediate changes in the probability of selecting a goal after punishment of variable intensity. Results show how gain modulation determine the type of elementary navigation process within the state space of a network of neuronal populations of excitatory neurons regulated by inhibition. Immediately after punishment, the system can avoid the punished populations by going back or by jumping to unpunished populations. This does not require particular credit assignment at the `choice' population but only gain modulation of neurons active at the time of punishment. Gain modulation does not require statistical relearning that may lead to further errors, but can encode memories of past experiences without modification of synaptic efficacies. Therefore, gain modulation can complements synaptic plasticity.</description>

Abstract: This paper extends and generalizes previous works on constructing combinatorial multivector fields from continuous systems (see [10]) and the construction of combinatorial vector fields from data (see [2]) by introducing an optimization based framework for the construction of combinatorial multivector fields from finite vector field data. We address key challenges in convexity, computational complexity and resolution, providing theoretical guarantees and practical methodologies for generating combinatorial representation of the dynamics of our data.</description>

      <title>Modeling COVID-19 spread in the USA using metapopulation SIR models coupled with graph convolutional neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph convolutional neural networks (GCNs) have shown tremendous promise in addressing data-intensive challenges in recent years. In particular, some attempts have been made to improve predictions of Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) models by incorporating human mobility between metapopulations and using graph approaches to estimate corresponding hyperparameters. Recently, researchers have found that a hybrid GCN-SIR approach outperformed existing methodologies when used on the data collected on a precinct level in Japan. In our work, we extend this approach to data collected from the continental US, adjusting for the differing mobility patterns and varying policy responses. We also develop the strategy for real-time continuous estimation of the reproduction number and study the accuracy of model predictions for the overall population as well as individual states. Strengths and limitations of the GCN-SIR approach are discussed as a potential candidate for modeling disease dynamics.</description>

Abstract: Let $X$ be a complex manifold of dimension $k,$ and $(V,\omega)$ be a K\"ahler submanifold of dimension $l$ in $X,$ and $B\Subset V$ be a domain with $\Cc^2$-smooth boundary. Let $T$ be a positive plurisubharmonic current on $X$ such that $T$ satisfies a reasonable approximation condition on $X$ and near $\partial B.$ In our previous work we introduce the concept of the generalized Lelong numbers $\nu_j(T,B)\in\R$ of $T$ along $B$ for $0\leq j\leq l.$ When $l=0,$ $V=B$ is a single point $x,$ $\nu_0(T,B)$ is none other than the classical Lelong number of $T$ at $x.$
  This article has five purposes.
  Firstly, we formulate the notion of the generalized Lelong number of $T$ associated to every closed smooth $(j,j)$-form on $V.$ This concept extends the previous notion of the generalized Lelong numbers. We also establish their basic properties.
  Secondly, we define the horizontal dimension $\hbar$ of such a current $T$ along $B.$ Next, we characterize $\hbar$ in terms of the generalized Lelong numbers. We also establish a Siu's upper-semicontinuity type theorem for the generalized Lelong numbers.
  In their above-mentioned context, Dinh and Sibony introduced some cohomology classes which may be regarded as their analogues of the classical Lelong numbers. Our third objective is to generalize their notion to the broader context where $T$ is (merely) positive pluriharmonic. Moreover, we also establish a formula relating Dinh-Sibony classes and the generalized Lelong numbers.
  Fourthly, we obtain an effective sufficient condition for defining the intersection of $m$ positive closed currents in the sense of Dinh-Sibony's theory of tangent currents on a compact K\"ahler manifold.
  Finally, we establish an effective sufficient condition for the continuity of the above intersection.</description>

      <title>Bowen's Problem 32 and the conjugacy problem for systems with specification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that Rufus Bowen's Problem 32 on the classification of symbolic systems with the specification property does not admit a solution that would use concrete invariants. To this end, we construct a class of symbolic systems with the specification property and show that the conjugacy relation on this class is too complicated to admit such a classification. More generally, we gauge the complexity of the classification problem for symbolic systems with the specification property. Along the way, we also provide answers to two questions related to the classification of pointed systems with the specification property: to a question of Ding and Gu related to the complexity of the classification of pointed Cantor systems with the specification property and to a question of Bruin and Vejnar related to the complexity of the classification of pointed Hilbert cube systems with the specification property.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2103.03211v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using Lavaurs maps and near-parabolic renormalization, we describe the degenerating geometry of external rays for quadratic polynomials when a periodic cycle becomes parabolic. We similarly describe the geometry of parameter rays for the Mandelbrot set near parabolic points. Using this geometric control we establish new bounds on the size of limbs of the Mandelbrot set, providing a quadratic Pommerenke-Levin-Yoccoz inequality in the near-parabolic setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2109.14761v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Some mathematical models of synchronization, such as the Kuramoto model (1975) and its generalizations pioneered by Lohe (2009), are formulated as ordinary differential equations describing populations of particles on Lie groups with locally attractive interactions. We suggest a model of synchronization on Lie groups and present a framework to understand the formation of phase-locked states and their orbital stability. This is a sequel to a previous joint work with Ha and Ko (2017).</description>

Abstract: We consider an intermediate factor situation in two categories: probability measure preserving ergodic theory and compact topological dynamics. In the first we prove a master-key theorem and examine a wide range of applications. In the second we treat the case when one of the systems is distal and then provide some counterexamples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16069v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate algebraic and topological signatures of networks of coupled oscillators. Translating dynamics into a system of algebraic equations enables us to identify classes of network topologies that exhibit unexpected behaviors. Many previous studies focus on synchronization of networks having high connectivity, or of a specific type (e.g. circulant networks). We introduce the Kuramoto ideal; an algebraic analysis of this ideal allows us to identify features beyond synchronization, such as positive dimensional components in the set of potential solutions (e.g. curves instead of points). We prove sufficient conditions on the network structure for such solutions to exist. The points lying on a positive dimensional component of the solution set can never correspond to a linearly stable state. We apply this framework to give a complete analysis of linear stability for all networks on at most eight vertices. Furthermore, we describe a construction of networks on an arbitrary number of vertices having linearly stable states that are not twisted stable states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13228v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the regularity of spectral measures of dynamical systems arising from a translation action on tilings of substitutive nature. The results are inspired in the work of Bufetov and Solomyak, where they established a log-H\"older modulus of continuity of one-dimensional self-similar tiling systems. We generalize this result to higher dimensions in the more general setting of self-affine tilings systems. Further analysis leads to uniform estimates in the whole space of spectral parameters, allowing to deduce logarithmic rates of weak mixing.</description>

      <title>Cartan subalgebras of C*-algebras associated with complex dynamical systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.14860v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a rational function with degree $\geq 2$ and $X$ be its Julia set, its Fatou set, or the Riemann sphere. Suppose that $X$ is not empty. We can regard $R$ as a continuous map from $X$ onto itself. Kajiwara and Watatani showed that in the case that $X$ is the Julia set, $C_0(X)$ is a maximal abelian subalgebra of $\mathcal{O}_R(X)$, where $\mathcal{O}_R(X)$ denotes the C*-algebra associated with the dynamical system $(X,R)$ introduced by them. In this paper, we develop their result and give the equivalent condition for $C_0(X)$ to be a Cartan subalgebra of $\mathcal{O}_R(X)$.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Foundations of Deep Selective State-Space Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19047v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Structured state-space models (SSMs) such as S4, stemming from the seminal work of Gu et al., are gaining popularity as effective approaches for modeling sequential data. Deep SSMs demonstrate outstanding performance across a diverse set of domains, at a reduced training and inference cost compared to attention-based transformers. Recent developments show that if the linear recurrence powering SSMs allows for multiplicative interactions between inputs and hidden states (e.g. GateLoop, Mamba, GLA), then the resulting architecture can surpass in both in accuracy and efficiency attention-powered foundation models trained on text, at scales of billion parameters. In this paper, we give theoretical grounding to this recent finding using tools from Rough Path Theory: we show that when random linear recurrences are equipped with simple input-controlled transitions (selectivity mechanism), then the hidden state is provably a low-dimensional projection of a powerful mathematical object called the signature of the input -- capturing non-linear interactions between tokens at distinct timescales. Our theory not only motivates the success of modern selective state-space models such as Mamba but also provides a solid framework to understand the expressive power of future SSM variants.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06465v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When studying out-of-equilibrium systems, one often excites the dynamics in some degrees of freedom while removing the excitation in others through damping. In order for the system to converge to a statistical steady state, the dynamics must transfer the energy from the excited modes to the dissipative directions. The precise mechanisms underlying this transfer are of particular interest and are the topic of this paper. We explore a class of randomly switched models introduced in [2,3] and provide some of the first results showing that minimal damping is sufficient to stabilize the system in a fluids model.</description>

Abstract: A holomorphic pre-foliation $\mathscr{F}=\mathcal{C}\boxtimes\mathcal{F}$ on $\mathbb{P}^{2}_{\mathbb{C}}$ is the data of a reduced complex projective curve $\mathcal{C}$ of $\mathbb{P}^{2}_{\mathbb{C}}$ and a holomorphic foliation $\mathcal{F}$ on $\mathbb{P}^{2}_{\mathbb{C}}$. When the foliation $\mathcal{F}$ is convex (resp. reduced convex) and the curve $\mathcal{C}$ is invariant by $\mathcal{F}$, we say that the pre-foliation $\mathscr{F}=\mathcal{C}\boxtimes\mathcal{F}$ is convex (resp. reduced convex). We prove that the dual web of a reduced convex pre-foliation on $\mathbb{P}^{2}_{\mathbb{C}}$ is flat. This generalizes our previous result obtained in the case where the associated curve consists only of invariant lines.</description>

      <title>Residual connections provably mitigate oversmoothing in graph neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00762v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable empirical success in processing and representing graph-structured data across various domains. However, a significant challenge known as "oversmoothing" persists, where vertex features become nearly indistinguishable in deep GNNs, severely restricting their expressive power and practical utility. In this work, we analyze the asymptotic oversmoothing rates of deep GNNs with and without residual connections by deriving explicit convergence rates for a normalized vertex similarity measure. Our analytical framework is grounded in the multiplicative ergodic theorem. Furthermore, we demonstrate that adding residual connections effectively mitigates or prevents oversmoothing across several broad families of parameter distributions. The theoretical findings are strongly supported by numerical experiments.</description>
