      <title>Cryogenic Dielectric Metasurface-Integrated Superconducting Nanowire Single-Photon Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past decade, multi-element superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) have emerged as the leading single-photon detection technology due to their exceptional system detection efficiency (SDE), ultrahigh timing precision, negligible dark counts, etc. However, achieving these performances with a \textit{single-element} SNSPD has been an outstanding challenge due to a fundamental trade-off: a large active area is necessary for high SDE, while a smaller area is crucial for higher photon count rates, lower dark counts, and lower jitter. Here, we introduce an all-dielectric cryogenic metalens integrated with a single-element SNSPD to achieve high SDE with a smaller active area. Furthermore, we leverage a bifunctional metalens to demonstrate polarization-resolved photodetection at the telecommunication wavelength theoretically. Integrating multifunctional cryogenic metaurfaces with the state-of-the-art SNSPDs may enable novel capabilities with reduced size, weight, power, cost, and cooling (SWaP-C$^{2}$) requirements.</description>

      <title>Capturing Arbitrary Waveform without Absorption with Synthesis of Complex Frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An arbitrary optical waveform can be synthesized by complex-frequency waves as well as by realfrequency harmonic waves. While single complex-frequency wave with exponentially rising waveform can be perfectly absorbed in lossless structures. Here, we propose that arbitrary waveforms can be captured without any absorption through the synthesis of complex frequencies in a lossless system. The scattering matrix zeros of the system correspond to a set of complex frequencies with exponentially rising waveforms, each of which can be virtually and perfectly absorbed. Thus, an arbitrary waveform, decomposed into these complex frequencies automatically, can be captured without any absorption. Then, in a well-designed coupled cavity system, various waveforms such as exponentially decaying, Gaussian, rectangular, and triangular profiles, are captured with high efficiency. The proposed mechanism has potential applications in enhancing light-matter interactions, optical energy storage, and photonic quantum memory.</description>

      <title>Holistic Information Theory of Spatial Remote Sensing Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To address the non-optimal global design caused by the independent optimization of optical lenses, photodetectors, and computational processing subsystems in traditional remote sensing imaging system design, this paper proposes a holistic information theory for spatial remote sensing imaging. This theory integrates the optoelectronic imaging hardware front end and computational reconstruction back end into a unified framework. It establishes a complete spatial imaging chain information transfer model with the objective of obtaining the required effective information. The paper innovatively proposes a quantifiable Modulation Transfer Function (MTF)-Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) product criterion. It demonstrates that the system information transmission ability is determined by the product of MTF and SNR, and that these parameters can compensate for each other to achieve equivalent information transfer. Validation through a high-resolution Earth observation system case shows that under consistent reconstruction mean square error conditions, increasing time delay integration stages reduces optical aperture size and significantly lowers primary mirror mass. Simulations and physical experiments further indicate that by increasing integration time, low-resolution optical systems achieve reconstructed fidelity comparable to high-resolution systems. This verifies that small-aperture optical systems can achieve equivalent imaging performance by enhancing SNR. This theory has been successfully applied in the design of the Jilin-1 satellite constellation, providing a new paradigm for low-cost high-resolution remote sensing systems.</description>

      <title>Doppler-induced continuous spectral broadening of ultraviolet lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a compact scheme based on ultrafast-rotating phase plates (URPPs) to achieve continuous spectral broadening of ultraviolet lasers. The rapid rotation elements behave as a random oscillator which induces Doppler frequency shift into the ultraviolet lasers. As an example, for a disk-shaped phase plate, with the beam acting on the edge at a radius of 10 cm, a rotation frequency of 1 kHz, and a phase-element size of 10 nm, the continuous spectral broadening reaches 0.07%. Further increasing the rotation speed or reducing the phase-element can lead to greater spectral broadening. When multiple URPPs are arranged in series, the superimposed spatiotemporal modulation further enhances the continuous spectral broadening and achieves more effective speckle smoothing. The scheme is applicable to broadening the independent spectrum of optical frequency combs as well as to the mitigation of laser-plasma instabilities in inertial fusion energy.</description>

      <title>High-Resolution Sensing via Quantum States Discrimination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-resolution sensing plays a significant role in scientific research and industrial production, but the practical implementation is constrained by the physical mechanisms of the sensors. To address the critical limitation, we propose a high-resolution sensing approach based on quantum state discrimination. Distinct from conventional strategies, the proposed approach constructs measurement operators in the orthogonal complement space rather than eigenspace of the eigenstate, thereby notably improving the discriminability among quantum states. Moreover, the experimental results via an optical microcavity demonstrate a potential sensing resolution of 4 $\times$ 10\textsuperscript{-6} \degree C and 18 p$\epsilon$ respectively for temperature and strain, and further verify the feasibility of simultaneous sensing of the two parameters. This work establishs a universal approach for high-resolution sensing, and may be extended to different sensing platforms across various application scenarios.</description>

      <title>Accelerating field decay along nonlocal metasurfaces by suppressing the Norton wave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying the nature of electromagnetic fields of dipole sources over a homogeneous flat ground or impedance surfaces has a long history. In general, at a long distance $r$ from the source, the near-surface field is mostly contributed by the geometrical optics term (describing the radiation pattern), a guided wave, and the higher-order reactive contribution referred to as the Norton wave. In the special case of a perfect magnetic conductor interface, the first two terms vanish, so the residual Norton wave determines the steepest achievable field decay profile of $~r^{-3/2}$ (for a two-dimensional horizontal magnetic dipole). In this letter, we reveal that in the presence of a nonlocal metasurface described by the second-order impedance boundary condition, the field decay can be further accelerated by suppressing the Norton wave (approaching the profiles $r^{-5/2}$ and $r^{-7/2}$ for electric and magnetic fields, respectively). In a proposed practical realization of a nonlocal metasurface, the effect is numerically verified and shown to reduce the edge diffraction effects by 10 dB for the shield diameter of only one wavelength, paving the way toward compact antenna systems.</description>

      <title>Design Guidelines for Plasmon-Enhanced CsSn$_x$Ge$_{1-x}$I$_3$ Perovskite LEDs: A DFT-Informed FDTD Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CsSn$_x$Ge$_{1-x}$I$_3$ as lead-free perovskites are promising for next generation NIR emitting perovskite LEDs due to their tunable bandgaps and stability. However, they suffer from poor light extraction efficiency, and accurate composition-specific optical data for these materials remain scarce. This study presents a DFT-FDTD framework to optimize light extraction via compositional tuning and plasmonic enhancement. First, DFT calculations were performed to obtain composition-specific complex refractive index and extinction coefficient values for $x = 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75$, and $1$. Results show bandgap increased from 1.331 eV for CsSnI$_3$ to 1.927 eV for CsGeI$_3$ with increasing Ge content, while refractive index ranges from 2.2 to 2.6 across compositions. These optical constants were then used as inputs for FDTD simulations of a PeLED structure with optimized Au/SiO$_2$ core-shell nanorods for plasmonic enhancement. A 12.1-fold Purcell enhancement was achieved for CsSn$_{0.25}$Ge$_{0.75}$I$_3$, while light extraction efficiency reached 25% for CsSn$_{0.5}$Ge$_{0.5}$I$_3$. LEE enhancement of 36% was obtained for CsSnI$_3$, and spectral overlap between emitter and plasmon resonance reached 96% for Sn-rich compositions. Design guidelines indicate CsSn$_{0.5}$Ge$_{0.5}$I$_3$ offers optimal balance of extraction efficiency (25%), Purcell enhancement (5.3$\times$), spectral overlap (93%), and oxidation stability for wearable and flexible optoelectronic applications, while CsSn$_{0.25}$Ge$_{0.75}$I$_3$ is recommended for applications prioritizing spontaneous emission rate.</description>

      <title>Fully stabilized 25 GHz frequency comb for frequency calibration of optical spectrum analyzer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical spectrometers are widely used in scientific and industrial applications, and precise frequency calibration is essential for ensuring their reliable performance. Traditionally, spectrometers have been calibrated using reference gas cells or reference lamps. However, such conventional methods are not enough to meet the demands for high accuracy and stability. Although frequency-stabilized lasers offer excellent frequency uncertainty, they provide only a single calibration point at a fixed frequency, which is unsuitable for wide-range spectrometer calibration. In this work, we demonstrate a fully stabilized, high-repetition rate electro-optic frequency comb (EO comb) as an absolute frequency reference providing multiple calibration points over a broad spectral range. Our 25 GHz EO comb provides a broadband spectrum spanning from 189.5 THz to 196 THz (corresponding to 1530 nm to 1582 nm), traceable to a frequency standard with a relative standard uncertainty of 10^-13. The well-defined and evenly spaced comb modes can be spectrally resolved by conventional optical spectrometers, enabling wide-range, high-precision frequency calibration. We directly calibrated a commercial spectrometer by referencing its measured frequency values to our well-defined comb modes, thereby evaluating the frequency error with a standard uncertainty of 20 MHz (or relative standard uncertainty of 10^-7), which is limited by the Type A uncertainty (repeatability) of the spectrometer. The proposed method is simple to implement and provides multiple calibration points referenced to the frequency standards over a broad spectral range. This approach improves both the calibration and performance evaluation of spectrometers, and it contributes to the advancement of optical metrology.</description>

      <title>Enhanced and directional light emission from two-dimensional excitons using Mie voids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling light emission at the nanoscale has important applications in solid-state lighting, displays, and quantum light sources. Achieving this control requires both enhanced local electromagnetic fields to boost emission intensity and engineered radiation patterns to direct photons efficiently. Mie voids, consisting of an air cavity surrounded by a high-index semiconductor, are particularly suited for this purpose because they expose their strongest fields in an accessible region for nearby emitters while supporting resonances that shape directional emission through interference. Here, we demonstrate an all-van der Waals nanophotonic platform that couples excitons in atomically thin WS$_2$ to Mie void resonators formed in WSe$_2$. Guided by electromagnetic simulations, we identify void geometries that maximize photoluminescence through synergistic enhancement of excitation and emission processes. We also develop a two-step fabrication strategy that enables independent control of void diameter and depth, providing a route to systematically tune the optical response. Experimentally, we observe up to a 600-fold increase in photoluminescence intensity from monolayer WS$_2$ placed on individual voids compared to on an unstructured WSe$_2$, along with pronounced out-of-plane beaming of light that yields a forward-to-off-axis enhancement of 2.6 dB. Our results establish Mie voids in van der Waals semiconductors as a new platform for controlling light-matter interactions and realizing compact, directional, and efficient nanoscale light sources.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a perturbative technique for modeling the scattering of light by a nonlinear material. This approach eliminates the need for an iterative algorithm to solve the fully coupled nonlinear problem. We demonstrate its effectiveness in the cases of a nonlinear anisotropic slab and a nonlinear periodic crystal, both illuminated by a plane wave under conical incidence and arbitrary polarization. Quantitative comparisons of the accuracy and computational time with a previously published rigorous model are provided.</description>

      <title>Simulating vacuum birefringence with a diffractive beam propagation code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ninety years after their prediction, quantum vacuum nonlinearities in macroscopic electromagnetic fields still await a direct experimental verification in the laboratory. A particularly promising route towards their first measurement is the collision of counter-propagating laser beams in a pump-probe type experiment. Here, the key challenge is to separate the small quantum vacuum signal at the oscillation frequency of the probe that is mainly emitted in the vicinity of its forward cone from the large probe background. While quantitatively accurate predictions of the associated quantum vacuum signals are available, to date there is no framework that combines these predictions with a diffractive beam propagation code. Such codes are designed to holistically model optical experiments and can reliably account for diffraction and absorption losses of optical devices, like lenses and apertures. The latter inevitably influence and modify both the induced signal and background components prior to their detection in experiment. The present work addresses this topical issue and reports on the first implementation of a quantum vacuum signals emission module in an established diffractive beam propagation toolkit designed for the realistic modelling of optical experiments.</description>

      <title>High-purity amplification of circularly polarized orbital angular momentum modes in an active spun ring-core tapered fiber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structured light, optical fields engineered in their spatial, polarization, or phase degrees of freedom, has become a key resource across advanced communication, sensing, imaging, and quantum technologies. Optical fibers nowadays play an essential role in this landscape, providing stable and scalable platforms for guiding, and amplifying complex modes such as vector and orbital angular momentum (OAM) beams. In this work, we demonstrate an active spun ring-shaped tapered fiber as a gain medium for efficient amplification of OAM modes preserving their modal purity and polarization topology. OAM beams with topological charges l = 1 and l = 2 carrying 60 ps pulses at 15 MHz repetition rate at 1030 nm wavelength are amplified over 1.2 W average power with modal purity over 95%. The spatially resolved measurement of the OAM beam polarization topology revealed small distortion due to the coupling in to neighbour modes. These results demonstrate the high potential of active spun ring-shaped tapered fibers for power scaling of complex beams, preserving their phase and polarization structure simultaneously.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic-enhanced Raman scattering in van der Waals MoOCl2: from Fano resonances to picomolar detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Natural van der Waals (vdW) crystals with hyperbolic dispersion challenge artificial metamaterials but remain confined to the mid-infrared spectrum. The emergence of MoOCl2, a quasi-one-dimensional metal with in-plane hyperbolicity, overcomes this spectral limit, shifting the focus to the practical visible range. Here, utilizing angle-resolved Raman spectroscopy, we uncover a highly anisotropic vibrational response characterized by pronounced Fano resonances and polarization switching, which serve as signatures of strong coupling between phonons and the metallic continuum. Harnessing this interaction, we demonstrate "Hyperbolic-Enhanced Raman" (HypER) scattering, where MoOCl2 provides polarization-tunable enhancement factors exceeding 10^7 and picomolar-level detection down to 100 pM, without any nanostructuring. These results establish MoOCl2 as a simple, air-stable, wafer-compatible platform for visible-range hyperbolic nanophotonics and lithography-free sensing.</description>

      <title>Irreversible thermalization vs reversible dynamics mediated by anomalous correlators: Wave turbulence theory and experiments in optical fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically and experimentally investigate spontaneous self-organization in a conservative (Hamiltonian) turbulent wave system, operating far from thermodynamic equilibrium. Our system is governed by two coherently coupled nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations, describing the polarization evolution of light in a dispersive nonlinear optical fiber. The analysis reveals the emergence of two fundamentally distinct turbulent regimes. In a first regime, the waves undergo a slow, irreversible thermalization process, which is accurately described by the wave turbulence kinetic equation and the associated H-theorem of entropy growth. In stark contrast with this expected irreversible process, we identify a second different regime, where strong phase-correlations spontaneously emerge, giving rise to a fast reversible oscillatory dynamics of the normal correlator and anomalous phase-correlator. Experimental observations confirm the occurrence of both irreversible thermalization and reversible dynamics mediated by the anomalous correlated fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Two-photon light-sheet live imaging at kilohertz frame rate using birefringence-based pulse splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiphoton microscopy is widely used for live imaging. However, its acquisition speed remains limited by fluorophore emission rates and photodamage. To increase the pixel rate of a two-photon microscope beyond a few megahertz (MHz), multi-point parallelized schemes have been proposed. Two-photon (2P) light-sheet microscopy emerges as an effective approach for high-speed multiphoton imaging of live specimens, as it enables parallelized excitation while minimizing the required laser power. However, optimizing the signal-to-photodamage ratio in 2P light-sheet microscopy requires to precisely control the illumination parameters, including both wavelength and pulse frequency. Since conventional femtosecond laser sources generally do not allow independent modulation of these parameters, the development of low-cost, efficient and robust strategies to modulate the temporal excitation profile is essential to fully exploit the advantages of 2P light-sheet microscopy. Here, we introduce a compact pulse splitting scheme that meets these criteria. We used cascaded birefringent crystals to convert each excitation laser pulse into an adjustable sequence of collinear sub-pulses. We demonstrate its effectiveness in optimizing 2P light-sheet imaging of live zebrafish embryos. We analyze the impact of pulse splitting on photobleaching, nonlinear photodamage, and imaging performance. Additionally, we demonstrate high-speed 2P imaging of the beating heart and brain calcium dynamics using red fluorophores in live embryos. We achieve kilohertz imaging frame rate, reaching more than 150 MHz pixel rates with fluorescent signal levels above 10 $photons.pixel^{-1}$ using a laser mean power and a peak intensity in the range of 100 mW and 0.1 $TW.cm^{-2}$ at the sample, respectively. This adjustable pulse-splitting scheme allows full advantage to be taken of light-sheet illumination for fast in vivo 2P imaging.</description>

      <title>A Concept of Two-Point Propagation Field of a Single Photon: A Way to Picometer X-ray Displacement Sensing and Nanometer Resolution 3D X-ray Micro-Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the two-point propagation field (TPPF), a real-valued, phase-sensitive quantity defined as the functional derivative of the single-photon detection probability with respect to an infinitesimal opaque perturbation placed between source and detection slits. The TPPF is analytically derived and shown to exhibit a stable, high-frequency sinusoidal structure (6.7 nm period) near the detection slit. This structure enables shot-noise-limited displacement sensing at ~15 pm precision using routinely available synchrotron fluxes and practical nanofabricated slit/comb geometries, requiring mechanical stability only over the final 0.5 mm. The same principle provides a foundation for future nanometer-resolution 3D X-ray microtomography of bulk samples, potentially resulting in a reduced radiation dose. Two conceptual strategies, a central blocker and off-axis multi-slit arrays, are estimated to lower the required incident fluence by more than one order of magnitude each, yielding combined reductions of two to three orders of magnitude with near-term detector development. The TPPF concept, originally developed in a perturbative study of single-particle propagation, thus bridges fundamental quantum measurement questions with practical high-resolution X-ray metrology and imaging.</description>

      <title>Inverse-Designed Phase Prediction in Digital Lasers Using Deep Learning and Transfer Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital lasers control the laser beam by dynamically updating the phase patterns of the spatial light modulator (SLM) within the laser cavity. Due to the presence of nonlinear effects, such as mode competition and gain saturation in digital laser systems, it is often necessary to rely on specifically manually tailored approach or iteration processes to find suitable loaded phases in Digital lasers. This study proposes a model based on Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGAN) and a modified U-Net architecture, with designed loss functions to inverse design the loaded phases. In this work, we employ deep neural networks to learn the nonlinear effects in simulated L-shape digital lasers, enabling the prediction of SLM-loaded phases for both analytical and non-analytical arbitrary structured light fields. The results demonstrate superior performance on non-analytical light fields compared to the current methods in L-shape Digital lasers. Furthermore, a transfer learning strategy is introduced, allowing knowledge obtained from one class of structured beams to be effectively reused for another, thereby enhancing generalization and improving performance under limited training data. Importantly, this method, the first proposed learning framework for digital lasers, is not limited to the L-shaped digital lasers discussed in this study, providing an efficient alternative for generating structured light in other digital laser systems.</description>

      <title>Spectro-temporal unitary transformations for coherent modulation: design trade-offs and practical considerations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper analyzes the performance of spectro-temporal unitary transforms for coherent optical modulation. Unlike conventional IQ modulation, such transforms are based on a cascade of phase modulators and dispersive elements, so are theoretically lossless and not limited by the bandwidth of the constituent modulators. We analyse the performance limits and design trade-offs of this scheme: estimating how the number of stages, amount of dispersion, modulator bandwidth, symbol block length and electrical signal power impacts the achievable signal-to-distortion ratio (SDR). Importantly, we show that high (&gt;30 dB) SDRs suitable for modern &gt;200 GBd class coherent optical communications are achievable with a low (&lt;6) number of stages and reasonable parameters for driver power, modulator bandwidth and on-chip dispersion. Finally we address the SDR penalties associated with potential phase, amplitude, or dispersion errors, and limited DAC resolution.</description>

      <title>Comparing Homodyne and Heterodyne Tomography of Quantum States of Light</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Gaussian quantum states are critical resources in photonic quantum information processing, rendering their generation and characterization of increasing importance in quantum optics. In this work, we theoretically and numerically analyze the relative efficiency of homodyne versus heterodyne measurements for reconstructing non-Gaussian states, a major outstanding question in continuous-variable tomography. Combining a Fisher information-based formalism with simulated experiments, we find homodyne tomography to outperform heterodyne measurements for all non-Gaussian states tested, although the separation between the two modalities proves significantly narrower than suggested by the asymptotic Cramer-Rao lower bound. Our results should find use for optimizing measurement strategies in practical continuous-variable quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Attosecond Control of Squeezed Light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Squeezed light has revolutionized quantum metrology by enhancing interferometry for sensitive applications such as the detection of gravitational waves. Squeezed light has also played a pivotal role in quantum information science with numerous applications in quantum computing and communication. Previously, squeezed light has been primarily generated using nonlinear optical interactions, where control of the degree of squeezing was possible by tuning the nonlinearity of the generating medium using suitable material engineering. Here, we modulate the third-order nonlinear response in dielectrics with strong ultrafast laser fields to control the degree of squeezing on attosecond time scales. We demonstrate the ability to change the ultrafast squeezed light generated in the nonlinear process from amplitude-squeezed to phase-squeezed by controlling the strong-field-driven nonlinear response of the material through a sub-cycle phase delay between the input femtosecond laser pulses. The squeezing of quantum noise is measured using a frequency-resolved balanced homodyne detection scheme capable of extracting the field quadratures in different frequency modes simultaneously. Using this frequency-resolved measurement we extract the complete coherency matrix containing the quantum correlations between field quadratures across different frequency modes of the femtosecond squeezed light pulse. These results have major implications for the development of quantum light sources with unprecedented levels of control over quadrature squeezing, for applications in multimode quantum information processing, and for measuring transient quantum matter correlations via transduction to quantum field correlations in an ultrafast light-matter interaction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fully connected quantum networks enable simultaneously connecting every user to every other user and are the most versatile and robust networking architecture. However, the scalability of such networks remains great challenge for practical applications. Here we construct a large-scale fully connected quantum network founded on two-photon Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interference, where user-to-user security is guaranteed even with untrusted network provider. Using integrated soliton microcomb (SMC) and photonic encoding chips, we realize precise massive parallel frequency generation and locking, high-visibility HOM interferences and measurement-device-independent (MDI) quantum key distribution. The proposed architecture enables a 200-user fully connected quantum network over 200 kilometers with strict information-theoretic security via untrusted network provider. The implemented networking architecture paves the way for realizing large-scale fully connected MDI quantum networks across metropolitan and intercity regions.</description>

      <title>Quantitative phase nano-imaging with a laboratory source</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Investigating the structure of matter at the nanoscale non destructively is a key capability enabled by X-ray imaging. One of the most powerful nano-imaging methods is X-ray ptychography, a coherent diffraction imaging technique that has become the go-to method at synchrotron facilities for applications ranging from brain imaging to battery materials. However, the requirements in terms of X-ray beam quality have limited its use to large synchrotron facilities and, to date, only one attempt has been made to translate the technique to a small-scale laboratory. To unleash the power of this technique to the broad user community of laboratory X-ray sources, there are outstanding questions to answer including whether the quantitativeness of the information is preserved in a laboratory despite the drastic decrease in X-ray flux of several orders of magnitude, with respect to synchrotron instruments. In this study not only we demonstrate that the quantitativeness of X-ray ptychography is preserved in a laboratory setting, but we also apply the method to the imaging of a brain tissue phantom. Finally, we describe the current challenges and limitations, and we set the basis for further development and future directions of quantitative nano-imaging with laboratory X-ray sources.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Picosecond-Precision Synchronization in Measurement-Device-Independent Quantum Key Distribution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (MDI-QKD) eliminates detector side-channel attacks by relocating all measurements to an untrusted intermediate node. However, its practical implementation critically relies on picosecond-level temporal synchronization between spatially separated users. In this work, we present a physically motivated autonomous synchronization algorithm for fiber-based MDI-QKD networks that does not require auxiliary optical channels or shared clock references. The method exploits round-trip optical pulse propagation and statistical signal detection in the presence of Gaussian noise. We derive analytical expressions for false-alarm probabilities, quantify detection reliability, and demonstrate through numerical modeling that synchronization accuracy better than 10~ps is achievable for channel lengths up to 100~km with realistic optical power levels. The proposed approach improves the scalability and robustness of MDI-QKD architectures and is directly applicable to metropolitan and backbone quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Systematic search of laser and phase modulation noise coupling in heterodyne interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heterodyne interferometry for precision science often comes with an optical phase modulation, for example, for intersatellite clock noise transfer for gravitational wave (GW) detectors in space, exemplified by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). The phase modulation potentially causes various noise couplings to the final phase extraction of heterodyne beatnotes by a phasemeter. In this paper, in the format of space-based GW detectors, we establish an analytical framework to systematically search for the coupling of various noises from the heterodyne and modulation frequency bands, which are relatively unexplored so far. In addition to the noise caused by the phase modulation, the high-frequency laser phase noise is also discussed in the same framework. The analytical result is also compared with a numerical experiment to confirm that our framework successfully captures the major noise couplings. We also demonstrate a use case of this study by taking the LISA-like parameters as an example, which enables us to derive requirements on the level of the laser and phase modulation noises in the high frequency regimes.</description>

      <title>Quantum Quasinormal Mode Theory for Dissipative Nano-Optics and Magnetodielectric Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics</title>

Abstract: The unprecedented pace of evolution in nanoscale architectures for cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED) has posed crucial challenges for theory, where the quantum dynamics arising from the non-perturbative dressing of matter by cavity electric and magnetic fields, as well as the fundamentally non-hermitian character of the system are to be treated without significant approximation. The lossy electromagnetic resonances of photonic, plasmonic or magnonic nanostructures are described as quasinormal modes (QNMs), whose properties and interactions with quantum emitters and spin qubits are central to the understanding of dissipative nano-optics and magnetodielectric cQED. Despite recent advancements toward a fully quantum framework for QNMs, a general and universally accepted approach to QNM quantization for arbitrary linear media remains elusive. In this work, we introduce a unified theoretical framework, based on macroscopic QED and complex coordinate transformations, that achieves QNM quantization for a wide class of spatially inhomogeneous, dissipative (with possible gain components) and dispersive, linear, magnetodielectric resonators. The complex coordinate transformations equivalently convert the radiative losses into non-radiative material dissipation, and via a suitable transformation that reflects all the losses of the resonator, we define creation and annihilation operators that allow the construction of modal Fock states for the joint excitations of field-dressed matter. By directly addressing the intricacies of modal loss in a fully quantum theory of magnetodielectric cQED, our approach enables the exploration of modern, quantum nano-optical experiments utilizing dielectric, plasmonic, magnetic or hybrid cQED architectures, and paves the way towards a rigorous assessment of room-temperature quantum nanophotonic technologies without recourse to ad hoc quantization schemes.</description>

      <title>All-Optical Photonic Crystal Bolometer with Ultra-Low Heat Capacity for Scalable Thermal Imaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22006v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-speed thermal imaging in the long-wave infrared (LWIR) is critical for applications from autonomous navigation to medical screening, yet existing uncooled detectors are fundamentally constrained. Resistive bolometers are limited by electronic noise and the parasitic thermal load of wired readouts, while state-of-the-art nanomechanical resonators typically rely on vacuum packaging to maintain the mechanical $Q$ needed for sensitivity. Here, we introduce and demonstrate an uncooled thermal detector that addresses these challenges via an all-optical transduction mechanism. The heterogeneously integrated pixel is engineered for minimal thermal mass, combining pyrolytic carbon absorbers for broadband LWIR absorption, hollow zirconia structures for ultra-low-conductance thermal isolation, and a silicon photonic crystal cavity that serves as a high-$Q$ optical thermometer. Operating at ambient temperature and pressure, we measure a specific detectivity of $1.1\times10^{7}$ Jones and a thermal time constant of $27~\mu \mathrm{s}$, corresponding to a speed that surpasses typical high-sensitivity uncooled technologies by an order of magnitude. Based on this detectivity measurement, which is limited by the noise floor of the external optical detection electronics, a physics-based model predicts a $&gt;25\text{-fold}$ performance enhancement to its fundamental thermorefractive-noise-limited value ($3\times10^{8}$ Jones). The optical readout remains functional across ambient and vacuum environments. We expect this architecture to provide a general route toward scalable, high-performance thermal imaging systems.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic readout of chiral photonic topology in a single-cavity spin-orbit-coupled Bose-Einstein condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08662v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological photonic phases are typically identified through band reconstruction, steady-state transmission, or real-space imaging of edge modes. In this work, we present a framework for spectroscopic readout of chiral photonic topology in a single driven optical cavity containing a spin-orbit-coupled Bose-Einstein condensate. We demonstrate that the cavity transmission power spectral density provides a direct and measurable proxy for a momentum- and frequency-resolved photonic Chern marker, enabling topological characteristics to be inferred from spectral data without the need for bulk-band tomography. In the loss-dominated regime, where cavity decay exceeds atomic dissipation, the power spectral density exhibits Dirac-like gapped hybrid modes with a vanishing Chern marker, indicating a trivial phase. When the dissipation imbalance is reversed, a bright, gap-spanning spectral ridge emerges, co-localized with peaks in both the Chern marker and Berry curvature. The complex spectrum reveals parity-time symmetric coalescences and gain-loss bifurcations, marking exceptional points and enabling chiral, gap-traversing transport. By linking noise spectroscopy to geometric and non-Hermitian topology in a minimal cavity-QED architecture, this work provides a framework for spectroscopic detection of topological order in driven quantum systems. This approach offers a pathway to compact, tunable topological photonics across a broad range of light-matter platforms, providing a method for the study and control of topological phases in hybrid quantum systems.</description>
