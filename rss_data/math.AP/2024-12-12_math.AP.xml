      <title>Interior regularity of some weighted quasi-linear equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we study the quasi-linear equation \[ \left\{ \begin{aligned} \mathrm{div}\, \mathcal A(x,u,\nabla u)&amp;=\mathcal B(x,u,\nabla u)&amp;&amp;\text{in }\Omega,\\ u\in H^{1,p}_{loc}&amp;(\Omega;wdx) \end{aligned} \right. \] where $\mathcal A$ and $\mathcal B$ are functions satisfying $\mathcal A(x,u,\nabla u)\sim \mathcal B(x,u,\nabla u)\sim w(|\nabla u|^{p-2}\nabla u+|u|^{p-2}u)$ for $p&gt;1$ and a $p$-admissible weight function $w$.
  We establish interior regularity results of weak solutions and use those results to obtain point-wise asymptotic estimates for solutions to \[ \left\{ \begin{aligned} -\mathrm{div}\,(w|\nabla u|^{p-2}\nabla u)&amp;=w|u|^{q-2}u&amp;&amp;\text{in }\Omega,\\ u\in D^{1,p}&amp;(\Omega,wdx) \end{aligned} \right. \] for a critical exponent $q&gt;p$ in the sense of Sobolev.</description>

      <title>On the elliptic sinh-Gordon equation with integrable boundary conditions II -- Baker-Akhiezer theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study finite-type solutions of the elliptic sinh-Gordon equation along the strip $\Bbb{R}\times[0,L]$ with Durham conditions on each boundary component. We determine necessary rationality criteria for these conditions to be satisfied on both components. These rationality criteria are analogous to the necessary and sufficient criteria for finite-type solutions to be periodic. However, in contrast to the periodic case, they are not in themselves sufficient for Durham conditions to be satisfied on both boundary components: certain additional criteria must also be satisfied at 4 specific points of the spectral curve. Nevertheless, in the special case where the Durham conditions imposed on the two boundary components are complementary to one another in a sense that we will clarify, these rationality criteria are, indeed, sufficient. This study is a necessary preliminary for any general construction of finite-type solutions of the elliptic sinh-Gordon equation subject to Durham boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Spectral multipliers on M\'etivier groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove an $L^p$-spectral multiplier theorem under the sharp regularity condition $s &gt; d\left|1/p - 1/2\right|$ for sub-Laplacians on M\'etivier groups. The proof is based on a restriction type estimate which, at first sight, seems to be suboptimal for proving sharp spectral multiplier results, but turns out to be surprisingly effective. This is achieved by exploiting the structural property that for any M\'etivier group the first layer of any stratification of its Lie algebra is typically much larger than the second layer, a phenomenon closely related to Radon-Hurwitz numbers.</description>

      <title>On equations of continuity and transport type on metric graphs and fractals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study first order equations of continuity and transport type on metric spaces of martingale dimension one, including finite metric graphs, p.c.f. self-similar sets and classical Sierpi\'nski carpets. On such spaces solutions of the continuity equation in the weak sense are generally non-unique. We use semigroup theory to prove a well-posedness result for divergence free vector fields and under suitable loop and boundary conditions. It is the first well-posedness result for first order equations with scalar valued solutions on fractal spaces. A key tool is the concept of boundary quadruples recently introduced by Arendt, Chalendar and Eymard. To exploit it, we prove a new domain characterization for the relevant first order operator and a novel integration by parts formula, which takes into account the given vector field and the loop structure of the space. We provide additional results on duality and on metric graph approximations in the case of periodic boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>A priori estimates and moving plane method for a class of Grushin equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study three kinds of nonlinear degenerate elliptic equations containing the Grushin operator. First, we prove radial symmetry and a decay rate at infinity of solutions to such a Grushin equation by using the moving plane method in combination with suitable integral inequalities. Applying similar methods, we obtain nonexistence results for solutions to a second type of Grushin equation in Euclidean space and in half space, respectively. Finally, we derive a priori estimates for positive solutions to more general types of Grushin equations by employing blow up analysis.</description>

      <title>Point Source Identification in Subdiffusion from A Posteriori Internal Measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we investigate an inverse problem of recovering point sources and their time-dependent strengths from {a posteriori} partial internal measurements in a subdiffusion model which involves a Caputo fractional derivative in time and a general second-order elliptic operator in space. We establish the well-posedness of the direct problem in the sense of transposition and improved local regularity. Using classical unique continuation of the subdiffusion model and improved local solution regularity, we prove the uniqueness of simultaneously recovering the locations of point sources, time-dependent strengths and initial condition for both one- and multi-dimensional cases. Moreover, in the one-dimensional case, the elliptic operator can have time-dependent coefficients. These results extend existing studies on point source identification for parabolic type problems. Additionally we present several numerical experiments to show the feasibility of numerical reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Decay of solutions to one-dimensional inhomogeneous nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the decay estimates of global solutions for a class of one-dimensional inhomogeneous nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations. While most existing results focus on spatial dimensions $d\geq2$, the decay properties in one dimension remain less explored due to the absence of effective Morawetz inequalities. For equations without external potential, by establishing a localized Virial-Morawetz identity, we derive decay estimates in the context of the $L^r$-norm for global solutions within a compact domain as a time subsequence approaches infinity. This decay result can be applied to obtain a criterion for energy scattering. Additionally, by establishing another type of Virial-Morawetz identity under more strict conditions, we demonstrate the decay result for odd solutions for any time sequence that approaches infinity. Utilizing some results about bound states proved by Barry Simon, we also show that similar decay results hold for the global odd solutions of equations with suitable external potentials that contain inverse power type and Yukawa-type potentials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we prove that the nonlinear Kawahara equation on the periodic domain \(\mathbb{T}\) (the unit circle in the plane) is globally approximately controllable in \(H^s(\mathbb{T})\) for \(s \in \mathbb{N}\), at any time \(T &gt; 0\), using a two-dimensional control force. The proof is based on the Agrachev-Sarychev approach in geometric control theory.</description>

      <title>$L^p$-Sobolev inequalities on Euclidean submanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper is devoted to prove Allard-Michael-Simon-type $L^p$-Sobolev $(p&gt;1)$ inequalities with explicit constants on Euclidean submanifolds of any codimension. Such inequalities contain, beside the Dirichlet $p$-energy, a term involving the mean curvature of the submanifold. Our results require separate discussions for the cases $p\geq 2$ and $1&lt;p&lt;2$, respectively; in particular, for $p\geq 2$, the coefficient in front of the Dirichlet $p$-energy is asymptotically sharp and codimension-free. Our argument is based on optimal mass transport theory on Euclidean submanifolds and it also provides an alternative, unified proof of the recent isoperimetric inequalities of Brendle (J. Amer. Math. Soc., 2021) and Brendle and Eichmair (Notices Amer. Math. Soc., 2024).</description>

      <title>Existence of solutions to a quasilinear nonlocal PDE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new class of quasilinear operators, which represents a nonlocal version of the operator studied by Stuart and Zhou [1], inspired by models in nonlinear optics. We will study the existence of at least one or two solutions in the cone $X=\{u\in H^s_0(\Omega): u\geq 0\}$ using variational methods. For this purpose, we analyze two scenarios: the asymptotic sublinear and linear growth cases for the reaction term. Additionally, in the sublinear case, we establish a nonexistence result.</description>

      <title>On Inverse Problems for Mean Field Games with Common Noise via Carleman Estimate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study two kinds of inverse problems for Mean Field Games (MFGs) with common noise. Our focus is on MFGs described by a coupled system of stochastic Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman and Fokker-Planck equations. Firstly, we establish the Lipschitz and H\"older stability for determining the solutions of a coupled system of stochastic Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman and Fokker-Planck equations based on terminal observation of the density function. Secondly, we derive a uniqueness theorem for an inverse source problem related to the system under consideration. The main tools to establish those results are two new Carleman estimates.</description>

      <title>Orbital stability of normalized ground states for critical Choquard equation with potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the existence of ground state standing waves and orbital stability, of prescribed mass, for the nonlinear critical Choquard equation \begin{equation*}
  \left\{\begin{array}{l} i \partial_t u+\Delta u -V(x)u+(I_{\alpha}\ast|u|^{q})|u|^{q-2}u+(I_{\alpha}\ast|u|^{2_{\alpha}^*})|u|^{2_{\alpha}^*-2}u=0,\ (x, t) \in \mathbb{R}^d \times \mathbb{R}, \\ \left.u\right|_{t=0}=\varphi \in H ^1(\mathbb{R}^d), \end{array}\right. \end{equation*} where $I_{\alpha}$ is a Riesz potential of order $\alpha\in(0,d),\ d\geq3,\ 2_{\alpha}^*=\frac{2d-\alpha}{d-2}$ is the upper critical exponent due to Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequality, $\frac{2d-\alpha}{d}&lt;q&lt;\frac{2d-\alpha+2}{d}$. Under appropriate potential conditions, we obtain new Strichartz estimates and construct the new space to get orbital stability of normalized ground state. To our best knowledge, this is the first orbital stability result for this model. Our method is also applicable to other mixed nonlinear equations with potential.</description>

      <title>Dissipation for codimension 1 singular structures to incompressible Euler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider weak solutions to the incompressible Euler equations. It is shown that energy conservation holds in any Onsager critical class in which smooth functions are dense. The argument is independent of the specific critical regularity and the underling PDE. This groups several energy conservation results and it suggests that critical spaces where smooth functions are dense are not at all different from subcritical ones, although possessing the "minimal" regularity index. Then, we study properties of the dissipation $D$ in the case of bounded solutions that are allowed to jump on $\mathcal{H}^d$-rectifiable space-time sets $\Sigma$, which are the natural dissipative regions in the compressible setting. As soon as both the velocity and the pressure posses traces on $\Sigma$, it is shown that $\Sigma$ is $D$-negligible. The argument makes the role of the incompressibility very apparent, and it prevents dissipation on codimension 1 sets even if they happen to be densely distributed. As a corollary, we deduce energy conservation for bounded solutions of "special bounded deformation", providing the first energy conservation criterion in a critical class where only an assumption on the "longitudinal" increment is made, while the energy flux does not vanish for kinematic reasons.</description>

      <title>Spatial segregation across travelling fronts in individual-based and continuum models for the growth of heterogeneous cell populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a partial differential equation model for the growth of heterogeneous cell populations subdivided into multiple distinct discrete phenotypes. In this model, cells preferentially move towards regions where they feel less compressed, and thus their movement occurs down the gradient of the cellular pressure, which is defined as a weighted sum of the densities (i.e. the volume fractions) of cells with different phenotypes. To translate into mathematical terms the idea that cells with distinct phenotypes have different morphological and mechanical properties, both the cell mobility and the weighted amount the cells contribute to the cellular pressure vary with their phenotype. We formally derive this model as the continuum limit of an on-lattice individual-based model, where cells are represented as single agents undergoing a branching biased random walk corresponding to phenotype-dependent and pressure-regulated cell division, death, and movement. Then, we study travelling wave solutions whereby cells with different phenotypes are spatially segregated across the invading front. Finally, we report on numerical simulations of the two models, demonstrating excellent agreement between them and the travelling wave analysis. The results presented here indicate that inter-cellular variability in mobility can provide the substrate for the emergence of spatial segregation across invading cell fronts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an {\em implementable} numerical scheme for the discretization of linear-quadratic optimal control problems involving SDEs in higher dimensions with {\em control constraint}. For time discretization, we employ the implicit Euler scheme, deriving discrete optimality conditions that involve time discretization of a backward stochastic differential equations. We develop a recursive formula to compute conditional expectations in the time discretization of the BSDE whose computation otherwise is the most computationally demanding step. Additionally, we present the error analysis for the rate of convergence. We provide numerical examples to demonstrate the efficiency of our scheme in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Existence and Non-Uniqueness of Ergodic Leray-Hopf Solutions to the Stochastic Power-Law Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study long time behavior of shear-thinning fluid flows in $d \geq 3$ dimensions, driven by additive stochastic forcing of trace class, with power-law indices ranging from $1$ to $ \frac{2d}{d+2}$. We particularly focus on Leray-Hopf solutions, i.e. on analytically weak solutions satisfying energy inequality. Introducing a new kind of energy related functional into the technique of convex integration enables the construction of infinitely many such solutions that are probabilistically strong for a certain initial value. Furthermore, we provide global i time estimates which lead to the existence of infinitely many stationary and even ergodic Leray--Hopf solutions. These results represent the first construction of Leray-Hopf solutions in the framework of stochastic shear-thinning fluids within this range of power-law indices.</description>

      <title>On growth of Sobolev norms for periodic nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger and generalised Korteweg-de Vries equations under critical Gibbs dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove logarithmic growth bounds on Sobolev norms of the focusing mass-critical NLS and gKdV equations on the torus, which hold almost surely under the focusing Gibbs measure with optimal mass threshold constructed by Oh, Sosoe, and Tolomeo. More precisely, we will establish almost sure growth bounds for solutions $u(t)$ of the equations of the form \[ \sup_{t \in [-T,T]} \lVert u(t) \rVert_{H^s(\mathbb{T})} \lesssim_{s, u_0} \log(2+T)\] with initial data $u_0 \in H^s(\mathbb{T})$ for $s&lt; \frac{1}{2}$. The proof uses a generalisation of Bourgain's invariant measure argument for measures in a suitable Orlicz space.</description>

      <title>Graph convolutional networks enable fast hemorrhagic stroke monitoring with electrical impedance tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Objective: To develop a fast image reconstruction method for stroke monitoring with electrical impedance tomography with image quality comparable to computationally expensive nonlinear model-based methods. Methods: A post-processing approach with graph convolutional networks is employed. Utilizing the flexibility of the graph setting, a graph U-net is trained on linear difference reconstructions from 2D simulated stroke data and applied to fully 3D images from realistic simulated and experimental data. An additional network, trained on 3D vs. 2D images, is also considered for comparison. Results: Post-processing the linear difference reconstructions through the graph U-net significantly improved the image quality, resulting in images comparable to, or better than, the time-intensive nonlinear reconstruction method (a few minutes vs. several hours). Conclusion: Pairing a fast reconstruction method, such as linear difference imaging, with post-processing through a graph U-net provided significant improvements, at a negligible computational cost. Training in the graph framework vs classic pixel-based setting (CNN) allowed the ability to train on 2D cross-sectional images and process 3D volumes providing a nearly 50x savings in data simulation costs with no noticeable loss in quality. Significance: The proposed approach of post-processing a linear difference reconstruction with the graph U-net could be a feasible approach for on-line monitoring of hemorrhagic stroke.</description>

Abstract: We study the weighted constant scalar curvature K\"ahler equations on mildly singular K\"ahler varieties. Under an assumption on the existence of certain resolution of singularities, we prove the existence of singular weighted constant scalar curvature K\"ahler metrics when the weighted Mabuchi functional is coercive. This extends the work of Chen and Cheng to the singular weighted setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study positive solutions to the CR Yamabe equation in noncompact $(2n+1)$-dimensional Sasakian manifolds with nonnegative curvature. In particular, we show that the Heisenberg group $\mathbb{H}^1$ is the only (complete) Sasakian space with nonnegative Tanaka-Webster scalar curvature admitting a (nontrivial) positive solution. Moreover, under some natural assumptions, we prove this strong rigidity result in higher dimensions, extending the celebrated Jerison-Lee's result to curved manifolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.06006v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: On a $2m$-dimensional closed manifold we investigate the existence of prescribed $Q$-curvature metrics with conical singularities. We present here a general existence and multiplicity result in the supercritical regime. To this end, we first carry out a blow-up analysis of a $2m$th-order PDE associated to the problem and then apply a variational argument of min-max type. For $m&gt;1$, this seems to be the first existence result for supercritical conic manifolds different from the sphere.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Sobolev regularity of quasiregular maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14089v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We quantify the Sobolev space norm of the Beltrami resolvent $(I- \mu \mathcal{B})^{-1}$, where $\mathcal B$ is the Beurling-Ahlfors transform, in terms of the corresponding Sobolev space norm of the dilatation $\mu$ in the critical and supercritical ranges. Our estimate entails as a consequence quantitative self-improvement inequalities of Caccioppoli type for quasiregular distributions with dilatations in $W^{1,p}$, $p \geq 2$. Our proof strategy is then adapted to yield quantitative estimates for the resolvent $(I-\mu {\mathcal B}_\Omega)^{-1}$ of the Beltrami equation on a sufficiently regular domain $\Omega$, with $\mu\in W^{1,p}(\Omega)$. Here, ${\mathcal B}_\Omega$ is the compression of ${\mathcal B}$ to a domain $\Omega$. Our proofs do not rely on the compactness or commutator arguments previously employed in related literature. Instead, they leverage the weighted Sobolev estimates for compressions of Calder\'on-Zygmund operators to domains, recently obtained by the authors, to extend the Astala-Iwaniec-Saksman technique to higher regularities.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness analysis of the Cahn-Hilliard-Biot model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.18231v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the well-posedness of the recently proposed Cahn-Hilliard-Biot model. The model is a three-way coupled PDE of elliptic-parabolic nature, with several nonlinearities and the fourth order term known to the Cahn-Hilliard system. We show existence of weak solutions to the variational form of the equations and uniqueness under certain conditions of the material parameters and secondary consolidation, adding regularizing effects. Existence is shown by discretizing in space and applying ODE-theory (the Peano-Cauchy theorem) to prove existence of the discrete system, followed by compactness arguments to retain solutions of the continuous system. In addition, the continuous dependence of solutions on the data is established, in particular implying uniqueness. Both results build strongly on the inherent gradient flow structure of the model.</description>

Abstract: We consider evolutionary Stokes system, coupled with the so-called dynamic boundary condition, in the simple geometry of a $d$-dimensional half-space. Using the Fourier transform, we obtain an explicit formula for the resolvent. Maximal regularity estimates and existence of analytic semigroup in the $L^p$-setting are then deduced using the methods of $\mathcal{H}^{\infty}$-calculus.</description>

      <title>Almost global existence and radiative decay of three dimensional spherical gas bubble inside inviscid compressible liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16495v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present paper considers the model of a homogeneous bubble inside an unbounded isentropic compressible inviscid liquid. The exterior liquid is governed by the Euler equation while the free bubble surface is determined by the kinematic and dynamic boundary conditions on the bubble-liquid interface. We first proved the local existence and uniqueness of the complete nonlinear system using energy methods under an iteration scheme. Then we proved the almost global existence of the solution and the radiative decay of bubble oscillation through a bootstrap argument. Except for the energy estimate, this bootstrap argument encompasses a generalized KSS (Keel-Smith-Sogge) estimate and the analysis of backward pressure wave using the method of characteristics, which are the novelty of the present paper.
  We developed a generalized weighted $L^2_tH^j_x$-estimate, or the so-called KSS estimate, which extends the KSS estimate \cite{MR2015331} to nonlinear wave equations in exterior domains regardless of the boundary conditions, at the cost of only the appearance of a $L_t^2$ norm of the boundary value. To handle this boundary value, we establish a method of characteristics to study the backward pressure wave, which is then used to decouple the ODE of the boundary value from the hyperbolic system of backward and forward pressure wave. The analysis of backward pressure wave takes advantage of a change of variable between the backward and forward characteristics generated by the sound speed field in a geometric way. These two methods can not only be used for the bubble-liquid model studied in this paper, but are expected to be applied on other questions regarding nonlinear wave equations with complex boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Sequence of pseudoequilibria describes the long-time behavior of the nonlinear noisy leaky integrate-and-fire model with large delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00971v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is a wide range of mathematical models that describe populations of large numbers of neurons. In this article, we focus on nonlinear noisy leaky integrate-and-fire (NNLIF) models that describe neuronal activity at the level of the membrane potential. We introduce a sequence of states, which we call pseudoequilibria, and give evidence of their defining role in the behavior of the NNLIF system when a significant synaptic delay is considered. The advantage is that these states are determined solely by the system's parameters and are derived from a sequence of firing rates that result from solving a recurrence equation. We propose a strategy to show convergence to an equilibrium for a weakly connected system with large transmission delay, based on following the sequence of pseudoequilibria. Unlike direct entropy dissipation methods, this technique allows us to see how a large delay favors convergence. We present a detailed numerical study to support our results. This study helps us understand, among other phenomena, the appearance of periodic solutions in strongly inhibitory networks.</description>

Abstract: We study existence of a weak solution for one-dimensional problems as \begin{equation}\label{intro}\tag{1} \begin{cases} \displaystyle -\frac{d}{dx}\left(a(x) \frac{d u}{dx}\right) = - \frac{d \phi (u) }{dx}- \frac{d g(x) }{dx}&amp; \text{in}\;(0,L),
  u(0)=u(L)=0\,, &amp; \end{cases} \end{equation} where $a$ is a positive bounded function, $g\in L^2(0,L)$, and $\phi:\mathbb{R}\mapsto \mathbb{R}\cup \{+\infty\}$ is continuous as a function with values in $\mathbb{R}\cup \{+\infty\}$. Some relevant qualitative and quantitative facts concerning such problems and their solutions are described. In particular a precise characterization of the behaviour of suitable approximating solution is provided. Of particular (and independent) interest is the study of an associated ODE for which, we prove existence, uniqueness and comparison results. As a consequence of our arguments, a delicate stability result as well a quite unexpected multiplicity result is shown for problems as in \eqref{intro}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17043v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study focuses on numerically approximating solutions to the nonlinear periodic Westervelt equation within bounded domains in $\mathbb{R}^d$, where $d \in \{2,3\}$, with Robin boundary conditions. We establish the existence and uniqueness of solutions in the linear and nonlinear case, emphasizing the importance of small excitations for existence and uniqueness in the nonlinear case. Adopting a multiharmonic formulation, we address the nonlinear propagation's harmonic frequencies. An iteration scheme is devised and its convergence under smallness conditions on the excitation is shown. We explore numerical solution to the resulting system of Helmholtz equations, with a conforming finite element method for its discretization. Using an implementation of the devised methodology, we showcase how acoustic waves propagate within nonlinear media. This study is supposed to enhance our understanding of ultrasound propagation dynamics, crucial for obtaining high-quality images from limited boundary measurements.</description>

      <title>Existence and regularity of solutions for the elliptic nonlinear transparent media equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19948v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study existence and regularity of solutions to Dirichlet problems as
  $$
  \begin{cases}
  - {\rm div}\left(|u|^m\frac{D u}{|D u|}\right) = f &amp; \text{in}\;\Omega,\\ \newline
  u=0 &amp; \text{on}\;\partial\Omega,
  \end{cases}
  $$
  where $\Omega$ is an open bounded subset of $\mathbb{R}^N$ ($N\geq 2$) with Lipschitz boundary, $m&gt;0$, and $f$ belongs to the Lorentz space $L^{N,\infty}(\Omega)$. In particular, we explore the regularizing effect given by the degenerate coefficient $|u|^m$ in order to get non-trivial and bounded solutions with no smallness assumptions on the size of the data.</description>

      <title>On the magnetic Dirichlet to Neumann operator on the disk -- strong diamagnetism and strong magnetic field limit--</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15522v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by a paper by T. Chakradhar, K. Gittins, G. Habib and N. Peyerimhoff, we analyze their conjecture that the ground state energy of the magnetic Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator on the disk tends to $+\infty$ as the magnetic field tends to $+\infty$. This is an important step towards the analysis of the curvature effect in the case of general domains in $\mathbb R^2$.</description>

      <title>Interior and Boundary Regularity of Mixed Local Nonlocal Problem with Singular Data and Its Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18505v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we examine the H\"older regularity of solutions to equations involving a mixed local-nonlocal nonlinear nonhomogeneous operator $\fp + \fqs$ with singular data, under the minimal assumption that $p&gt; sq$. The regularity result is twofold: we establish interior gradient H\"older regularity for locally bounded data and boundary regularity for singular data. We prove both boundary H\"older and boundary gradient H\"older regularity depending on the degree of singularity. Additionally, we establish a strong comparison principle for this class of problems, which holds independent significance. As the applications of these qualitative results, we further study sublinear and subcritical perturbations of singular nonlinearity.</description>

      <title>Adaptive waveform inversion for transmitted wave data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17696v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adaptive Waveform Inversion (AWI) applied to transient transmitted wave data can yield estimates of index of refraction (or wave velocity) similar to those obtained by travel time inversion. The AWI objective function measures normalized mean-square dispersion about zero time of a family of filters, one filter for each source-reeciver pair, designed to match predicted data to observed data. Provided that the data contain a single smooth wavefront, this function approaches the mean square traveltime error as data wavelength tends to zero. The scaling of each filter to have unit norm is responsible for the simple relation with travel time tomography. A similar approach, Matched Source Waveform Inversion (MSWI), does not normalize the filters and has a looser relation with mean-square travel time error. If substantial energy is spread amongst multiple arrivals, on the other hand, neither AWI nor MSWI objectives approximate the travel time mean square erorr, and attempts to minimize them by local (Newton-related) optimization are as likely to stagnate at models predicting erroneous travel times as is least-square Full Waveform Inversion (FWI). The matching filter at the heart of this approach must be ``pre-whitened'', that is, computed by solving a regularized least squares problem for filtered data misfit. In order for the relation to traveltime tomography to hold, and for the filtered data misfit to stay relatively small, the regularization weight must be coupled to data wavelength. These objective functions can also be used as penalty terms in a homotopy of objectives connecting AWI or MSWI with FWI.</description>

      <title>Singular Twist Waves in Chromonic Liquid Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10769v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chromonic liquid crystals are lyotropic nematic phases whose applications span from food to drug industries. It has recently been suggested that the elastic energy density governing the equilibrium distortions of these materials may be quartic in the measure of twist. Here we show that the non-linear twist-wave equation associated with such an energy has smooth solutions that break down in a finite time, giving rise to the formation of a shock wave, under rather generic assumptions on the initial profile. The critical time at which smooth solutions become singular is estimated analytically with an accuracy that numerical calculations for a number of exemplary cases prove to be satisfactory.</description>
