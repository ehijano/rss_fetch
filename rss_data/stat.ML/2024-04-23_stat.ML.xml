      <title>Multiclass ROC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model evaluation is of crucial importance in modern statistics application. The construction of ROC and calculation of AUC have been widely used for binary classification evaluation. Recent research generalizing the ROC/AUC analysis to multi-class classification has problems in at least one of the four areas: 1. failure to provide sensible plots 2. being sensitive to imbalanced data 3. unable to specify mis-classification cost and 4. unable to provide evaluation uncertainty quantification. Borrowing from a binomial matrix factorization model, we provide an evaluation metric summarizing the pair-wise multi-class True Positive Rate (TPR) and False Positive Rate (FPR) with one-dimensional vector representation. Visualization on the representation vector measures the relative speed of increment between TPR and FPR across all the classes pairs, which in turns provides a ROC plot for the multi-class counterpart. An integration over those factorized vector provides a binary AUC-equivalent summary on the classifier performance. Mis-clasification weights specification and bootstrapped confidence interval are also enabled to accommodate a variety of of evaluation criteria. To support our findings, we conducted extensive simulation studies and compared our method to the pair-wise averaged AUC statistics on benchmark datasets.</description>

      <title>An economically-consistent discrete choice model with flexible utility specification based on artificial neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Random utility maximisation (RUM) models are one of the cornerstones of discrete choice modelling. However, specifying the utility function of RUM models is not straightforward and has a considerable impact on the resulting interpretable outcomes and welfare measures. In this paper, we propose a new discrete choice model based on artificial neural networks (ANNs) named "Alternative-Specific and Shared weights Neural Network (ASS-NN)", which provides a further balance between flexible utility approximation from the data and consistency with two assumptions: RUM theory and fungibility of money (i.e., "one euro is one euro"). Therefore, the ASS-NN can derive economically-consistent outcomes, such as marginal utilities or willingness to pay, without explicitly specifying the utility functional form. Using a Monte Carlo experiment and empirical data from the Swissmetro dataset, we show that ASS-NN outperforms (in terms of goodness of fit) conventional multinomial logit (MNL) models under different utility specifications. Furthermore, we show how the ASS-NN is used to derive marginal utilities and willingness to pay measures.</description>

      <title>Learning In Reverse Causal Strategic Environments With Ramifications on Two Sided Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by equilibrium models of labor markets, we develop a formulation of causal strategic classification in which strategic agents can directly manipulate their outcomes. As an application, we compare employers that anticipate the strategic response of a labor force with employers that do not. We show through a combination of theory and experiment that employers with performatively optimal hiring policies improve employer reward, labor force skill level, and in some cases labor force equity. On the other hand, we demonstrate that performative employers harm labor force utility and fail to prevent discrimination in other cases.</description>

      <title>Latent Schr{\"o}dinger Bridge Diffusion Model for Generative Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims to conduct a comprehensive theoretical analysis of current diffusion models. We introduce a novel generative learning methodology utilizing the Schr{\"o}dinger bridge diffusion model in latent space as the framework for theoretical exploration in this domain. Our approach commences with the pre-training of an encoder-decoder architecture using data originating from a distribution that may diverge from the target distribution, thus facilitating the accommodation of a large sample size through the utilization of pre-existing large-scale models. Subsequently, we develop a diffusion model within the latent space utilizing the Schr{\"o}dinger bridge framework. Our theoretical analysis encompasses the establishment of end-to-end error analysis for learning distributions via the latent Schr{\"o}dinger bridge diffusion model. Specifically, we control the second-order Wasserstein distance between the generated distribution and the target distribution. Furthermore, our obtained convergence rates effectively mitigate the curse of dimensionality, offering robust theoretical support for prevailing diffusion models.</description>

      <title>Preconditioned Neural Posterior Estimation for Likelihood-free Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulation based inference (SBI) methods enable the estimation of posterior distributions when the likelihood function is intractable, but where model simulation is feasible. Popular neural approaches to SBI are the neural posterior estimator (NPE) and its sequential version (SNPE). These methods can outperform statistical SBI approaches such as approximate Bayesian computation (ABC), particularly for relatively small numbers of model simulations. However, we show in this paper that the NPE methods are not guaranteed to be highly accurate, even on problems with low dimension. In such settings the posterior cannot be accurately trained over the prior predictive space, and even the sequential extension remains sub-optimal. To overcome this, we propose preconditioned NPE (PNPE) and its sequential version (PSNPE), which uses a short run of ABC to effectively eliminate regions of parameter space that produce large discrepancy between simulations and data and allow the posterior emulator to be more accurately trained. We present comprehensive empirical evidence that this melding of neural and statistical SBI methods improves performance over a range of examples, including a motivating example involving a complex agent-based model applied to real tumour growth data.</description>

      <title>Distributional Principal Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dimension reduction techniques usually lose information in the sense that reconstructed data are not identical to the original data. However, we argue that it is possible to have reconstructed data identically distributed as the original data, irrespective of the retained dimension or the specific mapping. This can be achieved by learning a distributional model that matches the conditional distribution of data given its low-dimensional latent variables. Motivated by this, we propose Distributional Principal Autoencoder (DPA) that consists of an encoder that maps high-dimensional data to low-dimensional latent variables and a decoder that maps the latent variables back to the data space. For reducing the dimension, the DPA encoder aims to minimise the unexplained variability of the data with an adaptive choice of the latent dimension. For reconstructing data, the DPA decoder aims to match the conditional distribution of all data that are mapped to a certain latent value, thus ensuring that the reconstructed data retains the original data distribution. Our numerical results on climate data, single-cell data, and image benchmarks demonstrate the practical feasibility and success of the approach in reconstructing the original distribution of the data. DPA embeddings are shown to preserve meaningful structures of data such as the seasonal cycle for precipitations and cell types for gene expression.</description>

      <title>Training-Conditional Coverage Bounds for Uniformly Stable Learning Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The training-conditional coverage performance of the conformal prediction is known to be empirically sound. Recently, there have been efforts to support this observation with theoretical guarantees. The training-conditional coverage bounds for jackknife+ and full-conformal prediction regions have been established via the notion of $(m,n)$-stability by Liang and Barber~[2023]. Although this notion is weaker than uniform stability, it is not clear how to evaluate it for practical models. In this paper, we study the training-conditional coverage bounds of full-conformal, jackknife+, and CV+ prediction regions from a uniform stability perspective which is known to hold for empirical risk minimization over reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces with convex regularization. We derive coverage bounds for finite-dimensional models by a concentration argument for the (estimated) predictor function, and compare the bounds with existing ones under ridge regression.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian Approach for Prioritising Driving Behaviour Investigations in Telematic Auto Insurance Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automotive insurers increasingly have access to telematic information via black-box recorders installed in the insured vehicle, and wish to identify undesirable behaviour which may signify increased risk or uninsured activities. However, identification of such behaviour with machine learning is non-trivial, and results are far from perfect, requiring human investigation to verify suspected cases. An appropriately formed priority score, generated by automated analysis of GPS data, allows underwriters to make more efficient use of their time, improving detection of the behaviour under investigation.
  An example of such behaviour is the use of a privately insured vehicle for commercial purposes, such as delivering meals and parcels. We first make use of trip GPS and accelerometer data, augmented by geospatial information, to train an imperfect classifier for delivery driving on a per-trip basis. We make use of a mixture of Beta-Binomial distributions to model the propensity of a policyholder to undertake trips which result in a positive classification as being drawn from either a rare high-scoring or common low-scoring group, and learn the parameters of this model using MCMC. This model provides us with a posterior probability that any policyholder will be a regular generator of automated alerts given any number of trips and alerts. This posterior probability is converted to a priority score, which was used to select the most valuable candidates for manual investigation.
  Testing over a 1-year period ranked policyholders by likelihood of commercial driving activity on a weekly basis. The top 0.9% have been reviewed at least once by the underwriters at the time of writing, and of those 99.4% have been confirmed as correctly identified, showing the approach has achieved a significant improvement in efficiency of human resource allocation compared to manual searching.</description>

      <title>Variational Bayesian Optimal Experimental Design with Normalizing Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian optimal experimental design (OED) seeks experiments that maximize the expected information gain (EIG) in model parameters. Directly estimating the EIG using nested Monte Carlo is computationally expensive and requires an explicit likelihood. Variational OED (vOED), in contrast, estimates a lower bound of the EIG without likelihood evaluations by approximating the posterior distributions with variational forms, and then tightens the bound by optimizing its variational parameters. We introduce the use of normalizing flows (NFs) for representing variational distributions in vOED; we call this approach vOED-NFs. Specifically, we adopt NFs with a conditional invertible neural network architecture built from compositions of coupling layers, and enhanced with a summary network for data dimension reduction. We present Monte Carlo estimators to the lower bound along with gradient expressions to enable a gradient-based simultaneous optimization of the variational parameters and the design variables. The vOED-NFs algorithm is then validated in two benchmark problems, and demonstrated on a partial differential equation-governed application of cathodic electrophoretic deposition and an implicit likelihood case with stochastic modeling of aphid population. The findings suggest that a composition of 4--5 coupling layers is able to achieve lower EIG estimation bias, under a fixed budget of forward model runs, compared to previous approaches. The resulting NFs produce approximate posteriors that agree well with the true posteriors, able to capture non-Gaussian and multi-modal features effectively.</description>

      <title>Solution space and storage capacity of fully connected two-layer neural networks with generic activation functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The storage capacity of a binary classification model is the maximum number of random input-output pairs per parameter that the model can learn. It is one of the indicators of the expressive power of machine learning models and is important for comparing the performance of various models. In this study, we analyze the structure of the solution space and the storage capacity of fully connected two-layer neural networks with general activation functions using the replica method from statistical physics. Our results demonstrate that the storage capacity per parameter remains finite even with infinite width and that the weights of the network exhibit negative correlations, leading to a 'division of labor'. In addition, we find that increasing the dataset size triggers a phase transition at a certain transition point where the permutation symmetry of weights is broken, resulting in the solution space splitting into disjoint regions. We identify the dependence of this transition point and the storage capacity on the choice of activation function. These findings contribute to understanding the influence of activation functions and the number of parameters on the structure of the solution space, potentially offering insights for selecting appropriate architectures based on specific objectives.</description>

      <title>Generalized Regression with Conditional GANs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Regression is typically treated as a curve-fitting process where the goal is to fit a prediction function to data. With the help of conditional generative adversarial networks, we propose to solve this age-old problem in a different way; we aim to learn a prediction function whose outputs, when paired with the corresponding inputs, are indistinguishable from feature-label pairs in the training dataset. We show that this approach to regression makes fewer assumptions on the distribution of the data we are fitting to and, therefore, has better representation capabilities. We draw parallels with generalized linear models in statistics and show how our proposal serves as an extension of them to neural networks. We demonstrate the superiority of this new approach to standard regression with experiments on multiple synthetic and publicly available real-world datasets, finding encouraging results, especially with real-world heavy-tailed regression datasets. To make our work more reproducible, we release our source code. Link to repository: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/regressGAN-7B71/</description>

      <title>Predict to Minimize Swap Regret for All Payoff-Bounded Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A sequence of predictions is calibrated if and only if it induces no swap regret to all down-stream decision tasks. We study the Maximum Swap Regret (MSR) of predictions for binary events: the swap regret maximized over all downstream tasks with bounded payoffs. Previously, the best online prediction algorithm for minimizing MSR is obtained by minimizing the K1 calibration error, which upper bounds MSR up to a constant factor. However, recent work (Qiao and Valiant, 2021) gives an ${\Omega}(T^{0.528})$ lower bound for the worst-case expected K1 calibration error incurred by any randomized algorithm in T rounds, presenting a barrier to achieving better rates for MSR. Several relaxations of MSR have been considered to overcome this barrier, via external regret (Kleinberg et al., 2023) and regret bounds depending polynomially on the number of actions in downstream tasks (Noarov et al., 2023; Roth and Shi, 2024). We show that the barrier can be surpassed without any relaxations: we give an efficient randomized prediction algorithm that guarantees $O(TlogT)$ expected MSR. We also discuss the economic utility of calibration by viewing MSR as a decision-theoretic calibration error metric and study its relationship to existing metrics.</description>

      <title>Error Analysis of Shapley Value-Based Model Explanations: An Informative Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Shapley value attribution is an increasingly popular explainable AI (XAI) method, which quantifies the contribution of each feature to the model's output. However, recent work has shown that most existing methods to implement Shapley value attributions have some drawbacks. Due to these drawbacks, the resulting Shapley value attributions may provide biased or unreliable explanations, which fail to correctly capture the true intrinsic relationships between features and model outputs. Moreover, it is difficult to evaluate these explanation errors because the true underlying dependencies between features and model outputs are typically unknown. In this paper, we theoretically analyze the explanation errors of Shapley value attributions by decomposing the explanation error into two components: observation bias and structural bias. We also clarify the underlying causes of these two biases and demonstrate that there is a trade-off between them. Based on this error analysis framework, we develop two novel concepts: over-informative and under-informative explanations. We theoretically analyze the potential over-informativeness and under-informativeness of existing Shapley value attribution methods. Particularly for the widely deployed assumption-based Shapley value attributions, we affirm that they can easily be under-informative due to the distribution drift caused by distributional assumptions. We also propose a measurement tool to quantify the distribution drift that causes such errors.</description>

      <title>Cumulative Hazard Function Based Efficient Multivariate Temporal Point Process Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most existing temporal point process models are characterized by conditional intensity function. These models often require numerical approximation methods for likelihood evaluation, which potentially hurts their performance. By directly modelling the integral of the intensity function, i.e., the cumulative hazard function (CHF), the likelihood can be evaluated accurately, making it a promising approach. However, existing CHF-based methods are not well-defined, i.e., the mathematical constraints of CHF are not completely satisfied, leading to untrustworthy results. For multivariate temporal point process, most existing methods model intensity (or density, etc.) functions for each variate, limiting the scalability. In this paper, we explore using neural networks to model a flexible but well-defined CHF and learning the multivariate temporal point process with low parameter complexity. Experimental results on six datasets show that the proposed model achieves the state-of-the-art performance on data fitting and event prediction tasks while having significantly fewer parameters and memory usage than the strong competitors.

      <title>Resampling-free Particle Filters in High-dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: State estimation is crucial for the performance and safety of numerous robotic applications. Among the suite of estimation techniques, particle filters have been identified as a powerful solution due to their non-parametric nature. Yet, in high-dimensional state spaces, these filters face challenges such as 'particle deprivation' which hinders accurate representation of the true posterior distribution. This paper introduces a novel resampling-free particle filter designed to mitigate particle deprivation by forgoing the traditional resampling step. This ensures a broader and more diverse particle set, especially vital in high-dimensional scenarios. Theoretically, our proposed filter is shown to offer a near-accurate representation of the desired posterior distribution in high-dimensional contexts. Empirically, the effectiveness of our approach is underscored through a high-dimensional synthetic state estimation task and a 6D pose estimation derived from videos. We posit that as robotic systems evolve with greater degrees of freedom, particle filters tailored for high-dimensional state spaces will be indispensable.</description>

Abstract: Soft targets combined with the cross-entropy loss have shown to improve generalization performance of deep neural networks on supervised classification tasks. The standard cross-entropy loss however assumes data to be categorically distributed, which may often not be the case in practice. In contrast, InfoNCE does not rely on such an explicit assumption but instead implicitly estimates the true conditional through negative sampling. Unfortunately, it cannot be combined with soft targets in its standard formulation, hindering its use in combination with sophisticated training strategies. In this paper, we address this limitation by proposing a principled loss function that is compatible with probabilistic targets. Our new soft target InfoNCE loss is conceptually simple, efficient to compute, and can be derived within the framework of noise contrastive estimation. Using a toy example, we demonstrate shortcomings of the categorical distribution assumption of cross-entropy, and discuss implications of sampling from soft distributions. We observe that soft target InfoNCE performs on par with strong soft target cross-entropy baselines and outperforms hard target NLL and InfoNCE losses on popular benchmarks, including ImageNet. Finally, we provide a simple implementation of our loss, geared towards supervised classification and fully compatible with deep classification model trained with cross-entropy.</description>

      <title>Prediction of flow and elastic stresses in a viscoelastic turbulent channel flow using convolutional neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural-network models have been employed to predict the instantaneous flow close to the wall in a viscoelastic turbulent channel flow. The numerical simulation data at the wall is utilized to predict the instantaneous velocity fluctuations and polymeric-stress fluctuations at three different wall-normal positions. Apart from predicting the velocity fluctuations well in a hibernating flow, the neural-network models are also shown to predict the polymeric shear stress and the trace of the polymeric stresses at a given wall-normal location with reasonably good accuracy. These non-intrusive sensing models can be integrated in an experimental setting to construct the polymeric-stress field in turbulent flows, which otherwise may not be directly quantifiable in experimental measurements.</description>

      <title>Rotting Infinitely Many-armed Bandits beyond the Worst-case Rotting: An Adaptive Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we consider the infinitely many armed bandit problems in rotting environments, where the mean reward of an arm may decrease with each pull, while otherwise, it remains unchanged. We explore two scenarios capturing problem-dependent characteristics regarding the decay of rewards: one in which the cumulative amount of rotting is bounded by $V_T$, referred to as the slow-rotting scenario, and the other in which the number of rotting instances is bounded by $S_T$, referred to as the abrupt-rotting scenario. To address the challenge posed by rotting rewards, we introduce an algorithm that utilizes UCB with an adaptive sliding window, designed to manage the bias and variance trade-off arising due to rotting rewards. Our proposed algorithm achieves tight regret bounds for both slow and abrupt rotting scenarios. Lastly, we demonstrate the performance of our algorithms using synthetic datasets.</description>

      <title>Preserving linear invariants in ensemble filtering methods</title>

Abstract: Formulating dynamical models for physical phenomena is essential for understanding the interplay between the different mechanisms and predicting the evolution of physical states. However, a dynamical model alone is often insufficient to address these fundamental tasks, as it suffers from model errors and uncertainties. One common remedy is to rely on data assimilation, where the state estimate is updated with observations of the true system. Ensemble filters sequentially assimilate observations by updating a set of samples over time. They operate in two steps: a forecast step that propagates each sample through the dynamical model and an analysis step that updates the samples with incoming observations. For accurate and robust predictions of dynamical systems, discrete solutions must preserve their critical invariants. While modern numerical solvers satisfy these invariants, existing invariant-preserving analysis steps are limited to Gaussian settings and are often not compatible with classical regularization techniques of ensemble filters, e.g., inflation and covariance tapering. The present work focuses on preserving linear invariants, such as mass, stoichiometric balance of chemical species, and electrical charges. Using tools from measure transport theory (Spantini et al., 2022, SIAM Review), we introduce a generic class of nonlinear ensemble filters that automatically preserve desired linear invariants in non-Gaussian filtering problems. By specializing this framework to the Gaussian setting, we recover a constrained formulation of the Kalman filter. Then, we show how to combine existing regularization techniques for the ensemble Kalman filter (Evensen, 1994, J. Geophys. Res.) with the preservation of the linear invariants. Finally, we assess the benefits of preserving linear invariants for the ensemble Kalman filter and nonlinear ensemble filters.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Neural Networks with RePU Activation: with Applications to Score Estimation and Isotonic Regression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.00608v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the properties of differentiable neural networks activated by rectified power unit (RePU) functions. We show that the partial derivatives of RePU neural networks can be represented by RePUs mixed-activated networks and derive upper bounds for the complexity of the function class of derivatives of RePUs networks. We establish error bounds for simultaneously approximating $C^s$ smooth functions and their derivatives using RePU-activated deep neural networks. Furthermore, we derive improved approximation error bounds when data has an approximate low-dimensional support, demonstrating the ability of RePU networks to mitigate the curse of dimensionality. To illustrate the usefulness of our results, we consider a deep score matching estimator (DSME) and propose a penalized deep isotonic regression (PDIR) using RePU networks. We establish non-asymptotic excess risk bounds for DSME and PDIR under the assumption that the target functions belong to a class of $C^s$ smooth functions. We also show that PDIR achieves the minimax optimal convergence rate and has a robustness property in the sense it is consistent with vanishing penalty parameters even when the monotonicity assumption is not satisfied. Furthermore, if the data distribution is supported on an approximate low-dimensional manifold, we show that DSME and PDIR can mitigate the curse of dimensionality.</description>

      <title>Classification with Deep Neural Networks and Logistic Loss</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.16792v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) trained with the logistic loss (i.e., the cross entropy loss) have made impressive advancements in various binary classification tasks. However, generalization analysis for binary classification with DNNs and logistic loss remains scarce. The unboundedness of the target function for the logistic loss is the main obstacle to deriving satisfactory generalization bounds. In this paper, we aim to fill this gap by establishing a novel and elegant oracle-type inequality, which enables us to deal with the boundedness restriction of the target function, and using it to derive sharp convergence rates for fully connected ReLU DNN classifiers trained with logistic loss. In particular, we obtain optimal convergence rates (up to log factors) only requiring the H\"older smoothness of the conditional class probability $\eta$ of data. Moreover, we consider a compositional assumption that requires $\eta$ to be the composition of several vector-valued functions of which each component function is either a maximum value function or a H\"older smooth function only depending on a small number of its input variables. Under this assumption, we derive optimal convergence rates (up to log factors) which are independent of the input dimension of data. This result explains why DNN classifiers can perform well in practical high-dimensional classification problems. Besides the novel oracle-type inequality, the sharp convergence rates given in our paper also owe to a tight error bound for approximating the natural logarithm function near zero (where it is unbounded) by ReLU DNNs. In addition, we justify our claims for the optimality of rates by proving corresponding minimax lower bounds. All these results are new in the literature and will deepen our theoretical understanding of classification with DNNs.</description>

      <title>Training of Neural Networks with Uncertain Data -- A Mixture of Experts Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08083v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces the "Uncertainty-aware Mixture of Experts" (uMoE), a novel solution aimed at addressing aleatoric uncertainty within Neural Network (NN) based predictive models. While existing methodologies primarily concentrate on managing uncertainty during inference, uMoE uniquely embeds uncertainty into the training phase. Employing a "Divide and Conquer" strategy, uMoE strategically partitions the uncertain input space into more manageable subspaces. It comprises Expert components, individually trained on their respective subspace uncertainties. Overarching the Experts, a Gating Unit, leveraging additional information regarding the distribution of uncertain in-puts across these subspaces, dynamically adjusts the weighting to minimize deviations from ground truth. Our findings demonstrate the superior performance of uMoE over baseline methods in effectively managing data uncertainty. Furthermore, through a comprehensive robustness analysis, we showcase its adaptability to varying uncertainty levels and propose optimal threshold parameters. This innovative approach boasts broad applicability across diverse da-ta-driven domains, including but not limited to biomedical signal processing, autonomous driving, and production quality control.</description>

Abstract: In decision-making guided by machine learning, decision-makers may take identical actions in contexts with identical predicted outcomes. Conformal prediction helps decision-makers quantify uncertainty in point predictions of outcomes, allowing for better risk management for actions. Motivated by this perspective, we introduce \textit{Self-Consistent Conformal Prediction} for regression, which combines two post-hoc approaches -- Venn-Abers calibration and conformal prediction -- to provide calibrated point predictions and compatible prediction intervals that are valid conditional on model predictions. Our procedure can be applied post-hoc to any black-box model to provide predictions and inferences with finite-sample prediction-conditional guarantees. Numerical experiments show our approach strikes a balance between interval efficiency and conditional validity.</description>

      <title>Soft-constrained Schrodinger Bridge: a Stochastic Control Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01717v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Schr\"{o}dinger bridge can be viewed as a continuous-time stochastic control problem where the goal is to find an optimally controlled diffusion process whose terminal distribution coincides with a pre-specified target distribution. We propose to generalize this problem by allowing the terminal distribution to differ from the target but penalizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the two distributions. We call this new control problem soft-constrained Schr\"{o}dinger bridge (SSB). The main contribution of this work is a theoretical derivation of the solution to SSB, which shows that the terminal distribution of the optimally controlled process is a geometric mixture of the target and some other distribution. This result is further extended to a time series setting. One application is the development of robust generative diffusion models. We propose a score matching-based algorithm for sampling from geometric mixtures and showcase its use via a numerical example for the MNIST data set.</description>

Abstract: Machine learning-based reliability analysis methods have shown great advancements for their computational efficiency and accuracy. Recently, many efficient learning strategies have been proposed to enhance the computational performance. However, few of them explores the theoretical optimal learning strategy. In this article, we propose several theorems that facilitates such exploration. Specifically, cases that considering and neglecting the correlations among the candidate design samples are well elaborated. Moreover, we prove that the well-known U learning function can be reformulated to the optimal learning function for the case neglecting the Kriging correlation. In addition, the theoretical optimal learning strategy for sequential multiple training samples enrichment is also mathematically explored through the Bayesian estimate with the corresponding lost functions. Simulation results show that the optimal learning strategy considering the Kriging correlation works better than that neglecting the Kriging correlation and other state-of-the art learning functions from the literatures in terms of the reduction of number of evaluations of performance function. However, the implementation needs to investigate very large computational resource.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10261v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we tackle Multi-Source Domain Adaptation (MSDA), a task in transfer learning where one adapts multiple heterogeneous, labeled source probability measures towards a different, unlabeled target measure. We propose a novel framework for MSDA, based on Optimal Transport (OT) and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs). Our framework has two key advantages. First, OT between GMMs can be solved efficiently via linear programming. Second, it provides a convenient model for supervised learning, especially classification, as components in the GMM can be associated with existing classes. Based on the GMM-OT problem, we propose a novel technique for calculating barycenters of GMMs. Based on this novel algorithm, we propose two new strategies for MSDA: GMM-WBT and GMM-DaDiL. We empirically evaluate our proposed methods on four benchmarks in image classification and fault diagnosis, showing that we improve over the prior art while being faster and involving fewer parameters.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Validity and Finite-Sample Properties of Approximate Randomization Tests</title>

      <description>arXiv:1908.04218v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Randomization tests rely on simple data transformations and possess an appealing robustness property. In addition to being finite-sample valid if the data distribution is invariant under the transformation, these tests can be asymptotically valid under a suitable studentization of the test statistic, even if the invariance does not hold. However, practical implementation often encounters noisy data, resulting in approximate randomization tests that may not be as robust. In this paper, our key theoretical contribution is a non-asymptotic bound on the discrepancy between the size of an approximate randomization test and the size of the original randomization test using noiseless data. This allows us to derive novel conditions for the validity of approximate randomization tests under data invariances, while being able to leverage existing results based on studentization if the invariance does not hold. We illustrate our theory through several examples, including tests of significance in linear regression. Our theory can explain certain aspects of how randomization tests perform in small samples, addressing limitations of prior theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Representation Learning in Graph Neural Networks with Node Decimation Pooling</title>

      <description>arXiv:1910.11436v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In graph neural networks (GNNs), pooling operators compute local summaries of input graphs to capture their global properties, and they are fundamental for building deep GNNs that learn hierarchical representations. In this work, we propose the Node Decimation Pooling (NDP), a pooling operator for GNNs that generates coarser graphs while preserving the overall graph topology. During training, the GNN learns new node representations and fits them to a pyramid of coarsened graphs, which is computed offline in a pre-processing stage. NDP consists of three steps. First, a node decimation procedure selects the nodes belonging to one side of the partition identified by a spectral algorithm that approximates the \maxcut{} solution. Afterwards, the selected nodes are connected with Kron reduction to form the coarsened graph. Finally, since the resulting graph is very dense, we apply a sparsification procedure that prunes the adjacency matrix of the coarsened graph to reduce the computational cost in the GNN. Notably, we show that it is possible to remove many edges without significantly altering the graph structure. Experimental results show that NDP is more efficient compared to state-of-the-art graph pooling operators while reaching, at the same time, competitive performance on a significant variety of graph classification tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2112.04620v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate uncertainty estimates are important in sequential model-based decision-making tasks such as Bayesian optimization. However, these estimates can be imperfect if the data violates assumptions made by the model (e.g., Gaussianity). This paper studies which uncertainties are needed in model-based decision-making and in Bayesian optimization, and argues that uncertainties can benefit from calibration -- i.e., an 80% predictive interval should contain the true outcome 80% of the time. Maintaining calibration, however, can be challenging when the data is non-stationary and depends on our actions. We propose using simple algorithms based on online learning to provably maintain calibration on non-i.i.d. data, and we show how to integrate these algorithms in Bayesian optimization with minimal overhead. Empirically, we find that calibrated Bayesian optimization converges to better optima in fewer steps, and we demonstrate improved performance on standard benchmark functions and hyperparameter optimization tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2201.07794v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I give a short introduction to data ethics. I begin with some background information and societal context for data ethics. I then discuss data ethics in mathematical-science education and indicate some available course material. I briefly highlight a few efforts -- at my home institution and elsewhere -- on data ethics, society, and social good. I then discuss open data in research, research replicability and some other ethical issues in research, and the tension between privacy and open data and code, and a few controversial studies and reactions to studies. I then discuss ethical principles, institutional review boards, and a few other considerations in the scientific use of human data. Finally, I briefly survey a variety of research and lay articles that are relevant to data ethics and data privacy. I conclude with a brief summary.
  My focal audience is mathematicians, but I hope that this chapter will also be useful to others. I am not an expert about data ethics, and this chapter provides only a starting point on this wide-ranging topic. I encourage you to examine the resources that I discuss and to reflect carefully on data ethics, its role in mathematics education, and the societal implications of data and data analysis. As data and technology continue to evolve, I hope that such careful reflection will continue throughout your life.</description>

      <title>Statistical Inference for Heterogeneous Treatment Effects Discovered by Generic Machine Learning in Randomized Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.14511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.14511v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Researchers are increasingly turning to machine learning (ML) algorithms to investigate causal heterogeneity in randomized experiments. Despite their promise, ML algorithms may fail to accurately ascertain heterogeneous treatment effects under practical settings with many covariates and small sample size. In addition, the quantification of estimation uncertainty remains a challenge. We develop a general approach to statistical inference for heterogeneous treatment effects discovered by a generic ML algorithm. We apply the Neyman's repeated sampling framework to a common setting, in which researchers use an ML algorithm to estimate the conditional average treatment effect and then divide the sample into several groups based on the magnitude of the estimated effects. We show how to estimate the average treatment effect within each of these groups, and construct a valid confidence interval. In addition, we develop nonparametric tests of treatment effect homogeneity across groups, and rank-consistency of within-group average treatment effects. The validity of our methodology does not rely on the properties of ML algorithms because it is solely based on the randomization of treatment assignment and random sampling of units. Finally, we generalize our methodology to the cross-fitting procedure by accounting for the additional uncertainty induced by the random splitting of data.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Online Regularized Learning Over Random Time-Varying Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.03861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.03861v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the decentralized online regularized linear regression algorithm over random time-varying graphs. At each time step, every node runs an online estimation algorithm consisting of an innovation term processing its own new measurement, a consensus term taking a weighted sum of estimations of its own and its neighbors with additive and multiplicative communication noises and a regularization term preventing over-fitting. It is not required that the regression matrices and graphs satisfy special statistical assumptions such as mutual independence, spatio-temporal independence or stationarity. We develop the nonnegative supermartingale inequality of the estimation error, and prove that the estimations of all nodes converge to the unknown true parameter vector almost surely if the algorithm gains, graphs and regression matrices jointly satisfy the sample path spatio-temporal persistence of excitation condition. Especially, this condition holds by choosing appropriate algorithm gains if the graphs are uniformly conditionally jointly connected and conditionally balanced, and the regression models of all nodes are uniformly conditionally spatio-temporally jointly observable, under which the algorithm converges in mean square and almost surely. In addition, we prove that the regret upper bound is $O(T^{1-\tau}\ln T)$, where $\tau\in (0.5,1)$ is a constant depending on the algorithm gains.</description>

      <title>Selection of the Most Probable Best</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.07533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.07533v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider an expected-value ranking and selection (R&amp;S) problem where all k solutions' simulation outputs depend on a common parameter whose uncertainty can be modeled by a distribution. We define the most probable best (MPB) to be the solution that has the largest probability of being optimal with respect to the distribution and design an efficient sequential sampling algorithm to learn the MPB when the parameter has a finite support. We derive the large deviations rate of the probability of falsely selecting the MPB and formulate an optimal computing budget allocation problem to find the rate-maximizing static sampling ratios. The problem is then relaxed to obtain a set of optimality conditions that are interpretable and computationally efficient to verify. We devise a series of algorithms that replace the unknown means in the optimality conditions with their estimates and prove the algorithms' sampling ratios achieve the conditions as the simulation budget increases. Furthermore, we show that the empirical performances of the algorithms can be significantly improved by adopting the kernel ridge regression for mean estimation while achieving the same asymptotic convergence results. The algorithms are benchmarked against a state-of-the-art contextual R&amp;S algorithm and demonstrated to have superior empirical performances.</description>

      <title>Interpretation of Neural Networks is Susceptible to Universal Adversarial Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.03095v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interpreting neural network classifiers using gradient-based saliency maps has been extensively studied in the deep learning literature. While the existing algorithms manage to achieve satisfactory performance in application to standard image recognition datasets, recent works demonstrate the vulnerability of widely-used gradient-based interpretation schemes to norm-bounded perturbations adversarially designed for every individual input sample. However, such adversarial perturbations are commonly designed using the knowledge of an input sample, and hence perform sub-optimally in application to an unknown or constantly changing data point. In this paper, we show the existence of a Universal Perturbation for Interpretation (UPI) for standard image datasets, which can alter a gradient-based feature map of neural networks over a significant fraction of test samples. To design such a UPI, we propose a gradient-based optimization method as well as a principal component analysis (PCA)-based approach to compute a UPI which can effectively alter a neural network's gradient-based interpretation on different samples. We support the proposed UPI approaches by presenting several numerical results of their successful applications to standard image datasets.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Kernel Inducing Points using features from ScatterNets (DP-KIP-ScatterNet) for Privacy Preserving Data Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.13389v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data distillation aims to generate a small data set that closely mimics the performance of a given learning algorithm on the original data set. The distilled dataset is hence useful to simplify the training process thanks to its small data size. However, distilled data samples are not necessarily privacy-preserving, even if they are generally humanly indiscernible. To address this limitation, we introduce differentially private kernel inducing points (DP-KIP) for privacy-preserving data distillation. Unlike our original intention to simply apply DP-SGD to the framework of KIP, we find that KIP using infinitely-wide convolutional neural tangent kernels (conv-NTKs) performs better compared to KIP using fully-connected NTKs. However, KIP with conv-NTKs, due to its convolutional and pooling operations, introduces an unbearable computational complexity, requiring hundreds of V100 GPUs in parallel to train, which is impractical and more importantly, such computational resources are inaccessible to many. To overcome this issue, we propose an alternative that does not require pre-training (to avoid a privacy loss) and can well capture complex information on images, as those features from conv-NKTs do, while the computational cost is manageable by a single V100 GPU. To this end, we propose DP-KIP-ScatterNet, which uses the wavelet features from Scattering networks (ScatterNet) instead of those from conv-NTKs, to perform DP-KIP at a reasonable computational cost. We implement DP-KIP-ScatterNet in -- computationally efficient -- JAX and test on several popular image datasets to show its efficacy and its superior performance compared to state-of-the art methods in image data distillation with differential privacy guarantees.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Compression in Federated Learning via Side Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.12625v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The high communication cost of sending model updates from the clients to the server is a significant bottleneck for scalable federated learning (FL). Among existing approaches, state-of-the-art bitrate-accuracy tradeoffs have been achieved using stochastic compression methods -- in which the client $n$ sends a sample from a client-only probability distribution $q_{\phi^{(n)}}$, and the server estimates the mean of the clients' distributions using these samples. However, such methods do not take full advantage of the FL setup where the server, throughout the training process, has side information in the form of a global distribution $p_{\theta}$ that is close to the clients' distribution $q_{\phi^{(n)}}$ in Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. In this work, we exploit this closeness between the clients' distributions $q_{\phi^{(n)}}$'s and the side information $p_{\theta}$ at the server, and propose a framework that requires approximately $D_{KL}(q_{\phi^{(n)}}|| p_{\theta})$ bits of communication. We show that our method can be integrated into many existing stochastic compression frameworks to attain the same (and often higher) test accuracy with up to $82$ times smaller bitrate than the prior work -- corresponding to 2,650 times overall compression.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous inference for generalized linear models with unmeasured confounders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07261v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tens of thousands of simultaneous hypothesis tests are routinely performed in genomic studies to identify differentially expressed genes. However, due to unmeasured confounders, many standard statistical approaches may be substantially biased. This paper investigates the large-scale hypothesis testing problem for multivariate generalized linear models in the presence of confounding effects. Under arbitrary confounding mechanisms, we propose a unified statistical estimation and inference framework that harnesses orthogonal structures and integrates linear projections into three key stages. It begins by disentangling marginal and uncorrelated confounding effects to recover the latent coefficients. Subsequently, latent factors and primary effects are jointly estimated through lasso-type optimization. Finally, we incorporate projected and weighted bias-correction steps for hypothesis testing. Theoretically, we establish the identification conditions of various effects and non-asymptotic error bounds. We show effective Type-I error control of asymptotic $z$-tests as sample and response sizes approach infinity. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method controls the false discovery rate by the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure and is more powerful than alternative methods. By comparing single-cell RNA-seq counts from two groups of samples, we demonstrate the suitability of adjusting confounding effects when significant covariates are absent from the model.</description>

      <title>Corrected generalized cross-validation for finite ensembles of penalized estimators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01374v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generalized cross-validation (GCV) is a widely-used method for estimating the squared out-of-sample prediction risk that employs a scalar degrees of freedom adjustment (in a multiplicative sense) to the squared training error. In this paper, we examine the consistency of GCV for estimating the prediction risk of arbitrary ensembles of penalized least-squares estimators. We show that GCV is inconsistent for any finite ensemble of size greater than one. Towards repairing this shortcoming, we identify a correction that involves an additional scalar correction (in an additive sense) based on degrees of freedom adjusted training errors from each ensemble component. The proposed estimator (termed CGCV) maintains the computational advantages of GCV and requires neither sample splitting, model refitting, or out-of-bag risk estimation. The estimator stems from a finer inspection of the ensemble risk decomposition and two intermediate risk estimators for the components in this decomposition. We provide a non-asymptotic analysis of the CGCV and the two intermediate risk estimators for ensembles of convex penalized estimators under Gaussian features and a linear response model. Furthermore, in the special case of ridge regression, we extend the analysis to general feature and response distributions using random matrix theory, which establishes model-free uniform consistency of CGCV.</description>

      <title>Equation Discovery with Bayesian Spike-and-Slab Priors and Efficient Kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05387v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discovering governing equations from data is important to many scientific and engineering applications. Despite promising successes, existing methods are still challenged by data sparsity and noise issues, both of which are ubiquitous in practice. Moreover, state-of-the-art methods lack uncertainty quantification and/or are costly in training. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel equation discovery method based on Kernel learning and BAyesian Spike-and-Slab priors (KBASS). We use kernel regression to estimate the target function, which is flexible, expressive, and more robust to data sparsity and noises. We combine it with a Bayesian spike-and-slab prior -- an ideal Bayesian sparse distribution -- for effective operator selection and uncertainty quantification. We develop an expectation-propagation expectation-maximization (EP-EM) algorithm for efficient posterior inference and function estimation. To overcome the computational challenge of kernel regression, we place the function values on a mesh and induce a Kronecker product construction, and we use tensor algebra to enable efficient computation and optimization. We show the advantages of KBASS on a list of benchmark ODE and PDE discovery tasks.</description>

      <title>Transformer Fusion with Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05719v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fusion is a technique for merging multiple independently-trained neural networks in order to combine their capabilities. Past attempts have been restricted to the case of fully-connected, convolutional, and residual networks. This paper presents a systematic approach for fusing two or more transformer-based networks exploiting Optimal Transport to (soft-)align the various architectural components. We flesh out an abstraction for layer alignment, that can generalize to arbitrary architectures - in principle - and we apply this to the key ingredients of Transformers such as multi-head self-attention, layer-normalization, and residual connections, and we discuss how to handle them via various ablation studies. Furthermore, our method allows the fusion of models of different sizes (heterogeneous fusion), providing a new and efficient way to compress Transformers. The proposed approach is evaluated on both image classification tasks via Vision Transformer and natural language modeling tasks using BERT. Our approach consistently outperforms vanilla fusion, and, after a surprisingly short finetuning, also outperforms the individual converged parent models. In our analysis, we uncover intriguing insights about the significant role of soft alignment in the case of Transformers. Our results showcase the potential of fusing multiple Transformers, thus compounding their expertise, in the budding paradigm of model fusion and recombination.

      <title>Using explainable AI to investigate electrocardiogram changes during healthy aging -- from expert features to raw signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07463v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases remain the leading global cause of mortality. Age is an important covariate whose effect is most easily investigated in a healthy cohort to properly distinguish the former from disease-related changes. Traditionally, most of such insights have been drawn from the analysis of electrocardiogram (ECG) feature changes in individuals as they age. However, these features, while informative, may potentially obscure underlying data relationships. In this paper we present the following contributions: (1) We employ a deep-learning model and a tree-based model to analyze ECG data from a robust dataset of healthy individuals across varying ages in both raw signals and ECG feature format. (2) We use explainable AI methods to identify the most discriminative ECG features across age groups.(3) Our analysis with tree-based classifiers reveals age-related declines in inferred breathing rates and identifies notably high SDANN values as indicative of elderly individuals, distinguishing them from younger adults. (4) Furthermore, the deep-learning model underscores the pivotal role of the P-wave in age predictions across all age groups, suggesting potential changes in the distribution of different P-wave types with age. These findings shed new light on age-related ECG changes, offering insights that transcend traditional feature-based approaches.</description>

      <title>On diffusion-based generative models and their error bounds: The log-concave case with full convergence estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13584v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide full theoretical guarantees for the convergence behaviour of diffusion-based generative models under the assumption of strongly log-concave data distributions while our approximating class of functions used for score estimation is made of Lipschitz continuous functions. We demonstrate via a motivating example, sampling from a Gaussian distribution with unknown mean, the powerfulness of our approach. In this case, explicit estimates are provided for the associated optimization problem, i.e. score approximation, while these are combined with the corresponding sampling estimates. As a result, we obtain the best known upper bound estimates in terms of key quantities of interest, such as the dimension and rates of convergence, for the Wasserstein-2 distance between the data distribution (Gaussian with unknown mean) and our sampling algorithm.
  Beyond the motivating example and in order to allow for the use of a diverse range of stochastic optimizers, we present our results using an $L^2$-accurate score estimation assumption, which crucially is formed under an expectation with respect to the stochastic optimizer and our novel auxiliary process that uses only known information. This approach yields the best known convergence rate for our sampling algorithm.</description>

      <title>Isolated pulsar population synthesis with simulation-based inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14848v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We combine pulsar population synthesis with simulation-based inference (SBI) to constrain the magneto-rotational properties of isolated Galactic radio pulsars. We first develop a framework to model neutron-star birth properties and their dynamical and magneto-rotational evolution. We specifically sample initial magnetic-field strengths, $B$, and spin periods, $P$, from log-normal distributions and capture the late-time magnetic-field decay with a power law. Each log-normal is described by a mean, $\mu_{\log B}, \mu_{\log P}$, and standard deviation, $\sigma_{\log B}, \sigma_{\log P}$, while the power law is characterized by the index, $a_{\rm late}$. We subsequently model the stars' radio emission and observational biases to mimic detections with three radio surveys, and produce a large database of synthetic $P$-$\dot{P}$ diagrams by varying our five magneto-rotational input parameters. We then follow an SBI approach that focuses on neural posterior estimation and train deep neural networks to infer the parameters' posterior distributions. After successfully validating these individual neural density estimators on simulated data, we use an ensemble of networks to infer the posterior distributions for the observed pulsar population. We obtain $\mu_{\log B} = 13.10^{+0.08}_{-0.10}$, $\sigma_{\log B} = 0.45^{+0.05}_{-0.05}$ and $\mu_{\log P} = -1.00^{+0.26}_{-0.21}$, $\sigma_{\log P} = 0.38^{+0.33}_{-0.18}$ for the log-normal distributions, and $a_{\rm late} = -1.80^{+0.65}_{-0.61}$ for the power law at $95\%$ credible interval. We contrast our results with previous studies and highlight uncertainties of the inferred $a_{\rm late}$ value. Our approach represents a crucial step towards robust statistical inference for complex population-synthesis frameworks and forms the basis for future multi-wavelength analyses of Galactic pulsars.</description>

      <title>On the Trajectories of SGD Without Replacement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16143v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article examines the implicit regularization effect of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). We consider the case of SGD without replacement, the variant typically used to optimize large-scale neural networks. We analyze this algorithm in a more realistic regime than typically considered in theoretical works on SGD, as, e.g., we allow the product of the learning rate and Hessian to be $O(1)$ and we do not specify any model architecture, learning task, or loss (objective) function. Our core theoretical result is that optimizing with SGD without replacement is locally equivalent to making an additional step on a novel regularizer. This implies that the expected trajectories of SGD without replacement can be decoupled in (i) following SGD with replacement (in which batches are sampled i.i.d.) along the directions of high curvature, and (ii) regularizing the trace of the noise covariance along the flat ones. As a consequence, SGD without replacement travels flat areas and may escape saddles significantly faster than SGD with replacement. On several vision tasks, the novel regularizer penalizes a weighted trace of the Fisher Matrix, thus encouraging sparsity in the spectrum of the Hessian of the loss in line with empirical observations from prior work. We also propose an explanation for why SGD does not train at the edge of stability (as opposed to GD).</description>

      <title>Rethinking Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning: From the Angles of Policy Imitation and Transferable Reward Recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14593v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adversarial inverse reinforcement learning (AIRL) stands as a cornerstone approach in imitation learning, yet it frequently faces criticisms from prior studies. In this paper, we rethink AIRL and respond to these criticisms. Criticism 1 lies in Inadequate Policy Imitation. We show that substituting the built-in algorithm with soft actor-critic (SAC) during policy updating (requires multi-iterations) significantly enhances the efficiency of policy imitation. Criticism 2 lies in Limited Performance in Transferable Reward Recovery Despite SAC Integration. While we find that SAC indeed exhibits a significant improvement in policy imitation, it introduces drawbacks to transferable reward recovery. We prove that the SAC algorithm itself is not feasible to disentangle the reward function comprehensively during the AIRL training process, and propose a hybrid framework, PPO-AIRL + SAC, for a satisfactory transfer effect. Criticism 3 lies in Unsatisfactory Proof from the Perspective of Potential Equilibrium. We reanalyze it from an algebraic theory perspective.</description>

Abstract: The barren plateau phenomenon, characterized by loss gradients that vanish exponentially with system size, poses a challenge to scaling variational quantum algorithms. Here we explore the potential of warm starts, whereby one initializes closer to a solution in the hope of enjoying larger loss variances. Focusing on an iterative variational method for learning shorter-depth circuits for quantum real and imaginary time evolution we conduct a case study to elucidate the potential and limitations of warm starts. We start by proving that the iterative variational algorithm will exhibit substantial (at worst vanishing polynomially in system size) gradients in a small region around the initializations at each time-step. Convexity guarantees for these regions are then established, suggesting trainability for polynomial size time-steps. However, our study highlights scenarios where a good minimum shifts outside the region with trainability guarantees. Our analysis leaves open the question whether such minima jumps necessitate optimization across barren plateau landscapes or whether there exist gradient flows, i.e., fertile valleys away from the plateau with substantial gradients, that allow for training.</description>
