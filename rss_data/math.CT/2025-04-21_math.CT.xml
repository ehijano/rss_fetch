      <title>Categories of abstract and noncommutative measurable spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gelfand duality is a fundamental result that justifies thinking of general unital $C^*$-algebras as noncommutative versions of compact Hausdorff spaces. Inspired by this perspective, we investigate what noncommutative measurable spaces should be. This leads us to consider categories of monotone $\sigma$-complete $C^*$-algebras as well as categories of Boolean $\sigma$-algebras, which can be thought of as abstract measurable spaces. Motivated by the search for a good notion of noncommutative measurable space, we provide a unified overview of these categories, alongside those of measurable spaces, and formalize their relationships through functors, adjunctions and equivalences. This includes an equivalence between Boolean $\sigma$-algebras and commutative monotone $\sigma$-complete $C^*$-algebras, as well as a Gelfand-type duality adjunction between the latter category and the category of measurable spaces. This duality restricts to two equivalences: one involving standard Borel spaces, which are widely used in probability theory, and another involving the more general Baire measurable spaces. Moreover, this result admits a probabilistic version, where the morphisms are $\sigma$-normal cpu maps and Markov kernels, respectively. We hope that these developments can also contribute to the ongoing search for a well-behaved Markov category for measure-theoretic probability beyond the standard Borel setting - an open problem in the current state of the art.</description>

      <title>Groupoid Cardinality and Random Permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16386v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: If we treat the symmetric group $S_n$ as a probability measure space where each element has measure $1/n!$, then the number of cycles in a permutation becomes a random variable. The Cycle Length Lemma describes the expected values of products of these random variables. Here we categorify the Cycle Length Lemma by showing that it follows from an equivalence between groupoids.</description>

      <title>Coinductive Streams in Monoidal Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.14494v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce monoidal streams. Monoidal streams are a generalization of causal stream functions, which can be defined in cartesian monoidal categories, to arbitrary symmetric monoidal categories. In the same way that streams provide semantics to dataflow programming with pure functions, monoidal streams provide semantics to dataflow programming with theories of processes represented by a symmetric monoidal category. Monoidal streams also form a feedback monoidal category. In the same way that we can use a coinductive stream calculus to reason about signal flow graphs, we can use coinductive string diagrams to reason about feedback monoidal categories. As an example, we study syntax for a stochastic dataflow language, with semantics in stochastic monoidal streams.</description>

      <title>Evidential Decision Theory via Partial Markov Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.12989v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce partial Markov categories. In the same way that Markov categories encode stochastic processes, partial Markov categories encode stochastic processes with constraints, observations and updates. In particular, we prove a synthetic Bayes theorem and we apply it to define a syntactic partial theory of observations on any Markov category, whose normalisations can be computed in the original Markov category. Finally, we formalise Evidential Decision Theory in terms of partial Markov categories, and provide implemented examples.</description>

      <title>Natural homotopy of multipointed d-spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18693v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We identify Grandis' directed spaces as a full reflective subcategory of the category of multipointed $d$-spaces. When the multipointed $d$-space realizes a precubical set, its reflection coincides with the standard realization of the precubical set as a directed space. The reflection enables us to extend the construction of the natural system of topological spaces in Baues-Wirsching's sense from directed spaces to multipointed $d$-spaces. In the case of a cellular multipointed $d$-space, there is a discrete version of this natural system which is proved to be bisimilar up to homotopy. We also prove that these constructions are invariant up to homotopy under globular subdivision. These results are the globular analogue of Dubut's results. Finally, we point the apparent incompatibility between the notion of bisimilar natural systems and the q-model structure of multipointed $d$-spaces and we give some suggestions for future works.</description>

      <title>A Concrete Model for Disjunction in Parallel and Algebraic Lambda Calculi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16102v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an interpretation for disjunctions in the presence of parallel and sum operators in both the parallel lambda calculus and the algebraic lambda calculus. Unlike conventional approaches that treat disjunction as a coproduct, we introduce a set-theoretic interpretation based on the union of the disjoint union and the Cartesian product, which does not form a coproduct in our proposed models. This leads to concrete models in the category ${\mathbf{Mag}_{\mathbf{Set}}}$, whose objects are magmas and whose arrows are those of Set, and in the category ${\mathbf{AMag}^{\mathcal{S}}_{\mathbf{Set}}}$, whose objects are action magmas and whose arrows are also those of Set. This framework enables a refined treatment of parallelism and algebraic structure. We define two lambda calculi: (i) a parallel lambda calculus where the parallel operator is a constructor of collections, and (ii) an algebraic lambda calculus incorporating scalars. Each calculus is given a formal interpretation in a corresponding category, ensuring soundness and adequacy. Our results provide a novel approach to integrating parallelism and algebraic structure within propositional logic while preserving key proof-theoretic properties.</description>
