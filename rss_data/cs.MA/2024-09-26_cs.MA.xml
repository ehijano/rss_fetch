      <title>Offline and Distributional Reinforcement Learning for Radio Resource Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has proved to have a promising role in future intelligent wireless networks. Online RL has been adopted for radio resource management (RRM), taking over traditional schemes. However, due to its reliance on online interaction with the environment, its role becomes limited in practical, real-world problems where online interaction is not feasible. In addition, traditional RL stands short in front of the uncertainties and risks in real-world stochastic environments. In this manner, we propose an offline and distributional RL scheme for the RRM problem, enabling offline training using a static dataset without any interaction with the environment and considering the sources of uncertainties using the distributions of the return. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms conventional resource management models. In addition, it is the only scheme that surpasses online RL and achieves a $16 \%$ gain over online RL.</description>

      <title>On the Principles behind Opinion Dynamics in Multi-Agent Systems of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15492v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the evolution of opinions inside a population of interacting large language models (LLMs). Every LLM needs to decide how much funding to allocate to an item with three initial possibilities: full, partial, or no funding. We identify biases that drive the exchange of opinions based on the LLM's tendency to find consensus with the other LLM's opinion, display caution when specifying funding, and consider ethical concerns in its opinion. We find these biases are affected by the perceived absence of compelling reasons for opinion change, the perceived willingness to engage in discussion, and the distribution of allocation values. Moreover, tensions among biases can lead to the survival of funding for items with negative connotations. We also find that the final distribution of full, partial, and no funding opinions is more diverse when an LLM freely forms its opinion after an interaction than when its opinion is a multiple-choice selection among the three allocation options. In the latter case, consensus is mostly attained. When agents are aware of past opinions, they seek to maintain consistency with them, changing the opinion dynamics. Our study is performed using Llama 3 and Mistral LLMs.</description>

      <title>MAPF-GPT: Imitation Learning for Multi-Agent Pathfinding at Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00134v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) is a challenging computational problem that typically requires to find collision-free paths for multiple agents in a shared environment. Solving MAPF optimally is NP-hard, yet efficient solutions are critical for numerous applications, including automated warehouses and transportation systems. Recently, learning-based approaches to MAPF have gained attention, particularly those leveraging deep reinforcement learning. Following current trends in machine learning, we have created a foundation model for the MAPF problems called MAPF-GPT. Using imitation learning, we have trained a policy on a set of pre-collected sub-optimal expert trajectories that can generate actions in conditions of partial observability without additional heuristics, reward functions, or communication with other agents. The resulting MAPF-GPT model demonstrates zero-shot learning abilities when solving the MAPF problem instances that were not present in the training dataset. We show that MAPF-GPT notably outperforms the current best-performing learnable-MAPF solvers on a diverse range of problem instances and is efficient in terms of computation (in the inference mode).</description>

      <title>On Collaboration in Distributed Parameter Estimation with Resource Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06442v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Effective resource allocation in sensor networks, IoT systems, and distributed computing is essential for applications such as environmental monitoring, surveillance, and smart infrastructure. Sensors or agents must optimize their resource allocation to maximize the accuracy of parameter estimation. In this work, we consider a group of sensors or agents, each sampling from a different variable of a multivariate Gaussian distribution and having a different estimation objective. We formulate a sensor or agent's data collection and collaboration policy design problem as a Fisher information maximization (or Cramer-Rao bound minimization) problem. This formulation captures a novel trade-off in energy use, between locally collecting univariate samples and collaborating to produce multivariate samples. When knowledge of the correlation between variables is available, we analytically identify two cases: (1) where the optimal data collection policy entails investing resources to transfer information for collaborative sampling, and (2) where knowledge of the correlation between samples cannot enhance estimation efficiency. When knowledge of certain correlations is unavailable, but collaboration remains potentially beneficial, we propose novel approaches that apply multi-armed bandit algorithms to learn the optimal data collection and collaboration policy in our sequential distributed parameter estimation problem. We illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms, DOUBLE-F, DOUBLE-Z, UCB-F, UCB-Z, through simulation.</description>

      <title>Incorporating Human Flexibility through Reward Preferences in Human-AI Teaming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14292v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Preference-based Reinforcement Learning (PbRL) has made significant strides in single-agent settings, but has not been studied for multi-agent frameworks. On the other hand, modeling cooperation between multiple agents, specifically, Human-AI Teaming settings while ensuring successful task completion is a challenging problem. To this end, we perform the first investigation of multi-agent PbRL by extending single-agent PbRL to the two-agent teaming settings and formulate it as a Human-AI PbRL Cooperation Game, where the RL agent queries the human-in-the-loop to elicit task objective and human's preferences on the joint team behavior. Under this game formulation, we first introduce the notion of Human Flexibility to evaluate team performance based on if humans prefer to follow a fixed policy or adapt to the RL agent on the fly. Secondly, we study the RL agent's varying access to the human policy. We highlight a special case along these two dimensions, which we call Specified Orchestration, where the human is least flexible and agent has complete access to human policy. We motivate the need for taking Human Flexibility into account and the usefulness of Specified Orchestration through a gamified user study. We evaluate state-of-the-art PbRL algorithms for Human-AI cooperative setups through robot locomotion based domains that explicitly require forced cooperation. Our findings highlight the challenges associated with PbRL by varying Human Flexibility and agent's access to the human policy. Finally, we draw insights from our user study and empirical results, and conclude that Specified Orchestration can be seen as an upper bound PbRL performance for future research in Human-AI teaming scenarios.</description>

      <title>Towards Autonomous Supply Chains: Definition, Characteristics, Conceptual Framework, and Autonomy Levels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14183v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent global disruptions, such as the pandemic and geopolitical conflicts, have profoundly exposed vulnerabilities in traditional supply chains, requiring exploration of more resilient alternatives. Autonomous supply chains (ASCs) have emerged as a potential solution, offering increased visibility, flexibility, and resilience in turbulent trade environments. Despite discussions in industry and academia over several years, ASCs lack well-established theoretical foundations. This paper addresses this research gap by presenting a formal definition of ASC along with its defining characteristics and auxiliary concepts. We propose a layered conceptual framework called the MIISI model. An illustrative case study focusing on the meat supply chain demonstrates an initial ASC implementation based on this conceptual model. Additionally, we introduce a seven-level supply chain autonomy reference model, delineating a trajectory towards achieving a full supply chain autonomy. Recognising that this work represents an initial endeavour, we emphasise the need for continued exploration in this emerging domain. We anticipate that this work will stimulate further research, both theoretical and technical, and contribute to the continual evolution of ASCs.</description>

      <title>Opponent Shaping for Antibody Development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10588v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Anti-viral therapies are typically designed to target the current strains of a virus. Game theoretically, this corresponds to a short-sighted, or myopic, response. However, therapy-induced selective pressures act on viral antigens to drive the emergence of mutated strains, against which initial therapies have reduced efficacy. Building on a computational model of binding between antibodies and viral antigens (the Absolut! framework), we design and implement a genetic simulation of such viral evolutionary escape. Crucially, this allows our antibody optimisation algorithm to consider and influence the entire escape curve of the virus, i.e. to guide (or ''shape'') the viral evolution. This is inspired by opponent shaping which, in general-sum learning, accounts for the adaptation of the co-player rather than playing a myopic best response. Hence we call the optimised antibodies shapers. Within our simulations, we demonstrate that our shapers target both current and simulated future viral variants, outperforming the antibodies chosen in a myopic way. Furthermore, we show that shapers exert specific evolutionary pressure on the virus compared to myopic antibodies. Altogether, shapers modify the evolutionary trajectories of viral strains and minimise the viral escape compared to their myopic counterparts. While this is a simplified model, we hope that our proposed paradigm will enable the discovery of better long-lived vaccines and antibody therapies in the future, enabled by rapid advancements in the capabilities of simulation tools.

      <title>Extending Stable and Popular Matching Algorithms from Bipartite to Arbitrary Instances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16173v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider stable and popular matching problems in arbitrary graphs, which are referred to as stable roommates instances. We extend the 3/2-approximation algorithm for the maximum size weakly stable matching problem to the roommates case, which solves a more than 20 year old open question of Irving and Manlove about the approximability of maximum size weakly stable matchings in roommates instances with ties [Irving and Manlove 2002] and has nice applications for the problem of matching residents to hospitals in the presence of couples. We also extend the algorithm that finds a maximum size popular matching in bipartite graphs in the case of strict preferences and the algorithm to find a popular matching among maximum weight matchings. While previous attempts to extend the idea of promoting the agents or duplicating the edges from bipartite instances to arbitrary ones failed, these results show that with the help of a simple observation, we can indeed bridge the gap and extend these algorithms</description>
