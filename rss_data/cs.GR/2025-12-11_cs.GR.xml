      <title>Residual Primitive Fitting of 3D Shapes with SuperFrusta</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a framework for converting 3D shapes into compact and editable assemblies of analytic primitives, directly addressing the persistent trade-off between reconstruction fidelity and parsimony. Our approach combines two key contributions: a novel primitive, termed SuperFrustum, and an iterative fiting algorithm, Residual Primitive Fitting (ResFit). SuperFrustum is an analytical primitive that is simultaneously (1) expressive, being able to model various common solids such as cylinders, spheres, cones &amp; their tapered and bent forms, (2) editable, being compactly parameterized with 8 parameters, and (3) optimizable, with a sign distance field differentiable w.r.t. its parameters almost everywhere. ResFit is an unsupervised procedure that interleaves global shape analysis with local optimization, iteratively fitting primitives to the unexplained residual of a shape to discover a parsimonious yet accurate decompositions for each input shape. On diverse 3D benchmarks, our method achieves state-of-the-art results, improving IoU by over 9 points while using nearly half as many primitives as prior work. The resulting assemblies bridge the gap between dense 3D data and human-controllable design, producing high-fidelity and editable shape programs.</description>

      <title>AI Co-Artist: A LLM-Powered Framework for Interactive GLSL Shader Animation Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Creative coding and real-time shader programming are at the forefront of interactive digital art, enabling artists, designers, and enthusiasts to produce mesmerizing, complex visual effects that respond to real-time stimuli such as sound or user interaction. However, despite the rich potential of tools like GLSL, the steep learning curve and requirement for programming fluency pose substantial barriers for newcomers and even experienced artists who may not have a technical background. In this paper, we present AI Co-Artist, a novel interactive system that harnesses the capabilities of large language models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4, to support the iterative evolution and refinement of GLSL shaders through a user-friendly, visually-driven interface. Drawing inspiration from the user-guided evolutionary principles pioneered by the Picbreeder platform, our system empowers users to evolve shader art using intuitive interactions, without needing to write or understand code. AI Co-Artist serves as both a creative companion and a technical assistant, allowing users to explore a vast generative design space of real-time visual art. Through comprehensive evaluations, including structured user studies and qualitative feedback, we demonstrate that AI Co-Artist significantly reduces the technical threshold for shader creation, enhances creative outcomes, and supports a wide range of users in producing professional-quality visual effects. Furthermore, we argue that this paradigm is broadly generalizable. By leveraging the dual strengths of LLMs-semantic understanding and program synthesis, our method can be applied to diverse creative domains, including website layout generation, architectural visualizations, product prototyping, and infographics.</description>

      <title>GTAvatar: Bridging Gaussian Splatting and Texture Mapping for Relightable and Editable Gaussian Avatars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Gaussian Splatting have enabled increasingly accurate reconstruction of photorealistic head avatars, opening the door to numerous applications in visual effects, videoconferencing, and virtual reality. This, however, comes with the lack of intuitive editability offered by traditional triangle mesh-based methods. In contrast, we propose a method that combines the accuracy and fidelity of 2D Gaussian Splatting with the intuitiveness of UV texture mapping. By embedding each canonical Gaussian primitive's local frame into a patch in the UV space of a template mesh in a computationally efficient manner, we reconstruct continuous editable material head textures from a single monocular video on a conventional UV domain. Furthermore, we leverage an efficient physically based reflectance model to enable relighting and editing of these intrinsic material maps. Through extensive comparisons with state-of-the-art methods, we demonstrate the accuracy of our reconstructions, the quality of our relighting results, and the ability to provide intuitive controls for modifying an avatar's appearance and geometry via texture mapping without additional optimization.</description>

      <title>WonderZoom: Multi-Scale 3D World Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present WonderZoom, a novel approach to generating 3D scenes with contents across multiple spatial scales from a single image. Existing 3D world generation models remain limited to single-scale synthesis and cannot produce coherent scene contents at varying granularities. The fundamental challenge is the lack of a scale-aware 3D representation capable of generating and rendering content with largely different spatial sizes. WonderZoom addresses this through two key innovations: (1) scale-adaptive Gaussian surfels for generating and real-time rendering of multi-scale 3D scenes, and (2) a progressive detail synthesizer that iteratively generates finer-scale 3D contents. Our approach enables users to "zoom into" a 3D region and auto-regressively synthesize previously non-existent fine details from landscapes to microscopic features. Experiments demonstrate that WonderZoom significantly outperforms state-of-the-art video and 3D models in both quality and alignment, enabling multi-scale 3D world creation from a single image. We show video results and an interactive viewer of generated multi-scale 3D worlds in https://wonderzoom.github.io/</description>

      <title>Im2SurfTex: Surface Texture Generation via Neural Backprojection of Multi-View Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14006v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present Im2SurfTex, a method that generates textures for input 3D shapes by learning to aggregate multi-view image outputs produced by 2D image diffusion models onto the shapes' texture space. Unlike existing texture generation techniques that use ad hoc backprojection and averaging schemes to blend multiview images into textures, often resulting in texture seams and artifacts, our approach employs a trained neural module to boost texture coherency. The key ingredient of our module is to leverage neural attention and appropriate positional encodings of image pixels based on their corresponding 3D point positions, normals, and surface-aware coordinates as encoded in geodesic distances within surface patches. These encodings capture texture correlations between neighboring surface points, ensuring better texture continuity. Experimental results show that our module improves texture quality, achieving superior performance in high-resolution texture generation.</description>

      <title>MACS: Multi-source Audio-to-image Generation with Contextual Significance and Semantic Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10287v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Propelled by the breakthrough in deep generative models, audio-to-image generation has emerged as a pivotal cross-modal task that converts complex auditory signals into rich visual representations. However, previous works only focus on single-source audio inputs for image generation, ignoring the multi-source characteristic in natural auditory scenes, thus limiting the performance in generating comprehensive visual content. To bridge this gap, we propose a method called MACS to conduct multi-source audio-to-image generation. To our best knowledge, this is the first work that explicitly separates multi-source audio to capture the rich audio components before image generation. MACS is a two-stage method. In the first stage, multi-source audio inputs are separated by a weakly supervised method, where the audio and text labels are semantically aligned by casting into a common space using the large pre-trained CLAP model. We introduce a ranking loss to consider the contextual significance of the separated audio signals. In the second stage, effective image generation is achieved by mapping the separated audio signals to the generation condition using only a trainable adapter and a MLP layer. We preprocess the LLP dataset as the first full multi-source audio-to-image generation benchmark. The experiments are conducted on multi-source, mixed-source, and single-source audio-to-image generation tasks. The proposed MACS outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods in 17 out of the 21 evaluation indexes on all tasks and delivers superior visual quality.</description>

      <title>Foveation Improves Payload Capacity in Steganography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13151v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Steganography finds its use in visual medium such as providing metadata and watermarking. With support of efficient latent representations and foveated rendering, we trained models that improve existing capacity limits from 100 to 500 bits, while achieving better accuracy of up to 1 failure bit out of 2000, at 200K test bits. Finally, we achieve a comparable visual quality of 31.47 dB PSNR and 0.13 LPIPS, showing the effectiveness of novel perceptual design in creating multi-modal latent representations in steganography.</description>

      <title>HOLE: Homological Observation of Latent Embeddings for Neural Network Interpretability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07988v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved remarkable success across various domains, yet their learned representations and decision-making processes remain largely opaque and hard to interpret. This work introduces HOLE (Homological Observation of Latent Embeddings), a method for analyzing and interpreting deep neural networks through persistent homology. HOLE extracts topological features from neural activations and presents them using a suite of visualization techniques, including Sankey diagrams, heatmaps, dendrograms, and blob graphs. These tools facilitate the examination of representation structure and quality across layers. We evaluate HOLE on standard datasets using a range of discriminative models, focusing on representation quality, interpretability across layers, and robustness to input perturbations and model compression. The results indicate that topological analysis reveals patterns associated with class separation, feature disentanglement, and model robustness, providing a complementary perspective for understanding and improving deep learning systems.</description>
