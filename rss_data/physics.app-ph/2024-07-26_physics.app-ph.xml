      <title>Active Interface Characteristics of Heterogeneously Integrated GaAsSb/Si Photodiodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is increased interest in the heterogeneous integration of various compound semiconductors with Si for a variety of electronic and photonic applications. This paper focuses on integrating GaAsSb (with absorption in the C-band at 1550nm) with silicon to fabricate photodiodes, leveraging epitaxial layer transfer (ELT) methods. Two ELT techniques, epitaxial lift-off (ELO) and macro-transfer printing (MTP), are compared for transferring GaAsSb films from InP substrates to Si, forming PIN diodes. Characterization through atomic force microscopy (AFM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) exhibits a high-quality, defect-free interface. Current-voltage (IV) measurements and capacitance-voltage (CV) analysis validate the quality and functionality of the heterostructures. Photocurrent measurements at room temperature and 200 K demonstrate the device's photo-response at 1550 nm, highlighting the presence of an active interface.</description>

      <title>Low Temperature Properties of Low-Loss Macroscopic Lithium Niobate Bulk Acoustic Wave Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we investigate the properties of macroscopic bulk acoustic wave (BAW) devices, manufactured from crystalline piezoelectric lithium niobate at both room temperature and 4 K. We identify the fundamental acoustic modes in the crystal samples structures as well as characterise their loss properties and non-linear effects at both room and cryogenic temperatures. We compare these results to similar resonators made from quartz and conclude that lithium niobate may be suitable for certain experiments due to its low-loss and strong piezoelectric coupling. Additionally, we provide evidence for the reduction of crystal lattice defect sites by thermal annealing. We report exceptional quality factors for bulk acoustic modes in lithium niobate, with a maximum recorded quality factor of 8.9 million with a corresponding quality factor $\times$ frequency product of 3.8 $\times 10^{14}$ Hz.</description>

      <title>Record nighttime electric power generation at a density of 350 mW/m$^2$ via radiative cooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coldness of the universe is a thermodynamic resource that has largely remained untapped for renewable energy generation. Recently, a growing interest in this area has led to a number of studies with the aim to realize the potential of tapping this vast resource for energy generation. While the theoretical calculation based on thermodynamic principles places an upper limit in the power density at the level of 6000 mW/m$^2$, most experimental demonstrations so far result in much lower power density at the level of tens of mW/m$^2$. Here we demonstrate, through design optimization involving the tailoring of the thermal radiation spectrum, the minimization of parasitic heat leakage, and the maximum conversion of heat to electricity, an energy generation system harvesting electricity from the thermal radiation of the ambient heat to the cold universe that achieves a sustained power density of 350 mW/m$^2$. We further demonstrate a power density at the 1000 mW/m$^2$ level using an additional heat source or heat storage that provides access to heat at a temperature above ambient. Our work here shows that the coldness of the universe can be harvested to generate renewable energy at the power density level that approaches the established bound.</description>

      <title>Microwave field vector detector based on the nonresonant spin rectification effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Normal microwave (MW) electromagnetic field detectors convert microwave power into voltages, which results in the loss of the vector characteristics of the microwave field. In this work, we developed a MW magnetic field (h-field) vector detector based on the nonresonant spin rectification effect. By measuring and analyzing the angle dependence of the rectification voltages under nonresonant conditions, we can extract the three components of the h-field. As an initial test of this method, we obtained the h-field distributions at 5.4 GHz generated by a coplanar waveguide with sub-wavelength resolution. Compared to methods using ferromagnetic resonance, this technique offers a faster and more convenient way to determine the spatial distribution of the h-field, which can be used for MW integrated circuit optimization and fault diagnosis.</description>

      <title>Optimizing ToF-SIMS Depth Profiles of Semiconductor Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The continuous technological development of electronic devices and the introduction of new materials leads to ever greater demands on the fabrication of semiconductor heterostructures and their characterization. This work focuses on optimizing Time-of-Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) depth profiles of semiconductor heterostructures aiming at a minimization of measurement-induced profile broadening. As model system, a state-of-the-art Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE) grown multilayer homostructure consisting of $^{\textit{nat}}$Si/$^{28}$Si bilayers with only 2 nm in thickness is investigated while varying the most relevant sputter parameters. Atomic concentration-depth profiles are determined and an error function based description model is used to quantify layer thicknesses as well as profile broadening. The optimization process leads to an excellent resolution of the multilayer homostructure. The results of this optimization guide to a ToF-SIMS analysis of another MBE grown heterostructure consisting of a strained and highly purified $^{28}$Si layer sandwiched between two Si$_{0.7}$Ge$_{0.3}$ layers. The sandwiched $^{28}$Si layer represents a quantum well that has proven to be an excellent host for the implementation of electron-spin qubits.</description>

      <title>First Demonstration of HZO/beta-Ga2O3 Ferroelectric FinFET with Improved Memory Window</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have experimentally demonstrated the effectiveness of beta-gallium oxide (beta-Ga2O3) ferroelectric fin field-effect transistors (Fe-FinFETs) for the first time. Atomic layer deposited (ALD) hafnium zirconium oxide (HZO) is used as the ferroelectric layer. The HZO/beta-Ga2O3 Fe-FinFETs have wider counterclockwise hysteresis loops in the transfer characteristics than that of conventional planar FET, achieving record-high memory window (MW) of 13.9 V in a single HZO layer. When normalized to the actual channel width, FinFETs show an improved ION/IOFF ratio of 2.3x10^7 and a subthreshold swing value of 110 mV/dec. The enhanced characteristics are attributed to the low-interface state density (Dit), showing good interface properties between the beta-Ga2O3 and HZO layer. The enhanced polarization due to larger electric fields across the entire ferroelectric layer in FinFETs is validated using Sentaurus TCAD. After 5x10^6 program/erase (PGM/ERS) cycles, the MW was maintained at 9.2 V, and the retention time was measured up to 3x10^4 s with low degradation. Therefore, the ultrawide bandgap (UWBG) Fe-FinFET was shown to be one of the promising candidates for high-density non-volatile memory devices.</description>

      <title>Complex picking via entanglement of granular mechanical metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When objects are packed in a cluster, physical interactions are unavoidable. Such interactions emerge because of the objects geometric features; some of these features promote entanglement, while others create repulsion. When entanglement occurs, the cluster exhibits a global, complex behaviour, which arises from the stochastic interactions between objects. We hereby refer to such a cluster as an entangled granular metamaterial. We investigate the geometrical features of the objects which make up the cluster, henceforth referred to as grains, that maximise entanglement. We hypothesise that a cluster composed from grains with high propensity to tangle, will also show propensity to interact with a second cluster of tangled objects. To demonstrate this, we use the entangled granular metamaterials to perform complex robotic picking tasks, where conventional grippers struggle. We employ an electromagnet to attract the metamaterial (ferromagnetic) and drop it onto a second cluster of objects (targets, non-ferromagnetic). When the electromagnet is re-activated, the entanglement ensures that both the metamaterial and the targets are picked, with varying degrees of physical engagement that strongly depend on geometric features. Interestingly, although the metamaterials structural arrangement is random, it creates repeatable and consistent interactions with a second tangled media, enabling robust picking of the latter.</description>

      <title>Curie-Weiss behavior and the "interaction" temperature of magnetic nanoparticle ensembles: local structure strongly affects the magnetic behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, the Curie-Weiss type behavior and the appearance of an "interaction" or "ordering" temperature for a collection of magnetic nanoparticles is explored theoretically. We show that some systems where an interaction temperature is reported are too dilute for dipolar interactions to play a role unless at least some of the particles are clumped together. We then show using the most simple type of clumps (particle pairs) that positive and negative interaction temperatures are possible due to dipolar interactions. The clump orientation dramatically changes this result. Finally, we show that an apparent interaction temperature can be measured in magnetic nanoparticle systems that have no interactions between particles, due to some alignment of anisotropy easy axes. These results show that nanoscale physical structures affect the measured magnetic response of nanoparticles.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Cage Evolution in Quasi-two-dimensional Colloidal Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Employing video microscopy, we explore the cage dynamics for colloidal particles confined in quasi-two dimensions (q2D). Our experiments reveal that while ensemble-averaged dynamics of cages are isotropic in the laboratory frame, its evolution in the displacement frame of the caged particle is anisotropic and asymmetric. In turn, this leads to particles in specific regions of the cage contributing either to cage persistence or breaking, influencing the structural relaxation of the fluid. Our findings, thus, provide microscopic insights into cage evolution and dynamics for colloidal fluids in q2D, with direct potential implications for the flow of complex fluids, structural relaxation in dense suspensions, and collective motion in active matter in confined geometries.</description>

      <title>Eavesdropping risk evaluation for non-line-of-sight terahertz channels by metallic wavy surface in rain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01074v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-line-of-sight (NLOS) data transmission through surface reflection is pivotal for enhancing the reach and efficiency of terahertz (THz) communication systems. However, this innovation also introduces significant eavesdropping risks, exacerbated by the complex bistatic scattering effects during adverse weather conditions like rain. This work delves into the assessment of the vulnerabilities of NLOS THz communication channels to eavesdropping under simulated rain conditions using metallic wavy surfaces (MWS). The observation reveals the feasibility of successful signal interception under these conditions, highlighting a prevalent security concern for outdoor terahertz communication networks utilizing NLOS channels to broaden coverage. This insight underscores the critical need for addressing and mitigating potential eavesdropping threats to ensure secure and reliable terahertz communications in varied environmental conditions.</description>

      <title>Beyond the blur: using experimentally determined point spread functions to improve scanning Kelvin probe imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03593v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scanning Kelvin probe microscopy (SKPM) is a powerful technique for investigating the electrostatic properties of material surfaces, enabling the imaging of variations in work function, topology, surface charge density, or combinations thereof. Regardless of the underlying signal source, SKPM results in a voltage image which is spatially distorted due to the finite size of the probe, long-range electrostatic interactions, mechanical and electrical noise, and the finite response time of the electronics. In order to recover the underlying signal, it is necessary to deconvolve the measurement with an appropriate point spread function (PSF) that accounts the aforementioned distortions, but determining this PSF is difficult. Here we describe how such PSFs can be determined experimentally, and show how they can be used to recover the underlying information of interest. We first consider the physical principles that enable SKPM, and discuss how these affect the system PSF. We then show how one can experimentally measure PSFs by looking at well defined features, and that these compare well to simulated PSFs, provided scans are performed extremely slowly and carefully. Next, we work at realistic scan speeds, and show that the idealised PSFs fail to capture temporal distortions in the scan direction. While simulating PSFs for these situations would be quite challenging, we show that measuring PSFs with similar scan conditions works well. Our approach clarifies the basic principles of and inherent challenges to SKPM measurements, and gives practical methods to improve results</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17263v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report a monolithic bidirectional dual-gate metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFET) fabricated on epitaxially grown beta-Ga2O3, demonstrating efficient two-way conduction and blocking. It features two independently controlled gates and operates in four distinct modes, offering flexibility in managing current and voltage in the first and third quadrants. This versatility makes it ideal for various power conversion system applications. The device operates at a low negative threshold voltage (~-2.4 V for both gates) with a zero turn-on drain voltage and an on-resistance of approximately 500 ohm-mm. It exhibits a high on/off current ratio of 1e7 in all three conducting modes. In the blocking mode, the device breakdown was measured to be more than +-350 V with a current compliance of 0.5 mA/mm. The estimated breakdown field and power figure of merit for the device are 0.35 MV/cm and 1.6 MW/cm2 respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2008.05412v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A nonlinear algebraic equation system of two variables is numerically solved, which is derived from a nonlinear algebraic equation system of four variables, that corresponds to a mathematical model related to investment under conditions of uncertainty. The theory of investment under uncertainty scenarios proposes a model to determine when a producer must expand or close, depending on his income. The system mentioned above is solved using a fractional iterative method, valid for one and several variables, that uses the properties of fractional calculus, in particular the fact that the fractional derivatives of constants are not always zero, to find solutions of nonlinear systems.</description>

      <title>Fractional flow equations. A model for pressure deficit in an oil well</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.09068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2008.09068v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article presents a novel system of flow equations that models the pressure deficit of a reservoir considered as a triple continuous medium formed by the rock matrix, vugular medium and fracture. In non-conventional reservoirs, the velocity of the fluid particles is altered due to physical and chemical phenomena caused by the interaction of the fluid with the medium, this behavior is defined as anomalous. A more exact model can be obtained with the inclusion of the memory formalism concept that can be expressed through the use of fractional derivatives. Using Laplace transform of the Caputo fractional derivative and Bessel functions, a semi-analytical solution is reached in the Laplace space.</description>

      <title>Microstructural Underpinnings of Giant Intrinsic Exchange Bias in Epitaxial NiCo2O4 Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.13227v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding intrinsic exchange bias in nominally single-component ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic materials is crucial for simplifying related device architectures. However, the mechanisms behind this phenomenon and its tunability remain elusive, which hinders the efforts to achieve unidirectional magnetization for widespread applications. Inspired by the high tunability of ferrimagnetic inverse spinel NiCo2O4, we have investigated the origin of intrinsic exchange bias in NiCo2O4(111) films deposited on Al2O3(0001) substrates. Our comprehensive characterizations, including electron diffraction, x-ray reflectometry and spectroscopy, and polarized neutron reflectometry, reveals that intrinsic exchange bias in NiCo2O4(111)/Al2O3(0001) arises from a reconstructed antiferromagnetic rock-salt NixCo1-xO layer at the interface between the film and the substrate due to a significant structural mismatch. Remarkably, by engineering the interfacial structure under optimal growth conditions, we can achieve exchange bias larger than coercivity, leading to unidirectional magnetization. Such giant intrinsic exchange bias can be utilized for realistic device applications. Our work establishes a new material platform based on NiCo2O4, an emergent spintronics material, to study tunable interfacial magnetic and spintronic properties.</description>

Abstract: Friction impacts a wide range of fields, spanning engineering, geology, biomechanics, and numerous others. As a fundamental force, it influences various aspects of our daily lives and industrial processes across multiple disciplines. To understand how adhesive friction seemingly breaks the size limit dictated by the fracture theory, here we investigate the sliding of elastic solids adhered to a rigid surface via multiple adhesive springs. With the consideration of random re-attachment of detached adhesive springs, we find that the shear-off force of the interface can significantly exceed predictions made by the fracture theory, with substantial adhesive forces distributed across the entire interface. Through this observation, we identify multiple adhesive fronts closely aligning along the interface, exhibiting similar force profiles. Moreover, the number of these regions seems to generally increase with the interface size, resulting in a linear rise in the calculated shear-off force with interface size. Therefore, we conclude that the close accumulation of multiple adhesive fronts along an interface aids each other through random healing so as to erase the size effect of the fracture theory, which offers valuable insights into understanding the phenomena associated with adhesive friction along an interface in various fields.</description>

      <title>Efficient Combinatorial Optimization via Heat Diffusion</title>

Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems are widespread but inherently challenging due to their discrete nature. The primary limitation of existing methods is that they can only access a small fraction of the solution space at each iteration, resulting in limited efficiency for searching the global optimal.To overcome this challenge, diverging from conventional efforts of expanding the solver's search scope, we focus on enabling information to actively propagate to the solver through heat diffusion. By transforming the target function while preserving its optima, heat diffusion facilitates information flow from distant regions to the solver, providing more efficient navigation. Utilizing heat diffusion, we propose a framework for solving general combinatorial optimization problems.The proposed methodology demonstrates superior performance across a range of the most challenging and widely encountered combinatorial optimizations. Echoing recent advancements in harnessing thermodynamics for generative artificial intelligence, our study further reveals its significant potential in advancing combinatorial optimization.</description>

      <title>Diamond molecular balance: Revolutionizing high-resolution mass spectrometry from MDa to TDa at room temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01963</link>

Abstract: The significance of mass spectrometry lies in its unparalleled ability to accurately identify and quantify molecules in complex samples, providing invaluable insights into molecular structures and interactions. Here, we leverage diamond nanostructures as highly sensitive mass sensors by utilizing a self-excitation mechanism under an electron beam in a conventional scanning electron microscope (SEM). The diamond molecular balance (DMB) exhibits an exceptional mass resolution of 0.36 MDa, based on its outstanding mechanical quality factor and frequency stability, along with an extensive dynamic range from MDa to TDa. This positions the DMB at the forefront of molecular balances operating at room temperature. Notably, the DMB demonstrates its ability to measure the mass of a single bacteriophage T4 by precisely locating the analyte on the device. These findings highlight the groundbreaking potential of the DMB as a revolutionary tool for mass spectrometry at room temperature.</description>
