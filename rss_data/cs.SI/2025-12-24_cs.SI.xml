      <title>Community Notes: Crowd Participation and Dependence on Professional Fact-Checking Across Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crowd-sourced fact-checking provides social media platforms with a promising method of managing misinformation at scale. However, the success of fact-checking programs like X's Community Notes requires the participation of a critical mass of note-writers who have the time and epistemic resources necessary to write and rate high-quality notes. As X's Community Notes program was first established in English-speaking countries, much academic research has focused on English-language notes or notes writ large. Relatively little research has investigated how different linguistic communities utilise Community Notes. Thus, it is unclear whether Community Notes or similar crowd-sourced fact-checking initiatives represent a viable alternative to social media platforms' partnerships with professional fact-checking organisations across linguistic contexts. This research identifies how different linguistic communities participate in volunteer fact-checking efforts on X's Community Notes program and addresses volunteers' reliance on professional fact-checking resources differs across languages. We find that while the Community Notes program has had strong uptake in some linguistic communities, the program has failed to catch on in others. Additionally, we confirm findings that notes that cite professional fact-checkers are considered more helpful, but show that reliance on professional fact-checking overall remains minimal.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Moderation in Online Social Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spread of toxic content on online platforms presents complex challenges that call for both theoretical insight and practical tools to test intervention strategies. In this novel research paper, we introduce a simulation-based framework that extends the classical SEIZ (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Skeptic) epidemic model to capture the dynamics of toxic message propagation. Our simulator incorporates active moderation mechanisms through two distinct variants: a basic moderator, which implements uniform, non-personalized interventions, and smart moderator, which leverages user-specific psychological profiles based on Dark Triad traits to apply personalized, threshold-driven moderation. By varying parameter configurations, the simulator allows for systematic exploration of how different moderation strategies influence user state transitions over time. Simulation results demonstrate that while generic interventions can curb toxicity under certain conditions, profile-aware moderation proves significantly more effective in limiting both the spread and persistence of toxic behavior. This simulation framework offers a flexible and extensible tool for studying and designing adaptive moderation strategies in complex online social systems.</description>

      <title>Enhancing structural resilience in healthcare through patient flow network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06031v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large-scale disasters, such as pandemics and climate-related events, test the resilience of healthcare systems, that is, their ability to ensure patient care under extreme strain. These crises intensify stress on the system, meaning sudden surges in demand for hospital beds, staff, and critical supplies, while increasing pressure on clinicians and other frontline providers. Most existing studies measure resilience using broad, system-wide outcomes, but often overlook how coordination between regions helps manage stress and keep care accessible. In this study, we analyzed billions of electronic medical records to construct cross-regional patient flow networks in the U.S., mapping how patients moved across healthcare facilities. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we observed that cross-regional flow rose to 4.59%, compared to the pre-pandemic level of 3.53%. This redistribution absorbed, on average, 63% of the excess stress on facilities, meaning nearly two-thirds of surging demand was handled by shifting patients to less burdened regions, an absolute 32 percentage point improvement from the pre-pandemic baseline of 31%. Further analysis suggests that strengthening cross-regional coordination could allow the healthcare system to absorb even more stress, reduce clinicians' demand, and reduce excess deaths. These findings show that structural strategies, like reinforcing patient flow between regions, can substantially enhance resilience, providing critical insights for future pandemic preparedness and disaster response planning, and ultimately improving patient care.</description>

      <title>Illusions of Intimacy: How Emotional Dynamics Shape Human-AI Relationships</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11649v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: AI companion chatbots, such as those offered by Replika and CharacterAI, increasingly function as always-available companions that provide empathy, validation, and support. While these systems appear to meet basic needs for connection, mounting safety concerns raise a deeper question: how do processes of emotional bonding and intimacy formation unfold in human-AI relationships? Prior research has relied largely on self-reports, interviews, or clinical assessments, leaving unclear how real-world emotional dynamics develop within ongoing human-AI conversations. We address this gap by analyzing over 17,000 user-shared chats with social chatbots from Reddit forums. We show that AI companions dynamically track and mimic user affect and amplify positive emotions, including when users share explicit or transgressive content. These dynamics suggest how chatbots can engage psychological processes involved in intimacy formation and emotional bonding. Finally, we release an anonymized dataset of emotionally salient human-AI companion dialogues to support future empirical work and discuss implications for redesigning and governing social chatbots as high-risk systems for vulnerable users.</description>

      <title>Estimating Graph Dimension with Cross-validated Eigenvalues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.03336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.03336v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In applied multivariate statistics, estimating the number of latent dimensions or the number of clusters, $k$, is a fundamental and recurring problem. We study a sequence of statistics called "cross-validated eigenvalues." Under a large class of random graph models, including both Poisson and Bernoulli edges, without parametric assumptions, we provide a $p$-value for each cross-validated eigenvalue. It tests the null hypothesis that the sample eigenvector is orthogonal to (i.e., uncorrelated with) the true latent dimensions. This approach naturally adapts to problems where some dimensions are not statistically detectable. In scenarios where all $k$ dimensions can be estimated, we show that our procedure consistently estimates $k$. In simulations and data example, the proposed estimator compares favorably to alternative approaches in both computational and statistical performance.</description>
