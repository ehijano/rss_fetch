      <title>Optical Convolutional Spectrometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical spectrometers are fundamental across numerous disciplines in science and technology. However, miniaturized versions, while essential for in situ measurements, are often restricted to coarse identification of signature peaks and inadequate for metrological purposes. Here, we introduce a new class of spectrometer, leveraging the convolution theorem as its mathematical foundation. Our convolutional spectrometer offers unmatched performance for miniaturized systems and distinct structural and computational simplicity, featuring a centimeter-scale footprint for the fully packaged unit, low cost (~$10) and a 2400 cm-1 (approximately 500 nm) bandwidth. We achieve excellent precision in resolving complex spectra with sub-second sampling and processing time, demonstrating a wide range of applications from industrial and agricultural analysis to healthcare monitoring. Specifically, our spectrometer system classifies diverse solid samples, including plastics, pharmaceuticals, coffee, flour and tea, with 100% success rate, and quantifies concentrations of aqueous and organic solutions with detection accuracy surpassing commercial benchtop spectrometers. We also realize the non-invasive sensing of human biomarkers, such as skin moisture (mean absolute error; MAE = 2.49%), blood alcohol (1.70 mg/dL), blood lactate (0.81 mmol/L), and blood glucose (0.36 mmol/L), highlighting the potential of this new class of spectrometers for low-cost, high-precision, portable/wearable spectral metrology.</description>

      <title>Metalens array for complex-valued optical discrete Fourier transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic computing has emerged as a promising platform for accelerating computational tasks with high degrees of parallelism, such as image processing and neural network. We present meta-DFT (discrete Fourier transform), a single layer metasurface device, designed to perform optical complex-to-complex DFT with O(N) time complexity. One critical challenge in free-space analog optical computing is to control the measurement error. Our scheme addresses this issue by focusing light on spatially separated focal points and reconstructing the complex phase, which enable error correction. We systematically evaluate the device's performance using input vectors with random complex amplitudes and phases, to demonstrate its robust accuracy. Our findings pave the way towards advancement of metasurface-based computation, offering a robust framework that is readily extensible to an arbitrary complex-valued matrix-vector multiplication (MVM).</description>

      <title>Temporal Interface in Dispersive Hyperbolic Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatial inhomogeneity, temporal modulation, and engineered anisotropy of parameters of electromagnetic media offer numerous opportunities for manipulating light-matter interaction over the past decades. Here, we investigate a scenario in which we deal with the temporal interface, hyperbolic anisotropy in the form of layered structures, and frequency dispersion. We theoretically investigate how a monochromatic uniform plane wave - propagating in an unbounded, homogeneous, isotropic dielectric medium - undergoes changes due to the rapid temporal variation of such medium into a hyperbolic dispersive medium formed by the stack of thin metal-dielectric bilayers, in which the metal follows the lossless Drude dispersion and the dielectric is assumed to be dispersionless. We corroborate our analytical results by numerical simulations. We observe several interesting phenomena, such as the conversion of the original frequency into three pairs of frequencies, resulting in three sets of forward (FW) and backward (BW) waves. We present the amplitudes and the time-average Poynting vectors for such FW and BW waves and discuss some of the salient features of such temporal interface.</description>

      <title>Magic Cancellation Point for Vibration Resilient Ultrastable Microwave Signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonically-synthesized microwave signals have demonstrated the ability to surpass the phase-noise performance achievable by traditional means of RF signal generation. However, in order for microwave-photonic oscillators to truly replace their RF counterparts, this phase noise advantage must also be realizable when operating outside of a laboratory. Oscillators in general are known to be notoriously vibration sensitive, with both traditional RF and optical oscillators degrading sharply in phase noise in all but the most stationary of environments. We demonstrate here a powerful technique that makes use of a precise frequency difference between two optical signals, termed the "magic cancellation point", to enable the cancellation of vibration-induced noise upon optical frequency division to the RF. Beyond simply mitigating the effects of vibration, this technique also preserves the excellent phase noise that would ordinarily be characteristic of signals obtained from a frequency division process. At a center frequency of 10 GHz, our divided down oscillator achieves -42 dBc/Hz, -72 dBc/Hz, -102 dBc/Hz, and -139 dBc/Hz at 1 Hz, 10 Hz, 100 Hz, and 10 kHz offset frequencies, respectively. In addition, from optical to RF, we showcase the cancellation of vibration-induced phase noise by 22.6 dB, reaching an acceleration sensitivity of $1.5 \times 10^{-10}$ g$^{-1}$. This technique applies widely to optical carriers of any center wavelength and derived from an arbitrary resonator geometry.</description>

      <title>All-optical and ultrafast control of high-order exciton-polariton orbital modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exciton-polaritons flows within closed quantum circuits can spontaneously form phase-locked modes that carry orbital angular momentum (OAM). With its infinite set of angular momentum quantum numbers, high-order OAM represents a transformative solution to the bandwidth bottleneck in multiplexed optical communication. However, its practical application is hindered by the limited choice of materials which in general requires cryogenic temperatures and the reliance on mechanical switching. In this work, we achieve stable and high-order (up to order of 33) OAM modes by constructing a closed quantum circuit using the halide perovskite microcavities at room temperature. By controlling the spatial and temporal symmetry of the closed quantum circuits using another laser pulse, we achieve significant tuning OAM of EP flows from 8 to 12. Our work demonstrate all-optical and ultrafast control of high-order OAM using exciton-polariton condensates in perovskite microcavities that would have important applications in high-throughput optical communications.</description>

      <title>Frequency-comb-steered ultrawideband quasi-true-time-delay beamformer for integrated sensing and communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phased array antennas (PAAs) possessing broadband beamforming capabilities are crucial for advanced radar and wireless communication systems. Nevertheless, traditional phase-shifter-based PAA beamformers frequently encounter the beam-squint issue, which substantially restricts their instantaneous bandwidth. Photonic true-time-delay (TTD) beamformers have the potential to overcome this challenge, offering ultrawide bandwidth and immunity to electromagnetic interference. However, their practical application is impeded by the high complexity, which typically involves a vast array of optical switches and delay lines. Here, we introduce a novel frequency-comb-steered photonic quasi-TTD beamformer that eliminates the need for delay lines by leveraging the concepts of frequency-diverse arrays and photonic microwave mixing arrays. This beamformer enables squint-free beamforming of ultrawideband linear frequency modulation waveforms, which is essential for high-resolution radar applications. It ensures seamless and continuous beam steering, effectively delivering infinite spatial resolution. We present a prototype with an 8-element PAA, demonstrating an instantaneous bandwidth of 6 GHz across the entire Ku-band. Additionally, we explore the system's capabilities in integrated inverse synthetic aperture radar imaging and high-speed communication, achieving a high imaging resolution of 2.6 cm * 3.0 cm and a transmission rate of 3 Gbps. Compared to conventional delay-line-based beamformers, our new concept markedly reduces hardware complexity and enhances scalability, positioning it as a potent enabler for future integrated sensing and communication applications.</description>

      <title>Broadband bright biphotons from periodically poled triple-resonance metasurface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biphotons from spontaneous parametric down conversion with broad bandwidth are highly wanted in many quantum technologies. However, achieving broad bandwidth in both frequency and momentum while keeping a high rate remains a challenge for both conventional nonlinear crystals and recently emerging nonlinear metasurfaces. Here, we address this challenge by introducing a periodically poled triple-resonance metasurface (PPTM) incorporating a nano-grating atop a periodically poled LiNbO$_3$ thin film. PPTM supports high-Q guided mode resonances at pump, signal, and idler wavelengths meanwhile enabling quasi-phase matching between three guided modes in a broad frequency/momentum range. The predicted biphoton rate is over 100 MHz/mW with a frequency bandwidth of 165 nm around 1550 nm and a momentum bandwidth of $13^\circ \times 6^\circ$, improving the state-of-the-art by over three orders of magnitude in rate and one order of magnitude in bandwidths. This ultrathin broadband bright biphoton source could stimulate system-level miniaturization of various free-space quantum photonic technologies.</description>

      <title>Generalized Elliptical Vector modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The strong coupling between the spatial and polarisation degrees of freedom (DoF) in vector modes enables a diverse array of exotic, inhomogeneous polarisation distributions through a non-separable superposition, which are conventionally generated in circular-cylindrical symmetry. Here, we theoretically and experimentally demonstrate a generalized class of vector modes specified in elliptical spatial coordinates and elliptical polarisation. This generalisation gives rise to an even larger set of vector beams with more intricate polarisation distributions. Crucially, controlling the beam parameters allows engineering of vector beams with predefined polarisation trajectories on the Poincar\'e sphere. This capability offers potential applications, for example in optical communications, where precise polarisation control can significantly enhance data transmission and security.</description>

      <title>Computational discovery of high-refractive-index van der Waals materials: The case of HfS$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New high-refractive-index dielectric materials may enhance many optical technologies by enabling efficient manipulation of light in waveguides, metasurfaces, and nanoscale resonators. Van der Waals materials are particularly promising due to their excitonic response and strong in-plane polarizability. Here we combine ab initio calculations and experiments to discover new high-refractive-index materials. Our screening highlights both known and new promising optical materials, including hafnium disulfide (HfS$_2$), which shows an in-plane refractive index above 3 and large anisotropy in the visible range. We confirm these theoretical predictions through ellipsometry measurements and investigate the photonic potential of HfS$_2$ by fabricating nanodisk resonators, observing optical Mie resonances in the visible spectrum. Over the course of seven days, we observe a structural change in HfS$_2$, which we show can be mitigated by storage in either argon-rich or humidity-reduced environments. This work provides a comparative overview of high-index van der Waals materials and showcases the potential of HfS$_2$ for photonic applications in the visible spectrum.</description>

      <title>Natural van der Waals canalization lens for non-destructive nanoelectronic circuit imaging and inspection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical inspection has long served as a cornerstone non-destructive method in semiconductor wafer manufacturing, particularly for surface and defect analysis. However, conventional techniques such as bright-field and dark-field scattering optics face significant limitations, including insufficient resolution and the inability to penetrate and detect buried structures. Atomic force microscopy (AFM), while offering higher resolution and precise surface characterization, is constrained by slow speed, limited to surface-level imaging, and incapable of resolving subsurface features. Here, we propose an approach that integrates the strengths of dark-field scattering optics and AFM by leveraging a van der Waals (vdW) canalization lens based on natural biaxial {\alpha}-MoO3 crystals. This method enables ultrahigh-resolution subwavelength imaging with the ability to visualize both surface and buried structures, achieving a spatial resolution of 15 nm and grating pitch detection down to 100 nm. The underlying mechanism relies on the unique anisotropic properties of {\alpha}-MoO3, where its atomic-scale unit cells and biaxial symmetry facilitate the diffraction-free propagation of both evanescent and propagating waves via a flat-band canalization regime. Unlike metamaterial-based superlenses and hyperlenses, which suffer from high plasmonic losses, fabrication imperfections, and uniaxial constraints, {\alpha}-MoO3 provides robust and aberration-free imaging in multiple directions. We successfully applied this approach to high-resolution inspection of buried nanoscale electronic circuits, offering unprecedented capabilities essential for next-generation semiconductor manufacturing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light emitting diodes have superior performance over most other light sources, but the need for secondary optics to shape their illumination for specific applications yield bulky lighting products. Here, we present an approach to shaping light from incoherent sources, such as light emitting diodes, using non-imaging metasurfaces. We present a theoretical framework and a numerical tool for designing the metasurface phase, and use it to construct a proof-of-principle beam shaping metasurface. We demonstrate the optical performance of the fabricated sample, and perform numerical experiments to investigate the quality of the metasurface design. Our approach bridges the fields of non-imaging optics and metaoptics, and may enable metasurface applications for shaping coherent and incoherent light.</description>

      <title>Deterministic fabrication of GaAs-quantum-dot micropillar single-photon sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the performance of droplet-etched GaAs quantum dots (QDs) integrated into micropillar structures using a deterministic fabrication technique. We demonstrate a unity QD positioning yield across 74 devices and consistent device performance. Under p-shell excitation, the QD decay dynamics within the micropillars exhibit biexponential behavior, accompanied by intensity fluctuations limiting the source efficiency to &lt; 4.5%. Charge stabilization via low-power above-band LED excitation effectively reduces these fluctuations, doubling the source efficiency to $\sim$ 9%. Moreover, we introduce suppression of radiation modes by introducing cylindrical rings theoretically predicted to boost the collection efficiency by a factor of 4. Experimentally, only a modest improvement is obtained, underscoring the influence of even minor fabrication imperfections for this advanced design. Our findings demonstrate the reliability of our deterministic fabrication approach in producing high-yield, uniform devices, while offering detailed insights into the influence of charge noise and complex relaxation dynamics on the performance.</description>

      <title>Measuring and controlling the birth of quantum attosecond pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generation and control of extreme ultraviolet (XUV) radiation by high harmonic generation (HHG) have advanced ultrafast science, providing direct insights into electron dynamics on their natural time scale. Attosecond science has established the capability to resolve ultrafast quantum phenomena in matter by characterizing and controlling the classical properties of the high harmonics. Recent theoretical proposals have introduced novel schemes for generating and manipulating XUV HHG with distinct quantum features, paving the way to attosecond quantum optics. In this work, we transfer fundamental concepts in quantum optics into attosecond science. By driving the HHG process with a combination of an infrared bright squeezed vacuum (BSV, a non-classical state of light), and a strong coherent field, we imprint the quantum correlations of the input BSV onto both the ultrafast electron wavefunction and the harmonics' field. Performing in-situ HHG interferometry provides an insight into the underlying sub-cycle dynamics, revealing squeezing in the statistical properties of one of the most fundamental strong-field phenomena -- field induced tunneling. Our measurement allows the reconstruction of the quantum state of the harmonics through homodyne-like tomography, resolving correlated fluctuations in the harmonic field that mirror those of the input BSV. By controlling the delay between the two driving fields, we manipulate the photon statistics of the emitted attosecond pulses with sub-cycle accuracy. The ability to measure and control quantum correlations in both electrons and XUV attosecond pulses establishes a foundation for attosecond electrodynamics, manipulating the quantum state of electrons and photons with sub-cycle precision.</description>

      <title>Structural phase transitions between layered Indium Selenide for inte-grated photonic memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The primary mechanism of optical memristive devices relies on the phase transitions between amorphous-crystalline states. The slow or energy hungry amorphous-crystalline transitions in optical phase-change materials are detrimental to the devices scalability and performance. Leveraging the integrated photonic platform, we demonstrate a single nanosecond pulse triggered nonvolatile and reversible switching between two layered structures of indium selenide (In2Se3). High resolution pair distribution function reveals the detailed atomistic transition pathways between the layered structures. With inter-layer shear glide and isosymmetric phase transition, the switching between alpha and beta structural states contain low re-configurational entropy, allowing reversible switching between layered structures. Broadband refractive index contrast, optical transparency, and volumetric effect in the crystalline-crystalline phase transition are experimentally characterized in molecular beam epitaxy-grown thin films and compared to ab initials calculations. The nonlinear resonator transmission spectra measure an incremental linear loss rate of 3.3 GHz introduced by 1.5 micrometer long In2Se3 covered lay-er, resulting from the combinations of material absorption and scattering.</description>

      <title>High-Rate Four Photon Subtraction from Squeezed Vacuum: Preparing Cat State for Optical Quantum Computation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generating logical qubits, essential for error detection and correction in quantum computation, remains a critical challenge in continuous-variable (CV) optical quantum information processing. The Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) code is a leading candidate for logical qubits, and its generation requires large-amplitude coherent state superpositions -- Schr\"{o}dinger cat states. However, experimentally producing these resource states has been hindered in the optical domain by technical challenges. The photon subtraction method, a standard approach for generating cat states using a squeezed vacuum and a photon number-resolving detector, has proven difficult to scale to multi-photon operations. While the amplitude of the generated cat states increases with the number of subtracted photons, limitations in the generation rate have restricted the maximum photon subtraction to $n=3$ for over a decade. In this work, we demonstrate high-rate photon subtraction of up to four photons from a squeezed vacuum with picosecond wavepackets generated by a broadband optical parametric amplifier. Using a Ti-Au superconducting-transition-edge sensor, we achieve high-speed, high-resolution photon number discrimination. The resulting states exhibit Wigner function negativity without loss correction, and their quantum coherence is verified through off-diagonal density matrix elements in CV representation. These results overcome long-standing limitations in multi-photon operations, providing a critical foundation for generating quantum resources essential for fault-tolerant quantum computing and advancing ultrafast optical quantum processors.</description>

      <title>High-harmonic generation in zinc oxide subjected to intense mid-infrared femtosecond laser pulse</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01571v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate photo-excitation of electron-hole pairs and high harmonic generation in the bulk of zinc oxide (ZnO) subjected to intense femto-second laser pulses with mid-infrared wavelength. The main microscopic mechanism of solid-state HHG is identified by separating resonant from non-resonant non-linear optical responses in the photo-excited solid. It allows us to obtain an effective description of the light-matter interaction in which electrons become subject to weak atto-second pulse train with the second harmonic of the drive laser frequency being the repetition frequency in the train. Under a condition of constructive interference between electronic transitions at each half-cycle of the drive laser pulse, resonant-like excitation of electron-hole pairs occurs, analogously to above threshold ionization in a gas phase. The inter-band motion of charge carriers creates rapidly oscillating electric dipole moment, which emits radiation in the form of high-order harmonics of the drive laser frequency. We also discuss the importance of the pulse envelope for producing clean frequency combs as observed in experiments. Good semi-quantitative agreement with the experimental data is found: clean and well defined odd-order harmonic peaks extending well beyond the band edge of ZnO are exhibited for laser linearly polarized at right angles to the optical axis of the crystal.</description>

      <title>Topological Switching via Exceptional Point Pairs in an Optical Microcavity Laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00406v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conventional mode switching mechanisms, which rely on dynamically encircling exceptional points (EPs) through non-adiabatic transitions (NATs), suffer from intrinsic nonlinear dynamics that hinder precise control and reproducibility in experimental settings. Additionally, these methods exhibit low transmission efficiencies due to path-dependent attenuation, limiting their effectiveness in optical switching and logic gate applications. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel mode switching approach that leverages a pair of EPs configuration in an optical microcavity, characterized by superradiance and subradiance. This mechanism exploits the topological structure of the Riemann surface to enable robust mode switching control and tunable Q-factor through purely adiabatic encircling. Furthermore, topological protection validated via braid isotopy ensures robustness against noise and parametric perturbations, facilitating a compact, robust, and adaptive non-Hermitian system.</description>

      <title>Genetically programmable optical random neural networks</title>

Abstract: Today, machine learning tools, particularly artificial neural networks, have become crucial for diverse applications. However, current digital computing tools to train and deploy artificial neural networks often struggle with massive data sizes and high power consumptions. Optical computing provides inherent parallelism accommodating high-resolution input data and performs fundamental operations with passive optical components. However, most of the optical computing platforms suffer from relatively low accuracies for machine learning tasks due to fixed connections while avoiding complex and sensitive techniques. Here, we demonstrate a genetically programmable yet simple optical neural network to achieve high performances with optical random projection. By genetically programming the orientation of the scattering medium which acts as a random projection kernel and only using 1% of the search space, our novel technique finds an optimum kernel and improves initial test accuracies by 8-41% for various machine learning tasks. Through numerical simulations and experiments on a number of datasets, we validate the programmability and high-resolution sample processing capabilities of our design. Our optical computing method presents a promising approach to achieve high performance in optical neural networks with a simple and scalable design.</description>

      <title>Model-free reinforcement learning with noisy actions for automated experimental control in optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15421v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Setting up and controlling optical systems is often a challenging and tedious task. The high number of degrees of freedom to control mirrors, lenses, or phases of light makes automatic control challenging, especially when the complexity of the system cannot be adequately modeled due to noise or non-linearities. Here, we show that reinforcement learning (RL) can overcome these challenges when coupling laser light into an optical fiber, using a model-free RL approach that trains directly on the experiment without pre-training. By utilizing the sample-efficient algorithms Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) or Truncated Quantile Critics (TQC), our agent learns to couple with 90% efficiency, comparable to the human expert. We demonstrate that direct training on an experiment can replace extensive system modeling. Our result exemplifies RL's potential to tackle problems in optics, paving the way for more complex applications where full noise modeling is not feasible.</description>

      <title>Asymmetrical estimator for training encapsulated deep photonic neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18458v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photonic neural networks (PNNs) are fast in-propagation and high bandwidth paradigms that aim to popularize reproducible NN acceleration with higher efficiency and lower cost. However, the training of PNN is known to be challenging, where the device-to-device and system-to-system variations create imperfect knowledge of the PNN. Despite backpropagation (BP)-based training algorithms being the industry standard for their robustness, generality, and fast gradient convergence for digital training, existing PNN-BP methods rely heavily on accurate intermediate state extraction or extensive computational resources for deep PNNs (DPNNs). The truncated photonic signal propagation and the computation overhead bottleneck DPNN's operation efficiency and increase system construction cost. Here, we introduce the asymmetrical training (AsyT) method, tailored for encapsulated DPNNs, where the signal is preserved in the analogue photonic domain for the entire structure. AsyT offers a lightweight solution for DPNNs with minimum readouts, fast and energy-efficient operation, and minimum system footprint. AsyT's ease of operation, error tolerance, and generality aim to promote PNN acceleration in a widened operational scenario despite the fabrication variations and imperfect controls. We demonstrated AsyT for encapsulated DPNN with integrated photonic chips, repeatably enhancing the performance from in-silico BP for different network structures and datasets.</description>
