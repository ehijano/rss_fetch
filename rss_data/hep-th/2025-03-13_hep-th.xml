      <title>Holography for the IKKT matrix model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Holographic dualities that relate type II strings on near-horizon Dp brane geometries to super Yang-Mills theories with sixteen supercharges in p+1 dimensions provide non-conformal generalizations of the famous AdS/CFT correspondence. For the extremal case p=-1, this suggests a holographic duality for the IKKT matrix model - super Yang-Mills theory reduced to zero dimensions. Despite intriguing and highly non-trivial results in the IKKT model, this duality has remained largely unexplored so far. In this letter, we consider the lowest supermultiplet of gauge invariant operators of the model and identify its states with the lowest Kaluza-Klein fluctuations of (Euclidean) IIB supergravity on the D(-1) instanton background. We construct its holographic bulk realization as a one-dimensional maximal supergravity with 32 supercharges and local SO(10) invariance, capturing the full non-linear dynamics. Analyzing the bulk Killing spinor equations, we construct the most general half-supersymmetric solutions, which typically break SO(10). We present their uplifts to IIB supergravity, and furthermore to pp-waves in twelve dimensions. These results provide the minimal setup for conducting precision tests of holography involving Einstein gravity.</description>

      <title>Exact Results in Chiral Gauge Theories with Flavor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present exact results in $\text{SU}(N_C)$ chiral gauge theories with charged fermions in an antisymmetric, $N_F$ fundamental, and $N_C + N_F - 4$ anti-fundamental representations. We achieve this by considering the supersymmetric version of these theories and utilizing anomaly mediated supersymmetry breaking at a scale $m\ll\Lambda$ to generate a vacuum. The connection to non-supersymmetric theories is then argued by taking the limit $m\rightarrow\infty$. For odd $N_C$, we determine the massless fermions and unbroken global symmetries in the infrared. For even $N_C$, we find global symmetries are non-anomalous and no massless fermions. In all cases, the symmetry breaking patterns differ from what the tumbling hypothesis would suggest.</description>

      <title>Holographic R\'enyi $n\to 0$ entropy and Euclidean fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the holographic prescription for computing the refined R\'enyi entropies $\tilde S_n$ in the $n \to 0$ limit in the AdS$_{d+1}$/CFT$_{d}$ context. This can be interpreted as a high temperature limit with respect to the notion of energy provided by the modular Hamiltonian describing the state of the system reduced to a subregion. We find, to the leading order in $n$, that the system attains local equilibrium and admits a CFT description in terms of an Euclidean irrotational perfect fluid. The fluid has vortex like boundary conditions at the boundary of the region. These vortices extends into the bulk in the form of a conical singularity, in agreement with Dong's proposal for the holographic dual to the R\'enyi entropy.</description>

      <title>A conformal dispersion relation for mixed correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dispersion relations are non-perturbative formulae that relate the ultraviolet and infrared behavior of an observable. We derive a position-space dispersion relation for scalar four-point mixed correlation functions in an arbitrary conformal field theory. This formula expresses the correlator in terms of its integrated double-discontinuity times a kinematic kernel. The kernel is analytically computed, and expressed in a remarkably simple form as a two-variable Appell function. The dispersion kernel is found by solving a coupled partial differential equation that the kernel obeys. Numerical checks of the dispersion relation are successfully performed for generalized free field correlators. Finally, we show that our position-space dispersion relation is equivalent to a Cauchy-type dispersion relation of the Mellin amplitude of the correlator.</description>

      <title>Bananas are Unparticles: Differential Equations and Cosmological Bootstrap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish an exact correspondence between tree-level cosmological correlators with unparticle exchange (at integer scaling dimensions) and banana diagrams of conformally coupled scalars. This duality enables us to systematically solve the governing differential equations through the application of shift relations and de Sitter bootstrap techniques. Furthermore, we adapt a dimensional regularization scheme to cosmological correlators, demonstrating how renormalization conditions uniquely fix the regularization prescription. Our results provide new insights into the analytic structure of higher-order loop corrections to inflationary correlation functions.</description>

      <title>Mixed Anomalies of Magnetic Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We resolve the existence of mixed 't Hooft anomalies between the electric and magnetic (solitonic) symmetries in $\sigma$-models and gauge theories. We identify the anomaly as naturally originating from a higher group in the Whitehead tower of the target space. In particular, the magnetic charges (topological solitons) can be interpreted as higher connections on the stages of the Whitehead tower, when pulled back to spacetime. This allows us to derive the form of the $(d+1)$-dim topological theory which classifies the anomaly by inflow. We also find novel features of these anomalies resulting from the mapping class group of the target space. We give many explicit examples, including a discussion of the cases where the higher magnetic symmetries become non-invertible.</description>

      <title>3d Mirrors and Phase Diagrams of Abelian Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents new developments in the study of 3d mirror symmetry and the phase structure of Abelian gauge theories. Previous works identified 3d mirrors for a specific class of theories, termed ``simple" Abelian theories. This work extends this framework by proposing 3d mirrors for ``non-simple" Abelian theories with both discrete and continuous gauge group factors. The proposal is supported by evidence from an exact operator map between the Higgs/Coulomb branch of one theory and the Coulomb/Higgs branch of its 3d mirror. Further support is provided by explicit Hilbert series computations. An algorithm for computing the Hasse (phase) diagram of the Higgs branch of both simple and non-simple Abelian theories is introduced, uncovering a recently discovered family of isolated singularities among the elementary slices. A bottom-up algorithm for computing the Coulomb branch Hasse diagram of these theories is also introduced, and the two algorithms are tested against each other via 3d mirror symmetry.</description>

      <title>Neural Network/de Sitter Space Correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning's remarkable practical successes have sparked extensive theoretical investigations, yet fundamental breakthroughs remain elusive. Here, we study neural network training via gradient descent and demonstrate that the resulting dynamics can be described by a field theory in de Sitter space. We illustrate this correspondence with a simple example of neural network in which the continuum limit is explicitly realized. Since de Sitter space is well-studied in both field theory and general relativity, our findings suggest new avenues for understanding neural network training and for leveraging established theoretical frameworks to advance machine learning theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the presence of vortex configurations with logarithmic tails, which we call super long-range vortices, in Maxwell-Higgs models with gauge field dynamics modified by generalized magnetic permeability in the Lagrangian density. By taking advantage of a first-order formalism, we study which behavior the magnetic permeability must have in order to allow for the presence of the logarithmic tails in the solutions. We also analyze the asymptotic behavior of the magnetic field and energy density. To illustrate our procedure, we present two models; one of them is described by analytical solutions.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-Resolved Entanglement Entropy in Higher Dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method to compute the symmetry-resolved entanglement entropy of spherical regions in higher-dimensional conformal field theories. By employing Casini-Huerta-Myers mapping, we transform the entanglement problem into thermodynamic calculations in hyperbolic space. This method is demonstrated through computations in both free field theories and holographic field theories. For large hyperbolic space volume, our results reveal a universal expansion structure of symmetry-resolved entanglement entropy, with the equipartition property holding up to the constant order. Using asymptotic analysis techniques, we prove this expansion structure and the equipartition property in arbitrary dimensions.</description>

      <title>The Weak Gravity Conjecture in the Vilkovisky-DeWitt Effective Action of Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Weak Gravity Conjecture states that in any consistent theory of quantum gravity in the landscape of string theory, the repulsive force mediated by a U(1) gauge field must be stronger than the attractive force of gravity. In this work, we calculate quantum gravitational corrections to the charge-to-mass ratio of extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes, using the Vilkovisky-deWitt unique effective action approach, since this ratio provides a discriminant to select low-energy effective theories of quantum gravity that fulfill the conjecture. We find that depending on the values of the Wilson coefficients of the effective action, some UV complete theories will fulfill the conjecture, while others will not.</description>

      <title>Holographic Einstein Rings of AdS black holes with higher derivative corrections in presence of string cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper seeks to explore the holographic optical appearance of an AdS black hole with higher derivative corrections in the presence of a string cloud, drawing on the AdS/CFT correspondence and wave optics. We introduce a Gaussian wave source that oscillates at the AdS boundary and propagates through the bulk. The resulting response function is then analyzed using an imaging system to study the optical properties of the black hole. Depending on the observer's position and variations in system parameters, the resulting holographic image takes on different forms, including a well defined Einstein ring, deformed luminous patterns, or isolated bright spots. Notably, when the observer is positioned at the north pole, the image consistently features a bright ring at the photon sphere, encircled by concentric stripes. Our findings reveal a strong correlation between the Einstein ring's location and the photon sphere radius predicted by geometric optics, reinforcing the connection between wave optics and gravitational lensing. Additionally, we examine the influence of higher-derivative corrections and string cloud parameters on the observed optical features.</description>

      <title>On non-planar ABJM anomalous dimensions from M2 branes in AdS$_{4}\times S^{7}/\mathbb{Z}_{k}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planar parts of conformal dimensions of primary operators in $U_k(N) \times U_{-k}(N)$ ABJM theory are controlled by integrability. Strong coupling asymptotics of planar dimensions of operators with large spins can be found from the energy of semiclassical strings in AdS$_{4}\times$CP$^3$ but computing non-planar corrections requires understanding higher genus string corrections. As was pointed out in arXiv:2408.10070, here is an alternative way to find the non-planar corrections by quantizing M2 branes in AdS$_{4}\times S^7/\mathbb{Z}_{k}$ which are wrapped around the 11d circle of radius $1/k= \lambda/N$ and generalize spinning strings in AdS$_4\times$CP$^3$. Computing the 1-loop correction to the energy of M2 brane that corresponds to the long folded string with large spin $S$ in AdS$_4$ allowed to obtain a prediction for the large $\lambda$ limit of non-planar corrections to the cusp anomalous dimension. Similar predictions were found for non-planar dimensions of operators dual to M2 branes that generalize the ''short'' and ''long'' circular strings with two equal spins $J_1=J_2$ in CP$^3$. Here we consider two more non-trivial examples of 1-loop M2 brane computations that correspond to: (i) long folded string with large spin $S$ in AdS$_4$ and orbital momentum $J$ in CP$^3$ whose energy determines the generalized cusp anomalous dimension, and (ii) circular string with spin $S$ in AdS$_4$ and spin $J$ in CP$^3$. We find the leading terms of the expansion of the corresponding 1-loop M2 brane energies in $1/k$. We also discuss similar semiclassical 1-loop M2 brane computation in flat 11d background and comment on possible relation to higher genus corrections to energies in 10d string theory.</description>

      <title>Freelance Holography, Part I: Setting Boundary Conditions Free in Gauge/Gravity Correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore AdS/CFT duality in the large $N$ limit, where the duality reduces to gauge/gravity correspondence, from the viewpoint of covariant phase space formalism (CPSF). In particular, we elucidate the role of the $W, Y$, and $Z$ freedoms (also known as ambiguities) in the CPSF and their meaning in the gauge/gravity correspondence. We show that $W$-freedom is associated with the choice of boundary conditions and slicing of solution space in the gravity side, which has been related to deformations by multi-trace operators in the gauge theory side. The gauge/gravity correspondence implies the equivalence of on-shell symplectic potentials on both sides, thereby the $Y$-freedom of the gravity side specifies the on-shell symplectic form of the gauge theory side. The $Z$-freedom, which determines the corner Lagrangian on the gravity side, establishes the boundary conditions and choice of slicing in the boundary theory and its solution space. We utilize these results to systematically formulate freelance holography in which boundary conditions of the fields on the gravity side are chosen freely and are not limited to Dirichlet boundary conditions and discuss some examples with different boundary conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We continue developing the freelance holography program, formulating gauge/gravity correspondence where the gravity side is formulated on a space bounded by a generic timelike codimension-one surface inside AdS and arbitrary boundary conditions are imposed on the gravity fields on the surface. Our analysis is performed within the Covariant Phase Space Formalism (CPSF). We discuss how a given boundary condition on the bulk fields on a generic boundary evolves as we move the boundary to another boundary inside AdS and work out how this evolution is encoded in deformations of the holographic boundary theory. Our analyses here extend the extensively studied T$\bar{\text{T}}$-deformation by relaxing the boundary conditions at asymptotic AdS or at the cutoff surface to be any arbitrary one (besides Dirichlet). We discuss some of the implications of our general freelance holography setting.</description>

      <title>Beta-Functions and RG flows for Holographic QCD with Heavy and Light Quarks: Isotropic case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a previous paper [arXiv:2402.14512v3], we investigated the dependence of the running coupling constant on temperature and chemical potential for holographic models of the light and heavy quarks, supported by an Einstein-dilaton-Maxwell action. In this paper, we study the dependence of the corresponding $\beta$-functions on the temperature and the chemical potential. As in the previous paper, we give special attention to the behavior of the $\beta$-functions near the 1st order phase transitions. We consider different types of boundary conditions for the dilaton. Only one of the possible boundary conditions yields results that agree with lattice calculations at zero chemical potential. The corresponding $\beta$-functions are negative and exhibit jumps at the 1st order phase transitions. We also show that the RG fluxes are invariant with respect to the choice of the boundary conditions and that our exact solutions for the light and heavy quarks are unstable, as expected, given their negative dilaton potentials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: These notes review a description of quantum mechanics in terms of the topology of spaces, basing on the axioms of Topological Quantum Field Theory and path integral formalism. In this description quantum states and operators are encoded by the topology of spaces that are used as modules to build the quantum mechanical model, while expectation values and probabilities are given by topological invariants of spaces, knots and links. The notes focus on the specific way the topology encodes quantum mechanical features, or, equivalently, on how these features can be controlled through the topology. A topological classification of entanglement is discussed, as well as properties of entanglement entropy and basic quantum protocols. The primary aim is to build a less conventional diagrammatic intuition about quantum mechanics, expanding the paradigm of ``Quantum Picturalism".</description>

      <title>Quantum Circuits for SU(3) Lattice Gauge Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lattice gauge theories in varying dimensions, lattice volumes, and truncations offer a rich family of targets for Hamiltonian simulation on quantum devices. In return, formulating quantum simulations can provide new ways of thinking about the quantum structure of gauge theories. In this work, we consider pure $SU(3)$ gauge theory in two and three spatial dimensions in a streamlined version of the electric basis. We use a formulation of the theory that balances locality of the Hamiltonian and size of the gauge-invariant state space, and we classically pre-compute dictionaries of plaquette operator matrix elements for use in circuit construction. We build circuits for simulating time evolution on arbitrary lattice volumes, spanning circuits suitable for NISQ era hardware to future fault-tolerant devices. Relative to spin models, time evolution in lattice gauge theories involves more complex local unitaries, and the Hilbert space of all quantum registers may have large unphysical subspaces. Based on these features, we develop general, volume-scalable tools for optimizing circuit depth, including pruning and fusion algorithms for collections of large multi-controlled unitaries. We describe scalings of quantum resources needed to simulate larger circuits and some directions for future algorithmic development.</description>

      <title>Scalar Quasinormal Modes of Rotating Regular Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasinormal modes are characteristic signatures of compact objects. Here we consider rotating regular black holes, representing rotating generalizations of the Simpson and Visser metric. We present the spectrum of scalar quasinormal modes and compare it with the spectrum of Kerr black holes. The calculations are done using a spectral decomposition method. The scalar modes smoothly connect to the Kerr limit. Interestingly, for particularly low scaled Hawking temperatures, the dependence of the modes changes as rotation increases. A further investigation shows that the real part of the fundamental and first excited modes of the static and slowly rotating black holes (about $13\%$ of the extremal angular momentum) progresses in an opposite behavior in this low temperature region. Meanwhile the imaginary part of the modes crosses where the excited modes become longer lived than the fundamental modes. Rapid rotation however suppresses such tendency.</description>

      <title>Gravity induced CP violation in mesons mixing, decay and interference experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The impact of earth's gravity on neutral mesons dynamics is analyzed. The main effect of a Newtonian potential is to couple the strangeness and bottomness oscillations with the quark zitterbewegung oscillations. This coupling is responsible for the observed CP violation in the three types of experiments analyzed here: (i) indirect violation in the mixing, (ii) direct violation in the decay to one final state and (iii) violation in interference between decays with and without mixing. The three violation parameters associated with these experiments are predicted in agreement with the experimental data. The amplitude of the violation is linear with respect to the strength of gravity so that this new mechanism allows to consider matter dominated cosmological evolutions providing the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe.</description>

      <title>Tremblay-Turbiner-Winternitz (TTW) system at integer index $k$: polynomial algebras of integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An infinite 3-parametric family of superintegrable and exactly-solvable quantum models on a plane, admitting separation of variables in polar coordinates, marked by integer index $k$ was introduced in Journ Phys A 42 (2009) 242001 and was called in literature the TTW system. In this paper it is conjectured that the Hamiltonian and both integrals of TTW system have hidden algebra $g^{(k)}$ - it was checked for $k=1,2,3,4$ - having its finite-dimensional representation spaces as the invariant subspaces. It is checked that for $k=1,2,3,4$ that the Hamiltonian $H$, two integrals ${\cal I}_{1,2}$ and their commutator ${\cal I}_{12} = [{\cal I}_1,{\cal I}_2]$ are four generating elements of the polynomial algebra of integrals of the order $(k+1)$: $[{\cal I}_1,{\cal I}_{12}] = P_{k+1}(H, {\cal I}_{1,2},{\cal I}_{12})$, $[{\cal I}_2,{\cal I}_{12}] = Q_{k+1}(H, {\cal I}_{1,2},{\cal I}_{12})$, where $P_{k+1},Q_{k+1}$ are polynomials of degree $(k+1)$ written in terms of ordered monomials of $H, {\cal I}_{1,2},{\cal I}_{12}$. This implies that polynomial algebra of integrals is subalgebra of $g^{(k)}$. It is conjectured that all is true for any integer $k$.</description>

Abstract: We study stratifications of regions in the space of symmetric matrices. Their points are Mandelstam matrices for momentum vectors in particle physics. Kinematic strata in these regions are indexed by signs and rank two matroids. Matroid strata of Lorentzian quadratic forms arise when all signs are non-negative. We characterize the posets of strata, for massless and massive particles, with and without momentum conservation.</description>

      <title>Inhomogeneous Abelian Chern-Simons Higgs Model with New Inhomogeneous BPS Vacuum and Solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11978v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study an inhomogeneous U(1) Chern-Simons Higgs model with a magnetic impurity in the BPS limit. The potential is sextic with both broken and unbroken phases, but its minimum varies spatially depending on the strength of the impurity. While the system lacks translation symmetry, it admits a supersymmetric extension. Depending on the sign of the impurity term, it has either a BPS sector or an anti-BPS sector (but not both), which satisfies the Bogomolny equations. The vacuum configuration of the broken phase is not simply determined by the the minimum of the potential since it is no longer constant, but it becomes a nontrivial function satisfying the Bogomolny equations. Thus, the energy and angular momentum densities of the vacuum locally have nonzero distributions, although the total energy and angular momentum remain zero. As in the homogeneous case, the theory supports various BPS soliton solutions, including topological and nontopological vortices and Q-balls. The vorticities as well as the U(1) charges are exclusively positive or negative. For a Gaussian type impurity as a specific example, we obtain rotationally symmetric numerical solutions and analyze their detailed properties. We also discuss the case of a delta-function impurity as the infinitely thin limit of the Gaussian impurity which shows some nontrivial feature of BPS Chern-Simons Higgs theory.</description>

      <title>Regge trajectories and bridges between them in integrable AdS/CFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08927v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the analytic continuation in the spin of the planar spectrum of ABJM theory using the integrability-based Quantum Spectral Curve (QSC) method. Under some minimal assumptions, we classify the analytic properties of the Q-functions appearing in the QSC compatible with the spin being non-integer. In this way we find not one - but $\textit{two}$ distinct possibilities. While one is related to standard Regge trajectories, we show that the second choice can be used to build bridges which connect leading and subleading Regge trajectories, thus giving a shortcut to reach infinitely many sheets of the spin Riemann surface without going explicitly around the branch points in the complex spin plane. Moreover, the bridges are exact spin reflections of standard Regge trajectories. Together, these results reveal the existence of a hidden symmetry which we call "twist/co-twist symmetry": every non-BPS local operator has an exact image - living below unitarity on a different Regge trajectory - with the same $\Delta$ and the spin flipped by a Weyl reflection. We discuss how an analogous phenomenon, based on the same mechanism at the level of the QSC, also occurs at non-perturbative level in $\mathcal{N}$$=$$4$ SYM. This provides a framework to understand recent independent observations of the symmetry in this model at weak and strong coupling. We present numerical results for Regge trajectories in planar ABJM theory, in particular we compute exactly the coupling dependence of the position of the leading Regge pole in the correlator of four stress tensors. The shape of this leading trajectory shows a behaviour at weak coupling that strongly resembles the BFKL limit in $\mathcal{N}$$=$$4$ SYM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10685v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quite some years ago, Oleg Chalykh has built a nice theory from the observation that the Macdonald polynomial reduces at $t=q^{-m}$ to a sum over permutations of simpler polynomials called Baker-Akhiezer functions, which can be unambiguously constructed from a system of linear difference equations. Moreover, he also proposed a generalization of these polynomials to the twisted Baker-Akhiezer functions. Recently, in a private communication Oleg suggested that these twisted Baker-Akhiezer functions could provide eigenfunctions of the commuting Hamiltonians associated with the $(-1,a)$ rays of the Ding-Iohara-Miki algebra. In the paper, we discuss this suggestion and some evidence in its support.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04043v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study $\frac{1}{4}$-BPS Wilson loops in four-dimensional SU$(N$) ${\cal N}=2$ super-Yang-Mills theories with conformal matter in an arbitrary representation $\mathcal{R}$. These operators correspond to loops on a two-sphere formed by two meridians separated by an arbitrary opening angle. We conjecture that these observables are encoded in Pestun's matrix model. The matrix representation of these operators resembles that of the $\frac12$-BPS circular Wilson loop, differing only for a rescaling in the phase factor. We support our conjecture with an explicit three-loop calculation in flat space, which shows that the observable coincides with the $\mathcal{N}=4$ counterpart up to two loops, as expected by the conformality condition. Finally, exploiting the matrix model representation of these Wilson loops, we study the large-$N$ limit at strong coupling of $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal QCD, finding a surprising transition in the vacuum expectation value for a critical opening angle.</description>

      <title>Selection rules for RG flows of minimal models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16587v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Minimal d=2 CFTs are usually classified through modular invariant partition functions. There is a finer classification of ``non complete'' models when S-duality is not imposed. We approach this classification by starting with the local chiral algebra and adding primaries sequentially. At each step, we only impose locality (T-duality) and closure of the operator algebra. For each chiral algebra, this produces a tree-like graph. Each tree node corresponds to a local d=2 CFT, with an intrinsic Jones index measuring the size of Haag duality violation. This index can be computed with the partition function and is related to the total quantum dimension of the category of superselection sectors of the node, and to the relative size between the node and a modular invariant completion. In this way, we find in a very explicit manner a classification of local minimal (c&lt;1) d=2 CFTs. When appropriate, this matches Kawahigashi-Longo's previous results. We use this finer classification to constrain RG flows. For a relevant perturbation, the flow can be restricted to the subalgebra associated with it, typically corresponding to a non-modular invariant node in the tree. The structure of the graph above such node needs to be preserved by the RG flow. In particular, the superselection sector category for the node must be preserved. This gives selection rules that recover in a unified fashion several known facts while unraveling new ones.</description>

      <title>Symbolic Approximations to Ricci-flat Metrics Via Extrinsic Symmetries of Calabi-Yau Hypersurfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19778v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ever since Yau's non-constructive existence proof of Ricci-flat metrics on Calabi-Yau manifolds, finding their explicit construction remains a major obstacle to development of both string theory and algebraic geometry. Recent computational approaches employ machine learning to create novel neural representations for approximating these metrics, offering high accuracy but limited interpretability. In this paper, we analyse machine learning approximations to flat metrics of Fermat Calabi-Yau n-folds and some of their one-parameter deformations in three dimensions in order to discover their new properties. We formalise cases in which the flat metric has more symmetries than the underlying manifold, and prove that these symmetries imply that the flat metric admits a surprisingly compact representation for certain choices of complex structure moduli. We show that such symmetries uniquely determine the flat metric on certain loci, for which we present an analytic form. We also incorporate our theoretical results into neural networks to reduce Ricci curvature for multiple Calabi--Yau manifolds compared to previous machine learning approaches. We conclude by distilling the ML models to obtain for the first time closed form expressions for Kahler metrics with near-zero scalar curvature.</description>

Abstract: This work explores holographic correlators within the frameworks of two-dimensional Boundary Conformal Field Theory (BCFT) and Crosscap Conformal Field Theory (XCFT). Utilizing the AdS/CFT correspondence, we compute stress tensor correlators in BCFT, considering both tensionless and tensionful end-of-the-world (EOW) brane scenarios. We derive recurrence relations for two-point and three-point correlators and examine the impact of non-zero brane tension on correlators. Extending these results, we investigate the holographic duals of XCFTs, presenting explicit scalar and stress tensor correlator computations on projective geometries such as $\mathbb{RP}^2$. Additionally, we analyze stress tensor correlators at a finite cutoff, uncovering deformations to one-point and two-point functions induced by the cutoff. Our findings provide novel insights into the holographic structures of BCFT and XCFT while laying the groundwork for future research into higher-dimensional extensions.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the emergence of geometric phases in chiral transformations within gauge theories coupled to fermions. We begin by analyzing the Schwinger model in (1+1) dimensions, where chiral symmetry is explicitly modified due to the dynamical generation of a photon mass. This model provides a controlled setting to study the interplay between anomalies and vacuum structure.
  Building on these insights, we extend our analysis to four-dimensional QED by promoting the vacuum angle $\theta$ to a dynamical field $\theta(x)$. This generalization allows us to explore how the axial anomaly and the presence of a nontrivial vacuum structure modify the conventional chiral symmetry.
  Using the adiabatic approximation, we demonstrate that chiral transformations are modified by the emergence of a nontrivial Berry phase, which introduces a geometric correction that depends on the topological properties of the vacuum. This result suggests that chiral transformations acquire an effective gauge structure in parameter space, in the presence of a dynamical $\theta(x)$ field, leading to new physical consequences at low energies.
  This framework establishes a novel connection between chiral symmetries, anomalies, and geometric phases, offering a unified approach to describing topological effects, vacuum structure, and infrared modifications in gauge theories with fermions. Moreover, our results suggest that Berry phases play a crucial role in the infrared structure of QED, potentially providing a mechanism for regularizing infrared divergences in theories with axial anomalies.</description>

      <title>Autonomous systems and attractor behaviors in non-metricity gravity: stability analysis and cosmic acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05455v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The cosmological dynamics are rigorously investigated through the systematic application of autonomous system analysis to the gravitational field equations in non-metricity gravity. The systematic procedure to analyze the late-time cosmic acceleration in higher-order non-metricity gravity is demonstrated by exploring non-hyperbolic critical points with the center manifold theory. The stability properties of these critical points are also evaluated based on the analysis of eigenvalues and phase portraits. It is explicitly shown that the stable node can be realized. The critical points of each model are individually analyzed, and their corresponding cosmological implications are derived. The stability properties of these critical points are evaluated based on the analysis of eigenvalues and phase portraits, revealing that each model includes at least one stable node. Furthermore, the evolution plots of the cosmological parameters confirm the models capacity to exhibit accelerated expansion.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Potential of the Polyakov Loop in SU(3) Quenched Lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17335v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using SU(3) lattice QCD, we study for the first time the effective potential of the Polyakov loop $\langle P \rangle$ at finite temperature, i.e., the thermodynamic potential, in the field-theoretical way. In the framework of the reweighting method in lattice QCD, we express the effective potential $V_{\rm eff}(\langle P \rangle)$ using the expectation value without a source term. In particular, we consider the most difficult and interesting case of vacuum coexistence at the critical temperature $T_c$. We adopt SU(3) quenched lattice QCD on $48^3 \times 6$ at $\beta$= 5.89379, which corresponds exactly to the critical temperature $T_c$ of the deconfinement phase transition, and use 200,000 Monte Carlo configurations. After categorizing the gauge configurations into one $Z_3$-symmetric and three $Z_3$-broken vacua each, we perform a vacuum-associated reweighting method, using the gauge configurations around each vacuum separately. Finally, we obtain the Polyakov-loop effective potential, which is well depicted around the $Z_3$-symmetric and $Z_3$-broken vacua.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06285v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Utilizing an emergent metric developed from deep learning techniques, we determine the complex potential associated with static quarkonium. This study explores the disintegration process of quarkonium by analyzing the real component of this potential, which is crucial for understanding its stability in various conditions. We show that the dissociation length, the critical distance at which a quark and antiquark pair disintegrate, decreases as the temperature increases. Furthermore, our assessment of the imaginary component of the potential indicates an increase in the magnitude of the imaginary potential for quarkonium as temperatures rise. This enhancement contributes to the quarkonium's suppression within the quark-gluon plasma, mirroring the anticipated outcomes from QCD. Our findings not only confirm the theoretical predictions but also demonstrate the efficacy of deep learning methods in advancing our understanding of high-energy particle physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07839v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rotating bosonic dark matter halos are considered as potential candidates for modeling dark matter in galactic halos. These bosonic dark matter halos can be viewed as a dilute and very extended version of bosonic stars, and the methods used for the calculation and analysis of the latter objects can be directly applied. Bosonic stars, a hypothetical type of astrophysical objects, are categorized into two primary families, based on the nature of the particles composing them: Einstein-Klein-Gordon stars and Proca stars. We examine various models from both families and the rotation curves which their contribution induces in different galaxies, to identify the most plausible candidates that explain the flattening of orbital velocities observed in galactic halos. By exploring different combinations of our dark matter models with observable galactic features, we propose an interesting source to compensate for the apparent lack of matter in dwarf and spiral galaxies, providing a possible explanation for this longstanding astronomical puzzle.</description>

      <title>A mechanism to generate varying speed of light via Higgs-dilaton coupling: Theory and cosmological applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02583v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We allow the Higgs field $\Phi$ to interact with a dilaton field $\chi$ of the background spacetime via the coupling $\chi^2\,\Phi^\dagger\Phi$. Upon spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking, the Higgs VEV becomes proportional to $\chi$. While traditionally this linkage is employed to make the Planck mass and particle masses dependent on $\chi$, we present an $\textit alternative$ mechanism: the Higgs VEV will be used to construct Planck's constant $\hbar$ and speed of light $c$. Specifically, each open set vicinity of a given point $x^*$ on the spacetime manifold is equipped with a replica of the Glashow-Weinberg-Salam action operating with its own effective values of $\hbar_*$ and $c_*$ per $\hbar_*\propto\chi^{-1/2}(x^*)$ and $c_*\propto\chi^{1/2}(x^*)$, causing these ``fundamental constants'' to vary alongside the dynamical field $\chi$. Moreover, in each open set around $x^*$, the prevailing value $\chi(x^*)$ determines the length and time scales for physical processes occurring in this region as $l\propto\chi^{-1}(x^*)$ and $\tau\propto\chi^{-3/2}(x^*)$. This leads to an $\textit anisotropic$ relation $\tau^{-1}\propto l^{-3/2}$ between the rate of clocks and the length of rods, resulting in a distinct set of novel physical phenomena. For late-time cosmology, the variation of $c$ along the trajectory of light waves from distant supernovae towards the Earth-based observer necessitates modifications to the Lema\^itre redshift relation and the Hubble law. These modifications are capable of: (1) Accounting for the Pantheon Catalog of SNeIa $\textit{through a declining speed of light in an expanding Einstein--de Sitter universe}$, thus avoiding the need for dark energy; (2) Revitalizing Blanchard-Douspis-Rowan-Robinson-Sarkar's CMB power spectrum analysis that bypassed dark energy [A&amp;A 412, 35 (2003)]; and (3) Resolving the $H_0$ tension without requiring a dynamical dark energy component.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of Rotating AdS black holes in Kaniadakis statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08325v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we advance the understanding of thermodynamic properties and phase transitions in rotating anti-de Sitter (AdS) black holes by applying the Kaniadakis(KD) entropy framework. This framework represents a non-extensive generalization of classical statistical mechanics, inspired by the symmetries of relativity and offering a novel perspective on black hole thermodynamics. Our focus is on investigating how Kaniadakis entropy modifies the thermodynamic phase space of rotating AdS black holes. To achieve this, we analyze three prominent rotating AdS black hole systems: the Kerr AdS black hole, the Kerr-Sen AdS black hole, and the Kerr-Newman AdS black hole. We assess their thermodynamic quantities, phase transitions, thermodynamic topology and thermodynamic geometry within the Kaniadakis statistical framework. Our analysis reveals notable deviations from the behaviour predicted by traditional Gibbs-Boltzmann(GB) statistics.</description>

      <title>Regulating Sommerfeld resonances for multi-state systems and higher partial waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18168v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Long-range attractive interactions between dark matter particles can significantly enhance their annihilation, particularly at low velocities. This ``Sommerfeld enhancement'' is typically computed by evaluating the deformation of the two-particle wavefunction due to the long-range potential, while ignoring the physics associated with the annihilation, and then scaling the appropriate annihilation matrix elements by factors that depend on the wavefunction in the limit where the particles approach zero relative separation. It has long been recognized that this approach is a valid approximation only in the limit where the annihilation rate is small, and breaks down in the regime where the enhanced annihilation rate approaches the unitarity bound, in which case ignoring the impact of the annihilation physics on the two-particle wavefunction cannot be justified and leads to apparent violations of unitarity. In the case where the physics relevant to annihilation occurs at a parametrically shorter distance scale (higher energy scale) compared with the long-range potential, we provide a simple prescription for correcting the Sommerfeld enhancement for the effects of the short-range physics, valid for all partial waves and for systems where multiple states are coupled by the long-range potential.</description>

      <title>The maximum radiated energy and final spin of high speed collision of two black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20239v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We performed a series of 769 full numerical simulations of high energy collision of black holes to search for the maximum gravitational energy emitted $E_{rad}$, during their merger. We consider equal mass binaries with spins pointing along their orbital angular momentum $\vec{L}$ and perform a search over impact parameters $b$ and initial linear momenta $p/m=\gamma v$ to find the maximum $E_{rad}$ for a given spin $\vec{S}$. The total radiated energy proves to have a weak dependence on the intrinsic spin $s$ of the holes, for the sequence $s=+0.8, 0.0, -0.8$ studied here. We thus estimate the maximum $E_{rad}^{max}/M_{ADM}\approx32\%\pm2\%$ for these direct merger encounters. We also explore the radiated angular momentum and the maximum spin of the merger remnant (within these configurations), finding $\alpha_f^{max}=0.987$. We then use the zero frequency limit expansion to analytically model the radiated energy in the small impact parameter and large initial linear momentum regime.</description>

      <title>Self-Gravity Effects of Ultralight Boson Clouds Formed by Black Hole Superradiance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21442v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Oscillating clouds of ultralight bosons can grow around spinning black holes through superradiance, extracting energy and angular momentum, and eventually dissipating through gravitational radiation. Gravitational wave detectors like LIGO, Virgo, KAGRA, and LISA can thus probe the existence of ultralight bosons. In this study, we use fully general-relativistic solutions of the black hole-boson cloud systems to study the self-gravity effects of scalar and vector boson clouds, making only the simplifying assumption that the spacetime is axisymmetric (essentially corresponding to taking an oscillation average). We calculate the self-gravity shift in the cloud oscillation frequency, which determines the frequency evolution of the gravitational wave signal, finding that this effect can be up to twice as large in the relativistic regime compared to non-relativistic estimates. We use this to improve the superrad waveform model, and estimate that this reduces the theoretical phase error to a few cycles over the characteristic timescale of the gravitational wave emission timescale for the louder vector boson signals. We also perform an analysis of the spacetime geometry of these systems, calculating how the cloud changes the innermost stable circular orbit and light-ring around the black hole.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23471v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe the chiral transition for the quark condensate and the melting of scalar and vector mesons in two-flavor holographic QCD. This is done by extending the improved holographic soft wall models proposed in [1] to finite temperature, by means of introducing an asymptotically AdS black brane. We find that the chiral transition is second order in the chiral limit and a crossover for physical quark masses, as expected in two-flavor QCD. We investigate the melting of vector and scalar mesons in the deconfined plasma through the calculation of hadronic spectral functions. Fixing the model parameters by the meson spectrum at zero temperature, we find that the mesons melt at temperatures between $90$ and $110$ MeV and the chiral transition occurs around $129$ MeV. We also provide a prediction for the hydrodynamic diffusion constant associated with a flavor current in the deconfined plasma.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the Berry phase arising from axion-photon and axion-fermion interactions. The effective Hamiltonians in both systems share the same form, enabling a unified description of the Berry phase and providing a novel perspective on axion experiments. We conceptually propose a new photon-ring experiment for axion detection. Furthermore, we demonstrate that measuring the axion-induced Berry phase offers a unique method for probing the global structure of the Standard Model gauge group and axion-related generalized symmetries.</description>

      <title>New analysis of SNeIa Pantheon Catalog: Variable speed of light as an alternative to dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05262v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In A&amp;A 412, 35 (2003) Blanchard, Douspis, Rowan-Robinson, and Sarkar (BDRS) slightly modified the primordial fluctuation spectrum and produced an excellent fit to WMAP's CMB power spectrum for an Einstein-de Sitter (EdS) universe, bypassing dark energy. Curiously, they obtained a Hubble value of $H_0\approx46$, in sharp conflict with the canonical range $H_0\sim67-73$. However, we will demonstrate that the reduced value of $H_0\approx46$ achieved by BDRS is fully compatible with the use of variable speed of light in analyzing the late-time cosmic acceleration observed in Type Ia supernovae (SNeIa). In Phys. Lett. B 862, 139357 (2025) we uncovered a hidden aspect in a generic class of scale-invariant actions: the dynamics of the dilaton can induce a variation in the speed of light as $c\propto\chi^{1/2}$, causing $c$ to vary alongside $\chi$ across spacetime. For an EdS universe with varying $c$, besides the effects of cosmic expansion, light waves emitted from distant SNeIa are further subject to a refraction effect, which alters the Lemaitre redshift relation to $1+z=a^{-3/2}$. Based on this new formula, we achieve a fit to the SNeIa Pantheon Catalog exceeding the quality of the $\Lambda$CDM model. Crucially, our approach does not require dark energy and produces $H_0=47.2$ in strong alignment with the BDRS finding of $H_0\approx46$. Hence, BDRS's analysis of the (early-time) CMB power spectrum and our variable-$c$ analysis of the (late-time) Hubble diagram of SNeIa fully agree on two counts: (i) the dark energy hypothesis is avoided, and (ii) $H_0$ is reduced to $\sim47$, which also yields an age $t_0=2/(3H_0)=13.8$ Gy for an EdS universe, without requiring dark energy. Most importantly, we will demonstrate that the late-time acceleration can be attributed to the declining speed of light in an expanding EdS universe, rather than to a dark energy component.</description>

      <title>Significant circular Unruh effect at small acceleration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19454v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the transition rates of an atom rotating in a circular orbit, which is coupled with fluctuating electromagnetic fields in vacuum. We find that when the rotational angular velocity exceeds the transition frequency of the atom, the excitation rate can reach the same order of magnitude as the emission rate, even with an extremely low centripetal acceleration resulting from a very small orbital radius. For experimentally accessible centripetal accelerations, the excitation rate of centripetally accelerated atoms can be $10^{272,878}$ times greater than that of linearly accelerated atoms with the same magnitude of acceleration. Our result suggests that the circular version of the Unruh effect can be significant even at very small centripetal accelerations, contrary to the common belief that a large Unruh effect requires large acceleration. This finding sheds new light on the experimental detection of the circular Unruh effect.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we show that a gauge-theoretic description of Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity naturally yields a Henneaux-Teitelboim (HT) unimodular gravity via a central extension of its isometry group, valid for both flat and curved two-dimensional spacetimes. HT gravity introduces a unimodular time canonically conjugate to the cosmological constant, serving as a physical time in quantum cosmology. By studying the mini-superspace reduction of $\text{HT}_2$ gravity, the Wheeler-DeWitt equation becomes a Schr\"odinger-like equation, giving a consistent and unitary quantum theory. Analysis of the wavefunction's probability density reveals a quantum distribution for the scale factor $a$, offering a quantum perspective on the expansion and contraction of the universe. In this perspective, the possibility of reaching the singular point $a=0$ signals that topology change could occur. Finally, we give a consistent quantum description of unimodular time that aligns seamlessly with Page-Wootters formulation of quantum mechanics, where quantum correlations between unimodular time and JT gravity are studied in $\text{HT}_2$ quantum cosmology.</description>

      <title>A New $\sim 5\sigma$ Tension at Characteristic Redshift from DESI-DR1 BAO and DES-SN5YR Observations</title>

Abstract: We perform a model-independent reconstruction of the angular diameter distance ($D_{A}$) using the Multi-Task Gaussian Process (MTGP) framework with DESI-DR1 BAO and DES-SN5YR datasets. We calibrate the comoving sound horizon at the baryon drag epoch $r_d$ to the Planck best-fit value, ensuring consistency with early-universe physics. With the reconstructed $D_A$ at two key redshifts, $z\sim 1.63$ (where $D_{A}^{\prime} =0$) and at $z\sim 0.512$ (where $D_{A}^{\prime} = D_{A}$), we derive the expansion rate of the Universe $H(z)$ at these redshifts. Our findings reveal that at $z\sim 1.63$, the $H(z)$ is fully consistent with the Planck-2018 $\Lambda$CDM prediction, confirming no new physics at that redshift. However, at $z \sim 0.512$, the derived $H(z)$ shows a more than $5\sigma$ discrepancy with the Planck-2018 $\Lambda$CDM prediction, suggesting a possible breakdown of the $\Lambda$CDM model as constrained by Planck-2018 at this lower redshift. This emerging $\sim 5\sigma$ tension at $z\sim 0.512$, distinct from the existing ``Hubble Tension'', may signal the first strong evidence for new physics at low redshifts.</description>

      <title>Compactification of Anisotropies in Einstein-Scalar-Gauss-Bonnet Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07260v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the evolution of anisotropies in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory with a scalar field coupled to the Gauss-Bonnet term. Specifically, we examine the simplest scenario in which the scalar field lacks a kinetic term, and its kinetic contribution arises from an integration by parts of the Gauss-Bonnet scalar. We consider four- and five-dimensional anisotropic spacetimes, focusing on Bianchi I and extended Bianchi I geometries. Our study reveals that the asymptotic solutions correspond to locally symmetric spacetimes where at least two scale factors exhibit analogous behavior or, alternatively, to isotropic configurations where all scale factors evolve identically. Additionally, we discuss the effects of a cosmological constant, finding that the presence of the cosmological constant does not lead to an isotropic universe.</description>
