      <title>Social Cyber Geographical Worldwide Inventory of Bots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social Cyber Geography is the space in the digital cyber realm that is produced through social relations. Communication in the social media ecosystem happens not only because of human interactions, but is also fueled by algorithmically controlled bot agents. Most studies have not looked at the social cyber geography of bots because they focus on bot activity within a single country. Since creating a bot uses universal programming technology, bots, how prevalent are these bots throughout the world? To quantify bot activity worldwide, we perform a multilingual and geospatial analysis on a large dataset of social data collected from X during the Coronavirus pandemic in 2021. This pandemic affected most of the world, and thus is a common topic of discussion. Our dataset consists of ~100 mil posts generated by ~31mil users. Most bot studies focus only on English-speaking countries, because most bot detection algorithms are built for the English language. However, only 47\% of the bots write in the English language. To accommodate multiple languages in our bot detection algorithm, we built Multilingual BotBuster, a multi-language bot detection algorithm to identify the bots in this diverse dataset. We also create a Geographical Location Identifier to swiftly identify the countries a user affiliates with in his description. Our results show that bots can appear to move from one country to another, but the language they write in remains relatively constant. Bots distribute narratives on distinct topics related to their self-declared country affiliation. Finally, despite the diverse distribution of bot locations around the world, the proportion of bots per country is about 20%. Our work stresses the importance of a united analysis of the cyber and physical realms, where we combine both spheres to inventorize the language and location of social media bots and understand communication strategies.</description>

      <title>Modelling Infodemics on a Global Scale: A 30 Countries Study using Epidemiological and Social Listening Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infodemics are a threat to public health, arising from multiple interacting phenomena occurring both online and offline. The continuous feedback loops between the digital information ecosystem and offline contingencies make infodemics particularly challenging to define operationally, measure, and eventually model in quantitative terms. In this study, we present evidence of the effect of various epidemic-related variables on the dynamics of infodemics, using a robust modelling framework applied to data from 30 countries across diverse income groups. We use WHO COVID-19 surveillance data on new cases and deaths, vaccination data from the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker, infodemic data (volume of public conversations and social media content) from the WHO EARS platform, and Google Trends data to represent information demand. Our findings show that new deaths are the strongest predictor of the infodemic, measured as new document production including social media content and public conversations, and that the epidemic burden in neighbouring countries appears to have a greater impact on document production than the domestic one. Building on these results, we propose a taxonomy that highlights country-specific discrepancies between the evolution of the infodemic and the epidemic. Further, an analysis of the temporal evolution of the relationship between the two phenomena quantifies how much the discussions around vaccine rollouts may have shaped the development of the infodemic. The insights from our quantitative model contribute to advancing infodemic research, highlighting the importance of a holistic approach integrating both online and offline dimensions.</description>

      <title>Analysis and predictability of centrality measures in competition networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Common Out-Neighbor (or CON) score quantifies shared influence through outgoing links in competitive contexts. A dynamic analysis of competition networks reveals the CON score as a powerful predictor of node rankings. Defined in first-order and second-order forms, the CON score captures both direct and indirect competitive interactions, offering a comprehensive metric for evaluating node influence. Using datasets from Survivor, Chess.com, and Dota~2 online gaming competitions, directed competition networks are constructed, and the dynamic CON score is integrated into supervised machine learning models. Empirical results show that the CON score consistently outperforms traditional centrality measures such as PageRank, closeness, and betweenness centrality in classification tasks.
  By integrating dynamic centrality measures with machine learning, our proposed methodology accurately predicts outcomes in competition networks. The findings underline the CON score's robustness as a feature in node classification, offering a significant advancement in understanding and analyzing competitive interactions.</description>

      <title>Divergent Emotional Patterns in Disinformation on Social Media? An Analysis of Tweets and TikToks about the DANA in Valencia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the dissemination of disinformation on social media platforms during the DANA event (DANA is a Spanish acronym for Depresion Aislada en Niveles Altos, translating to high-altitude isolated depression) that resulted in extremely heavy rainfall and devastating floods in Valencia, Spain, on October 29, 2024. We created a novel dataset of 650 TikTok and X posts, which was manually annotated to differentiate between disinformation and trustworthy content. Additionally, a Few-Shot annotation approach with GPT-4o achieved substantial agreement (Cohen's kappa of 0.684) with manual labels. Emotion analysis revealed that disinformation on X is mainly associated with increased sadness and fear, while on TikTok, it correlates with higher levels of anger and disgust. Linguistic analysis using the LIWC dictionary showed that trustworthy content utilizes more articulate and factual language, whereas disinformation employs negations, perceptual words, and personal anecdotes to appear credible. Audio analysis of TikTok posts highlighted distinct patterns: trustworthy audios featured brighter tones and robotic or monotone narration, promoting clarity and credibility, while disinformation audios leveraged tonal variation, emotional depth, and manipulative musical elements to amplify engagement. In detection models, SVM+TF-IDF achieved the highest F1-Score, excelling with limited data. Incorporating audio features into roberta-large-bne improved both Accuracy and F1-Score, surpassing its text-only counterpart and SVM in Accuracy. GPT-4o Few-Shot also performed well, showcasing the potential of large language models for automated disinformation detection. These findings demonstrate the importance of leveraging both textual and audio features for improved disinformation detection on multimodal platforms like TikTok.</description>

      <title>Neural Graph Pattern Machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph learning tasks require models to comprehend essential substructure patterns relevant to downstream tasks, such as triadic closures in social networks and benzene rings in molecular graphs. Due to the non-Euclidean nature of graphs, existing graph neural networks (GNNs) rely on message passing to iteratively aggregate information from local neighborhoods. Despite their empirical success, message passing struggles to identify fundamental substructures, such as triangles, limiting its expressiveness. To overcome this limitation, we propose the Neural Graph Pattern Machine (GPM), a framework designed to learn directly from graph patterns. GPM efficiently extracts and encodes substructures while identifying the most relevant ones for downstream tasks. We also demonstrate that GPM offers superior expressivity and improved long-range information modeling compared to message passing. Empirical evaluations on node classification, link prediction, graph classification, and regression show the superiority of GPM over state-of-the-art baselines. Further analysis reveals its desirable out-of-distribution robustness, scalability, and interpretability. We consider GPM to be a step toward going beyond message passing.</description>

      <title>Analyzing Classroom Interaction Data Using Prompt Engineering and Network Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classroom interactions play a vital role in developing critical thinking, collaborative problem-solving abilities, and enhanced learning outcomes. While analyzing these interactions is crucial for improving educational practices, the examination of classroom dialogues presents significant challenges due to the complexity and high-dimensionality of conversational data. This study presents an integrated framework that combines prompt engineering with network analysis to investigate classroom interactions comprehensively. Our approach automates utterance classification through prompt engineering, enabling efficient and scalable dialogue analysis without requiring pre-labeled datasets. The classified interactions are subsequently transformed into network representations, facilitating the analysis of classroom dynamics as structured social networks. To uncover complex interaction patterns and how underlying interaction structures relate to student learning, we utilize network mediation analysis. In this approach, latent interaction structures, derived from the additive and multiplicative effects network (AMEN) model that places students within a latent social space, act as mediators. In particular, we investigate how the gender gap in mathematics performance may be mediated by students' classroom interaction structures.</description>

      <title>CPU vs. GPU for Community Detection: Performance Insights from GVE-Louvain and $\nu$-Louvain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Community detection involves identifying natural divisions in networks, a crucial task for many large-scale applications. This report presents GVE-Louvain, one of the most efficient multicore implementations of the Louvain algorithm, a high-quality method for community detection. Running on a dual 16-core Intel Xeon Gold 6226R server, GVE-Louvain outperforms Vite, Grappolo, NetworKit Louvain, and cuGraph Louvain (on an NVIDIA A100 GPU) by factors of 50x, 22x, 20x, and 5.8x, respectively, achieving a processing rate of 560M edges per second on a 3.8B-edge graph. Additionally, it scales efficiently, improving performance by 1.6x for every thread doubling. The paper also presents $\nu$-Louvain, a GPU-based implementation. When evaluated on an NVIDIA A100 GPU, $\nu$-Louvain performs only on par with GVE-Louvain, largely due to reduced workload and parallelism in later algorithmic passes. These results suggest that CPUs, with their flexibility in handling irregular workloads, may be better suited for community detection tasks.</description>

      <title>The Atlas for the Aspiring Network Scientist</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.00863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2101.00863v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Network science is the field dedicated to the investigation and analysis of complex systems via their representations as networks. We normally model such networks as graphs: sets of nodes connected by sets of edges and a number of node and edge attributes. This deceptively simple object is the starting point of never-ending complexity, due to its ability to represent almost every facet of reality: chemical interactions, protein pathways inside cells, neural connections inside the brain, scientific collaborations, financial relations, citations in art history, just to name a few examples. If we hope to make sense of complex networks, we need to master a large analytic toolbox: graph and probability theory, linear algebra, statistical physics, machine learning, combinatorics, and more.
  This book aims at providing the first access to all these tools. It is intended as an "Atlas", because its interest is not in making you a specialist in using any of these techniques. Rather, after reading this book, you will have a general understanding about the existence and the mechanics of all these approaches. You can use such an understanding as the starting point of your own career in the field of network science. This has been, so far, an interdisciplinary endeavor. The founding fathers of this field come from many different backgrounds: mathematics, sociology, computer science, physics, history, digital humanities, and more. This Atlas is charting your path to be something different from all of that: a pure network scientist.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the MrDeepFakes Sexual Deepfake Marketplace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11100v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The prevalence of sexual deepfake material has exploded over the past several years. Attackers create and utilize deepfakes for many reasons: to seek sexual gratification, to harass and humiliate targets, or to exert power over an intimate partner. In part enabling this growth, several markets have emerged to support the buying and selling of sexual deepfake material. In this paper, we systematically characterize the most prominent and mainstream marketplace, MrDeepFakes. We analyze the marketplace economics, the targets of created media, and user discussions of how to create deepfakes, which we use to understand the current state-of-the-art in deepfake creation. Our work uncovers little enforcement of posted rules (e.g., limiting targeting to well-established celebrities), previously undocumented attacker motivations, and unexplored attacker tactics for acquiring resources to create sexual deepfakes.</description>

      <title>Towards Graph Foundation Models: Learning Generalities Across Graphs via Task-Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16441v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Foundation models aim to create general, cross-task, and cross-domain machine learning models by pretraining on large-scale datasets to capture shared patterns or concepts, such as contours, colors, textures, and edges in images, or tokens, words, and sentences in text. However, identifying generalities across graph-structured data remains a significant challenge, as different graph-based tasks necessitate distinct inductive biases, thereby impeding the development of graph foundation models. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel approach for learning cross-task generalities in graphs. Specifically, we propose task-trees as basic learning instances to align task spaces (node, link, graph) on graphs. Then, we conduct a theoretical analysis to examine their stability, transferability, and generalization. Our findings indicate that when a graph neural network (GNN) is pretrained on diverse task-trees using a reconstruction objective, it acquires transferable knowledge, enabling effective adaptation to downstream tasks with an appropriate set of fine-tuning samples. To empirically validate this approach, we develop a pretrained graph model based on task-trees, termed Graph Generality Identifier on Task-Trees (GIT). Extensive experiments demonstrate that a single pretrained GIT model can be effectively adapted to over 30 different graphs across five domains via fine-tuning, in-context learning, or zero-shot learning. Our data and code are available at https://github.com/Zehong-Wang/GIT.</description>
