      <title>End-to-End Multi-Track Reconstruction using Graph Neural Networks at Belle II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the study of an end-to-end multi-track reconstruction algorithm for the central drift chamber of the Belle II experiment at the SuperKEKB collider using Graph Neural Networks for an unknown number of particles. The algorithm uses detector hits as inputs without pre-filtering to simultaneously predict the number of track candidates in an event and and their kinematic properties. In a second step, we cluster detector hits for each track candidate to pass to a track fitting algorithm. Using a realistic full detector simulation including beam-induced backgrounds and detector noise taken from actual collision data, we find significant improvements in track finding efficiencies for tracks in a variety of different event topologies compared to the existing baseline algorithm used in Belle II. For events with a hypothetical long-lived massive particle with a mass in the GeV-range decaying uniformly along its flight direction into two charged particles, the GNN achieves a combined track finding and fitting efficiency of 85.4% with a fake rate of 2.5%, compared to 52.2% and 4.1% for the baseline algorithm. This is the first end-to-end multi-track machine learning algorithm for a drift chamber detector that has been utilized in a realistic particle physics environment.</description>

      <title>uRWELL detector developments at Jefferson Lab for high luminosity experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the future plans at Jefferson Lab is running electron scattering experiments with large acceptance detectors at luminosities $&gt; 10^{37}cm^{-2}s^{-1}$. These experiments allow the measurements of the Double Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering (DDVCS) reaction, an important physics process in the formalism of Generalized Parton Distributions, which has never been measured because of its small cross-section. The luminosity upgrade of CLAS12 or the SOLID detector makes Jefferson Lab a unique place to measure DDVCS. One of the important components of these high luminosity detectors is a tracking system that can withstand high rates of $\approx 1MHz/cm^{2}$. The recently developed Micro-Resistive Well (uRWELL) detector technology is a promising option for such a tracking detector by combining good position resolutions, low material budget with simple mechanical construction, and low production costs. In this proceeding, we will discuss recent developments and studies with uRWELL detectors at Jefferson Lab for future upgrades of the CLAS12 detector to study the DDVCS reaction.</description>

      <title>The SABRE South Technical Design Report Executive Summary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this Technical Design Report (TDR) we describe the SABRE South detector to be built at the Stawell Underground Physics Laboratory (SUPL). The SABRE South detector is designed to test the long-standing DAMA/LIBRA signal of an annually modulating rate consistent with dark matter by using the same target material. SABRE South uses seven ultra-high purity NaI(Tl) crystals (with a total target mass of either 35 kg or 50 kg), hermetically sealed in copper enclosures that are suspended within a liquid scintillator active veto. High quantum efficiency and low background Hamamatsu R11065 photomultiplier tubes are directly coupled to both ends of the crystal, and enclosed with the crystal in an oxygen free high thermal conductivity copper enclosure. The active veto system consists of 11.6 kL of linear alkylbenzene (LAB) doped with a mixture of fluorophores and contained in a steel vessel, which is instrumented with at least 18 Hamamatsu R5912 photomultipliers. The active veto tags key radiogenic backgrounds intrinsic to the crystals, such as ${^{40}}$K, and is expected to suppress the total background by 27% in the 1-6 keV region of interest. In addition to the liquid scintillator veto, a muon veto is positioned above the detector shielding. This muon veto consists of eight EJ-200 scintillator modules, with Hamamatsu R13089 photomultipliers coupled to both ends. With an expected total background of 0.72 cpd/kg/keV, SABRE South can test the DAMA/LIBRA signal with 5$\sigma$ discovery or 3$\sigma$ exclusion after two years of data taking.</description>

      <title>Maximizing Quantum Enhancement in Axion Dark Matter Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a comprehensive comparison of linear amplifiers and microwave photon-counters in axion dark matter experiments. The study is done assuming a range of realistic operating conditions and detector parameters, over the frequency range between 1--30 GHz. As expected, photon counters are found to be advantageous under low background, at high frequencies ($\nu&gt;$ 5 GHz), {\em if} they can be implemented with robust wide-frequency tuning or a very low dark count rate. Additional noteworthy observations emerging from this study include: (1) an expanded applicability of off-resonance photon background reduction, including the single-quadrature state squeezing, for scan rate enhancements; (2) a much broader appeal for operating the haloscope resonators in the over-coupling regime, up to $\beta\sim 10$; (3) the need for a detailed investigation into the cryogenic and electromagnetic conditions inside haloscope cavities to lower the photon temperature for future experiments; (4) the necessity to develop a distributed network of coupling ports in high-volume axion haloscopes to utilize these potential gains in the scan rate.</description>

      <title>Physics Performance and Detector Requirements at an Asymmetric Higgs Factory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hybrid Asymmetric Linear Higgs Factory (HALHF) proposes a shorter and cheaper design for a future Higgs factory. It reaches a $\sqrt{s} = 250$ GeV using a 500 GeV electron beam accelerated by an electron-driven plasma wake-field, and a conventionally-accelerated 31 GeV positron beam. Assuming plasma acceleration R&amp;D challenges are solved in a timely manner, the asymmetry of the collisions brings additional challenges regarding the detector and the physics analyses, from forward boosted topologies and beam backgrounds. This contribution will detail the impact of beam parameters on beam-induced backgrounds, and provide a first look at what modification compared to e.g. the ILD can improve the physics performance at such a facility. The studies will be benchmarked against some flagship Higgs Factory analyses for comparison.</description>

      <title>Detecting kHz gravitons from a neutron star merger with a multi-mode resonant mass detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16898v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a multi-mode bar consisting of mass elements of decreasing size for the implementation of a gravitational version of the photo-electric effect through the stimulated absorption of up to kHz gravitons from a binary neutron star merger and post-merger. We find that the multi-mode detector has normal modes that retain the coupling strength to the gravitational wave of the largest mass-element, while only having an effective mass comparable to the mass of the smallest element. This allows the normal modes to have graviton absorption rates due to the tonne-scale largest mass, while the single graviton absorption process in the normal mode could be resolved through energy measurements of a mass-element in-principle smaller than pico-gram scale. We argue the feasibility of directly counting gravito-phonons in the bar through energy measurements of the end mass. This improves the transduction of the single-graviton signal, enhancing the feasibility of detecting single gravitons.</description>

      <title>A Digital and Compact High-Precision Locking System for Pulse Laser Repetition Frequency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10092v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel approach that employs error amplification and ADC-based dual-mixer time-difference (ADC-based-DMTD) technique for high-precision locking of laser repetition frequency with compact size. This electronic system consists of two main components: a digitized error amplification module (EAM) and an FPGA-based digital frequency locking module (DFLM). The EAM mainly integrates a configurable frequency generator (CFG), a configurable frequency multiplier (CFM) and a mixer to process the laser pulses and a high-stability reference source (e.g., an atomic clock), enabling high-precision locking of pulse lasers operating at different repetition frequencies. By employing frequency multiplication and mixing, the EAM amplifies the laser's frequency error and performs frequency down-conversion, enhancing measurement sensitivity and reducing the hardware requirements of the back-end. The DFLM receives the EAM outputs by using an ADC-based-DMTD method to precisely measure frequency errors, then the digital proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller provides feedback to achieve accurate frequency locking. Initial testing with a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) demonstrated excellent locking performance, achieving an Allan deviation of $9.58 \times 10^{-14}$ at 10 seconds and a standard deviation (STD) of 7.7 \textmu Hz root mean square (RMS) after locking, marking a five-order-of-magnitude stability enhancement. In laboratory experiments with a custom-built femtosecond fiber laser, the system achieved robust locking of the repetition frequency, with a stability improvement from $1.51 \times 10^{-7}$ to $1.12 \times 10^{-12}$ at a 10-second gate time and an STD of 0.43 mHz RMS after locking.</description>
