      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assuming a weighted Nash type inequality for the generator $-A$ of a Markov semigroup, we prove a weighted Nash type inequality for its fractional power and deduce non-uniform bounds on the transition kernel corresponding to the Markov semigroup generated by $-A^\alpha$.</description>

      <title>Shadowing in the hyperspace of continua</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss whether classical examples of dynamical systems satisfying the shadowing property also satisfy the shadowing property for the induced map on the hyperspace of continua, obtaining both positive and negative results. We prove that transitive Anosov diffeomorphisms, or more generally continuum-wise hyperbolic homeomorphisms, do not satisfy the shadowing property for the induced map on the hyperspace of continua. We prove that dendrite monotone maps satisfy the shadowing property if, and only if, their induced map on the hyperspace of continua also satisfies it. We give some algorithms that show that there are abundant dynamical systems satisfying the shadowing property with dendrites (compact metric trees) as the underlying space. As a consequence, we show that the universal dendrite of order n admits a homeomorphism with the shadowing property.</description>

      <title>Bilateral Bounds for Norms of Solutions and Boundedness/Stability and Instability of Some Nonlinear Systems with Delays and Variable Coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel methodology for evaluating the boundedness, stability, and instability of some vector nonlinear systems with multiple time-varying delays and variable coefficients. The proposed technique develops two scalar counterparts for the initial vector system. The solutions to these scalar nonlinear equations, which also incorporate delays and variable coefficients, provide upper and lower bounds for the norms of solutions to the original vector equations with corresponding history functions. This enables evaluation of the dynamics of a vector system through the analysis of its scalar counterparts. This analysis can be accomplished using simplified analytical reasoning or straightforward simulations, which remain effective even for systems with a large number of coupled equations. Consequently, we introduced some novel boundedness, stability and instability criteria and estimated the radiuses of the balls containing the history functions which stem bounded/stabile solutions to the vector systems. Lastly, we validate our results in representative simulations that also assess their accuracy.</description>

      <title>Invariant Tori and Periodic Orbits in the FitzHugh-Nagumo System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The FitzHugh-Nagumo system is a $4$-parameter family of $3$D vector field used for modeling neural excitation and nerve impulse propagation. The origin represents a Hopf-zero equilibrium in the FitzHugh-Nagumo system for two classes of parameters. In this paper, we employ recent techniques in averaging theory to investigate, besides periodic solutions, the bifurcation of invariant tori within the aforementioned families. We provide explicit generic conditions for the existence of these tori and analyze their stability properties. Furthermore, we employ the backward differentiation formula to solve the stiff differential equations and provide numerical simulations for each of the mentioned results.</description>

      <title>Dynamically syndetic sets and the combinatorics of syndetic, idempotent filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A subset of the positive integers is \emph{dynamically central syndetic} if it contains the set of times that a point returns to a neighborhood of itself under a minimal transformation of a compact metric space. These sets are part of the highly-influential link between dynamics and combinatorics forged by Furstenberg and Weiss in the 1970's. Our main result is a characterization of dynamically central syndetic sets as precisely those sets that belong to syndetic, idempotent filters. Idempotent filters are combinatorial objects that abound in ergodic Ramsey theory but have been largely unnoticed and unexplored. We develop the algebra of these objects for the proof of the main theorem and with an eye toward future applications.
  The main result is best contextualized as a ``global'' analogue to Bergelson and Hindman's ``local'' characterization of Furstenberg's central sets as members of minimal, idempotent ultrafilters. It leads to a dual characterization of sets of topological pointwise recurrence, allowing us to answer a question of Glasner, Tsankov, Weiss, and Zucker. We draw numerous striking contrasts between pointwise recurrence and set recurrence, a topic with a long history in the subject and its applications, and answer four questions posed by Host, Kra, and Maass. We also show that the intersection of a dynamically central syndetic set with a set of pointwise recurrence must be piecewise syndetic, generalizing results of Dong, Glasner, Huang, Shao, Weiss, and Ye.</description>

      <title>Quantitative weak mixing of self-affine tilings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the regularity of spectral measures of dynamical systems arising from a translation action on tilings of substitutive nature. The results are inspired in the work of A. Bufetov and B. Solomyak, where they previously established a log-H\"older modulus of continuity of one-dimensional self-similar tiling systems. We generalize this result to higher dimension in the more general case of self-affine tilings systems. Futher analysis, leads to uniform estimates in the whole space of spectral parameters, allowing to deduce logarithmic rates of weak mixing.</description>

      <title>Role of Coupling Asymmetry in the Fully Disordered Kuramoto Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of phase oscillators in the fully disordered Kuramoto model with couplings of defined asymmetry. The mean-field dynamics is reduced to a self-consistent stochastic single-oscillator problem which we analyze perturbatively and by numerical simulations. We elucidate the influence of the asymmetry on the correlation and response function of the system as well as on the distribution of the order parameter. The so-called volcano transition is shown to be robust with respect to a small degree of coupling asymmetry but to disappear when the antisymmetry in the couplings outweighs the symmetry.</description>

      <title>Antiholomorphic correspondences and mating I: realization theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.02459v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we bring together four different branches of antiholomorphic dynamics: of global anti-rational maps, reflection groups, Schwarz reflections in quadrature domains, and antiholomorphic correspondences. We establish the first general realization theorems for bi-degree $d$:$d$ correspondences on the Riemann sphere (for $d\geq 2$) as matings of maps and groups. To achieve this, we introduce and study the dynamics of a general class of antiholomorphic correspondences; i.e., multi-valued maps with antiholomorphic local branches. Such correspondences are closely related to a class of single-valued antiholomorphic maps in one complex variable; namely, Schwarz reflection maps of simply connected quadrature domains. Using this connection, we prove that matings of all parabolic antiholomorphic rational maps with connected Julia sets (of arbitrary degree) and antiholomorphic analogues of Hecke groups can be realized as such correspondences. We also draw the same conclusion when parabolic maps are replaced with critically non-recurrent antiholomorphic polynomials with connected Julia sets.</description>

      <title>Detecting random bifurcations via rigorous enclosures of large deviations rate functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12556v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main goal of this work is to provide a description of transitions from uniform to non-uniform snychronization in diffusions based on large deviation estimates for finite time Lyapunov exponents. These can be characterized in terms of moment Lyapunov exponents which are principal eigenvalues of the generator of the tilted (Feynman-Kac) semigroup. Using a computer assisted proof, we demonstrate how to determine these eigenvalues and investigate the rate function which is the Legendre-Fenichel transform of the moment Lyapunov function. We apply our results to two case studies: the pitchfork bifurcation and a two-dimensional toy model, also considering the transition to a positive asymptotic Lyapunov exponent.</description>

      <title>Uniform Borel amenability is equivalent to randomized hyperfiniteness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12565v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Whether Borel amenability implies hyperfiniteness is a main open question in the theory of Borel equivalence relations. Under a mild extra uniformity condition, we prove that Borel amenability of bounded degree Borel graphs is equivalent to a randomized version of hyperfiniteness. Our new approach yields simple proofs and generalizations for the Ornstein-Weiss theorem, the Quasi-Tiling theorem and the Connes-Feldman-Weiss theorem. One result is that the main conjecture holds up to a compressible set (that is, a set that admits no invariant probability measure).</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Homology of Brownian motion on a Riemannian manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13215v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove, using the celebrated result by Spitzer about winding of planar Brownian motion, and the existence of harmonic morphisms $f:M\to{\mathbb S}^1$ representing cohomology classes in $\text{H}^1(M,\mathbb Z)$, that there is a stochastic process $H_t:{\mathcal C}(M)\to{\text{Hom}(\text{H}^1(M;\mathbb R), \mathbb R)}\simeq{\text{H}_1(M;\mathbb R)}$ ($t\in[0,\infty)$), where ${\mathcal C}(M)= \{ \alpha:[0, \infty) \to M :\alpha \,\, \text{is continuous} \}$, which has a multivariate Cauchy distribution i.e. such that for each nontrivial cohomology class $[\omega]\in{\text{H}^1(M;\mathbb R), \mathbb R)}$, represented by a closed 1-form $\omega$, in the de Rham cohomology, the process $A^\omega_t:{\mathcal C}(M)\to\mathbb R\,$ ($t\in[0,\infty)$) with $A^\omega_t(B)=H_t(B)([\omega]),\, B\in{\mathcal C}(M)$ converges in distribution, with respect to Wiener measure on ${\mathcal C}(M)$, to a Cauchy's distribution, with parameter 1. The process describes the ``homological winding" of the Brownian paths in $M$, thus it can be regarded as a generalization of Spitzer result. The last section discusses the asymptotic behavior of holonomy along Brownian paths.</description>
