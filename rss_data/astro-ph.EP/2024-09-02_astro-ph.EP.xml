      <title>Separating Super-Puffs vs. Hot Jupiters Among Young Puffy Planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discoveries of close-in young puffy (R$_p \gtrsim$ 6 R$_\oplus$) planets raise the question of whether they are bona fide hot Jupiters or puffed-up Neptunes, potentially placing constraints on the formation location and timescale of hot Jupiters. Obtaining mass measurements for these planets is challenging due to stellar activity and noisy spectra. Therefore, we aim to provide independent theoretical constraints on the masses of these young planets based on their radii, incident fluxes, and ages, benchmarking to the planets of age $&lt;$1 Gyr detected by Kepler, K2 and TESS. Through a combination of interior structure models, considerations of photoevaporative mass loss, and empirical mass-metallicity trends, we present the range of possible masses for 24 planets of age $\sim$10-900 Myr and radii $\sim$6-16 R$_\oplus$. We generally find that our mass estimates are in agreement with the measured masses and upper limits where applicable. There exist some outliers including super-puffs Kepler-51 b, c and V1298 Tau d, b, e, for which we outline their likely formation conditions. Our analyses demonstrate that most of the youngest planets ($\lesssim$ 100 Myr) tend to be puffed-up, Neptune-mass planets, while the true hot Jupiters are typically found around stars aged at least a few hundred Myr, suggesting the dominant origin of hot Jupiters to be late-stage high eccentricity migration.</description>

      <title>The MIRI Exoplanets Orbiting White Dwarfs (MEOW) Survey: Mid-Infrared Excess Reveals a Giant Planet Candidate around a Nearby White Dwarf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The MIRI Exoplanets Orbiting White dwarfs (MEOW) Survey is a cycle 2 JWST program to search for exoplanets around dozens of nearby white dwarfs via infrared excess and direct imaging. In this paper, we present the detection of mid-infrared excess at 18 and 21 microns towards the bright (V = 11.4) metal-polluted white dwarf WD 0310-688. The source of the IR excess is almost certainly within the system; the probability of background contamination is $&lt;0.1\%$. While the IR excess could be due to an unprecedentedly small and cold debris disk, it is best explained by a $3.0^{+5.5}_{-1.9}$ M$_{\rm Jup}$ cold (248$^{+84}_{-61}$ K) giant planet orbiting the white dwarf within the forbidden zone (the region where planets are expected to be destroyed during the star's red giant phase). We constrain the source of the IR excess to an orbital separation of 0.1-2 AU, marking the first discovery of a white dwarf planet candidate within this range of separations. WD 0310-688 is a young remnant of an A or late B-type star, and at just 10.4 pc it is now the closest white dwarf with a known planet candidate. Future JWST observations could distinguish the two scenarios by either detecting or ruling out spectral features indicative of a planet atmosphere.</description>

      <title>gaspery: Optimized Scheduling of Radial Velocity Follow-Up Observations for Active Host Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radial velocity (RV) follow-up is a critical complement of transiting exoplanet surveys like the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS ), both for validating discoveries of exoplanets and measuring their masses. Stellar activity introduces challenges to interpreting these measurements because the noise from the host star, which is often correlated in time, can result in high RV uncertainty. A robust understanding of stellar activity and how its timescales interact with the observing cadence can optimize limited RV resources. For this reason, in the era of over-subscribed, high-precision RV measurements, folding stellar activity timescales into the scheduling of observation campaigns is ideal. We present gaspery, an open-source code implementation to enable the optimization of RV observing strategies. Gaspery employs a generalized formulation of the Fisher Information for RV time series that also incorporates information about stellar correlated noise. We show that the information contained in an observing strategy can be significantly affected by beat frequencies between the orbital period of the planet, the stellar rotation period, and the observation epochs. We investigate how the follow-up observing strategy will affect the resulting radial velocity uncertainty, as a function of stellar properties such as the spot decay timescale and rotation period. We then describe two example use cases for gaspery: 1) calculating the minimum number of observations to reach an uncertainty tolerance in a correlated noise regime and 2) finding an optimal strategy given a fixed observing budget. Finally, we outline a prescription for selecting an observing strategy that is generalizable to different targets.</description>

      <title>Composition, Structure and Origin of the Moon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we critically examine the geophysical and geochemical properties of the Moon in order to identify the extent to which dynamical scenarios satisfy these observations. New joint inversions of existing lunar geophysical data (mean mass, moment of inertia, and tidal response) assuming a laterally- and vertically homogeneous lunar mantle show that, in all cases, a core with a radius of 300$\pm$20 km ($\sim$0.8 to 1.5 % the mass of the Moon) is required. However, an Earth-like Mg# (0.89) in the lunar mantle results in core densities (7800$\pm$100 kg/m$^3$) consistent with that of Fe-Ni alloy, whereas FeO-rich compositions (Mg# = 0.80--0.84) require lower densities (6100$\pm$800 kg/m$^3$). Geochemically, we use new data on mare basalts to reassess the bulk composition of the Moon for 70 elements, and show that the lunar core likely formed near 5 GPa, 2100 K and $\sim$1 log unit below the iron-w\"ustite buffer. Moreover, the Moon is depleted relative to the Earth's mantle in elements with volatilities higher than that of Li, with this volatile loss likely having occurred at low temperatures (1400$\pm$100 K), consistent with mass-dependent stable isotope fractionation of moderately volatile elements (e.g., Zn, K, Rb). The identical nucleosynthetic (O, Cr, Ti) and radiogenic (W) isotope compositions of the lunar and terrestrial mantles, strongly suggest the two bodies were made from the same material, rather than from an Earth-like impactor. Rb-Sr in FANs and Lu-Hf and Pb-Pb zircon ages point Moon formation close to $\sim$4500 Ma. Taken together, there is no unambiguous geochemical or isotopic evidence for the role of an impactor in the formation of the Moon, implying perfect equilibration between the proto-Earth and Moon-forming material or alternative scenarios for its genesis.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the HD 95086 system at mid-infrared wavelengths with JWST/MIRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mid-infrared imaging of exoplanets and disks is now possible with the coronagraphs of the MIRI on the JWST. This wavelength range unveils new features of young directly imaged systems and allows us to obtain new constraints for characterizing the atmosphere of young giant exoplanets and associated disks. These observations aim to characterize the atmosphere of the planet HD 95086 b by adding mid-infrared information so that the various hypotheses about its atmospheric parameters values can be unraveled. Improved images of circumstellar disks are provided. We present the MIRI coronagraphic imaging of the system HD 95086 obtained with the F1065C, F1140, and F2300C filters at central wavelengths of 10.575, 11.3, and 23 microns, respectively. We explored the method for subtracting the stellar diffraction pattern in the particular case when bright dust emitting at short separation is present. Furthermore, we compared different methods for extracting the photometry of the planet. Using the atmospheric models Exo-REM and ATMO, we measured the atmospheric parameters of HD 95086 b. The planet HD 95086 b and the contribution from the inner disk are detected at the two shortest MIRI wavelengths F1065C and F1140C. The outer colder belt is imaged at 23 microns. The mid-infrared photometry provides better constraints on the atmospheric parameters. We evaluate a temperature of 850-1020 K, consistent with one previous hypothesis that only used NIR data. The radius measurement of 1.0-1.13 RJup is better aligned with evolutionary models, but still smaller than predicted. These observations allow us to refute the hypothesis of a warm circumplanetary disk. HD 95086 is one of the first exoplanetary systems to be revealed at mid-infrared wavelengths. This highlights the interests and challenges of observations at these wavelengths.</description>

      <title>Accretion of the earliest inner solar system planetesimals beyond the water-snowline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How and where the first generation of inner solar system planetesimals formed remains poorly understood. Potential formation regions are the silicate condensation line and water-snowline of the solar protoplanetary disk. Whether the chemical compositions of these planetesimals align with accretion at the silicate condensation line (water-free and reduced) or water-snowline (water-bearing and oxidized) is, however, unknown. Here we use Fe/Ni and Fe/Co ratios of magmatic iron meteorites to quantify the oxidation states of the earliest planetesimals associated with non-carbonaceous (NC) and carbonaceous (CC) reservoirs, representing the inner and outer solar system, respectively. Our results show that the earliest NC planetesimals contained substantial amounts of oxidized Fe in their mantles (3-19 wt% FeO). In turn, we argue that this required the accretion of water-bearing materials into these NC planetesimals. The presence of substantial quantities of moderately and highly volatile elements in their parent cores is also inconsistent with their accretion at the silicate condensation line and favors instead their formation at or beyond the water-snowline. Similar oxidation states in the early-formed parent bodies of NC iron meteorites and those of NC achondrites and chondrites with diverse accretion ages suggests that the formation of oxidized planetesimals from water-bearing materials was widespread in the early history of the inner solar system.</description>

      <title>Role of magma oceans in controlling carbon and oxygen of sub-Neptune atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most exoplanets with a few Earth radii are more inflated than bare-rock planets with the same mass, indicating a substantial volatile amount. Neither the origin of the volatiles nor the planet's bulk composition can be constrained from the mass-radius relation alone, and the spectral characterization of their atmospheres is needed to solve this degeneracy. Previous studies showed that chemical interaction between accreted volatile and possible molten rocky surface (i.e., magma ocean) can greatly affects the atmospheric composition. However, a variety in the atmospheric compositions of such planets with different properties remains elusive. In this work, we examine the dependence of atmospheric H, O, and C on planetary parameters (atmospheric thickness, planetary mass, equilibrium temperature, and magma properties such as redox state) assuming nebula gas accretion on an Earth-like core, using an atmosphere-magma chemical equilibrium model. Consistent with previous work, we show that atmospheric $\rm H_{2}O$ fraction on a fully molten rocky interior with an Earth-like redox state is on the order of $10^{-2}$-$10^{-1}$ regardless of other planetary parameters. Despite the solubility difference between H- and C-bearing species, C/H increases only a few times above the nebula value except for atmospheric pressure $\lesssim$1000 bar and $\rm H_{2}O$ fraction $\gtrsim$10\%. This results in a negative O/H-C/O trend and depleted C/O below one-tenth of the nebula gas value under an oxidized atmosphere, which could provide a piece of evidence of rocky interior and endogenic water. We also highlight the importance of constraints on the high-pressure material properties for interpreting the magma-atmospheric interaction of inflated planets.</description>

      <title>Discovery and characterization of a dense sub-Saturn TOI-6651b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery and characterization of a transiting sub-Saturn exoplanet TOI-6651b using PARAS-2 spectroscopic observations. The host, TOI-6651 ($m_{V}\approx 10.2$), is a sub-giant, metal-rich G-type star with $[{\rm Fe/H}] = 0.225^{+0.044}_{-0.045}$, $T_{\rm eff} = 5940\pm110\ \mathrm{K}$, and $\log{g} = 4.087^{+0.035}_{-0.032}$. Joint fitting of the radial velocities from PARAS-2 spectrograph and transit photometric data from Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) reveals a planetary mass of $61.0^{+7.6}_{-7.9}\ M_\oplus$ and radius of $5.09^{+0.27}_{-0.26}\ R_\oplus$, in a $5.056973^{+0.000016}_{-0.000018}$ day orbit with an eccentricity of $0.091^{+0.096}_{-0.062}$. TOI-6651b has a bulk density of $2.52^{+0.52}_{-0.44}\ \mathrm{g\ cm^{-3}}$, positioning it among the select few known dense sub-Saturns and making it notably the densest detected with TESS. TOI-6651b is consistent with the positive correlation between planet mass and the host star's metallicity. We find that a considerable portion $\approx$ 87% of the planet's mass consists of dense materials such as rock and iron in the core, while the remaining mass comprises a low-density envelope of H/He. TOI-6651b lies at the edge of the Neptunian desert, which will be crucial for understanding the factors shaping the desert boundaries. The existence of TOI-6651b challenges conventional planet formation theories and could be a result of merging events or significant atmospheric mass loss through tidal heating, highlighting the complex interplay of dynamical processes and atmospheric evolution in the formation of massive dense sub-Saturns.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Modeling of Telluric Features and Stellar Variability with StellarSpectraObservationFitting.jl</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A significant barrier to achieving the radial velocity (RV) measurement accuracy and precision required to characterize terrestrial mass exoplanets is the existence of time-variable features in the measured spectra, from both telluric absorption and stellar variability, which affect measured line shapes and can cause apparent RV shifts. Reaching the desired accuracy using traditional techniques often requires avoiding lines contaminated by stellar variability and/or changing tellurics, and thus discarding a large fraction of the spectrum, lowering precision. New data-driven methods can help achieve extremely precise and accurate RVs by enabling the use of a larger fraction of the available data. While there exist methods for modeling telluric features or the stellar variability individually, there is a need for additional tools that are capable of modeling them simultaneously at the spectral level. Here we present StellarSpectraObservationFitting.jl (SSOF), a Julia package for measuring Doppler shifts and creating data-driven models (with fast, physically-motivated Gaussian Process regularization) for the time-variable spectral features for both the telluric transmission and stellar spectrum, while accounting for the wavelength-dependent instrumental line-spread function. We demonstrate SSOF's state-of-the-art performance on data from the NEID RV spectrograph on the WIYN 3.5m Telescope for multiple stars. We show SSOF's, ability to accurately identify and characterize spectral variability and provide $\sim$2-6x smaller photon-limited errors over the NEID CCF-based pipeline and match the performance of SERVAL, a leading template-based pipeline, using only observed EPRV spectra.</description>

      <title>A false positive transit candidate for EPIC 211101996 from K2 and TESS data identified as background eclipsing binary Gaia DR3 66767847894609792</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transiting planets around young stars are hard to find due to the enhanced stellar activity. Only a few transiting planets have been detected around stars younger than 100 Myr. We initially detected a transit-like signal in the K2 light curve of a very cool M dwarf star (EPIC 211101996) in the Pleiades open cluster, with an estimated age of about 100 Myr. Our detailed analysis of the per-pixel light curves, detrending with the W\={o}tan software and transit search with the Transit Least Squares algorithm showed that the source of the signal is a contaminant source (Gaia DR3 66767847894609792) 20" west of the target. The V-like shape of its phase-folded light curve and eclipse depth of ~15% suggest that it is a grazing eclipsing binary. The contaminant has hitherto been listed as a single star, which we now identify as an eclipsing stellar binary with a period of about 6 days.</description>

      <title>Near-Real Time Thermospheric Density Retrieval from Precise Low Earth Orbit Spacecraft Ephemerides During Geomagnetic Storms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a methodology to generate low-latency, high spatio-temporal resolution thermospheric density estimates using publicly available Low Earth Orbit (LEO) spacecraft ephemerides. This provides a means of generating density estimates that can be used in a data-assimilative context by the satellite operations and thermosphere communities. It also contributes to the data base of high-resolution density estimates during geomagnetic storms -- which remains one of the major gaps for the development and benchmarking of density models. Using accelerometer-derived densities from the Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment Follow-On (GRACE-FO) spacecraft as truth, our method surpasses Energy Dissipation Rate-Type density retrieval techniques and three widely used operational density models in terms of accuracy: EDR (103.37%), JB2008 (85.43%), DTM2000 (52.73%), and NRLMSISE-00 (12.31%). We demonstrate the robustness of our methodology during a critical time for spacecraft operators -- attempting to operate in the presence of geomagnetic storms, by reconstructing density profiles along the orbits of three LEO satellites during 80 geomagnetic storms. These profiles exhibit high spatial and temporal resolution compared to three operational thermospheric models, highlighting the operational applicability and potential for their use in model validation. Our findings suggest that the increasing availability of precise orbit determination data offers a valuable, yet underutilized, resource that could provide a significant improvement to data assimilative thermospheric models, ultimately enhancing both spacecraft operations and thermospheric modeling efforts.</description>

Abstract: Star formation in the central molecular zone (CMZ) is suppressed with respect to that of the Galactic disk, and this is likely related to its high turbulent environment. This turbulence impedes the potential detection of prestellar cores. We present the temperature, density, and spatial structure of the CMZ molecular cloud G+0.693-0.027, which has been proposed to host a prestellar cluster in the Sgr B2 region. We analysed multiple HC$_{3}$N rotational transitions that were observed with the IRAM 30m, APEX, Yebes 40m, and GBT radio telescopes, together with SMA+APEX spatially resolved maps. The spectral shape of HC$_{3}$N lines shows three velocity components: a broad component with a line width of 23 km s$^{-1}$ (C1), and two narrow components with line widths of 7.2 and 8.8 km s$^{-1}$ (C2 and C3). This suggests that a fraction of the molecular gas in this cloud is undergoing turbulence dissipation. From a non-local thermodynamic equilibrium analysis we have found H$_{2}$ densities of 2$\times$10$^{4}$ cm$^{-3}$, 5$\times$10$^{4}$ cm$^{-3}$, and 4$\times$10$^{5}$ cm$^{-3}$ and kinetic temperatures of 140 K, 30 K, and 80 K for C1, C2, and C3, respectively. The spatially resolved maps confirm that the colder and high-density condensations C2 and C3, which peak in the 70-85 km s$^{-1}$ velocity range, are embedded in a more diffuse and warmer gas (C1). The larger-scale structure of the Sgr B2 region shows a hole at 40-50 km s$^{-1}$ that is likely due to a small cloud that shocked the Sgr B2 region and is spatially related with a massive cloud at 60-80 km s$^{-1}$. We propose that the impacting small cloud sequentially triggered the formation of Sgr B2(M), (N), and (S) and the condensations in G+0.693-0.027 during its passage. Based on the analysis of the masses of the two condensations and on the virial parameters, C2 might expand, while C3 might further fragment or collapse.</description>

      <title>Accelerating the discovery of steady-states of planetary interior dynamics with machine learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulating mantle convection often requires reaching a computationally expensive steady-state, crucial for deriving scaling laws for thermal and dynamical flow properties and benchmarking numerical solutions. The strong temperature dependence of the rheology of mantle rocks causes viscosity variations of several orders of magnitude, leading to a slow-evolving stagnant lid where heat conduction dominates, overlying a rapidly-evolving and strongly convecting region. Time-stepping methods, while effective for fluids with constant viscosity, are hindered by the Courant criterion, which restricts the time step based on the system's maximum velocity and grid size. Consequently, achieving steady-state requires a large number of time steps due to the disparate time scales governing the stagnant and convecting regions.
  We present a concept for accelerating mantle convection simulations using machine learning. We generate a dataset of 128 two-dimensional simulations with mixed basal and internal heating, and pressure- and temperature-dependent viscosity. We train a feedforward neural network on 97 simulations to predict steady-state temperature profiles. These can then be used to initialize numerical time stepping methods for different simulation parameters. Compared to typical initializations, the number of time steps required to reach steady-state is reduced by a median factor of 3.75. The benefit of this method lies in requiring very few simulations to train on, providing a solution with no prediction error as we initialize a numerical method, and posing minimal computational overhead at inference time. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and discuss the potential implications for accelerated simulations for advancing mantle convection research.</description>

      <title>The stratification of regolith on celestial objects</title>

Abstract: All atmosphere-less planetary bodies are covered with a dust layer, the so-called regolith, which determines the optical, mechanical and thermal properties of their surface. These properties depend on the regolith material, the size distribution of the particles it consists of, and the porosity to which these particles are packed. We performed experiments in parabolic flights to determine the gravity dependency of the packing density of regolith for solid-particle sizes of 60 $\mu$m and 1 mm as well as for 100-250 $\mu$m-sized agglomerates of 1.5 $\mu$m-sized solid grains. We utilized g-levels between 0.7 m s$^{-2}$ and 18 m s$^{-2}$ and completed our measurements with experiments under normal gravity conditions. Based on previous experimental and theoretical literature and supported by our new experiments, we developed an analytical model to calculate the regolith stratification of celestial rocky and icy bodies and estimated the mechanical yields of the regolith under the weight of an astronaut and a spacecraft resting on these objects.</description>

      <title>High-energy spectra of LTT 1445A and GJ 486 reveal flares and activity</title>

Abstract: The high-energy radiative output, from the X-ray to the ultraviolet, of exoplanet host stars drives photochemical reactions and mass loss in the upper regions of planetary atmospheres. In order to place constraints on the atmospheric properties of the three closest terrestrial exoplanets transiting M dwarfs, we observe the high-energy spectra of the host stars LTT1445A and GJ486 in the X-ray with XMM-Newton and Chandra and in the ultraviolet with HST/COS and STIS. We combine these observations with estimates of extreme ultraviolet flux, reconstructions of the Ly-a lines, and stellar models at optical and infrared wavelengths to produce panchromatic spectra from 1A--20um for each star. While LTT1445Ab, LTT1445Ac, and GJ486b do not possess primordial hydrogen-dominated atmospheres, we calculate that they are able to retain pure CO2 atmospheres if starting with 10, 15, and 50% of Earth's total CO2 budget, respectively, in the presence of their host stars' stellar wind. We use age-activity relationships to place lower limits of 2.2 and 6.6 Gyr on the ages of the host stars LTT1445A and GJ486. Despite both LTT1445A and GJ486 appearing inactive at optical wavelengths, we detect flares at ultraviolet and X-ray wavelengths for both stars. In particular, GJ486 exhibits two flares with absolute energies of 10^29.5 and 10^30.1 erg (equivalent durations of 4357+/-96 and 19724+/-169 s) occurring three hours apart, captured with HST/COS G130M. Based on the timing of the observations, we suggest that these high-energy flares are related and indicative of heightened flaring activity that lasts for a period of days, but our interpretations are limited by sparse time-sampling. Consistent high-energy monitoring is needed to determine the duration and extent of high-energy activity on individual M dwarfs, as well as the population as a whole.</description>

      <title>Delivery of DART Impact Ejecta to Mars and Earth: Opportunity for Meteor Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02836v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: NASA's DART and ESA's Hera missions offer a unique opportunity to investigate the delivery of impact ejecta to other celestial bodies. We performed ejecta dynamical simulations using 3 million particles categorized into three size populations (10 cm, 0.5 cm, and 30 $\mu$m) and constrained by early post-impact LICIACube observations. The main simulation explored ejecta velocities ranging from 1 to 1,000 m/s, while a secondary simulation focused on faster ejecta with velocities from 1 to 2 km/s. We identified DART ejecta orbits compatible with the delivery of meteor-producing particles to Mars and Earth. Our results indicate the possibility of ejecta reaching the Mars Hill sphere in 13 years for launch velocities around 450 m/s, which is within the observed range. Some ejecta particles launched at 770 m/s could reach Mars's vicinity in 7 years. Faster ejecta resulted in a higher flux delivery towards Mars and particles impacting the Earth Hill sphere above 1.5 km/s. The delivery process is slightly sensitive to the initial observed cone range and driven by synodic periods. The launch locations for material delivery to Mars were predominantly northern the DART impact site, while they displayed a southwestern tendency for the Earth-Moon system. Larger particles exhibit a marginally greater likelihood of reaching Mars, while smaller particles favor delivery to Earth-Moon, although this effect is insignificant. To support observational campaigns for DART-created meteors, we provide comprehensive information on the encounter characteristics (orbital elements and radiants) and quantify the orbital decoherence degree of the released meteoroids.</description>
