      <title>Transitions to synchronization in adaptive multilayer networks with higher-order interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-world networks are often characterized by simultaneous interactions between multiple agents that adapt themselves due to feedback from the environment. In this article, we investigate the dynamics of an adaptive multilayer network of Kuramoto oscillators with higher-order interactions. The dynamics of the nodes within the layers are adaptively controlled through the global synchronization order parameter with the adaptations present alongside both pairwise and higher-order interactions. We first explore the dynamics with a linear form of the adaptation function and discover a tiered transition to synchronization, along with continuous and abrupt routes to synchronization. Multiple routes to synchronization are also observed due to the presence of multiple stable states. We investigate the bifurcations behind these routes and illustrate the basin of attraction to attain a deeper understanding of the multistability, that is born as a consequence of the adaptive interactions. When nonlinear adaptation is infused in the system, we observe three different kinds of tiered transition to synchronization, viz., continuous tiered, discontinuous tiered, and tiered transition with a hysteretic region. Our study provides an overview of how inducting order parameter adaptations in higher-order multilayer networks can influence dynamics and alter the route to synchronization in dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Influence of coupling symmetries and noise on the critical dynamics of synchronizing oscillator lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent work has shown that the synchronization process in lattices of self-sustained (phase and limit-cycle) oscillators displays universal scale-invariant behavior previously studied in the physics of surface kinetic roughening. The type of dynamic scaling ansatz which is verified depends on the randomness that occurs in the system, whether it is columnar disorder (quenched noise given by the random assignment of natural frequencies), leading to anomalous scaling, or else time-dependent noise, inducing the more standard Family-Vicsek dynamic scaling ansatz, as in equilibrium critical dynamics. The specific universality class also depends on the coupling function: for a sine function (as in the celebrated Kuramoto model) the critical behavior is that of the Edwards-Wilkinson equation for the corresponding type of randomness, with Gaussian fluctuations around the average growth. In all the other cases investigated, Tracy-Widom fluctuations ensue, associated with the celebrated Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation for rough interfaces. Two questions remain to be addressed in order to complete the picture, however: 1) Is the atypical scaling displayed by the sine coupling preserved if other coupling functions satisfying the same (odd) symmetry are employed (as suggested by continuum approximations and symmetry arguments)? and 2) how does the competition between both types of randomness (which are expected to coexist in experimental settings) affect the nonequilibrium behavior? We address the latter question by numerically characterizing the crossover between thermal-noise and columnar-disorder criticality, and the former by providing evidence confirming that it is the symmetry of the coupling function that sets apart the sine coupling, among other odd-symmetric couplings, due to the absence of Kardar-Parisi-Zhang fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Balanced Dynamics in Strongly Coupled Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the modeling of a variety of models of large-scale systems of interacting agents, mathematical models consider that the coupling terms representing the interactions between agents are scaled according to the network size to prevent divergence of the coupling terms. In a previous paper of ours and follow-ups from colleagues, we have explored the behavior of a large-scale system of interacting agents with diffusive coupling. It was shown that the system converges to a Dirac mass, that is free to evolve according to the intrinsic dynamics. We generalize these results to more general coupling functions, and show that, under specific conditions, the divergence of the coupling term does not preclude the well-posedness of limit equations. Instead, the system carries solutions associated to a balanced, so that the net input where leading order, vanishes. We also explore convergence to the balanced state. Such balanced regimes were widely observed in neuroscience and associated with complex regulatory mechanisms. This results offer an alternative, minimalistic perspective on the balance of excitation/inhibition in the brain.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Adaptive Modeling using Neural Networks Trained with Nonlinear Dynamics Based Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate models are essential for design, performance prediction, control, and diagnostics in complex engineering systems. Physics-based models excel during the design phase but often become outdated during system deployment due to changing operational conditions, unknown interactions, excitations, and parametric drift. While data-based models can capture the current state of complex systems, they face significant challenges, including excessive data dependence, limited generalizability to changing conditions, and inability to predict parametric dependence. This has led to combining physics and data in modeling, termed physics-infused machine learning, often using numerical simulations from physics-based models. This paper introduces a novel approach that departs from standard techniques by uncovering information from nonlinear dynamical modeling and embedding it in data-based models. The goal is to create a hybrid adaptive modeling framework that integrates data-based modeling with newly measured data and analytical nonlinear dynamical models for enhanced accuracy, parametric dependence, and improved generalizability. By explicitly incorporating nonlinear dynamic phenomena through perturbation methods, the predictive capabilities are more realistic and insightful compared to knowledge obtained from brute-force numerical simulations. In particular, perturbation methods are utilized to derive asymptotic solutions which are parameterized to generate frequency responses. Frequency responses provide comprehensive insights into dynamics and nonlinearity which are quantified and extracted as high-quality features. A machine-learning model, trained by these features, tracks parameter variations and updates the mismatched model. The results demonstrate that this adaptive modeling method outperforms numerical gray box models in prediction accuracy and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>A Categorical Framework for Quantifying Emergent Effects in Network Topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17403</link>

Abstract: Emergent effect is crucial to understanding the properties of complex systems that do not appear in their basic units, but there has been a lack of theories to measure and understand its mechanisms. In this paper, we consider emergence as a kind of structural nonlinearity, discuss a framework based on homological algebra that encodes emergence as the mathematical structure of cohomologies, and then apply it to network models to develop a computational measure of emergence. This framework ties the potential for emergent effects of a system to its network topology and local structures, paving the way to predict and understand the cause of emergent effects. We show in our numerical experiment that our measure of emergence correlates with the existing information-theoretic measure of emergence.</description>

      <title>Back to the Continuous Attractor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00109v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Continuous attractors offer a unique class of solutions for storing continuous-valued variables in recurrent system states for indefinitely long time intervals. Unfortunately, continuous attractors suffer from severe structural instability in general--they are destroyed by most infinitesimal changes of the dynamical law that defines them. This fragility limits their utility especially in biological systems as their recurrent dynamics are subject to constant perturbations. We observe that the bifurcations from continuous attractors in theoretical neuroscience models display various structurally stable forms. Although their asymptotic behaviors to maintain memory are categorically distinct, their finite-time behaviors are similar. We build on the persistent manifold theory to explain the commonalities between bifurcations from and approximations of continuous attractors. Fast-slow decomposition analysis uncovers the persistent manifold that survives the seemingly destructive bifurcation. Moreover, recurrent neural networks trained on analog memory tasks display approximate continuous attractors with predicted slow manifold structures. Therefore, continuous attractors are functionally robust and remain useful as a universal analogy for understanding analog memory.</description>
