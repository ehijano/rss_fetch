      <title>Bailouts by Representation: A Minimal TLC Theory with Weighted Consent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a purely theoretical mechanism in which provincial bailouts are disciplined by two levers derived from Weighted Representative Democracy (WRD): a political shadow cost of public funds and a weighted-consent cap on any transfer. Bailouts are considered only when an externality threshold is met. With quadratic implementation costs, the static problem yields a simple ''threshold--linear--cap'' (TLC) policy: zero below a lower activation point, linear in the middle, and flat at an upper cap. We characterize a knife-edge for a complete no bailout regime, either because the consent cap blocks all proposals or because the political cost of funds exceeds the maximum marginal benefit of relief. Comparative statics are transparent: increasing the political cost shifts activation upward; tightening the consent cap lowers the upper plateau; joint institutional changes move the two kinks in predictable ways. The WRD mechanism is observation ally equivalent to TLC rules obtained from screening models, yet attributes the same geometry to representation design rather than private information. For implementation and audit, we propose a constrained two-knot spline that recovers three interpretable metrics from data, activation threshold, interior slope, and the cap level, which support routine ex-post compliance checks.</description>

      <title>Existence of Richter-Peleg Representation for General Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides a general characterization of preferences that admit a Richter-Peleg representation without imposing completeness or transitivity. We establish that a binary relation on a nonempty set admits a Richter-Peleg representation if and only if it is "strongly acyclic" and its transitive closure is "separable". Strong acyclicity rules out problematic cycles among indifference classes, while separability limits the structural complexity of the relation. Our main result has two significant corollaries. First, when the set of alternatives is countable, a binary relation admits a Richter-Peleg representation if and only if it is strongly acyclic. Second, a preorder admits a Richter-Peleg representation if and only if it is separable. These findings have important implications for decision theory, particularly for obtaining maximal elements through scalar maximization in the presence of indecisiveness.</description>

      <title>Dividing a cake for the irrationally entitled</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A perfectly divisible cake is to be divided among a group of agents. Each agent is entitled to a share between zero and one, and these entitlements are compatible in that they sum to one. The mediator does not know the preferences of the agents, but can query the agents to make cuts and appraise slices in order to learn. We prove that if one of the entitlements is irrational, then the mediator must use a protocol that involves an arbitrarily large number of queries in order to construct an allocation that respects the entitlements regardless of preferences.</description>

      <title>Real Preferences Under Arbitrary Norms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Whether the goal is to analyze voting behavior, locate facilities, or recommend products, the problem of translating between (ordinal) rankings and (numerical) utilities arises naturally in many contexts. This task is commonly approached by representing both the individuals doing the ranking (voters) and the items to be ranked (alternatives) in a shared metric space, where ordinal preferences are translated into relationships between pairwise distances. Prior work has established that any collection of rankings with $n$ voters and $m$ alternatives (preference profile) can be embedded into $d$-dimensional Euclidean space for $d \geq \min\{n,m-1\}$ under the Euclidean norm and the Manhattan norm. We show that this holds for all $p$-norms and establish that any pair of rankings can be embedded into $R^2$ under arbitrary norms, significantly expanding the reach of spatial preference models.</description>

      <title>Coordinating cooperation in stag-hunt game: Emergence of evolutionarily stable procedural rationality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Humans are bounded rational at best and this, we argue, has worked in their favour in the hunter-gatherer society where emergence of a coordinated action, leading to cooperation, is otherwise the standard stag-hunt dilemma (when individuals are rational). In line with the fact the humans strive for developing self-reputation by having less propensity to cheat than to be cheated, we observe that the payoff structure of the stag-hunt game appropriately modifies to that of coordination-II game. Subsequently, within the paradigm of evolutionary game theory, we establish that a population -- consisting of procedural rational players (a type of bounded rationality) -- is unequivocally evolutionarily stable against emergence of more rational strategies in coordination-II game. The cooperation is, thus, shown to have been established by evolutionary forces picking less rational individuals.</description>

      <title>Not in My Backyard! Temporal Voting Over Public Chores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a temporal voting model where voters have dynamic preferences over a set of public chores -- projects that benefit society, but impose individual costs on those affected by their implementation. We investigate the computational complexity of optimizing utilitarian and egalitarian welfare. Our results show that while optimizing the former is computationally straightforward, minimizing the latter is computationally intractable, even in very restricted cases. Nevertheless, we identify several settings where this problem can be solved efficiently, either exactly or by an approximation algorithm. We also examine the effects of enforcing temporal fairness and its impact on social welfare, and analyze the competitive ratio of online algorithms. We then explore the strategic behavior of agents, providing insights into potential malfeasance in such decision-making environments. Finally, we discuss a range of fairness measures and their suitability for our setting.</description>

      <title>Connected Incomplete Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.04401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2008.04401v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores a new class of incomplete preferences, termed "connected preferences", in which maximal domains of comparability are topologically connected. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for continuous preferences to be connected. We also characterize their maximal domains of comparability. Our results extend classical findings in decision theory by linking topological properties of the choice space with the structure of preferences, offering a novel perspective on incompleteness in economic models.</description>

      <title>On the Monotonicity of Information Costs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15158v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the monotonicity of information costs: more informative experiments must be more costly. As criteria for informativeness, we consider the standard information orders introduced by Blackwell (1951, 1953) and Lehmann (1988). We provide simple necessary and sufficient conditions for a cost function to be monotone with respect to each order, grounded in their garbling characterizations. Finally, we examine several well-known cost functions from the literature through the lens of these conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14136v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study dynamic network formation from a centralized perspective. In each period, the social planner builds a single link to connect previously unlinked pairs. The social planner is forward-looking, with instantaneous utility monotonic in the aggregate number of walks of various lengths. We show that, forming a nested split graph at each period is optimal, regardless of the discount function. When the social planner is sufficiently myopic, it is optimal to form a quasi-complete graph at each period, which is unique up to permutation. This finding provides a micro-foundation for the quasi-complete graph, as it is formed under a greedy policy. We also investigate the robustness of these findings under non-linear best response functions and weighted networks.</description>

      <title>TTC Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15422v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the object reallocation problem under strict preferences. On the unrestricted domain, Ekici (2024) showed that the Top Trading Cycles (TTC) mechanism is the unique mechanism that is individually rational, pair efficient, and strategyproof. We introduce a richness property on preference domains -- the top-two condition -- and show that this characterization extends to all domains satisfying it. The condition requires that within any subset of objects, if two objects can each be most-preferred, they can also be ranked as the top two (in either order). We further show that almost all domains failing the top-two condition for a triple or quadruple of objects admit non-TTC mechanisms satisfying the axioms. These results unify prior findings on specific domains, demonstrate the robustness of Ekici (2024) characterization, and suggest a minimal richness requirement that may underlie it.</description>
