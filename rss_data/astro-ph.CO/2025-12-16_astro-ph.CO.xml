      <title>Local Nonlinear Transforms effectively Reveal Primordial Information in Large-Scale Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To eliminate gravitational non-Gaussianity, we introduce the $\mathcal{Z}$-$\kappa$ transform, a simple local nonlinear transform of the matter density field that emulates the inverse of nonlinear gravitational evolution. Using $N$-body simulations, we show that the $\mathcal{Z}$-$\kappa$ transform with $\kappa=6$ or $\kappa\to\infty$ (i.e., log) substantially Gaussianizes the density distribution, and recovers the linear power spectrum. In an extended parameter space including primordial non-Gaussianity, summed neutrino mass, and $\Lambda$CDM parameters, Fisher analysis demonstrates that power spectra of transformed fields provide strong complementary constraints. A central result is that these power spectra can directly capture the local primordial non-Gaussianity imprinted in large-scale structure. This opens a new avenue for probing the physics of the early Universe with Stage-IV surveys using two-point statistics.</description>

      <title>Comments on "Little ado about everything" by A. Lapi et al. and on cosmological back-reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In two papers, A. Lapi et al. introduce and discuss what they call the $\eta$CDM model, a stochastic framework in which they claim that fluctuations in the density field at the scale of tens of Mpc due to structure formation would effectively drive the accelerated expansion of the Universe. They claim that this qualitative behaviour would emerge from the dynamics of standard cold dark matter alone, without introducing any new physics. In this short comment, I argue that such a proposition is implausible. Some of my remarks are relevant more generally to frameworks that try to describe cosmological back-reaction.</description>

      <title>Beyond general relativity: probing gravity with gravitational redshifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the success of general relativity (GR), the unexplained nature of dark energy on cosmological scales leaves open the question of whether GR provides a complete description of gravity. This quest is further motivated by growing tensions among cosmological observations when interpreted within $\Lambda$CDM. Gravitational redshifts of cluster member galaxies probe cluster potentials on megaparsec scales directly, complementing conventional large-scale structure tests. Here, we investigate how redshift precision and survey design propagate into constraints on modified gravity using an end-to-end pipeline run on mock catalogues, focusing on mis-centring and spectroscopic completeness. We find that competitive measurements require wide-field spectroscopic cluster surveys explicitly designed to maximise the number of spectroscopically confirmed members per cluster, to enable high-purity stacking, and to control systematic effects.</description>

      <title>The Serendipitous Axiodilaton: A Self-Consistent Recombination-Era Solution to the Hubble Tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Axio-dilaton cosmology provides a minimal benchmark model for both Dark Matter (DM) and Dark Energy (DE) that is well motivated by fundamental physics. The axion and dilaton arise as pseudo-Goldstone modes of symmetries that predict particle masses depend on the dilaton, and therefore to evolve cosmologically, leading to correlated modifications of recombination physics, the sound horizon, and late-time expansion and growth histories. We confront this model with Planck 2018 temperature, polarisation, and lensing data, SPT-3G high-$\ell$ measurements, DESI DR2 BAO, and Pantheon$+$ supernovae, assuming that the axion makes up all of the dark matter and that the dilaton plays the role of a dark energy field. We find that it fits the data somewhat better than $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, with the $\chi^2$ lowered by $\simeq 7$ for three additional parameters, and significantly raises the inferred Hubble constant to $H_0 \simeq 69.2\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$, reducing the Hubble tension to $\lesssim 3\sigma$ and thereby allowing a joint fit of CMB and SH0ES data. The model fits this enlarged data set as well as the $w_0w_a$ model with an electron mass modified by hand at recombination, though it does so with calculable dynamics. Axio-dilaton self-interactions robustly fake a phantom equation of state in DESI measurements. There is a sting: cosmology prefers dilaton-matter couplings $|\mathbf{g}|\sim 10^{-2}$-$10^{-1}$, which are large enough to have been detected in solar-system tests of General Relativity. These results show how axio-dilatons can provide a viable cosmology preferred by current data at surprisingly large couplings, within a framework that links dark energy, dark matter, and time-dependent particle masses in a coherent way. They suggest both new observable signals and new theoretical directions, aimed at resolving the apparent inconsistency with non-cosmological observations.</description>

      <title>Fermionic versus Bosonic Dark Matter in Neutron Stars: A Bayesian Study with Multi-Density Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a comparative Bayesian analysis of fermionic and bosonic dark matter admixed neutron stars (DMANS) by incorporating a comprehensive set of theoretical, experimental, and astrophysical constraints. The hadronic matter equation of state (EoS) is modeled using a relativistic mean-field approach, constrained by chiral effective field theory ($\chi$EFT) calculations at low densities, finite nuclei and heavy-ion collision data at intermediate densities, and neutron star (NS) observations at high densities. For the dark sector, we consider fermionic dark matter (FDM) interacting via a dark vector meson, and two bosonic dark matter models (BDM1 and BDM2) characterized by self-interacting scalar fields. Bayesian inference is employed to constrain the model parameters, including the dark matter mass, coupling strength, and dark matter fraction within NSs. Our analysis finds that all models yield consistent nuclear matter parameters, allowing a small dark matter fraction under 10%. The presence of dark matter slightly softens the EoS, leading to a modest reduction in NS mass, radius, and tidal deformability, though all models remain compatible with NICER and GW170817 observations. The log-evidence and likelihood analyses reveal no statistical preference among the FDM and BDM models, indicating that current astrophysical data cannot decisively distinguish between fermionic and bosonic dark matter scenarios. This study provides a unified statistical framework to constrain dark matter properties using NS observables.</description>

      <title>The impact of non-Gaussianity when searching for Primordial Black Holes with LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LISA can observe cosmological millihertz (mHz) gravitational wave (GW) backgrounds that may offer a decisive test for asteroid-mass primordial black hole (PBH) dark matter (DM). In standard scenarios, failing to detect a scalar-induced gravitational wave (SIGW) background would exclude the last viable window for PBH DM formed through critical collapse. We show that this conclusion becomes much weaker in the presence of astrophysical foregrounds and strongly non-Gaussian primordial density perturbations, by studying how these phenomena affect the link between SIGWs and PBHs, and reevaluate LISA's sensitivity to asteroid-mass PBHs. In addition, we analyse the interplay between PBHs and SIGWs to gain further insights into the nature of primordial non-Gaussianity. We find that uncertainties in $f_{\rm NL}$ can induce substantial uncertainties in the PBH abundance, which ultimately limits LISA's capacity to fully probe the asteroid-mass PBH DM window.</description>

      <title>A critical value of the inflationary tensor-to-scalar ratio from inhomogeneous inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that, for a given fixed value of the number of e-folds of the homogeneous solution, inflation succeeds with order unity inhomogeneities in the initial conditions above a characteristic value of the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. In practice, we work with an $\alpha$-attractor $T$-model and vary its characteristic scale $\mu$, keeping the initial inhomogeneities in both gradient and kinetic fields of order unity of the inflationary energy scale. Under these conditions, and assuming 100 e-folds for the homogeneous solution, the requirement for 60 e-folds of inflation occurs at a critical characteristic scale $\mu_{crit} \approx 0.02m_{P}$, corresponding to an $r_{crit} \approx 10^{-6}$. Since increasing the amplitude of the inhomogeneities will make inflation less robust and hence require a higher characteristic scale in order for inflation to succeed, for a given number of e-folds achieved by the homogeneous solution $r_{crit}$ is a lower bound.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing spatially-varying multiplicative bias for Stage IV weak lensing galaxy surveys with a quadratic estimator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a quadratic estimator that detects and reconstructs spatially-varying multiplicative ($m-$) bias in weak lensing shear measurements, by exploiting the $EB$ mode coupling that it generates. The method combines $E$ and $B$ modes with inverse-variance weights, to yield an unbiased reconstruction of $m(\boldsymbol{\theta})$ to first order. We study the ability of future Stage IV surveys to obtain an unbiased reconstruction of the $m$-bias in differing scenarios, considering differing bias morphologies, and characteristic scales, as well as differing metrics to quantify the signal-to-noise ratio of the reconstructed map. Considering an $m$ pattern repeating on $\sim 1^\circ\times1^\circ$ sky patches, as might be the case for an $m$ field caused by focal-plane systematics. With a Euclid-like redshift distribution, we find that $\sim5\%$ rms variations in $m$-bias may be detected at the 20$\sigma$ level, after stacking between $\sim400$ and $\sim1000$ patches (rising to between $\sim2800$ and $\sim7600$ for $1\%$ rms variations, data volumes that are becoming available with upcoming surveys), depending on the morphology of the $m$ pattern. We show that these results are robust against the cosmological model assumed in the reconstruction, as well as the presence of intrinsic alignments or baryonic effects, and that the method shows no spurious response to additive ($c-$) bias. These results demonstrate that percent-level, spatially-varying $m-$bias can be detected at high significance, enabling diagnosis and mitigation in the Stage IV weak lensing era.</description>

      <title>Bridging Simulations and EFT: A Hybrid Model of the Lyman-Alpha Forest Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lyman-alpha (Lya) forest is a unique probe of cosmology and the intergalactic medium at high redshift and small scales. The statistical power of the ongoing Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) demands precise theoretical tools to model the Lya forest. We present a hybrid effective field theory (HEFT) forward model in redshift space that leverages the accuracy of non-linear particle displacements computed using the N-body simulation suite AbacusSummit with the predictive power of an analytical, perturbative bias forward model in the framework of the effective field theory (EFT). The residual noise between the model and the simulated Lya field has a nearly white (scale-and orientation-independent) power spectrum on quasi-linear scales, substantially simplifying its modeling compared to a purely perturbative description. As a consequence of the improved control over the 3D Lya forest stochasticity, we find agreement between the modeled and the true power spectra at the 5 per cent level down to scales of k &lt;= 1 h/Mpc. This procedure offers a promising path toward constructing efficient and accurate emulators to predict large-scale clustering summary statistics for full-shape cosmological analyses of Lya forest data from both DESI and its successor, DESI-II.</description>

      <title>Non-parametric exploration of minimally coupled gravity with phantom crossing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent measurements of the baryon acoustic oscillations by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), especially when combined with cosmic microwave background (CMB) and supernova data, favor a late-time dark energy equation of state that crosses $w=-1$, which has been argued to point toward non-minimal conformal coupling in Horndeski gravity. We test this interpretation by performing a non-parametric exploration of the minimally coupled, luminal Horndeski subclass known as kinetic gravity braiding (KGB). Using mochi_class and its manifestly stable effective field theory (EFT) basis implementation, we efficiently scan a broad class of models in which the EFT functions are allowed to vary freely in time, while enforcing the absence of ghost and gradient instabilities from the outset. We identify a set of KGB models that realize phantom crossing and remain broadly consistent with current probes of the background and linear large-scale structure, including CMB temperature and lensing power spectra, redshift-space distortions, cosmic shear, and the cross-correlation between galaxies and the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect. Our results demonstrate that viable phantom-crossing solutions exist without conformal coupling, motivating future full Bayesian analyses of this model class with non-parametric EFT priors.</description>

      <title>The MeerKLASS UHF On-the-Fly Continuum Survey -- Data Release I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first public data release (DR1) from the interferometric component of the MeerKAT Large Area Synoptic Survey (MeerKLASS) UHF survey, a legacy program demonstrating a novel on-the-fly (OTF) mapping technique. This release is based on 12 hours of early science observations covering approximately 800 deg$^2$ of the southern sky. We describe the data processing pipeline developed to calibrate and image these fast-scanning observations, producing high-fidelity continuum images at a central frequency of 816 MHz. The resulting mosaic reaches an RMS sensitivity of $\sim$35 $\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$ in its deepest regions, with a typical angular resolution of $\sim32'' \times 17''$. In these images, we identify $95483$ radio sources. We validate the catalogue through cross-matching with external surveys, confirming sub-arcsecond astrometric accuracy and a robust flux density scale. We compute the differential source counts, finding excellent agreement with existing measurements and validating our end-to-end processing. The success of this pilot study serves as a crucial proof of concept for the OTF observing strategy, and the public release of the images and source catalogue provides a valuable resource for a wide range of astrophysical studies. This work paves the way for the full MeerKLASS OTF survey and future large-area survey projects with the SKA.</description>

      <title>The MeerKLASS On-the-Fly continuum survey: pipeline design and validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The MeerKAT Large Area Synoptic Survey (MeerKLASS) is designed to map large areas of the Southern sky for cosmology using the single-dish HI intensity mapping (IM) technique, while simultaneously delivering a wide, high angular-resolution interferometric survey. We present the design and first results of the MeerKLASS On-the-Fly (OTF) continuum data, which exploits the visibilities recorded during fast, constant-elevation scans. This observing mode enables fast commensal imaging over several hundred of square degrees on a nightly basis.
  We describe the OTF survey strategy and pipeline, focusing on handling challenges introduced by the current MeerKAT fixed-delay correlation observing mode, which causes decorrelation (smearing). We implement a correction scheme based on time-dependent phase rotation, direction-dependent PSF modeling, and wide-band faceted deconvolution with \texttt{DDFacet}. Using UHF-band and pilot L-band data, we demonstrate the recovery of high-quality 2-second snapshot images and deep mosaics over hundreds of square degrees. After smearing correction we are able to achieve a resolution of $23.3$arcsec and $14$ arcsec with an rms sensitivity of $35 \mu {\rm Jy\,beam}^{-1}$ and $ 33 \mu {\rm Jy\,beam}^{-1}$ in the UHF and L-band respectively.
  The full survey will cover $10,000 \, {\rm deg}^{2}$ at 544-1088 MHz, and after the delay tracking fix implemented we expect to reach $\sim 25 \mu {\rm Jy\,beam}^{-1}$ at $14$ arcsec resolution. The continuum OTF data products will support diverse science goals, including galaxy and AGN evolution, diffuse cluster emission, large-scale structure and cosmology, rotation-measure synthesis, and transient searches. MeerKLASS-OTF thus establishes an efficient path to wide-area commensal surveys with MeerKAT and provides a key technical precursor for SKA-Mid.</description>

      <title>High-Redshift Galaxy Candidates at z &gt; 6 as Revealed by JWST Observations of MACS0647</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a catalog of 57 high-redshift $z&gt;6$ galaxy candidates, including 14 spectroscopic confirmations ($z = 6.10$ -- 9.25), 2 Little Red Dots ($z = 4.77$, 5.81), and 2 interlopers ($z = 3.23$, 3.72), based on \JWST\ NIRCam imaging (7 filters), NIRSpec spectroscopy (PRISM and G395H), and archival \HST\ imaging (17 filters) of the strong lensing galaxy cluster MACS0647. Our highest redshift confirmation ($z = 9.25$) is an Extremely Blue Galaxy (presented in~\citealt{Yanagisawa2024}), and here we identify a spectral turnover likely due to damped Lyman-$\alpha$. We identify an overdensity of galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts $z = 6.1$, confirming the $z \sim 6$ overdensity identified in \HST\ images. In one of these galaxies, our high-resolution G395H spectroscopy reveals two spatially resolved components with a velocity difference of $\sim$90 km/s; if these components are gravitationally bound, this would imply a dynamical mass on the order of $\sim 10^8\ M_\odot$ given their projected separation. We present spectral line fluxes, widths, and derived physical properties, including stellar masses ($10^8 - 10^9 \ \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$) and metallicities ($10\% - 40\% \ \mathrm{Z}_{\odot}$) for our spectroscopic sample. We note half of our NIRSpec data was obtained with standard 3-slitlet nods and half was obtained with single slitlets yielding similar results, demonstrating the power to observe more sources on a densely packed NIRSpec MSA.</description>

      <title>Born-Infeld signatures in AdS black hole thermodynamics and gravitational lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamic and optical properties of Einstein-Born-Infeld-Anti-de Sitter (EBI-AdS) black holes (BHs). Our study derives the Hawking temperature using standard surface gravity methods and examines quantum corrections through both the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) and exponential entropy modifications, showing enhanced thermal radiation and potential remnant formation scenarios. The gravitational redshift analysis separates contributions from mass, cosmological constant, electromagnetic charge, and Born-Infeld (BI) corrections, with the latter scaling as $a^4/r^6$ and thus confined to near-horizon regimes. Using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, we calculate light deflection angles in both vacuum and plasma environments, demonstrating how dispersive media can either enhance or suppress nonlinear electrodynamic signatures depending on observational configurations. The thermodynamic analysis in extended phase space, where the BH mass corresponds to enthalpy, reveals phase structures with heat capacity transitions between positive and negative values, indicating regions of local stability and instability sensitive to parameter choices. We study BH heat engines operating in rectangular thermodynamic cycles, achieving efficiencies of $\eta \sim 0.11$--$0.21$ that reach 30--61\% of the corresponding Carnot limits, consistent with other AdS BH systems. Comparison with Johnson's analysis confirms that BI corrections to heat engine efficiency are of order $10^{-12}$ for typical parameter ranges, though these effects become appreciable in the strong-field regime where $r_h \lesssim 1.5$ in Planck units. The plasma deflection analysis reveals frequency-dependent refractive modifications encoded in the plasma parameter, offering additional possible observational channels.</description>

      <title>Constraining the dark matter origin of the halo-like 20 GeV $\gamma$-ray excess with the AMS-02 antiproton data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Very recently, a significant $\sim 20$ GeV gamma-ray excess in the Milky Way halo has been reported and a dark matter origin has been suggested. The inferred dark matter parameters are $ m_\chi \sim 0.5-0.8 $ TeV and $ \langle \sigma v \rangle \sim (5-8) \times 10^{-25}~{\rm cm^3~s^{-1}}$ for the $ b\bar{b} $ channel. If correct, prominent antiproton emission is produced and can be directly tested by the AMS-02 data. In this work we calculate the corresponding antiproton emission and show that the expected flux at $\sim 100$ GeV is already above the AMS-02 observation. A proper treatment on the antiproton background resulting from the high energy cosmic ray propagation would suggest an annihilation cross section of $&lt; 2\times 10^{-26}~{\rm cm^3~s^{-1}}$, which is a few$\times 10$ times lower than that needed to interpret the potential signal. We therefore conclude that the $\sim 20$ GeV gamma-ray excess in the Milky Way halo is not a viable dark matter signal.</description>

      <title>New Massless Spectra from Cosmic String Cusps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the standard picture of cosmic strings, cusps are generic features of Nambu-Goto loops where the string momentarily reaches the speed of light. They have a characteristic sharp profile, following $y \sim x^{2/3}$ in the $(x,y)$ plane, and produce strong gravitational-wave (GW) bursts with frequency-domain strain $\mathop{\tilde{\!\kappa}}(\omega) \propto \omega^{-4/3}$, making them key targets for current and future GW searches. However, under certain conditions, this generic picture can differ. We identify cusp solutions with different, including smooth, shapes, and compute their massless GW and axion spectra. We derive a general expression for all possible Nambu-Goto cusp spectra with the asymptotic form $\mathop{\tilde{\!\kappa}}(\omega) \propto \omega^{-n/(2n-1)} \omega^{-m/(2m-1)}$ where $n, m\geq 2$. We investigate the effect of realistic corrections to the Nambu-Goto description, such as those from backreaction and finite string width, which introduce a high frequency cutoff.</description>

      <title>Nyx-RT: Adaptive Ray Tracing in the Nyx Hydrodynamical Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerical methods for radiative transfer play a key role in modern-day astrophysics and cosmology, including study of the inhomogeneous reionization process. In this context, ray tracing methods are well-regarded for accuracy but notorious for high computational cost. In this work, we extend the capabilities of the Nyx N-body / hydrodynamics code, coupling radiation to gravitational and gas dynamics. We formulate adaptive ray tracing as a novel series of filters and transformations that can be used with AMReX particle abstractions, simplifying implementation and enabling portability across Exascale GPU architectures. To address computational cost, we present a new algorithm for merging sources, which significantly accelerates computation once reionization is well underway. Furthermore, we develop a novel prescription for geometric overlap correction with low-density neighbor cells. We perform verification and validation against standard analytic and numerical test problems. Finally, we demonstrate scaling to up to 1024 nodes and 4096 GPUs running multiphysics cosmological simulations, with 4096^3 Eulerian gas cells, 4096^3 dark matter particles, and ray tracing on a 1024^3 coarse grid. For these full cosmological simulations, we demonstrate convergence in terms of reionization history and post-ionization Lyman-alpha forest flux.</description>

      <title>A Search for Soft $\gamma$-ray Emission from the Galaxy Cluster SPT-CL J2012-5649 (Abell 3667) Using INTEGRAL/ISGRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a search for soft $\gamma$-ray emission from the merging galaxy cluster SPT-CL J2012-5649 (Abell~3667) using archival INTEGRAL/ISGRI observations. This cluster located at $z=0.0556$ hosts prominent radio relics associated with merger-driven shocks, suggesting the presence of relativistic electrons capable of producing inverse-Compton (IC) emission in the 30--300~keV band. Using standard OSA~11.2 imaging and spectral pipelines and a total effective exposure of 2506~s, we find no significant emission at the cluster position in any energy interval. The extracted ISGRI spectrum is consistent with pure background, and no physically meaningful model parameters can be constrained. From the mosaic variance maps, we derive a conservative $3\sigma$ upper limit of $F_{30-300\,\mathrm{keV}} &lt; 6.9 \times 10^{-9}\,\mathrm{erg\,cm^{-2}\,s^{-1}}$ assuming a power-law spectrum with $\Gamma = 2$. This limit rules out bright IC scenarios and constrains the efficiency of merger-driven particle acceleration in SPT-CL J2012-5649. Our results provide the most stringent soft $\gamma$-ray constraint on this system to date and highlight the need for next-generation hard X-ray missions, such as HEX-P or eXTP, to probe IC emission at theoretically predicted levels in merging clusters.</description>

      <title>The post-inflationary cosmology of the VISH$\nu$ axion-majoron model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It was previously shown how several explanatory deficiencies of the Standard Model (including the origin of dark matter, matter-antimatter asymmetry, small active neutrino mass, strong CP-conservation and the seeds for large-scale structure formation) may be economically resolved when an experimentally-accessible QCD axion also plays the role of the majoron, and the scalar partner of the axion is dynamical during inflation. In this paper, we complete this general study of the cosmological history for a unit domain-wall number option of the DFSZ-type, dubbed VISH$\nu$, by performing a detailed lattice-informed analysis of the reheating era. In doing so, we make inflationary and leptogenesis predictions more precise through estimates of the reheating temperature and the expansion history. The viable reheating scenarios, which at the same time satisfy strict conditions for naturalness (radiative stability), are also shown to respect dark radiation bounds. We also characterise the high-frequency spectrum of gravitational waves, and mention other phenomenological implications that distinguish VISH$\nu$ from alternative proposals.</description>

      <title>CUBE2: A Parallel $N$-Body Simulation Code for Scalability, Accuracy, and Memory Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: $N$-body simulation serves as a critical method for modeling cosmic evolution and represents a significant challenge in high-performance computing. We present CUBE2, a cosmological $N$-body code emphasizing memory efficiency, computational performance, scalability and precision. The core of its algorithm utilizes Particle-Mesh (PM) method to solve the Poisson equation for matter distribution, leveraging the well-optimized Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for computational efficiency. In terms of scalability, the multi-level PM spatial decomposition reduces the computational complexity to nearly linear. Precision is ensured by the optimized Green's function that seamlessly bridges gravitational interactions between multi-level PM and Particle-Particle (PP) calculations. The program design enhances per-core/node efficiency in processing $N$-body particles, while a fixed-point data storage format addresses memory constraints for large particle counts. Using CUBE2, we run two cosmological simulations with particle counts of $6144^3$ on the Advanced Computing East China Sub-center (ACECS) to test performance and accuracy.</description>

Abstract: We propose a parameterized equation of state for dark energy and perform observational tests with the Hubble parameter measurements, the Pantheon supernova sample, baryon acoustic oscillations, and DESI DR2 data. We obtain the best-fit values for the parameters as: $H_0=73.96\pm 0.16$, $\Omega_{\rm m}=0.2434\pm 0.0079$, and $\alpha=-0.00049\pm 0.00092$, demonstrating that the model exhibits a high degree of consistency with astronomical observations and provides a promising parameterized method for addressing the Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>HALO I: Photometric continuum reverberation mapping of Fairall~9</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the origin of inter-band continuum time delays in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) to study the structure and properties of their accretion disks. We aim to measure the inter-band continuum time delays through photometric monitoring of Seyfert galaxy Fairall~9 to construct the lag-spectrum. Additionally, we explain the observed features in the Fairall~9 lag-spectrum and discuss the potential drivers behind them, based on our newly collected data from the Obserwatorium Cerro Murphy (OCM) telescope. We initiated a long-term, continuous AGN photometric monitoring program in 2024, titled 'Hubble constant constraints through AGN Light curve Observations' (HALO) using intermediate and broad band filters. Here, we present the first results from HALO, focusing on photometric light curves and continuum time-delay measurements for Fairall~9. To complement these observations and extend the wavelength coverage of the lag-spectrum, we also reanalyzed archival Swift light curves and spectroscopic data available in the literature. Using HALO and Swift light curves, we measured inter-band continuum delays to construct the lag-spectrum of Fairall~9. Excess lags appear in the $u$ and $U$ bands (Balmer continuum contamination) and in the $I$ band (Paschen jump/dust emission from the torus). Overall, the lag-spectrum deviates significantly from standard disk model predictions. We find that inter-band delays deviate from the power-law, $\tau_{\lambda} \propto \lambda^{\beta}$ due to BLR scattering, reprocessing, and dust contributions at longer wavelengths. Power-law fits are therefore not well suited for characterizing the nature of the time delays.</description>

      <title>Standardizing reverberation-mapped H$\beta$ active galactic nuclei using time-averaged radius$-$luminosity relations with 5100\,\AA\,, broad H$\beta$, and narrow \OIII\ luminosities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active galactic nuclei (AGN) have been studied as alternate probes in cosmology due to their large and stable luminosities and broad redshift range. Previously it was shown that higher-redshift AGN that were reverberation-mapped (RM) using broad Mg\,\textsc{ii} and C\,\textsc{iv} lines are standardizable and yield weak cosmological constraints that are consistent with those from better-established probes. In contrast, lower-redshift AGN that were reverberation-mapped using the broad H$\beta$ line exhibited tensions with the standard cosmological model, in particular they preferred currently decelerating cosmological expansion. Here we study the standardizability of a homogeneous RM H$\beta$ sample of $\sim 100$ AGN (over redshifts $0.00308 \leq z \leq 0.8429$), whose H$\beta$ time delays and three luminosity tracers (at 5100\,\AA\,, broad H$\beta$, and narrow [O\,\textsc{iii}]) are averaged over several epochs. We find that this averaged sample is standardizable using three $R-L$ relations. While for luminosities corresponding to 5100\,\AA\, and the broad H$\beta$ line the cosmological constraints prefer currently decelerating cosmological expansion, the cosmological parameters for the narrow [O\,\textsc{iii}] luminosity are more consistent with those from better-established probes and they are in agreement with currently accelerating cosmological expansion. This demonstrates for the first time that narrow-line region [O\,\textsc{iii}] can be utilized for AGN standardization and cosmological constraints. Selecting proper photoionizing flux proxies for the broad-line region is thus crucial in studies of RM AGN standardizability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the extension of the differentiable hydrodynamics code, diffhydro, enabling scalable PDE-constrained inference and integrated hybrid physics-ML models for a wide range of astrophysical applications. New physics additions include radiative heating/cooling, OU-driven turbulence, and self-gravity via multigrid Poisson. We demonstrate good agreement with the Athena++ code on standard validation tests such as Sedov-Taylor, Kelvin-Helmholtz, and driven/decaying turbulence. We further introduce a solver-in-the-loop neural corrector that reduces coarse-grid errors during time integration while preserving stability. The addition of custom adjoints facilitates efficient end-to-end gradients and multi-device scaling. We present simulations up to 1024^3 elements, run on distributed GPU systems, and we show gradient-based reconstructions of complex initial conditions in turbulent, self-gravitating, radiatively cooling flows. The code is written in JAX, and the solver's modular finite-volume components are compiled by XLA into fused accelerator kernels, delivering high-throughput forward runs and tractable differentiation through long integrations.</description>

      <title>Extending Weinberg's EFT: effective scalar-tensor theories up to sixth order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic construction of the six-derivative effective scalar-tensor theories, extending the four-derivative framework previously developed by Steven Weinberg. The on-shell effective field theory comprises five parity-even and three parity-odd independent six-derivative scalar-tensor interactions, representing all inequivalent deformations consistent with general covariance. We further confirm this operator counting through an independent analysis using the scattering amplitude formalism in four-dimensional flat spacetime. The six-derivative Lagrangian constructed here provides the next-to-leading-order extension of scalar-tensor gravity, furnishing a robust framework for exploring quantum or stringy corrections, parity-violating interactions, and strong-curvature effects in cosmology, black hole physics and gravitational wave observations.</description>

      <title>A post-inflationary kinetic axion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel realization of axion kinetic misalignment, triggered by a Hubble-induced phase transition during a post-inflationary stiff (kination) era. A negative Ricci scalar flips the sign of a non-minimally coupled mass term for a non-minimally coupled complex field $\Phi$, driving its radial mode to large amplitudes via a tachyonic instability. At large $|\Phi|$, higher-dimensional $U(1)$-breaking operators become relevant and impart a kick in the angular direction, generating a conserved $U(1)$ charge that sustains rotation as the symmetry is approximately restored. Because phases randomize across causally disconnected regions, multiple domains with distinct charges form. The subsequent axion potential converts the domain charges into an axion abundance, yielding dark matter even when the net global charge vanishes. We analyze the dynamics through a linear, domain-averaged treatment and identify two thermal histories: (i) Ricci reheating via saxion decays to Higgs bosons; (ii) external reheating with efficient damping of saxion energy by Higgs/fermion scatterings. The mechanism populates regions underabundant in standard misalignment, which are accessible to next generation axion searches.</description>

Abstract: In the present thesis, the author reviews the physics of cosmological first-order phase transitions that may have occured shortly after the Big Bang. Such transitions proceed via the nucleation and expansion of true vacuum bubbles and give rise to a rich phenomenology, for instance the emission of a stochastic gravitational-wave background caused by bubble collisions. The author discusses, in depth, the formalism of the effective scalar potential and its different contributions in the loop expansion, points out the necessary ingredients for a first-order transition, and assesses the detectability of the associated gravitational-wave spectrum via future space-based observatories and pulsar timing arrays. He then applies the the developed phenomenological toolbox to investigate the detection prospect for phase transitions in the context of specific theories such as the Vev Flip-Flop (a dark matter mechanism) and the Dark Photon Model.</description>

      <title>Tomographic Alcock-Paczynski Test with Marked Correlation Functions</title>

Abstract: The tomographic Alcock-Paczynski(AP) method, developed over the past decade, exploits redshift evolution for cosmological determination, aiming to mitigate contamination from redshift distortions and capture nonlinear scale information. Marked Correlation Functions (MCFs) extend information beyond the two-point correlation. For the first time, this study integrated the tomographic AP test with MCFs to constrain the flat $w$CDM cosmology model. Our findings show that multiple density weights in MCFs outperform the traditional two-point correlation function, reducing the uncertainties of the matter density parameter $\Omega_m$ and dark energy equation of state $w$ by 48\% and 45\%, respectively. Furthermore, we introduce a novel principal component analysis (PCA) compression scheme that efficiently projects high-dimensional statistical measurements into a compact set of eigenmodes while preserving most of the cosmological information. This approach retains significantly more information than traditional coarse binning methods, which simply average adjacent bins in a lossy manner, yielding an additional $\sim 40\%$ reduction in error margins. To assess robustness, we incorporate realistic redshift errors expected in future spectroscopic surveys. While these errors modestly degrade cosmological constraints, our combined framework, which utilizes MCFs and PCA compression within tomographic AP tests, is less affected and always yields tight cosmological constraints. This scheme remains highly promising for upcoming slitless spectroscopic surveys, such as the Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST).</description>

      <title>Polynomial Potential Inflation in the ACT Era: From CMB to Primordial Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12816v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent measurements from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) favor a higher value of the scalar spectral index $n_s$ compared to the Planck data, challenging many well-established inflationary models. In this work, we investigate the viability of polynomial potential inflation in light of the latest ACT data, systematically analyzing cases from $n=2$ to $n=5$. By exploring the parameter space and deriving constraints on the model coefficients, we find that the cubic to quintic models can provide a good fit to the data, while the quadratic model struggles to simultaneously accommodate the ACT data and the requirement of sufficient inflation. Notably, the quintic case ($n=5$) not only matches cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations but also produces an inflection point that simultaneously triggers primordial black hole formation and generates a scalar-induced gravitational wave. These findings establish higher-order polynomial potentials as compelling frameworks and reconcile precision CMB measurements with multi-messenger probes of early-universe physics.</description>

      <title>Scalar-Induced Gravitational Waves in Palatini $f(R)$ Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13420v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Primordial scalar perturbations that reenter the horizon after inflation may induce a second-order Gravitational Wave spectrum with information about the primordial Universe on scales inaccessible to Cosmic Microwave Background experiments. In this work, we develop a general framework for the study of Scalar-Induced Gravitational Waves in Palatini $f(R)$ gravity, a theory that was proven to successfully realise inflation and quintessence, and consider the case of the Starobinsky-like model as an example. A regime of radiation domination with a subdominant matter component is assumed, allowing for a well-motivated perturbative approach to the gravity modifications. We calculate the kernel function and the density spectrum numerically and find accurate analytical expressions. The spectral density, which may be tested across a wide range of frequencies by upcoming Gravitational Wave experiments, is shown to differ from the General Relativity and metric $f(R)$ gravity predictions under certain conditions. We comment on previous results in the literature regarding the metric formulation and make special emphasis on the potential of these distinctive features of the spectrum to probe the two formalisms of gravity.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of Dark Matter and Baryon Density From Galaxies: A Comparison of Linear, Halo Model and Machine Learning-Based Methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12530v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For many analyses in cosmology it is necessary to reconstruct the likely distribution of unobserved fields, such as dark matter or non-luminous baryons, from observed luminous tracers. The dominant approach in cosmology has been to use the so-called halo model, which assumes radially symmetric profiles centered around luminous tracers such as galaxies. More recently, field-level machine learning methods have been proposed that can learn to estimate the unobserved field after being trained on simulations. However, it is unclear whether machine learning methods indeed significantly improve over linear methods or the halo model. In this paper we make a systematic comparison of different approaches to reconstruct dark matter and non-luminous baryons, from galaxy data using the CAMELS simulations. These simulations are in a $25\ \texttt{Mpc/h}$ box, allowing us to compare performance on the mildly non-linear scales $(k\sim 0.4\ \mathrm{h/Mpc})$ down to the size of individual halos. We find the best results using a combined GNN-CNN approach. We also provide a general analysis and visualization of the relationship of matter, non-luminous baryons, halos, and galaxies in these simulations to interpret our results.</description>

      <title>Signature of polarized ultralight vector dark matter in pulsar timing arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07358v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate observational signatures of ultralight vector dark matter with masses $m \sim 10^{-24}$-$10^{-22}$ eV in pulsar timing arrays, taking into account general polarization states of the vector field. We find that vector dark matter induces pulsar timing residuals with nontrivial directional dependence, reflecting the anisotropic property and polarization structure specific to vector dark matter, unlike scalar dark matter. We also derive angular correlation curves of the timing residuals. Intriguingly, circular polarization of the vector dark matter enhances the quadrupole nature of the correlation curve, resulting in a more notable bending of the Hellings-Downs curve. The derived correlation curves offer a useful means to distinguish gravitational wave and dark matter contributions and to probe the nature of dark matter.</description>

      <title>Abundance and phase-space distribution of subhalos in cosmological N-body simulations: testing numerical convergence and correction methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07678v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Subhalos play a crucial role in accurately modeling galaxy formation and galaxy-based cosmological probes within the highly nonlinear, virialized regime. However, numerical convergence of subhalo evolution is difficult to achieve, especially in the inner regions of host halos where tidal forces are strongest. I investigate the numerical convergence and correction methods for the abundance, spatial, and velocity distributions of subhalos using two $6144^3$-particle cosmological N-body simulations with different mass resolutions -- Jiutian-300 ($1.0 \times 10^{7}\,h^{-1}M_{\odot}$) and Jiutian-1G ($3.7 \times 10^{8}\,h^{-1}M_{\odot}$) -- with subhalos identified by HBT+. My study shows that the Surviving subhalo Peak Mass Function (SPMF) converges only for subhalos with $m_{\mathrm{peak}}$ above $5000$ particles but can be accurately recovered by including orphan subhalos that survive according to the merger timescale model of Jiang et al., which outperforms other models. Including orphan subhalos also enables recovery of the real-space spatial and velocity distributions to $5$--$10\%$ accuracy down to scales of $0.1$--$0.2\,h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$. The remaining differences are likely due to cosmic variance and finite-box effects in the smaller Jiutian-300 simulation. Convergence below $0.1\,h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$ remains challenging and requires more sophisticated modeling of orphan subhalos. I further highlight that redshift-space multipoles are more difficult to recover even at larger scales because unreliable small-scale pairs at $r_{\mathrm{p}} &lt; 0.1\,h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$ in real space affect scales of tens of $\mathrm{Mpc}$ in redshift space due to elongated Fingers-of-God effects. Therefore, for redshift-space statistics, I recommend using modified or alternative measures that reduce sensitivity to small projected separations in subhalo-based studies.</description>

      <title>Stochastic inflation with gradient interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05124v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stochastic inflation rests on the separate-universe approximation, i.e. the ability to describe long-wavelength fluctuations in an inflating universe as homogeneous perturbations of its background dynamics. Although this approximation is valid in most cases, it has been recently pointed out that it breaks down during transition periods between attractor and non-attractor phases. Such transitions are ubiquitous in single-field models giving rise to enhanced perturbations at small scales, that are required to form primordial black holes. The current inability to apply the stochastic-inflation program in such models is therefore one of the main obstacles to investigating the role of backreaction in primordial-black-hole scenarios. In this work, we show how gradient interactions can be incorporated in stochastic inflation, via a set of Langevin equations of higher dimension. We apply our formalism to a few cases of interest, including one with a sharp transition. In all cases, in the classical limit we show that gradient corrections as predicted from cosmological perturbation theory are properly recovered. We uncover the existence of a "pullback" effect by which the tails of the first-passage-time distributions are dampened by gradient interactions. We finally discuss the role of backreaction in the presence of gradient interactions.</description>

      <title>Phantom Crossing with Quintom Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12335v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a two-scalar field quintom model, which utilises both a quintessence-like and a phantom-like scalar field, enabling a smooth and stable transition across the $w=-1$ phantom divide as hinted by recent measurements of Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 2. We explore a range of initial conditions and potential configurations that facilitate such a phantom-to-quintessence-like crossing, and find that this can be naturally realised with hill-top or cliff-face potentials bound from above. We study how varying these conditions affects the dynamics of the system, calculate the background observables and compare them with DESI, CMB, and Type Ia supernova data, identifying a viable parameter space for our model. In particular, we find that a potential featuring a hyperbolic tangent form can successfully reproduce the desired phantom crossing, although such models can suffer from fine-tuning effects. Finally, we discuss prospects for distinguishing such models with upcoming state-of-the-art cosmological observations.</description>

      <title>Analytic derivation of GW spectrum from bubble collisions in FLRW Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16073v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We generalize the analytic formula for the gravitational-wave spectrum from bubble collisions during a cosmological first-order phase transition, under the thin-wall and envelope approximations, by incorporating the effect of cosmic expansion in the FLRW metric. Along with presenting the complete analytic expression and corresponding numerical results, we also derive simplified formulas valid in the large- and small-$k$ limits, as well as in the Minkovski limit. The latter expansion reveals that the Minkovski approximation breaks down for $\beta / H_* \lesssim 10$, where $\beta$ denotes the inverse duration of the phase transition and $H_*$ the Hubble parameter at its completion. Furthermore, the next-to-leading-order term contributes about a $10\%$ correction for $\beta / H_* \sim 140$, a typical value for the electroweak phase transition.</description>

      <title>The Binary Ballet: Mapping Local Expansion Around M81 &amp; M82</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24840v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study of the M81 complex and its Hubble flow delivers new and improved Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB)-based distances for nine member galaxies, yielding a total of 58 galaxies with high-precision TRGB distances. With those, we perform a systematic analysis of the group's dynamics in the core and its embedding in the local cosmic environment. Our analysis confirms that the satellite galaxies of the M81 complex exhibit a flattened, planar distribution almost perpendicular to the supergalactic pole and thus aligned with a larger-scale filamentary structure in the Local Universe. We demonstrate that the properties of the group's barycentre are robustly constrained by the two brightest members, M81 and M82, and that correcting heliocentric velocities for the solar motion in the Local Group decreases the velocity dispersion of the group. Then applying minor and major infall models, we fit the local Hubble flow to constrain the Hubble Constant and the total mass of the M81 complex. The joint best-fit parameters from both models yield $H_0 = \left(63 \pm 6 \right)$ km/s/Mpc and total mass of $(2.28\pm 0.49) \times 10^{12} M_{\odot}$. We thus arrive at an increased mass estimate compared to prior work but reach a higher consistency with virial, $(2.74 \pm 0.36)\times 10^{12}\,M_\odot$, and projected-mass estimates, $(3.11 \pm 0.69)\times 10^{12} M_\odot$. Moreover, our $H_0$ estimate shows an agreement with Planck, consistent with other TRGB-based Local-Universe inferences of $H_0$ and still within a 2-$\sigma$ agreement with Cepheid-based Local-Universe probes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06640v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the Starobinsky inflation model and the impact of curvature corrections, particularly a cubic $R^3$ term, to assess their behavior in light of the latest observational results from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT). With the recent sixth data release (DR6), the scalar spectral index was measured to be $n_s=0.9743 \pm 0.0034$, which appears to exclude the pure Starobinsky model at approximately the $2\sigma$ level. In this paper, we implement the Starobinsky inflationary potential directly into the CLASS code, without relying on the slow-roll approximation, and we constrain the number of e-folds of inflation $N_k$ using a theoretically motivated range derived from reheating considerations and standard couplings between matter fields and gravity. We show that it is still possible to identify a significant region of parameter space where the Starobinsky model remains highly consistent with the latest observational data. While the pure Starobinsky model remains a compelling candidate for cosmic inflation, we explore how including a cubic $R^3$ term can shift its predictions to better align with the Planck and ACT measurements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.16032v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we constrain the phenomenological interacting dark energy (IDE) model using \emph{Fermi} gamma-ray burst (GRB) dataset and the latest baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 2 (DR2). Through a joint Bayesian analysis, we perform a cosmological comparative assessment of the $\Lambda$CDM, $w$CDM, and CPL models with the phenomenological IDE model. For the phenomenological IDE model in a flat universe with \emph{Fermi} samples and DESI DR2, we obtain: $\xi=2.63^{+0.63}_{-0.52}$, $\xi + 3w_X = -0.98^{+1.90}_{-2.07}$ with the GOLD sample ($1.4\le z \le5.6$) and $\xi=2.83^{+0.63}_{-0.58}$, $\xi + 3w_X = 0.03^{+1.35}_{-1.33}$ with the FULL sample ($1.4\le z \le8.2$), respectively. Our analysis shows that the $\Lambda$CDM model without interaction ($\xi=3$, $\xi + 3w_X = 0$) is consistent with the latest \emph{Fermi} sample and DESI DR2 at $1\sigma$ confidence level. We find no significant deviations from the standard model using AIC and BIC criterias.</description>

      <title>Prospects for joint multiband detection of intermediate-mass black holes by LGWA and the Einstein Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10165v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational-wave (GW) detection offers a novel approach to exploring intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs). The GW signals from IMBH mergers mainly fall in the decihertz frequency band. The lunar-based GW detector, the Lunar Gravitational-Wave Antenna (LGWA), exhibits high sensitivity in this band, making it particularly well-suited for detecting IMBHs. However, for lower-mass IMBHs, the late inspiral and merger signals enter the sensitive frequency range of ground-based GW detectors. In this work, we aim to explore how multi-band observations with LGWA and the third-generation ground-based GW detector, the Einstein Telescope (ET), can contribute to detecting the population of IMBHs. We consider three population distribution cases of IMBHs, including two population models based on astrophysical motivations and a uniform distribution, and compute the signal-to-noise ratios for LGWA, ET, and their combination to directly compare their capabilities in detecting IMBH mergers. Our results suggest that LGWA possesses strong detection capability for high-mass IMBH mergers. At redshift $z = 1$, LGWA's detection rate for IMBH binaries with primary masses above $5 \times 10^4~M_\odot$ is largely insensitive to orbital inclination and mass ratio. In contrast, ET is more suited for detecting IMBH binaries with primary masses below $10^3~M_\odot$. The multi-band observation of LGWA and ET possesses strong detection capabilities across the full IMBH mass spectrum. Furthermore, we find that the multi-band detection can significantly and effectively recover the IMBH population distributions. In summary, we conclude that the multi-band observations of LGWA and ET will provide powerful detection capabilities for IMBHs and are expected to significantly enhance our understanding of this important yet still poorly observed class of black holes.</description>

      <title>Lightcurve Features of Magnetar-Powered Superluminous Supernovae with Gravitational-Wave Emission and High-Energy Leakage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18940v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) are a distinct class of stellar explosions, exhibiting peak luminosities 10-100 times brighter than those of normal SNe. Their extreme luminosities cannot be explained by the radioactive decay of $^{56}\mathrm{Ni}$ and its daughter $^{56}\mathrm{Co}$ alone. Consequently, models invoking newly formed millisecond magnetars have been widely proposed, capable of supplying additional energy through magnetic dipole radiation. For these rapidly rotating magnetars, however, gravitational-wave (GW) emission may also contribute significantly to the spin-down, particularly during their early evolutionary stages. While high-energy photons initially remain trapped within the optically thick ejecta, they will eventually escape as the ejecta becomes transparent during the expansion, thereby influencing the late-time lightcurve. In this work, we adopt an analytical framework to systematically explore the combined effects of GW emission and high-energy leakage on the lightcurve of SLSNe. Compared to scenarios that neglect these processes, we find that for magnetars with initial spin periods of millisecond, the combined influence suppresses early-time luminosities but enhances late-time emission. We further investigate the effects of the neutron-star equation of state to the lightcurve, GW emission efficiency, ejecta mass, and other relevant quantities. Our results highlight the complex interplay between GW-driven spin-down and radiative transport in shaping the observable features of SLSNe, offering new insights into diagnosing the nature of their central engines.</description>

      <title>Searching for a Dark Dimension Right-handed Neutrino in KATRIN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05233v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the possibility that the Right-handed neutrino is a five-dimensional state propagating along a micron size extra dimension, as required in the dark dimension proposal. We work out the signatures of R-neutrino production in KATRIN experiment and compare them with those of a sterile neutrino which manifests by a kink in the electron energy spectrum of the beta-decay at a value corresponding to the sterile neutrino mass. We explore the allowed parameter space of the compactification scale and the R-neutrino bulk mass versus the Yukawa coupling, and show that a large part of it is within KATRIN's sensitivity. When the bulk mass is much smaller than the compactification scale, several kinks could be observed corresponding to the positions of the R-neutrino Kaluza-Klein excitations, while for large bulk mass there will be effectively one kink at the position of the bulk mass.</description>

      <title>From geometry to cosmology: a pedagogical review of inflation in curvature, torsion, and extended gravity theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14306v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a simplified review of inflationary cosmology across various modified gravity theories. These include models based on curvature, torsion, and non-metricity. We explore how scalar fields interact with different geometric quantities and how these interactions affect inflationary dynamics. Key cosmological features such as background evolution, reheating, and observable parameters are discussed. We also examine exotic scenarios inspired by string theory, extra dimensions, and non-local models. This work aims to connect theoretical models with observational data and future missions, offering guidance for exploring inflation beyond general relativity.</description>

      <title>The SPHEREx Satellite Mission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02985v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: SPHEREx, a NASA explorer satellite launched on 11 March 2025, is carrying out the first all-sky near-infrared spectral survey. The satellite observes in 102 spectral bands from 0.75 to 5.0 um with a resolving power ranging from 35 to 130 in 6.2 arcsecond pixels. The observatory obtains a 5-sigma depth of 19.5 - 19.9 AB mag for 0.75 to 3.8 um and 17.8 - 18.8 AB mag for 3.8 to 5.0 um after mapping the full sky four times over two years. Scientifically, SPHEREx will produce a large galaxy redshift survey over the full sky, intended to constrain the amplitude of inflationary non-Gaussianity. The observations will produce two deep spectral maps near the ecliptic poles that will use intensity mapping to probe the evolution of galaxies over cosmic history. By mapping the depth of infrared absorption features over the Galactic plane, SPHEREx will comprehensively survey the abundance and composition of water and other biogenic ice species in the interstellar medium. The initial data are rapidly released in the form of spectral images to the public. The project will release specialized data products over the life of the mission as the surveys proceed. The science team will also produce specialized spectral catalogs on planet-bearing and low-mass stars, solar system objects, and galaxy clusters 3 years after launch. We describe the design of the instrument and spacecraft, which flow from the core science requirements. Finally, we present an initial evaluation of the in-flight performance and key characteristics.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the intergalactic magnetic field from Fermi-LAT observations of GRB 221009A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11128v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A cosmological origin of the magnetic fields in large scale structures of the Universe would require a non-negligible magnetic field in cosmic voids, which, however, remains undetected. Gamma-ray emission from gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) offers the opportunity to indirectly probe such an intergalactic magnetic field (IGMF), as gamma rays interact with cosmic radiation fields, producing electron-positron pairs, and initiate an electromagnetic cascade. The deflection of the pairs in the IGMF results in a time-delayed signal at GeV energies. Using observations with the Fermi Large Area Telescope of the GRB 221009A, we are able to derive the most stringent constraints to date from the non-observation of the cascade and rule out magnetic fields B &lt; 2.5 x 10^{-17} G at 95% confidence level for a coherence length larger than 1 Mpc. Our results are comparable to limits obtained from blazar observations but do not suffer from assumptions on the duty cycle of the gamma-ray source or whether inverse-Compton scattering losses dominate over the development of plasma instabilities.</description>

      <title>GLIMPSE-D: An Exotic Balmer-Jump Object at z=6.20? Revisiting Photometric Selection and the Cosmic Abundance of Pop III Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11790v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present deep JWST/NIRSpec G395M spectroscopy of GLIMPSE-16043, a promising $z\sim6$ Pop III candidate originally identified through NIRCam photometry as having weak [OIII]$\lambda\lambda4959,5007$ emission. Our follow-up reveals clear [OIII] emission, ruling out a genuine zero-metallicity nature. However, the combination of the measured line fluxes and photometry indicates that its spectral energy distribution requires an extraordinarily strong Balmer jump ($-1.66 \pm 0.47$ mag) and H$\alpha$ equivalent width ($3750\pm1800$ \AA), features that cannot be reproduced by current stellar+nebular or pure nebular photoionization models. The only models approaching the observations to almost within $1\sigma$ involve a hot ($T_{\rm eff}\!\simeq\!10^{4.7}$ K) single blackbody embedded in a low-$T_{\rm e}$ nebular environment, suggestive of scenarios such as a tidal-disruption event or a microquasar with strong disk winds. This cautions that photometric Pop~III selections are vulnerable to contamination when the rest-frame optical continuum is undetected. Motivated by this, we refine the photometric Pop III selection criteria to exclude the locus of extreme Balmer-jump objects. The revised criteria also recover the recently reported spectroscopic candidate AMORE6, demonstrating that the updated selection preserves sensitivity to genuine Pop III-like sources while removing key contaminants. Applying the refined criteria across legacy survey fields and five newly released CANUCS lensing cluster fields, we revisit the Pop III UV luminosity function and estimate the Pop III cosmic star-formation rate density to be $\approx[10^{-6}$--$10^{-4}]$~$M_{\odot}$~yr$^{-1}$~cMpc$^{-3}$ at $z\simeq6$--7, falling in the range of current theoretical predictions.</description>
