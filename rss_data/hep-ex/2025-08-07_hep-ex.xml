      <title>Multiplicity dependence of the entropy and heat capacity for pp collisions at LHC energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the multiplicity dependence of the transverse momentum spectrum of the charged particle production in pp collisions at LHC energies. To this end, we consider the experimental data sets classified with different multiplicity estimators, defined by the ALICE Collaboration, that are analyzed within the framework of nonextensive particle production. We compute the variance, kurtosis, Shannon entropy, and heat capacity of the $p_T$ spectrum to study the hardening process as a function of the multiplicity and temperature under the different event classifiers. We found that both the Shannon entropy and the heat capacity show different responses for the triggers at the forward-backward and midrapidity regions. We emphasize that the selection of event biases may induce different responses in estimating theoretical and phenomenological observables that could lead to misleading conclusions.</description>

      <title>T versus CP effects in DUNE and T2HK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time reversal (T) symmetry violations in neutrino oscillations imply the presence of an $L$-odd component in the transition probability at fixed neutrino energy, with $L$ denoting the distance between neutrino source and detector. Within the standard three-flavour framework, we show that the combination of the transition probabilities determined at the DUNE and T2HK experiments can establish the presence of an $L$-odd component, and therefore provide sensitivity to T violation, up to $4\sigma$ significance. The optimal neutrino energy window is from 0.68 to 0.92 GeV, and therefore a crucial role is played by the low-energy part of the DUNE event spectrum covering the second oscillation maximum. We compare the sensitivity to T violation based on this energy range using neutrino data only with the more traditional search for charge-parity (CP) violation based on the comparison of neutrino versus anti-neutrino beam data. We show that for DUNE it is advantageous to run in neutrino mode only, i.e., searching for T violating effects, whereas T2HK is more sensitive to CP violation, comparing neutrino and anti-neutrino data. Hence, the two experiments offer complementary methods to determine the complex phase in the PMNS mixing matrix.</description>

      <title>Minicharged Particle Sensitivity of the MAPP Outrigger Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a detailed study of the projected background-free sensitivity of the MAPP Outrigger Detector (OD) to minicharged particles (mCPs) at the High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC). As the first upgrade to the MAPP Experiment, the MAPP OD is a standalone detector designed to offer enhanced sensitivity to high-mass mCPs with intermediate effective charges. The MAPP OD is planned for installation in a duct adjacent to the MAPP-1 detector, located between the LHC's UA83 gallery and the beamline. Considering mCP production via the Drell-Yan mechanism and various meson decays, the results show that, at the 95% confidence level, the MAPP OD can extend the experiment's upper mass reach to mCP masses of approximately 200 GeV at the HL-LHC.</description>

      <title>A mobile high spatial-resolution Muography hodoscope based on large-area Micromegas detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Muon radiography is an imaging technique based on muon absorption in matter that allows measurement of internal details in hidden objects or structures. This technique relies on measuring cosmic-ray muons tracks accurately, which reflects the incoming muon flux from both the target object and the open sky. In this paper, we report on the construction of a high spatial resolution muography hodoscope based on Micromegas detectors. Using four layers of 40cm {\times} 40 cm Micromegas detectors, channel multiplexing circuits, and the versatile readout system, a moveable muography hodoscope named {\mu}STC-R400 was designed and constructed. Results show that the channel multiplexing circuits can resolve hit positions correctly, and the spatial resolution of the detector is approximately 190 {\mu}m. Experiments were conducted at an under-construction subway tunnel and outdoors near a mountain, demonstrating the {\mu}STC-R400's ability to maintain high spatial resolution outside the laboratory and its robustness in harsh environments.</description>

      <title>QCD condensates and $\alpha_s$ from $e^+e^-$ and $\tau$-decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this talk, I review the determinations of the QCD condensates and $\alpha_s$ within the SVZ expansion using the ratio of Laplace sum rule (LSR) and $\tau$-like moments in $e^+e^-\to I=1$ Hadrons and in $\tau\to \nu_\tau+$Hadrons Axial-vector (A) and V-A channels. Some misprints in the original papers [1-3] have been corrected. We found that the value of the gluon condensate agrees with the one $\langle \alpha_s G^2\rangle=(6.35\pm 0.35)\times 10^{-2}$ GeV$^4$ from quarkonia and some other sum rules but less accurate, while the factorization of the four-quark condensate is violated by a factor about 6: $\rho\langle\bar\psi\psi\rangle^2=(5.98\pm 0.64)\times 10^{-4}$ GeV$^6$ which confirms previous findings. Extracting the QCD condensates up to dimension D=20 from $e^+e^-$ and the axial-vector channel of $\tau$-decay, we do not find any exponential growth of their values in the Euclidian region, thus excluding (by duality) any significant effect of the so-called Duality Violation (DV) in the Time-like one. The optimal values of $\alpha_s(M_\tau)$ from $e^+e^-\to$ Hadrons and $\tau$-decays agree each others and lead to the average: $\alpha_s(M_\tau)=0.3128(51)$ [resp.0.3330(57)] $ \longrightarrow \alpha_s(M_Z) = 0.1176$ [resp. 0.1201] $(7)_{fit}(3)_{evol.}$ for Fixed Order (FO) [resp. Contour improved (CI)] PT series to be compared with the PDG24 average (without Lattice calculations): $ \alpha_s(M_Z) = 0.1175(10)$.</description>

      <title>The Fast Stochastic Matching Pursuit for Neutrino and Dark Matter Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03156v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) are widely deployed at neutrino and dark matter experiments for photon counting. When multiple photons hit a PMT consecutively, their photo-electron (PE) pulses pile up to hinder the precise measurements of the count and timings. We introduce Fast Stochastic Matching Pursuit (FSMP) to analyze the PMT signal waveforms into individual PEs with the strategy of reversible-jump Markov-chain Monte Carlo. We demonstrate that FSMP improves the energy and time resolution of PMT-based experiments and gains acceleration on GPUs. It is suitable for dynode PMTs, and is extensible to microchannel-plate (MCP) PMTs. In the condition of our laboratory characterization of 8-inch MCP-PMTs, FSMP improves the energy resolution by up to 10% from the conventional method of waveform integration.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Neutrino Reconstruction in Water-Cherenkov Air Shower Arrays Using Multi-Photosensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08652v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, the potential of water Cherenkov detectors equipped with multi-PMT modules for background-free upward-going neutrino detection and improved direction reconstruction is demonstrated. By analyzing signal time traces with transformer-based models, significant improvements in angular resolution are achieved compared to previous designs with larger PMTs. These detectors enable the reconstruction of neutrino directions with resolutions of approximately $10^\circ$ in azimuth and $7^\circ$ in zenith for high-signal events, corresponding to an overall opening angle of approximately $10^\circ$. This design reduces saturation effects and enhances directional sensitivity, particularly for high-energy neutrinos. The results highlight the potential of WCD arrays as complementary tools for neutrino astronomy, particularly in the context of multimessenger observations of transient astrophysical sources. The nearly continuous operation and wide field of view of these detectors further enhance their suitability for real-time monitoring and alert generation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14365v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a dedicated model to assist with the life cycle analysis of emissions of scientific computing centres. The model takes into account both the embodied carbon and emissions from use, as well as other factors such as data centre power usage efficiency, data centre expansion, hardware replacement, increase in energy efficiency of next-generation hardware, reduction in carbon intensity of the electricity supply and potential for heat reuse. If differs from existing models in its detailed handling of hardware embodied carbon and time dependency of various factors affecting the emissions. We present a number of scenarios where we apply the model to real-life HPC centres in different countries to illustrate how the trade-offs depend on the various factors and validate our model against the literature.</description>

      <title>Third-Family Quark-Lepton Unification and Electroweak Precision Tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.11584v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the compatibility of the hypothesis of third-family quark-lepton unification at the TeV scale with electroweak precision data, lepton flavor universality tests, and high-$p_T$ constraints. We work within the framework of the UV complete flavor non-universal 4321 gauge model, which is matched at one loop to the Standard Model Effective Field Theory. For consistency, all electroweak precision observables are also computed at one loop within the effective field theory. At tree level, the most sizeable corrections are to $W\rightarrow \tau\nu_\tau$ and $Z \to \nu_\tau \nu_\tau$ due to integrating out a pseudo-Dirac singlet fermion required by the model for neutrino mass generation. At loop level, the new colored states of the model generate large flavor-universal contributions to the electroweak precision observables via leading- and next-to-leading log running effects, yielding a significant improvement in the electroweak fit (including an increase in the $W$-boson mass). These effects cannot be decoupled if the model addresses the charged-current $B$-meson anomalies. Overall, we find good compatibility between the data sets, while simultaneously satisfying all low- and high-energy constraints.</description>

      <title>Baryon Number Violation: From Nuclear Matrix Elements to BSM Physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16983v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Processes that violate baryon number, most notably proton decay and $n\bar n$ transitions, are promising probes of physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM) needed to understand the lack of antimatter in the Universe. To interpret current and forthcoming experimental limits, theory input from nuclear matrix elements to UV complete models enters. Thus, an interplay of experiment, effective field theory, lattice QCD, and BSM model building is required to develop strategies to accurately extract information from current and future data and maximize the impact and sensitivity of next-generation experiments. Here, we briefly summarize the main results and discussions from the workshop "INT-25-91W: Baryon Number Violation: From Nuclear Matrix Elements to BSM Physics," held at the Institute for Nuclear Theory, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, January 13-17, 2025.</description>

      <title>Studying Two-Photon Exchange in Deep Inelastic Scattering with the HERA Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23092v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-photon exchange (TPE) is one of the leading explanations for discrepancies in measurements of the proton electromagnetic form factors. It has been proposed that TPE could impact not only elastic scattering, but also the cross sections for both inclusive deep inelastic scattering (DIS) and semi-inclusive DIS, thereby affecting the interpretation of DIS structure functions in terms of parton distributions. It is expected that higher-order QED effects such as TPE should manifest as a deviation from unity in the ratio of \epp and \emp DIS cross sections. We use the existing inclusive $e^{\pm}p$ DIS data from HERA and SLAC to constrain higher-order QED effects on inclusive DIS.</description>
