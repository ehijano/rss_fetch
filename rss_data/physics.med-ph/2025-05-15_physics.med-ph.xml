      <title>An ion treatment planning framework for inclusion of nanodosimetric ionization detail through cluster dose</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanodosimetry relates Ionization Detail (ID) and ionization parameters (Ip) to biological endpoints relevant for charged-particle radiotherapy. This supports a more physics-based modeling of biological effectiveness than traditional dose-response relationships and RBE models. Faddegon et al. (2023) introduced cluster dose g(Ip) as a physical quantity, bridging ID to the treatment planning level, which can be directly optimized. We developed a framework enabling cluster dose optimization via a pencil-beam (PB) algorithm, and validated against Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. The framework, integrated into the treatment planning toolkit matRad, uses precomputed Ip values obtained from MC track-structure simulations. We applied our tool for plan optimization with protons, helium, and carbon ions in a water phantom and a prostate case. Recalculation with TOPAS showed 3D gamma passing rates &gt;97% (phantom) and &gt;98% (patient) using a 3%/3mm criterion and a threshold of 10% of the maximum dose. Cluster dose F5 optimization produced homogeneous target coverage, with heavier ions requiring lower absorbed doses for the same prescribed cluster dose level. This demonstrates the feasibility of fast, accurate cluster dose optimization using PB algorithms.</description>

      <title>Virtual Dosimetrists: A Radiotherapy Training "Flight Simulator"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective education in radiotherapy plan quality review requires a robust, regularly updated set of examples and the flexibility to demonstrate multiple possible planning approaches and their consequences. However, the current clinic-based paradigm does not support these needs. To address this, we have developed 'Virtual Dosimetrist' models that can both generate training examples of suboptimal treatment plans and then allow trainees to improve the plan quality through simple natural language prompts, as if communicating with a dosimetrist. The dose generation and modification process is accurate, rapid, and requires only modest resources. This work is the first to combine dose distribution prediction with natural language processing; providing a robust pipeline for both generating suboptimal training plans and allowing trainees to practice their critical plan review and improvement skills that addresses the challenges of the current clinic-based paradigm.</description>

      <title>Automated grading and staging of ovarian cancer using deep learning on the transmission optical microscopy bright-field images of thin biopsy tissue samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ovarian cancer remains a challenging malignancy to diagnose and manage, with prognosis heavily dependent on the stage at detection. Accurate grading and staging, primarily based on histopathological examination of biopsy tissue samples, are crucial for treatment planning and predicting outcomes. However, this manual process is time-consuming and subject to inter-observer variability among pathologists. The increasing volume of digital histopathology slides necessitates the development of robust, automated methods to assist in this critical diagnostic step for ovarian cancer. (Methods) This study presents a deep learning framework for the automated prediction of ovarian cancer stage (classified into five categories: 0, I, II, III, IV) using routine histopathological images. We employed a transfer learning approach, fine-tuning a ResNet-101 convolutional neural network pre-trained on ImageNet. The training process incorporated comprehensive data augmentation, weighted random sampling, and class weighting to address dataset characteristics. Hyperparameter optimization for learning rate, dropout rate, and weight decay was performed using a genetic algorithm to enhance model performance and generalization. (Results) Evaluated on an independent test set of ovarian thin tissue brightfield images, the developed model achieved a high overall classification accuracy of 97.62%.</description>

      <title>Associations between iron and mean kurtosis in iron-rich grey matter nuclei in aging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04706v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mean kurtosis in iron-rich grey matter has values similar to that seen in white matter. We suspect these elevated values may be related to iron. Multi-shell diffusion and multi-echo gradient echo acquisitions were used to derive mean kurtosis and R2*, respectively. Mean kurtosis and R2* were measured in subcortical grey matter nuclei and white matter tracts in 93 older adults and 62 younger adults. Grey matter regions exhibited higher mean kurtosis and R2* in the older adult group whereas white matter regions had reduced mean kurtosis in the older adult group. Grey matter mean kurtosis was significantly correlated with R2* iron-rich grey matter nuclei in both groups. Our findings indicate that higher mean kurtosis in iron-rich grey matter structures may be due to either increased tissue complexity or to decreases in signal-to-noise ratios from iron deposition</description>

      <title>AneuPy: An open source Python tool for creating simulation-ready geometries of abdominal aortic aneurysms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15285v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are localized dilatations of the abdominal aorta that can lead to life-threatening rupture if left untreated. AAAs primarily affect older individuals, with high mortality rates following rupture, so early diagnosis and risk assessment are critical. The geometrical characteristics of an AAA, such as its maximum diameter, asymmetry, and wall thickness, are extremely significant in biomechanical models for the assessment of rupture risk. Despite the growing use of computational modeling for AAA investigation, there is a notable gap in accessible, open-source software capable of generating simulation-ready geometries for biomechanical and hemodynamic simulations. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{AneuPy}, an open-source Python-based tool designed to create both idealized and patient-specific AAA geometric models. \textbf{AneuPy} is a fast and automated approach for generating aneurysm geometries from minimal input data, allowing for extensive parameter customization. By automating the creation of simulation-ready geometries for finite element analysis (FEA), computational fluid dynamics (CFD), or fluid-structure interaction (FSI) models, \textbf{AneuPy} can facilitate research in AAA and improve patient-specific risk prediction.</description>
