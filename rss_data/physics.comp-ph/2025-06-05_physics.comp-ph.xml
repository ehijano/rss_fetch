      <title>A three-dimensional energy flux acoustic propagation model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper extends energy flux methods to handle three-dimensional ocean acoustic environments, the implemented solution captures horizontally refracted incoherent acoustic intensity, and its required computational effort is predominantly independent of range and frequency. Energy flux models are principally derived as incoherent solutions for acoustic propagation in bounded waveguides. The angular distribution of incoherent acoustic intensity may be derived from Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin modes transformed to the continuous angular domain via the ray-mode analogy. The adiabatic approximation maps angular distributions of acoustic intensity as waveguide properties vary along a range-dependent environment, and the final solution integrates a modal intensity kernel over propagation angles. Additional integration kernels can be derived that modulate the incoherent field by specific physical wave phenomena such as geometric spreading, refractive focusing, and boundary attenuation and interference. This three-dimensional energy flux model is derived from a double-mode-sum cross-product, is integrated over solid-angles, incorporates a bi-variate convergence factor, accounts for acoustic energy escaping the computational domain through transparent transverse boundaries, and accumulates bottom attenuation along transverse cycle trajectories. Transmission loss fields compare favorably with analytic, ray tracing, and parabolic equation solutions for the canonical ASA wedge problem, and three-dimensional adiabatic ray trajectories for the ideal wedge are demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Superatomic hydrogen: achieving effective aggregation of hydrogen atoms at pressures lower than that of metallic hydrogen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metal hydrogen exhibiting electron delocalization properties has been recognized as an important prospect for achieving controlled nuclear fusion, but the extreme pressure conditions required exceeding hundreds of GPa remain a daunting challenge. Here, we propose a model of superatomic hydrogen, aiming to reduce the pressure conditions required for the effective aggregation of elemental hydrogen atoms. High-precision ab initio calculations indicate that the pressure required to compress the H13 system with one central atom and 12 surrounding atoms into a superatomic state is approximately two orders of magnitude lower than that of metallic hydrogen. Atomic-level analyses reveal that in the superatomic state of compressed H13, the central H atom donates its electron, and all electrons are delocalized on the superatomic molecular orbitals, which conforms to properties of metallic hydrogen. Our discovery in principle opens up the prospect of superatomic hydrogen in areas such as nuclear fusion.</description>

      <title>GP-Recipe: Gaussian Process approximation to linear operations in numerical methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce new Gaussian Process (GP) high-order approximations to linear operations that are frequently used in various numerical methods. Our method employs the kernel-based GP regression modeling, a non-parametric Bayesian approach to regression that operates on the probability distribution over all admissible functions that fit observed data. We begin in the first part with discrete data approximations to various linear operators applied to smooth data using the most popular squared exponential kernel function. In the second part, we discuss data interpolation across discontinuities with sharp gradients, for which we introduce a new GP kernel that fits discontinuous data without oscillations. The current study extends our previous GP work on polynomial-free shock-capturing methods in finite difference and finite volume methods to a suite of linear operator approximations on smooth data. The formulations introduced in this paper can be readily adopted in daily practices in numerical methods, including numerical approximations of finite differences, quadrature rules, interpolations, and reconstructions, which are most frequently used in numerical modeling in modern science and engineering applications. In the test problems, we demonstrate that the GP approximated solutions feature improved solution accuracy compared to the conventional finite-difference counterparts.</description>

      <title>chemtrain-deploy: A parallel and scalable framework for machine learning potentials in million-atom MD simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning potentials (MLPs) have advanced rapidly and show great promise to transform molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. However, most existing software tools are tied to specific MLP architectures, lack integration with standard MD packages, or are not parallelizable across GPUs. To address these challenges, we present chemtrain-deploy, a framework that enables model-agnostic deployment of MLPs in LAMMPS. chemtrain-deploy supports any JAX-defined semi-local potential, allowing users to exploit the functionality of LAMMPS and perform large-scale MLP-based MD simulations on multiple GPUs. It achieves state-of-the-art efficiency and scales to systems containing millions of atoms. We validate its performance and scalability using graph neural network architectures, including MACE, Allegro, and PaiNN, applied to a variety of systems, such as liquid-vapor interfaces, crystalline materials, and solvated peptides. Our results highlight the practical utility of chemtrain-deploy for real-world, high-performance simulations and provide guidance for MLP architecture selection and future design.</description>

      <title>Two self-starting single-solve third-order explicit integration algorithms for second-order nonlinear dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The single-step explicit time integration methods have long been valuable for solving large-scale nonlinear structural dynamic problems, classified into single-solve and multi-sub-step approaches. However, no existing explicit single-solve methods achieve third-order accuracy. The paper addresses this gap by proposing two new third-order explicit algorithms developed within the framework of self-starting single-solve time integration algorithms, which incorporates 11 algorithmic parameters. The study reveals that fully explicit methods with single-solve cannot reach third-order accuracy for general dynamic problems. Consequently, two novel algorithms are proposed: Algorithm 1 is a fully explicit scheme that achieves third-order accuracy in displacement and velocity for undamped problems; Algorithm 2, which employs implicit treatment of velocity and achieves third-order accuracy for general dynamic problems. Across a suite of both linear and nonlinear benchmarks, the new algorithms consistently outperform existing single-solve explicit methods in accuracy. Their built-in numerical dissipation effectively filters out spurious high-frequency components, as demonstrated by two wave propagation problems. Finally, when applied to the realistic engineering problem, both of them deliver superior numerical precision at minimal computational cost.</description>

      <title>Critical transport behavior in quantum dot solids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to recent advances, silicon solar cells are rapidly approaching the Shockley-Queisser limit of 33% efficiency. Quantum Dot (QD) solar cells have the potential to surpass this limit and enable a new generation of photovoltaic technologies beyond the capabilities of any existing solar energy modalities. The creation of the first epitaxially-fused quantum dot solids showing broad phase coherence and metallicity necessary for solar implementation has not yet been achieved, and the metal-insulator transition in these materials needs to be explored. We have created a new model of electron transport through QD solids, informed by 3D-tomography of QD solid samples, which considers disorder in both the on-site and hopping terms of the commonly studied Anderson Hamiltonian. We used the transfer matrix method and finite-size scaling to create a dynamic metal-insulator transition phase diagram. For a surprisingly large portion of the parameter space, our model shows a critical exponent distinct from the expected value for the Anderson transition. We show the existence of a crossover region from the universality class of the Anderson transition (AI) to the Chiral Orthogonal class (BDI) due to the addition of weak kinetic (hopping) disorder.</description>

      <title>Learning-at-Criticality in Large Language Models for Quantum Field Theory and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fundamental physics often confronts complex symbolic problems with few guiding exemplars or established principles. While artificial intelligence (AI) offers promise, its typical need for vast datasets to learn from hinders its use in these information-scarce frontiers. We introduce learning at criticality (LaC), a reinforcement learning (RL) scheme that tunes Large Language Models (LLMs) to a sharp learning transition, addressing this information scarcity. At this transition, LLMs achieve peak generalization from minimal data, exemplified by 7-digit base-7 addition -- a test of nontrivial arithmetic reasoning. To elucidate this peak, we analyze a minimal concept-network model (CoNet) designed to capture the essence of how LLMs might link tokens. Trained on a single exemplar, this model also undergoes a sharp learning transition. This transition exhibits hallmarks of a second-order phase transition, notably power-law distributed solution path lengths. At this critical point, the system maximizes a ``critical thinking pattern" crucial for generalization, enabled by the underlying scale-free exploration. This suggests LLMs reach peak performance by operating at criticality, where such explorative dynamics enable the extraction of underlying operational rules. We demonstrate LaC in quantum field theory: an 8B-parameter LLM, tuned to its critical point by LaC using a few exemplars of symbolic Matsubara sums, solves unseen, higher-order problems, significantly outperforming far larger models. LaC thus leverages critical phenomena, a physical principle, to empower AI for complex, data-sparse challenges in fundamental physics.</description>

      <title>Physics-Based Compact Modeling for the Drain Current Variability in Single-Layer Graphene FETs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the growth of emerging graphene field-effect transistor (GFET) technologies, a thorough characterization of on-wafer variability is required. Here, we report for the first time a physics-based compact model, which precisely describes the drain current (ID) fluctuations of monolayer GFETs. Physical mechanisms known to generate 1/f noise in transistors, such as carrier number and Coulomb scattering mobility fluctuations, are also revealed to cause ID variance. Such effects are considered in the model by being activated locally in the channel and the integration of their contributions from source to drain results in total variance. The proposed model is experimentally validated from a statistical population of three different-sized solution-gated (SG) GFETs from strong p- to strong n-type bias conditions. A series resistance ID variance model is also derived mainly contributing at high carrier densities.</description>

      <title>Efficient and standardized interface energy calculations in hybrid heterostructures using fictitious atoms surface passivation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heterostructures combining diverse physico-chemical properties are increasingly in demand for a wide range of applications in modern science and technology. However, despite their importance in materials science, accurately determining absolute interface energies remains a major challenge. This difficulty arises from periodic boundary conditions, high computational costs of plane-wave methods, multipolar interactions in heterostructures, the need for thick slabs for interface convergence, and reconstructed surfaces on both slab faces. Here, we introduce a standardized and computationally efficient fictitious H* charge passivation method for the surface termination, designed to accurately determine absolute interface energies in heterogeneous materials associations. This approach effectively addresses issues associated with surface reconstructions while significantly reducing computational costs within the framework of density functional theory. To demonstrate its reliability, we calculate the absolute interface energies for various quasi-lattice-matched and lattice-mismatched abrupt III-V/Si interfaces using the H* passivation technique and benchmark the results against those obtained using conventional reconstructed surface methods. We further explore the early stages of strained epitaxial GaAs on Si(001). Finally, we assess the fictitious H* passivation method, showing its effectiveness in minimizing electric dipole errors, reducing computational costs, and thus decreasing greenhouse gas emissions from high-performance computing. Finally, the potential of the approach to compute interface energies across a broad spectrum of materials is emphasized.</description>

      <title>Lattice Boltzmann wall boundary conditions for RANS-based simulations with wall functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate wall boundary condition schemes for Lattice Boltzmann simulations of turbulent flows modeled using RANS equations with wall functions. Two alternative schemes are formulated and assessed: a hybrid regularized boundary condition and a slip-velocity bounce-back scheme. Their performance is evaluated using two canonical turbulent flow cases, a fully developed channel flow and a zero-pressure-gradient flat plate boundary layer (BL), selected specifically to isolate and analyze the impact of wall boundary condition treatments on turbulence modeling. The comparative analysis reveals that the slip-velocity bounce-back approach, which has received relatively little attention within the context of LBM-RANS with wall functions, consistently outperforms the regularized-based method in terms of both accuracy and sensitivity to mesh resolution. Moreover, the regularized-based approach is shown to be highly sensitive to the reconstruction of the wall-normal velocity gradient, even in simple geometries such as flat walls where no interpolation is required. This dependency necessitates the use of specialized, ad-hoc gradient reconstruction techniques, requirements that are not present in the slip-velocity bounce-back method.</description>

      <title>Experimental and simulative study on laser irradiation of 3D-printed micro-structures at intensities relevant for inertial confinement fusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inertial confinement fusion requires a constant search for the most effective materials for improving the efficiency of the compression of the capsule and of the laser-to-target energy transfer. Foams could provide a solution to these problems, but they require further experimental and theoretical investigation. The new 3D-printing technologies, such as the two-photon polymerization, are opening a new era in the production of foams, allowing for the fine control of the material morphology. Detailed studies of their interaction with high-power lasers in regimes relevant for inertial confinement fusion are very few in the literature so far and more investigation is needed. In this work we present the results an experimental campaign performed at the ABC laser facility in ENEA Centro Ricerche Frascati where 3D-printed micro-structured materials were irradiated at high power. 3D simulations of the laser-target interaction performed with the FLASH code reveal a strong scattering when the center of the focal spot is on the through hole of the structure. The time required for the laser to completely ablate the structure obtained by the simulations is in good agreement with the experimental measurement. The measure of the reflected and transmitted laser light indicates that the scattering occurred during the irradiation, in accordance with the simulations. Two-plasmon decay has also been found to be active during irradiation.</description>

      <title>Bridging Quantum Chemistry and MaxCut: Classical Performance Guarantees and Quantum Algorithms for the Hartree-Fock Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In quantum chemistry, self-consistent field (SCF) algorithms define a nonlinear optimization problem, with both continuous and discrete components. In this work, we derive Hartree-Fock-inspired SCF algorithms that can be exactly written as a sequence of Quadratic Unconstrained Spin/Binary Optimization problems (QUSO/QUBO). We reformulate the optimization problem as a series of MaxCut graph problems, which can be efficiently solved using semi-definite programming techniques. This procedure provides performance guarantees at each SCF step, irrespective of the complexity of the optimization landscape. We numerically demonstrate the QUBO-SCF and MaxCut-SCF methods by studying the hydroxide anion OH- and molecular Nitrogen N2. The largest problem addressed in this study involves a system comprised of 220 qubits (equivalently, spin-orbitals). Our results show that QUBO-SCF and MaxCut-SCF suffer much less from internal instabilities compared with conventional SCF calculations. Additionally, we show that the new SCF algorithms can enhance single-reference methods, such as configuration interaction. Finally, we explore how quantum algorithms for optimization can be applied to the QUSO problems arising from the Hartree-Fock method. Four distinct hybrid-quantum classical approaches are introduced: GAS-SCF, QAOA-SCF, QA-SCF and DQI-SCF.</description>

Abstract: In computational biophysics, where molecular data is expanding rapidly and system complexity is increasing exponentially, large language models (LLMs) and agent-based systems are fundamentally reshaping the field. This perspective article examines the recent advances at the intersection of LLMs, intelligent agents, and scientific computation, with a focus on biophysical computation. Building on these advancements, we introduce ADAM (Agent for Digital Atoms and Molecules), an innovative multi-agent LLM-based framework. ADAM employs cutting-edge AI architectures to reshape scientific workflows through a modular design. It adopts a hybrid neural-symbolic architecture that combines LLM-driven semantic tools with deterministic symbolic computations. Moreover, its ADAM Tool Protocol (ATP) enables asynchronous, database-centric tool orchestration, fostering community-driven extensibility. Despite the significant progress made, ongoing challenges call for further efforts in establishing benchmarking standards, optimizing foundational models and agents, building an open collaborative ecosystem and developing personalized memory modules.

      <title>Is the end of Insight in Sight ?</title>

Abstract: The rise of deep learning challenges the longstanding scientific ideal of insight - the human capacity to understand phenomena by uncovering underlying mechanisms. In many modern applications, accurate predictions no longer require interpretable models, prompting debate about whether explainability is a realistic or even meaningful goal. From our perspective in physics, we examine this tension through a concrete case study: a physics-informed neural network (PINN) trained on a rarefied gas dynamics problem governed by the Boltzmann equation. Despite the system's clear structure and well-understood governing laws, the trained network's weights resemble Gaussian-distributed random matrices, with no evident trace of the physical principles involved. This suggests that deep learning and traditional simulation may follow distinct cognitive paths to the same outcome - one grounded in mechanistic insight, the other in statistical interpolation. Our findings raise critical questions about the limits of explainable AI and whether interpretability can - or should-remain a universal standard in artificial reasoning.</description>

      <title>1D Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking in thermal equilibrium via Non-Hermitian Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19052v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spontaneous symmetry breaking generally circumvents one-dimensional systems with local interactions in thermal equilibrium. Here, we analyze a category of one-dimensional Hermitian models via local non-Hermitian constructions. Notably, spontaneous symmetry breaking and long-range order may emerge at finite temperatures in such systems under periodic boundary conditions, in sharp contrast to Hermitian constructions. We demonstrate clear numerical evidence, such as order parameters and specific heat, supporting phase diagrams with robust ordered phases. Non-Hermitian physics plays a vital role in prohibiting domain-wall proliferation and promoting spontaneous symmetry breaking. The fermions exhibit an exotic topological nature in their path-integral windings, which uphold nonzero integers -- commonly a non-Hermitian signature -- in the ordered phases, thus offering a novel and spontaneous origin for both symmetry breaking and non-Hermiticity.</description>

      <title>Anomalous pinch in electron-electron beam collision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09398v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that an anomalous pinch can occur in ultrarelativistic electron-electron or positron-positron beam interaction, caused by the combined interplay of collective beam motion (disruption) and strong-field quantum electrodynamics (SF-QED). The locally created electron-positron pairs, from SF-QED effects, screen the self-fields of the beams and can invert the polarity of the Lorentz force resulting in a pinch of the beams. A theoretical model predicts the pinch condition and is confirmed by first-principles 3-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations. This anomalous pinch enhances density compression, increases the collision luminosity, and amplifies the local magnetic fields and the quantum parameter of the beam particles by several orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Seeded Topology Optimization for Commercial Foundry Integrated Photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00199v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a seeded topology optimization methodology for integrated photonic devices fabricated on foundry platforms that yields improved performance compared to traditional topology optimization. We employ blurring filters and a DRC correction algorithm to more readily meet design rule checks, resulting in devices with fewer artifacts and improved correlation between simulation and measurements. We apply this process to an ultra-compact TE modal multiplexer, a TE mode converter, a polarization rotator, and a high-contrast grating reflector. The measured insertion loss of the TE mode converter was reduced from 1.37 dB to 0.64 dB through this optimization strategy. This approach enables a two-step inverse design process, merging of physics-informed design strategies with inverse design, and ensures strict compliance with foundry constraints throughout optimization.</description>

      <title>Wyckoff Transformer: Generation of Symmetric Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02407v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Crystal symmetry plays a fundamental role in determining its physical, chemical, and electronic properties such as electrical and thermal conductivity, optical and polarization behavior, and mechanical strength. Almost all known crystalline materials have internal symmetry. However, this is often inadequately addressed by existing generative models, making the consistent generation of stable and symmetrically valid crystal structures a significant challenge. We introduce WyFormer, a generative model that directly tackles this by formally conditioning on space group symmetry. It achieves this by using Wyckoff positions as the basis for an elegant, compressed, and discrete structure representation. To model the distribution, we develop a permutation-invariant autoregressive model based on the Transformer encoder and an absence of positional encoding. Extensive experimentation demonstrates WyFormer's compelling combination of attributes: it achieves best-in-class symmetry-conditioned generation, incorporates a physics-motivated inductive bias, produces structures with competitive stability, predicts material properties with competitive accuracy even without atomic coordinates, and exhibits unparalleled inference speed.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Variational Quantum Kolmogorov-Arnold Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22604v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) is a novel multi-layer network model recognized for its efficiency in neuromorphic computing, where synapses between neurons are trained linearly. Computations in KAN are performed by generating a polynomial vector from the state vector and layer-wise trained synapses, enabling efficient processing. While KAN can be implemented on quantum computers using block encoding and Quantum Signal Processing, these methods require fault-tolerant quantum devices, making them impractical for current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) hardware. We propose the Enhanced Variational Quantum Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (EVQKAN) to overcome this limitation, which emulates KAN through variational quantum algorithms. The EVQKAN ansatz employs a tiling technique to emulate layer matrices, leading to significantly higher accuracy compared to conventional Variational Quantum Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (VQKAN) and Quantum Neural Networks (QNN), even with a smaller number of layers. EVQKAN achieves superior performance with a single-layer architecture, whereas QNN and VQKAN typically struggle. Additionally, EVQKAN eliminates the need for Quantum Signal Processing, enhancing its robustness to noise and making it well-suited for practical deployment on NISQ-era quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Wave propagation and scattering in time dependent media: Lippmann-Schwinger equations, multiple scattering theory, Kirchhoff Helmholtz integrals, Green's functions, reciprocity theorems and Huygens' principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05704v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wave scattering plays a central role for the modeling of complex wave propagation across all corners of science and engineering applications, including electromagnetic, acoustics, seismic and scattering physics. Wave control using time interfaces, where the properties of the medium through with the wave travels rapidly change in time, has opened further opportunities to control wave propagation in both space and time. For acoustic waves, studies on time modulated media have not been reported. In this context, full numerical solution of the wave equation using time interfaces is key to fully understand their potential. When applying time interfaces, the underlying physics of acoustic wave propagation and scattering and their similar roles on time and space, are still being explored. In this work, we introduce a mathematical formulation of the Lippmann-Schwinger integral equations for acoustic wave scattering when time interfaces are induced via a change of the velocity of the medium. We demonstrate that space-time duality for acoustic wave propagation with time interfaces and derive the Lippmann-Schwinger integral equations for wave scattering in time-dependent media, multiple scattering theory, Kirchhoff Helmholtz integrals, Green's functions, reciprocity theorems. We experimentally verify our theoretical derivation by studying and measuring the acoustic wave scattering in strongly scattering media. We illustrate the proposed framework and present results of acoustic wave scattering without prior knowledge of the background wave-fields. This improves the understanding of the generation and wave scattering and opens previously inaccessible research directions, potentially facilitating practical applications for acoustic, geophysical and optical imaging.</description>

      <title>Improved Uncertainty Quantification in Physics-Informed Neural Networks Using Error Bounds and Solution Bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06459v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have been widely used to obtain solutions to various physical phenomena modeled as Differential Equations. As PINNs are not naturally equipped with mechanisms for Uncertainty Quantification, some work has been done to quantify the different uncertainties that arise when dealing with PINNs. In this paper, we use a two-step procedure to train Bayesian Neural Networks that provide uncertainties over the solutions to differential equation systems provided by PINNs. We use available error bounds over PINNs to formulate a heteroscedastic variance that improves the uncertainty estimation. Furthermore, we solve forward problems and utilize the obtained uncertainties when doing parameter estimation in inverse problems in cosmology.</description>
