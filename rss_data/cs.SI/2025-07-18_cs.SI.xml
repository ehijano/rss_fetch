      <title>Identification of Authoritative Nodes and Dismantling of Illicit Networks Using a Novel Metric for Measuring Strength of a Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dismantling criminal networks or containing epidemics or misinformation through node removal is a well-studied problem. To evaluate the effectiveness of such efforts, one must measure the strength of the network before and after node removal. Process P1 is considered more effective than P2 if the strength of the residual network after removing k nodes via P1 is smaller than that from P2. This leads to the central question: How should network strength be measured?
  Existing metrics rely solely on structural properties of the graph, such as connectivity. However, in real-world scenarios, particularly in law enforcement, the perception of agents regarding network strength can differ significantly from structural assessments. These perceptions are often ignored in traditional metrics.
  We propose a new strength metric that integrates both structural properties and human perception. Using human subject surveys, we validate our approach against existing metrics. Our metric not only aligns more closely with human judgment but also outperforms traditional methods in identifying authoritative nodes and effectively dismantling both synthetic and real-world networks.</description>

      <title>T3MAL: Test-Time Fast Adaptation for Robust Multi-Scale Information Diffusion Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Information diffusion prediction (IDP) is a pivotal task for understanding how information propagates among users. Most existing methods commonly adhere to a conventional training-test paradigm, where models are pretrained on training data and then directly applied to test samples. However, the success of this paradigm hinges on the assumption that the data are independently and identically distributed, which often fails in practical social networks due to the inherent uncertainty and variability of user behavior. In the paper, we address the novel challenge of distribution shifts within IDP tasks and propose a robust test-time training (TTT)-based framework for multi-scale diffusion prediction, named T3MAL. The core idea is to flexibly adapt a trained model to accommodate the distribution of each test instance before making predictions via a self-supervised auxiliary task. Specifically, T3MAL introduces a BYOL-inspired self-supervised auxiliary network that shares a common feature extraction backbone with the primary diffusion prediction network to guide instance-specific adaptation during testing. Furthermore, T3MAL enables fast and accurate test-time adaptation by incorporating a novel meta-auxiliary learning scheme and a lightweight adaptor, which together provide better weight initialization for TTT and mitigate catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that T3MAL outperforms various state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>The Centrality Paradox: Why Your Friends Are Always More Important</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the classical friendship paradox which states that on an average one's friends have at least as many friends as oneself and generalize it to a variety of network centrality measures. In particular, we show that for any irreducible, undirected graph $G$, the "friends-average" of degree, eigenvector-centrality, walk-count, Katz, and PageRank centralities exceeds the global average. We show that the result follows from the variational characterisation of the eigenvector corresponding to the Perron eigenvalue.</description>

      <title>Interacting Hosts with Microbiome Exchange: An Extension of Metacommunity Theory for Discrete Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microbiomes, which are collections of interacting microbes in an environment, often substantially impact the environmental patches or living hosts that they occupy. In microbiome models, it is important to consider both the local dynamics within an environment and exchanges of microbiomes between environments. One way to incorporate these and other interactions across multiple scales is to employ metacommunity theory. Metacommunity models commonly assume continuous microbiome dispersal between the environments in which local microbiome dynamics occur. Under this assumption, a single parameter between each pair of environments controls the dispersal rate between those environments. This metacommunity framework is well-suited to abiotic environmental patches, but it fails to capture an essential aspect of the microbiomes of living hosts, which generally do not interact continuously with each other. Instead, living hosts interact with each other in discrete time intervals. In this paper, we develop a modeling framework that encodes such discrete interactions and uses two parameters to separately control the interaction frequencies between hosts and the amount of microbiome exchange during each interaction. We derive analytical approximations of models in our framework in three parameter regimes and prove that they are accurate in those regimes. We compare these approximations to numerical simulations for an illustrative model. We demonstrate that both parameters in our modeling framework are necessary to determine microbiome dynamics. Key features of the dynamics, such as microbiome convergence across hosts, depend sensitively on the interplay between interaction frequency and strength.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Gap: Leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation to Better Understand Public Concerns about Vaccines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vaccine hesitancy threatens public health, leading to delayed or rejected vaccines. Social media is a vital source for understanding public concerns, and traditional methods like topic modelling often struggle to capture nuanced opinions. Though trained for query answering, large Language Models (LLMs) often miss current events and community concerns. Additionally, hallucinations in LLMs can compromise public health communication. To address these limitations, we developed a tool (VaxPulse Query Corner) using the Retrieval Augmented Generation technique. It addresses complex queries about public vaccine concerns on various online platforms, aiding public health administrators and stakeholders in understanding public concerns and implementing targeted interventions to boost vaccine confidence. Analysing 35,103 Shingrix social media posts, it achieved answer faithfulness (0.96) and relevance (0.94).</description>

      <title>Life Finds A Way: Emergence of Cooperative Structures in Adaptive Threshold Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There has been a long debate on how new levels of organization have evolved. It might seem unlikely, as cooperation must prevail over competition. One well-studied example is the emergence of autocatalytic sets, which seem to be a prerequisite for the evolution of life. Using a simple model, we investigate how varying bias toward cooperation versus antagonism shapes network dynamics, revealing that higher-order organization emerges even amid pervasive antagonistic interactions. In general, we observe that a quantitative increase in the number of elements in a system leads to a qualitative transition.
  We present a random threshold-directed network model that integrates node-specific traits with dynamic edge formation and node removal, simulating arbitrary levels of cooperation and competition. In our framework, intrinsic node values determine directed links through various threshold rules. Our model generates a multi-digraph with signed edges (reflecting support/antagonism, labeled ``help''/``harm''), which ultimately yields two parallel yet interdependent threshold graphs. Incorporating temporal growth and node turnover in our approach allows exploration of the evolution, adaptation, and potential collapse of communities and reveals phase transitions in both connectivity and resilience.
  Our findings extend classical random threshold and Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi models, offering new insights into adaptive systems in biological and economic contexts, with emphasis on the application to Collective Affordance Sets. This framework should also be useful for making predictions that will be tested by ongoing experiments of microbial communities in soil.</description>

      <title>Modelling the spillover from online engagement to offline protest: stochastic dynamics and mean-field approximations on networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social media is transforming various aspects of offline life, from everyday decisions such as dining choices to the progression of conflicts. In this study, we propose a coupled modelling framework with an online social network layer to analyse how engagement on a specific topic spills over into offline protest activities. We develop a stochastic model and derive several mean-field models of varying complexity. These models allow us to estimate the reproductive number and anticipate when surges in activity are likely to occur. A key factor is the transmission rate between the online and offline domains; for offline outbursts to emerge, this rate must fall within a critical range, neither too low nor too high. Additionally, using synthetic networks, we examine how network structure influences the accuracy of these approximations. Our findings indicate that low-density networks need more complex approximations, whereas simpler models can effectively represent higher-density networks. When tested on two real-world networks, however, increased complexity did not enhance accuracy.</description>

      <title>DomainDemo: a dataset of domain-sharing activities among different demographic groups on Twitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09035v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Social media play a pivotal role in disseminating web content, particularly during elections, yet our understanding of the association between demographic factors and information sharing online remains limited. Here, we introduce a unique dataset, DomainDemo, linking domains shared on Twitter (X) with the demographic characteristics of associated users, including age, gender, race, political affiliation, and geolocation, from 2011 to 2022. This new resource was derived from a panel of over 1.5 million Twitter users matched against their U.S. voter registration records, facilitating a better understanding of a decade of information flows on one of the most prominent social media platforms and trends in political and public discourse among registered U.S. voters from different sociodemographic groups. By aggregating user demographic information onto the domains, we derive five metrics that provide critical insights into over 129,000 websites. In particular, the localness and partisan audience metrics quantify the domains' geographical reach and ideological orientation, respectively. These metrics show substantial agreement with existing classifications, suggesting the effectiveness and reliability of DomainDemo's approach.</description>

      <title>Hypergraph Link Prediction via Hyperedge Copying</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02386v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a generative model of temporally-evolving hypergraphs in which hyperedges form via noisy copying of previous hyperedges. Our proposed model reproduces several stylized facts from many empirical hypergraphs, is learnable from data, and defines a likelihood over a complete hypergraph rather than ego-based or other sub-hypergraphs. Analyzing our model, we derive descriptions of node degree, edge size, and edge intersection size distributions in terms of the model parameters. We also show several features of empirical hypergraphs which are and are not successfully captured by our model. We provide a scalable stochastic expectation maximization algorithm with which we can fit our model to hypergraph data sets with millions of nodes and edges. Finally, we assess our model on a hypergraph link prediction task, finding that an instantiation of our model with just 11 parameters can achieve competitive predictive performance with large neural networks.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Stage Framework with Taxonomy-Guided Reasoning for Occupation Classification Using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12989v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automatically annotating job data with standardized occupations from taxonomies, known as occupation classification, is crucial for labor market analysis. However, this task is often hindered by data scarcity and the challenges of manual annotations. While large language models (LLMs) hold promise due to their extensive world knowledge and in-context learning capabilities, their effectiveness depends on their knowledge of occupational taxonomies, which remains unclear. In this study, we assess the ability of LLMs to generate precise taxonomic entities from taxonomy, highlighting their limitations, especially for smaller models. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-stage framework consisting of inference, retrieval, and reranking stages, which integrates taxonomy-guided reasoning examples to enhance performance by aligning outputs with taxonomic knowledge. Evaluations on a large-scale dataset show that our framework not only enhances occupation and skill classification tasks, but also provides a cost-effective alternative to frontier models like GPT-4o, significantly reducing computational costs while maintaining strong performance. This makes it a practical and scalable solution for occupation classification and related tasks across LLMs.</description>

      <title>From Signed Networks to Group Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22802v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I define a "group graph" which encodes the symmetry in a dynamical process on a network. Group graphs extend signed networks, where links are labelled with plus or minus one, by allowing link labels from any group and generalising the standard notion of balance. I show that for processes on a balanced group graph the time evolution is completely determined by the network topology, not by the group structure. This unifies and extends recent findings on signed networks (Tian \&amp; Lambiotte, 2024a) and complex networks (Tian \&amp; Lambiotte, 2024b). I will also relate the results discussed here to related work such as the "group graph" of Harary (1982), a "voltage graph" (Gross, 1974) and a "gain graph" (Zaslavsky 1989). Finally, I will review some promising applications for network dynamics and symmetry-driven modelling including status, edges with a zero label, weak balance, unbalanced group graphs and using monoids.</description>

      <title>Freshness, Persistence and Success of Scientific Teams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12255v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Team science dominates scientific knowledge production, but what makes academic teams successful? Using temporal data on 25.2 million publications and 31.8 million authors, we propose a novel network-driven approach to identify and study the success of persistent teams. Challenging the idea that persistence alone drives success, we find that team freshness - new collaborations built on prior experience - is key to success. High impact research tends to emerge early in a team's lifespan. Analyzing complex team overlap, we find that teams open to new collaborative ties consistently produce better science. Specifically, team re-combinations that introduce new freshness impulses sustain success, while persistence impulses from experienced teams are linked to earlier impact. Together, freshness and persistence shape team success across collaboration stages.</description>
