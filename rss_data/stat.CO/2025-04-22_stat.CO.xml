      <title>Flowco: Rethinking Data Analysis in the Age of LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conducting data analysis typically involves authoring code to transform, visualize, analyze, and interpret data. Large language models (LLMs) are now capable of generating such code for simple, routine analyses. LLMs promise to democratize data science by enabling those with limited programming expertise to conduct data analyses, including in scientific research, business, and policymaking. However, analysts in many real-world settings must often exercise fine-grained control over specific analysis steps, verify intermediate results explicitly, and iteratively refine their analytical approaches. Such tasks present barriers to building robust and reproducible analyses using LLMs alone or even in conjunction with existing authoring tools (e.g., computational notebooks). This paper introduces Flowco, a new mixed-initiative system to address these challenges. Flowco leverages a visual dataflow programming model and integrates LLMs into every phase of the authoring process. A user study suggests that Flowco supports analysts, particularly those with less programming experience, in quickly authoring, debugging, and refining data analyses.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Cauchy Combination Test for Count Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Cauchy combination test (CCT) is a $p$-value combination method used in multiple-hypothesis testing and is robust under dependence structures. This study aims to evaluate the CCT for independent and correlated count data where the individual $p$-values are derived from tests based on Normal approximation to the negative binomial distribution. The correlated count data are modelled via copula methods. The CCT performance is evaluated in a simulation study to assess the type 1 error rate and the statistical power and compare it with existing methods. In addition, we consider the influence of factors such as the success parameter of the negative binomial distribution, the number of individual $p$-values, and the correlation strength. Our results indicate that the negative binomial success parameter and the number of combined individual $p$-values may influence the type 1 error rate for the CCT under independence or weak dependence. The choice of copula method for modelling the correlation between count data has a significant influence on type 1 error rates for both the CCT and MinP tests. The CCT has more control over managing the type 1 error rate as the strength increases in the Gumbel-Hougaard copula. This knowledge may have significant implications for practical applications.</description>
