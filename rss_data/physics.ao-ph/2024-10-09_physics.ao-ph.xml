      <title>El Nino Southern Oscillation and Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation Impact on Hurricanes North Atlantic Basin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tropical cyclones (TCs), including hurricanes and typhoons, cause significant property damage and result in fatalities, making it crucial to understand the factors driving extreme TCs. The El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) influences TC formation through tropospheric vorticity, wind shear, and atmospheric circulations. Apart from atmospheric changes, oceans influence activity through sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and deep ocean heat content. These Atlantic SSTs determine the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), which indicates SST variability in the Atlantic. This research focuses on ENSO, AMO, and SSTs impact on the strength and frequency of TCs in the North Atlantic Basin. AMO and SST anomalies are increasing at an alarming rate, but it remains unclear how their dynamics will influence future TC behavior. I used observational cyclone track data from 1950 to 2023, the Oceanic Nino Index (ONI), and NOAAs Extended Reconstructed SST V5 (ERSST). I found that Increasing SSTs over the past decade indicate stronger TCs, while warm phase AMO periods correspond with higher TC frequency. Meanwhile, a greater frequency of landfalling TCs can be attributed to La Nina or ENSO-neutral, with El Nino decreasing the frequency of landfalling TCs. Such relationships suggest that as the seasonal predictability of ENSO and SSTs improve, seasonal TC forecasts may improve.</description>

      <title>Bound on forecasting skill for models of North Atlantic tropical cyclone counts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Annual North Atlantic tropical cyclone (TC) counts are frequently modeled as a Poisson process with a state-dependent rate. We provide a lower bound on the forecasting error of this class of models. Remarkably we find that this bound is already saturated by a simple linear model that explains roughly 50 percent of the annual variance using three climate indices: El Ni\~no Southern Oscillation (ENSO), average sea surface temperature (SST) in the main development region (MDR) of the North Atlantic and the North Atlantic oscillation (NAO) atmospheric circulation index (Kozar et al 2012). As expected under the bound, increased model complexity does not help: we demonstrate that allowing for quadratic and interaction terms, or using an Elastic Net to forecast TC counts using global SST maps, produces no detectable increase in skill. We provide evidence that observed TC counts are consistent with a Poisson process, limiting possible improvements in TC modeling by relaxing the Poisson assumption.</description>

      <title>Unbiased evaluation and calibration of ensemble forecast anomalies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-range ensemble forecasts are typically verified as anomalies with respect to a lead-time dependent climatology to remove the influence of systematic biases. However, common methods for calculating anomalies result in statistical inconsistencies between forecast and verification anomalies, even for a perfectly reliable ensemble. It is important to account for these systematic effects when evaluating ensemble forecast systems, particularly when tuning a model to improve the reliability of forecast anomalies or when comparing spread-error diagnostics between systems with different reforecast periods. Here, we show that unbiased variances and spread-error ratios can be recovered by deriving estimators that are consistent with the values that would be achieved when calculating anomalies relative to the true, but unknown, climatological mean. An elegant alternative is to construct forecast anomalies separately for each member, which ensures that forecast and verification anomalies are defined relative to reference climatologies with the same sampling uncertainty. This alternative approach has no impact on forecast ensemble means or deterministic scores but systematically modifies the total variance and ensemble spread of forecast anomalies in such a way that anomaly-based spread-error ratios are unbiased without any explicit correction for climatology sample size. Furthermore, the improved statistical consistency of forecast and verification anomalies means that probabilistic forecast skill is optimized when the underlying forecast is also perfectly reliable. Alternative methods for anomaly calculation can thus impact probabilistic forecast skill, especially when anomalies are defined relative to climatologies with a small sample size. Finally, we demonstrate the equivalence of anomalies calculated using different methods after applying an unbiased statistical calibration.</description>

      <title>Continuous Ensemble Weather Forecasting with Diffusion models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weather forecasting has seen a shift in methods from numerical simulations to data-driven systems. While initial research in the area focused on deterministic forecasting, recent works have used diffusion models to produce skillful ensemble forecasts. These models are trained on a single forecasting step and rolled out autoregressively. However, they are computationally expensive and accumulate errors for high temporal resolution due to the many rollout steps. We address these limitations with Continuous Ensemble Forecasting, a novel and flexible method for sampling ensemble forecasts in diffusion models. The method can generate temporally consistent ensemble trajectories completely in parallel, with no autoregressive steps. Continuous Ensemble Forecasting can also be combined with autoregressive rollouts to yield forecasts at an arbitrary fine temporal resolution without sacrificing accuracy. We demonstrate that the method achieves competitive results for global weather forecasting with good probabilistic properties.</description>

      <title>Using Deep Learning to Identify Initial Error Sensitivity for Interpretable ENSO Forecasts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15419v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce an interpretable-by-design method, optimized model-analog, that integrates deep learning with model-analog forecasting which generates forecasts from similar initial climate states in a repository of model simulations. This hybrid framework employs a convolutional neural network to estimate state-dependent weights to identify initial analog states that lead to shadowing target trajectories. The advantage of our method lies in its inherent interpretability, offering insights into initial-error-sensitive regions through estimated weights and the ability to trace the physically-based evolution of the system through analog forecasting. We evaluate our approach using the Community Earth System Model Version 2 Large Ensemble to forecast the El Ni\~no-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on a seasonal-to-annual time scale. Results show a 10% improvement in forecasting equatorial Pacific sea surface temperature anomalies at 9-12 months leads compared to the unweighted model-analog technique. Furthermore, our model demonstrates improvements in boreal winter and spring initialization when evaluated against a reanalysis dataset. Our approach reveals state-dependent regional sensitivity linked to various seasonally varying physical processes, including the Pacific Meridional Modes, equatorial recharge oscillator, and stochastic wind forcing. Additionally, forecasts of El Ni\~no and La Ni\~na are sensitive to different initial states: El Ni\~no forecasts are more sensitive to initial error in tropical Pacific sea surface temperature in boreal winter, while La Ni\~na forecasts are more sensitive to initial error in tropical Pacific zonal wind stress in boreal summer. This approach has broad implications for forecasting diverse climate phenomena, including regional temperature and precipitation, which are challenging for the model-analog approach alone.</description>

      <title>The absolute seawater entropy: Part~I. Definition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04821v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The absolute entropy of seawater is defined as an improved version of the relationship defined by Franck Millero in 1976 and 1983. The first improvements concern the complex non-linear dependence of entropy on pressure, temperature and salinity, with the use of the standard TEOS10 formulation based on a fit of the oceanic Gibbs function to more recent observations. On the other hand, more recent thermodynamic tables have been used to increase the accuracy of the Millero's salinity increment to this standard formulation, to deduce the absolute version of entropy with new values for the pure-water and sea-salts absolute reference entropies. The differences between the values of the seawater entropy calculated with the Millero and TEOS10 formulations (standard and absolute) are documented, before a more complete study shown in the second part of the paper of the absolute seawater entropy computed from observed vertical profiles and analysed surface datasets.</description>

      <title>The absolute seawater entropy: Part~II. Case studies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04822v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of this second part of the article is to study with several concrete cases the absolute definition of the seawater entropy described in Part I. Observed vertical profiles and polar transects, as well as analysed surface data, show that very different temperature and salinity values can organise to create new isentropic regions that can only be revealed by the absolute formulation of the entropy of seawater (Arctic Ocean; Bay of Bengal; Mediterranean, Black and Caspian Seas). Existing hypotheses to explain these results include the possible impact of turbulent processes that must be applied to the entropies of the atmosphere and oceans.</description>

      <title>Bounds to the Basset-Boussinesq force on particle laden stratified flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19054v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Basset-Boussinesq force is often perfunctorily neglected when studying small inertial particles in turbulence. This force arises from the diffusion of vorticity from the particles and, since it depends on the particles' past history, complicates the dynamics by transforming their equations of motion into integro-differential equations. However, this force is of the same order as other viscous forces acting on the particles, and beyond convenience, the reasons for neglecting it are unclear. This study addresses the following question: Under what conditions can the Basset-Boussinesq force be neglected in light particles in geophysical flows? We derive strict bounds for the magnitude of the Basset-Boussinesq force in stably stratified flows, in contexts of interest for geophysical turbulence. The bounds are validated by direct numerical simulations. The Basset-Boussinesq force is negligible when a buoyancy Stokes number $\textrm{Sb} = N \tau_p$ is small, where $N$ is the flow Brunt-V\"ais\"al\"a frequency and $\tau_p$ is the particle's Stokes time. Interestingly, for most oceanic particles this force may be negligible. Only for very strong stratification, or for particles with very large inertia, this force must be considered in the dynamics.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Tornadic Supercell Thunderstorms on the Atmospheric Muon Flux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19311v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tornadoes are severe weather phenomena characterized by a violently rotating column of air connecting the ground to a parent storm. Within the United States, hundreds of tornadoes occur every year. Despite this, the dynamics of tornado formation and propagation are not particularly well understood, in part due to the challenge of instrumentation: many existing instruments for measuring atmospheric properties are in-situ detectors, making deployment in or near an active or developing tornado difficult. Here, we combine local atmospheric and cosmic ray air shower simulation to explore the potential for remote measurement of the pressure field within tornado-producing supercell thunderstorms by examining directional variations of the atmospheric muon flux.</description>

      <title>A simple emulator that enables interpretation of parameter-output relationships, applied to two climate model PPEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00931v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new additive method, nicknamed sage for Simplified Additive Gaussian processes Emulator, to emulate climate model Perturbed Parameter Ensembles (PPEs). It estimates the value of a climate model output as the sum of additive terms. Each additive term is the mean of a Gaussian Process, and corresponds to the impact of a parameter or parameter group on the variable of interest. This design caters to the sparsity of PPEs which are characterized by limited ensemble members and high dimensionality of the parameter space. sage quantifies the variability explained by different parameters and parameter groups, providing additional insights on the parameter-climate model output relationship. We apply the method to two climate model PPEs and compare it to a fully connected Neural Network. The two methods have comparable performance with both PPEs, but sage provides insights on parameter and parameter group importance as well as diagnostics useful for optimizing PPE design. Insights gained are valid regardless of the emulator method used, and have not been previously addressed. Our work highlights that analyzing the PPE used to train an emulator is different from analyzing data generated from an emulator trained on the PPE, as the former provides more insights on the data structure in the PPE which could help inform the emulator design.</description>
