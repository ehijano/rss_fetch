      <title>Numerical Solution of the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer Equation for Unconventional Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we consider the analytical properties and the efficient numerical solution of the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer equation for unconventional superconductivity incorporating long-range power-law electron-electron interactions within a tight-binding model on a $d$-dimensional lattice. It is a nonlinear convolution equation for the complex matrix-valued superconducting gap under symmetry constraints imposed by the fermionic anticommutation rules. The long-range interaction enters in momentum space in the form of the now efficiently computable Epstein zeta function, which exhibits a power-law singularity at zero momentum. This needs to be accounted when evaluating the convolution. After a brief overview of some of the equation's analytical properties, we discuss its efficient numerical solution using a Galerkin method with B-splines. We present numerical results for a nodal superconductor on a two-dimensional square lattice.</description>

      <title>New formula for Asymptotic behavior of the Synchrotron function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synchrotron radiation plays a central role in astrophysical and high-energy processes. Its spectral description involves the synchrotron function, defined by a non-trivial integral of modified Bessel functions and commonly evaluated through numerical methods or dedicated approximations. In this work, we obtain a compact analytical representation of the synchrotron function using the Method of Brackets, which yields systematically controllable asymptotic expansions in both the small- and large-argument regimes. The resulting expressions accurately reproduce numerical integration and make the analytic structure of the function explicit. Our results provide an efficient alternative to repeated numerical evaluations and facilitate applications requiring fast and controlled approximations.</description>

      <title>The Quantum Symmetric Simple Exclusion Process in the Continuum and Free Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum symmetric simple exclusion process (QSSEP) is a recent extension of the symmetric simple exclusion process, designed to model quantum coherent fluctuating effects in noisy diffusive systems. It models stochastic nearest-neighbor fermionic hopping on a lattice, possibly driven out-of-equilibrium by boundary processes. We present a direct formulation in the continuum, and establish how this formulation captures the scaling limit of the discrete version. In the continuum, QSSEP emerges as a non-commutative process, driven by free increments, conditioned on the algebra of functions on the ambiant space to encode spatial correlations. We actually develop a more general framework dealing with conditioned orbits with free increments which may find applications beyond the present context. We view this construction as a preliminary step toward formulating a quantum extension of the macroscopic fluctuation theory.</description>

      <title>Ground state energy of the dilute Bose-Hubbard gas on Bravais lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study interacting bosons on a three-dimensional Bravais lattice with positive hopping amplitudes and on-site repulsive interactions. We prove that, in the dilute limit $\rho\to 0$, the ground state energy density satisfies $$e_0(\rho) = 4\pi a \rho^2 \big(1+O(\rho^{1/6})\big),$$ where $a$ is the lattice scattering length defined through the corresponding two-body problem. This establishes the analogue of the Dyson and Lieb-Yngvason theorems for the Bose-Hubbard gas. Our result shows that the leading-order energy is universal: although the lattice geometry affects the microscopic dispersion relation, it enters the leading order asymptotics only through the scattering length. In particular, it is independent of other features of the underlying Bravais lattice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.16658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the mean-field dynamics of a system of $N$ interacting bosons starting from an initially condensated state. For a broad class of mean-field Hamiltonians, including models with arbitrary bounded interactions and models with unbounded interaction potentials, we prove that the probability of having $n$ particles outside the condensate decays exponentially in $n$ for any finite evolution time. Our results strengthen previously known bounds that provide only polynomial control on the probability of having $n$ excitations.</description>

      <title>Two-mode dominance and deterministic parameter bias bounds for equatorial Kerr-de Sitter ringdown</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study scalar waves on subextremal Kerr-de Sitter spacetimes in a compact slow-rotation regime and at a fixed overtone index. Working initially at a fixed cosmological constant $\Lambda&gt;0$ and uniformly for $(M,a)$ in a compact slow-rotation set, using the meromorphic/Fredholm framework for quasinormal modes and a semiclassical equatorial labeling proved in a companion paper, we establish a quantitative two-mode dominance theorem in an equatorial high-frequency package: after exact azimuthal reduction, microlocal equatorial localization, and analytic pole selection by entire localization weights constructed from equatorial pseudopoles, the $k=\pm\ell$ sector signals are each governed by a single quasinormal exponential, up to an explicitly controlled tail and an $\mathcal O(\ell^{-\infty})$ contribution from all other poles. We then develop a fully deterministic frequency-extraction stability estimate based on time-shift invariance, and combine it with the two-mode dominance result and the companion paper's inverse stability theorem to obtain an explicit parameter bias bound for ringdown-based recovery of $(M,a)$. Finally, using the companion paper's three-parameter inverse theorem and a damping observable based on the scaled imaginary part of one equatorial mode, we propagate the same deterministic error chain to a local bias bound for recovery of $(M,a,\Lambda)$ on compact parameter sets with $|a|$ bounded away from $0$. As a further consequence, we obtain a localized pseudospectral stability statement for the equatorial resolvent package, quantifying how large microlocalized resolvent norms enforce proximity to the labeled equatorial poles. The resulting estimates clarify the conditioning mechanisms (start time, window length, shift step, and detector nondegeneracy) and provide a rigorous PDE-to-data interface for high-frequency black-hole spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Einstein connection of nonsymmetric pseudo-Riemannian manifold</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.15956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A.~Einstein considered a nonsymmetric (0,2)-tensor $G=g+F$, where $g$ is a pseudo-Riemannian metric and $F\ne0$ is skew-symmetric, and a linear connection $\nabla$ with torsion $T$ such that $(\nabla_X\,G)(Y,Z)=-G(T(X,Y),Z)$. M. Prvanovi\'c (1995) obtained the explicit form of the Einstein connection of an almost Hermitian manifold.
  In this paper, first, we present the result above in coordinate-free form, and then extend it to almost contact metric mani\-folds satisfying the so-called $f^2$-torsion condition. We then derive the Einstein connection of nonsymmetric pseudo-Riemannian, in particular, weak almost Hermitian manifolds $(M,f,g)$, satisfying the $f^2$-torsion condition, where $F(X,Y)=g(X,fY)$, give explicit formulas for the torsion in terms of $\nabla^g F$, $dF$ and a new (1,1)-tensor $\widetilde Q:=-f^2-{\rm Id}$, and show that in the almost Hermitian case, our main result reduces to the coordinate-free form of Prvanovi\'c's solution. Finally, we describe special Einstein connections, i.e., the difference tensor has the property~$K_XY=-K_YX$, and indicate the Gray-Hervella classes. Illustrative examples are given, including the construction of a weighted product.</description>

      <title>Homotopy Lie algebras and coherent infinitesimal 2-braidings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.16017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a homotopy Lie algebra (i.e. an $L_\infty$-algebra) $\mathfrak{g}$, we show concretely how the Lada-Markl $\mathfrak{g}$-modules (i.e. representations) assemble into a symmetric monoidal dg-category. Considering the homotopy 2-category of that dg-category, we construct infinitesimal 2-braidings from 2-shifted Poisson structures then show that such infinitesimal 2-braidings are coherent in Cirio and Faria Martins' sense. We then explicitly determine the differential of the Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra associated with a finite-dimensional homotopy Lie algebra and construct the symmetric monoidal dg-equivalence between the category of representations and the category of semi-free dg-modules over the Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Landis-type result for Dirac operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study quantitative unique continuation at infinity for Dirac equations with bounded matrix-valued potentials. For the massless Dirac operator $\mathcal{D}_n$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$, we establish a Landis-type estimate showing that the vanishing order of any nontrivial bounded solution of $( \mathcal{D}_n + \mathbb{V} ) \varphi = 0$ satisfies a lower bound of order $\exp(-\kappa R^{2} (\log R)^{2})$ as $|x|=R\to \infty$; the quadratic growth in the exponent is sharp, in view of previous known results. Our proof follows a Bourgain--Kenig type approach based on a Carleman inequality for Dirac operators which relies on a local H\"older regularity result, which we also prove. In two dimension, we obtain improved quantitative estimates under symmetry assumptions on the potential $\mathbb{V}$ and for real-valued solutions. Finally, we also derive qualitative Landis-type results for Dirac equations with decaying potentials, including critical decay rates.</description>

      <title>Contractivity of time-dependent driven-dissipative systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a number of physically relevant contexts, a quantum system interacting with a decohering environment is simultaneously subjected to time-dependent controls and its dynamics is thus described by a time-dependent Lindblad master equation. Of particular interest in such systems is to understand the circumstances in which, despite the ability to apply time-dependent controls, they lose information about their initial state exponentially with time i.e., their dynamics are exponentially contractive. While there exists an extensive framework to study contractivity for time-independent Lindbladians, their time-dependent counterparts are far less well understood. In this paper, we study the contractivity of Lindbladians, which have a fixed dissipator (describing the interaction with an environment), but with a time-dependent driving Hamiltonian. We establish exponential contractivity in the limit of sufficiently small or sufficiently slow drives together with explicit examples showing that, even when the fixed dissipator is exponentially contractive by itself, a sufficiently large or a sufficiently fast Hamiltonian can result in non-contractive dynamics. Furthermore, we provide a number of sufficient conditions on the fixed dissipator that imply exponential contractivity independently of the Hamiltonian. These sufficient conditions allow us to completely characterize Hamiltonian-independent contractivity for unital dissipators and for two-level systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.16088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Average of exponential ${\rm Tr}_R e^X$, i.e. of a group rather than an algebra character, in Gaussian matrix model is known to be an amusing generalization of Schur polynomial, where time variables are substituted by traces of products of non-commuting matrices ${\rm Tr} \left(\prod_i A_{k_i}\right)$ and are thus labeled by weak compositions. The entries of matrices $A_k$ are made from extended Laguerre polynomials, what introduces additional difficulties. We describe the generic sum rules, which express arbitrary traces through convolutions of a single Laguerre polynomial $L_{N-1}^1(z_{k_i})$, what is a considerable simplification.</description>

      <title>Piecewise integrability of the discrete Hasimoto map for analytic prediction and design of helical peptides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The representation of protein backbone geometry through the discrete nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation provides a theoretical connection between biological structure and integrable systems. Although the global application of this framework is constrained by chiral degeneracies and non-local interactions we propose that helical peptides can be effectively modeled as piecewise integrable systems in which the discrete Hasimoto map remains applicable within specific geometric boundaries. We delineate these boundaries through an analytic characterization of the mapping between biochemical dihedral angles and Frenet frame parameters for a dataset of 50 helical peptide chains. We demonstrate that the transformation is information-preserving globally but ill-conditioned within the helical basin characterized by a median Jacobian condition number of 31 which suggests that the loss of chiral information arises primarily from local coordinate compression rather than topological singularities. We define a local integrability error $E[n]$ derived from the discrete dispersion relation to show that deviations from integrability are driven predominantly by torsion non-uniformity while curvature remains structurally rigid. This metric identifies integrable islands where the analytic dispersion relation predicts backbone coordinates with sub-angstrom accuracy yielding a median root-mean-square deviation of 0.77\,\AA\ and enables a segmentation strategy that isolates structural defects. We further indicate that the inverse design of peptide backbones is feasible within a quantitatively defined integrability zone where the design constraint reduces essentially to the control of torsion uniformity. These findings advance the Hasimoto formalism from a qualitative descriptor toward a precise quantitative framework for analyzing and designing local protein geometry within the limits of piecewise integrability.</description>

Abstract: The Lie theory of non-commutative integrability is used to reconstruct some integrable systems of ordinary differential equations in three dimensional Eucledian space. The Darboux-Brioschi-Halphen system is an example of the Lie integrable system associated with the simple Lie algebra sl(2,R). Other examples are related with solvable three dimensional real Lie algebras of Bianchi B class.</description>

      <title>Gaussian-like fixed point and variational properties of integral discriminants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider partition functions Z(g) = exp (-g(x))dx where g is a nonnegative polynomial action (a degree-2n form) vanishing only at the origin. Such integrals, known as integral discriminants, appear in statistical mechanics, quantum field theory, and the theory of exponential families. We show that the associated Boltzmann measure d$\mu$ = exp(-g(x))dx satisfies a fixed-point property identity relating in a simple manner its degree-2n moments to the coefficients of g. This generalizes familiar identities for the exponential distribution (degree-1) on the positive orthant and the Gaussian measure (degree-2). We further show that g is characterized by three variational principles, including a maximum-entropy principle under scaled moments constraints, extending the Gaussian extremality principle to arbitrary even-degree homogeneous actions. Exploiting these identities in a truncatedmoment numerical scheme (known as the Moment-SOS hierarchy), strengthens the standard semidefinite relaxations, and results in a much faster convergence, thus allowing more efficient approximations of the partition function Z(g) as well as moments of $\mu$.</description>

      <title>Finite elements for the space approximation of a differential model for salts crystallization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article investigates a space-time differential model related to the degradation of stone artifacts caused by exposure to air and atmospheric agents, which specifically lead to the accumulation of salt crystals in the material. A numerical method based on finite-element space discretization and implicit-explicit time marching is proposed as an extension of a one-dimensional finite-difference framework introduced in the literature. Within the same one-dimensional setting, a sensitivity analysis is performed, based on the techniques developed therein. They are also used as a comparison tool for the finite-element formulation, here introduced for more realistic simulations in higher space dimensions. Considerations about stability will be provided, together with an experimental convergence analysis highlighting the performance of the proposed approach. Numerical results in two and three space dimensions, obtained by an efficient code implementation, will be presented and discussed.</description>

      <title>Linear Landau equation as a limit of a tagged particle in mean field interaction with a free gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a tagged particle in mean field interaction with a free gas of density N at equilibrium. In dimensions $d\geq4$, we prove the convergence of its trajectory, as N goes to infinity, to the one of a diffusion process associated with the linear Landau equation. The proof of the convergence of the martingale problem relies on two key ingredients: long time stability results of the microscopic dynamics, and controls on the probability of particle recollisions.</description>

      <title>Topological variations in General Relativity: a rigorous perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.16457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent developments in the theory of gravitation, we revisit the idea of topological variations, originally introduced by Wheeler and Hawking, from a rigorous perspective. Starting from a localized version of the Einstein-Hilbert variational principle, we encode the key aspects of the variational procedure in the form of a topology on a suitable space of variational configurations with low Sobolev regularity. This structure is the final topology with respect to the admissible variational maps and naturally lends itself to generalizations. We rigorously introduce two distinct types of topological variations, corresponding to the infinitesimal addition of disconnected components and to infinitesimal surgeries, both motivated by related physical concepts. Using tools from the theory of Sobolev spaces and precise asymptotics, we establish dimensional obstructions for the continuity and differentiability of the Einstein-Hilbert action with respect to these variations, and show that in the extended variational framework the action does not admit critical points in dimension $n=4$, while higher dimensions are free of this problem. Finally, we demonstrate the non-trivial effect of higher order curvature terms on the critical dimension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.16489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rise of artificial intelligence and machine learning, a new wave of private information is being flushed into applications. This development raises privacy concerns, as private datasets can be stolen or abused for non-authorized purposes. Secure function computation aims to solve such problems by allowing a service provider to compute functions of datasets in the possession of a a data provider without reading the data itself. A foundational primitive for such tasks is Bit Commitment (BC), which is known to be impossible to realize without added assumptions. Given the pressing nature of the topic, it is thus important to develop BC systems and prove their security under reasonable assumptions. In this work, we provide a novel quantum optical BC protocol that uses the added assumption that the network provider will secure transmission lines against eavesdropping. Under this added assumption, we prove security of our protocol in the honest but curious setting and discuss the hardness of Mayer's attack in the context of our protocol.</description>

      <title>FEKAN: Feature-Enriched Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have recently emerged as a compelling alternative to multilayer perceptrons, offering enhanced interpretability via functional decomposition. However, existing KAN architectures, including spline-, wavelet-, radial-basis variants, etc., suffer from high computational cost and slow convergence, limiting scalability and practical applicability. Here, we introduce Feature-Enriched Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (FEKAN), a simple yet effective extension that preserves all the advantages of KAN while improving computational efficiency and predictive accuracy through feature enrichment, without increasing the number of trainable parameters. By incorporating these additional features, FEKAN accelerates convergence, increases representation capacity, and substantially mitigates the computational overhead characteristic of state-of-the-art KAN architectures. We investigate FEKAN across a comprehensive set of benchmarks, including function-approximation tasks, physics-informed formulations for diverse partial differential equations (PDEs), and neural operator settings that map between input and output function spaces. For function approximation, we systematically compare FEKAN against a broad family of KAN variants, FastKAN, WavKAN, ReLUKAN, HRKAN, ChebyshevKAN, RBFKAN, and the original SplineKAN. Across all tasks, FEKAN demonstrates substantially faster convergence and consistently higher approximation accuracy than the underlying baseline architectures. We also establish the theoretical foundations for FEKAN, showing its superior representation capacity compared to KAN, which contributes to improved accuracy and efficiency.</description>

      <title>A Lorentzian Equivariant Index Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a formula for the equivariant index of a twisted Dirac operator on a compact globally hyperbolic spacetime with timelike boundary on which a group acts isometrically, subject to APS boundary conditions. The formula is the same as in the Riemannian case: the equivariant index for a group element is an integral over the fixed point set of that element plus some boundary terms. The proof uses a surprisingly simple technique for reducing from the equivariant to the non-equivariant regime in order to show an equivariant version of the Lorentzian "index $=$ spectral flow" formula.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness and stability of the self-similar profile for a thin-film equation with gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the thin-film equation with linear mobility and a stabilizing second-order porous-medium type term modeling gravity. The model admits self-similar solutions, and our goal is to analyze their stability. We reformulate the problem in mass-Lagrangian coordinates and exploit the underlying gradient-flow structure of the equation with respect to a weighted $L^2$ inner product, where the weight is given by the self-similar source-type profile. This framework allows us to establish a coercivity result for the Hessian (the linearization around the self-similar solution) in a suitably weighted inner product. As a consequence, we prove the convergence of perturbations toward the self-similar profile at an algebraic rate of order $t^{-\frac 1 5}$, in arbitrary scales of weighted Sobolev norms. The analysis relies on maximal-regularity estimates for the linearized evolution, combined with appropriate estimates for the nonlinear terms.
  Notably, beyond perturbative regimes and in contrast to previous results for the thin-film equation (convergence to the Smyth-Hill profile) or the porous-medium equation (convergence to the Barenblatt-Pattle solution), our analysis does not rely on an explicit (algebraic) representation of the self-similar profile. Instead, it is based solely on a systematic use of the ordinary differential equation satisfied by the self-similar solution, together with a careful analysis of its boundary asymptotics. As a result, we expect that the approach developed here can serve as a flexible toolbox for the study of more general classes of equations and for the stability analysis of special solutions in future work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.16572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over an arbitrary commutative ring $R$, we develop a theory of quantum cellular automata. We then use algebraic K-theory to construct a space $\mathbf{Q}(X)$ of quantum cellular automata (QCA) on a given metric space $X$. In most cases of interest, $\pi_0 \mathbf{Q}(X)$ classifies QCA up to quantum circuits and stabilization. Notably, the QCA spaces are related by homotopy equivalences $\mathbf{Q}(*) \simeq \Omega^n \mathbf{Q}(\mathbb{Z}^n)$ for all $n$, which shows that the classification of QCA on Euclidean lattices is given by an $\Omega$-spectrum indexed by the dimension $n$. As a corollary, we also obtain a non-connective delooping of the K-theory of Azumaya $R$-algebras, which may be of independent interests. We also include a section leading to the $\Omega$-spectrum for QCA over $C^*$-algebras with unitary circuits.</description>

      <title>M2-branes, Higher Form Symmetries and 1-Gerbes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Higher-Form Symmetries (HFS) of a closed bosonic M2-brane formulated on a compactified target space $\mathcal{M}_9 \times T^2$ are investigated. We show that there is an obstruction to the gauging of these global symmetries in the presence of background fields, a mixed 't~Hooft anomaly. Its cancellation is obtained by the inflow term constructed in terms of gauge fields which are flat connections on a $U(1)$-principal bundle and a torsion $\mathcal{G}_1^{\nabla_c}$-gerbe on the M2-brane worldvolume. The effect of these gauge structures together with non trivial \textit{winding} embedding maps ensures the breaking of the continuous HFS $U(1)$ symmetry to a discrete subgroup and a worldvolume flux condition on the M2-brane. A Wilson surface, identified with the holonomy Hol$_\nabla$ one of the Gerbe structures, the flat $\mathcal{G}_1^{\nabla_c}$-gerbe, is naturally introduced as the topological operator characterizing the M2-brane. The resulting topological operators realize discrete symmetries associated with the \textit{winding} and the flux/\textit{monopole} sectors, and their operator algebra is well-defined: the \textit{monopole} operator acts non trivially on a \textit{vortex-dressed} operator, while the winding operator acts on the pullback of the Wilson surface.</description>

      <title>Convergent Twist Deformations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.16593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes a functorial framework for convergence of Drinfeld's Universal Deformation Formula (UDF) on spaces of analytic vectors. This is accomplished by matching the order of the latter with an equicontinuity condition on the Drinfeld twist underlying the deformation. Throughout, we work with representations of finite-dimensional Lie algebras by continuous linear mappings on locally convex spaces. This allows us to establish not only convergence of the formal power series, but the continuity of the deformed bilinear mappings as well as the entire holomorphic dependence on the deformation parameter $\hbar$. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our theory by applying it to the explicit Drinfeld twists constructed by Giaquinto and Zhang, where we establish both the equicontinuity condition and determine the corresponding spaces of analytic vectors for concrete representations. Thereby we answer a question posed by Giaquinto and Zhang whether a strict version of their formal twists is possible in the positive.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.16604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the classical edge-triangle Exponential Random Graph Model (ERGM) to an inhomogeneous setting in which vertices carry types determined by an underlying partition. This leads to a block-structured ERGM where interaction parameters depend on vertex types. We establish a large deviation principle for the associated sequence of measures and derive the corresponding variational formula for the limiting free energy. In the ferromagnetic regime, where the parameters governing triangle densities are nonnegative, we reduce the variational problem to a scalar optimization problem, thereby identifying the natural block counterpart of the replica symmetric regime. Under additional restrictions on the parameters, comparable to the classical Dobrushin's uniqueness region, we prove uniqueness of the maximizer and derive a law of large numbers for the edge density.</description>

      <title>Numerical study of non-relativistic quantum systems and small oscillations induced in a helically twisted geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate bound states of a non-relativistic scalar particle in a three-dimensional helically twisted (torsional) geometry, considering both the free case and the presence of external radial interactions. The dynamics is described by the Schr\"odinger equation on a curved spatial background and, when included, by minimal coupling to a magnetic vector potential incorporating an Aharonov--Bohm flux. After separation of variables, the problem reduces to a one-dimensional radial eigenvalue equation governed by an effective potential that combines torsion-induced Coulomb-like and centrifugal-like structures with magnetic/flux-dependent terms and optional model interactions. Because closed-form analytic solutions are not reliable over the parameter ranges required for systematic scans, we compute spectra and eigenfunctions numerically by formulating the radial equation as a self-adjoint Sturm--Liouville problem and solving it with a finite-difference discretization on a truncated radial domain, with explicit convergence control. We analyze four representative scenarios: (i) no external potential, (ii) Cornell-type confinement, (iii) Kratzer-type interaction, and (iv) the small-oscillation regime around the minimum of a Morse potential. We present systematic trends of the low-lying levels as functions of the torsion parameter, magnetic field, and azimuthal sector, and we show that geometric couplings alone can produce effective confinement even in the absence of an external interaction.</description>

      <title>Columnar order in random packings of $2\times2$ squares on the square lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.01276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.01276v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study random packings of $2\times2$ squares with centers on the square lattice $\mathbb{Z}^{2}$, in which the probability of a packing is proportional to $\lambda$ to the number of squares. We prove that for large $\lambda$, typical packings exhibit columnar order, in which either the centers of most tiles agree on the parity of their $x$-coordinate or the centers of most tiles agree on the parity of their $y$-coordinate. This manifests in the existence of four extremal and periodic Gibbs measures in which the rotational symmetry of the lattice is broken while the translational symmetry is only broken along a single axis. We further quantify the decay of correlations in these measures, obtaining a slow rate of exponential decay in the direction of preserved translational symmetry and a fast rate in the direction of broken translational symmetry. Lastly, we prove that every periodic Gibbs measure is a mixture of these four measures.
  Additionally, our proof introduces an apparently novel extension of the chessboard estimate, from finite-volume torus measures to all infinite-volume periodic Gibbs measures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22452v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate spin transport in a class of time-reversal symmetric insulators on the honeycomb structure, the Kane--Mele model being an emblematic example in this class. We derive the spin conductivity by the linear response \`a la Kubo and show that it is well-defined and independent of the choice of the spin current. For models that do not conserve the spin, we demonstrate that the deviation of the spin conductivity from the quantised value is, at worst, quadratic in the spin-non-conserving terms, thus improving previous results. Additionally, we show that the leading-order corrections are actually quadratic for some models in the class, demonstrating that the spin conductivity is not universally quantised. Consequently, our results show that, in general, there is no direct connection between the spin conductivity and the Fu--Kane--Mele index.</description>

      <title>A Self Propelled Vortex Dipole Model on Surfaces of Variable Negative Curvature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00923v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate vortex dipoles on surfaces of variable negative curvature, focusing on a catenoid of arbitrary throat radius as a concrete example. We construct the effective dynamical system including mutual and geometric self-interaction terms and show that the resulting Hamiltonian dynamics makes dipoles follow catenoid geodesics, in agreement with recent works, Gustafsson (J. Nonlinear Sci. 32, 62, 2022) and by Drivas, Glukhovskiy and Khesin (Int. Math. Res. Not. 2024, 14, 10880-10894). We utilize the symplectic structure to find a conserved momentum map J related to the U(1) symmetry along the azimuthal direction. We verify the conservation of both the Hamiltonian and this momentum for arbitrary throat radius. We then demonstrate direct and exchange scattering of classical vortices on the catenoid, and we contrast this with the collective rotational motion (with azimuthal drift) that arises for chiral pairs. Finally, we build a finite-dipole dynamical system on the catenoid and show that the self-propulsion terms emerge to leading order in the dipole size. This provides a concrete realization, on a curved minimal surface, of the intuitive statement that a finite dipole propels orthogonal to the dipole axis, with a speed modulated by curvature.</description>

Abstract: Automatically determining the number of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) and their center frequencies in Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) still remains an open mathematical challenge, which often relies on heuristic prior settings, trial-and-error strategies or complex-field based methods that lack of theoretical guarantees on the convergence. In this article, we proposed a novel variational method based on real field, focusing on evaluating the supporting baseline of a signal's spectrum, to further retrieve the intrinsic mode functions. Our method treats automatic extraction of modes as a constrained optimization problem that adversarially maximizes the baseline integral while penalizing its curvature, and transform the problem into iteratively solving a fourth-order boundary value problem via Lagrangian duality. Furthermore, we establish the rigorous mathematical proof on the global convergence to our algorithm based on dual ascent in function space. Comprehensive numerical experiments on artificial and real-world signals including electrocardiogram (ECG) data show that our method can provide accurate estimates of IMFs and center frequencies, and comparison with methods like Successive VMD also shows our advantages in avoiding redundant modes while ensuring the recovery of necessary components, indicating that we have provided a robust, theoretically grounded initialization routine for VMD.</description>

      <title>Wrinkling of an elastic sheet floating on a liquid sphere</title>

Abstract: A thin circular elastic sheet floating on a drop-like liquid substrate is deformed due to incompatibility between the curved substrate and the planar sheet. We adopt a variational viewpoint by minimizing the non-convex membrane energy together with a higher-order convex bending energy. Focusing on thin sheets, we expand the minimum of the energy in terms of a small thickness ratio $h$, and identify the first two terms of this expansion. The leading-order term arises from the minimization of a family of one-dimensional relaxed problems, while for the next-order term we establish lower and upper bounds. This generalizes the previous work [P. Bella and R.V. Kohn. Wrikling of a thin circular sheet bonded to a spherical substrate, Philos. Trans. Roy. Soc. A, 375(2017). arXiv:1611.01781] to the physically relevant case of a liquid substrate.</description>

      <title>Higher equations of motion at level 2 in Liouville CFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13900v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove conjectures of Zamolodchikov and Belavin-Belavin in Liouville conformal field theory (CFT), which are generalisations of the celebrated Belavin-Polyakov-Zamolodchikov equations known as the higher equations of motion. Algebraically, these equations give examples of non-zero singular states in Virasoro modules, which is a relatively rare phenomenon in the physical study of CFT. In probability theory, these equations and their variants have been instrumental in the rigorous derivation of the structure constants of Liouville CFT in the unit disc. The proof builds on a previous work of ours studying the analytic continuation of the Poisson operator of Liouville theory. The main novelty is that this operator admits poles on the Kac table, and the higher equations of motions are obtained via a residue computation.</description>

      <title>Rigorous derivation of damped-driven wave turbulence theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10711v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a rigorous justification of various kinetic regimes exhibited by the nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation with an additive stochastic forcing and a viscous dissipation. The importance of such damped-driven models stems from their wide empirical use in studying turbulence for nonlinear wave systems. The force injects energy into the system at large scales, which is then transferred across scales, thanks to the nonlinear wave interactions, until it is eventually dissipated at smaller scales. The presence of such scale-separated forcing and dissipation allows for the constant flux of energy in the intermediate scales, known as the inertial range, which is the focus of the vast amount of numerical and physical literature on wave turbulence.
  Roughly speaking, our results provide a rigorous kinetic framework for this turbulent behavior by proving that the stochastic dynamics can be effectively described by a deterministic damped-driven kinetic equation, which carries the full picture of the turbulent energy dynamic across scales (like cascade spectra or other flux solutions). The analysis extends previous works in the unperturbed setting arXiv:1912.09518-arXiv:2301.07063 to the above empirically motivated damped driven setting. Here, in addition to the size $L$ of the system, and the strength $\lambda$ of the nonlinearity, an extra thermodynamic parameter has to be included in the kinetic limit ($L\to \infty, \lambda\to 0$), namely the strength $\nu$ of the forcing and dissipation. Various regimes emerge depending on the relative sizes of $L$, $\lambda$ and $\nu$, which give rise to different kinetic equations. Two major novelties of this work is the extension of the Feynman diagram analysis to additive stochastic objects, and the sharp asymptotic development of the leading terms in that expansion.</description>

Abstract: We consider unitary cocycle deformations of covariant $\ast$-differential calculi. We prove that complex structures, holomorphic bimodules and Chern connections on the deformed calculus are twists of their untwisted counterparts. Moreover, for cocycle deformations of a class of classical K\"ahler manifolds, the Levi-Civita connection on the space of one-forms of the deformed calculus is shown to be a direct sum of the Chern connections on the twisted holomorphic and the anti-holomorphic bimodules. Our class of examples also includes cocycle deformations of the Heckenberger-Kolb calculi.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the relaxation of constraints in gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02468v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, there were works claiming that path integral quantisation of gauge theories necessarily requires relaxation of Lagrangian constraints. As has also been noted in the literature, it is of course wrong since there perfectly exist gauge field quantisations respecting the constraints, and at the same time the very idea of changing the classical theory in this way has many times appeared in other works. On the other hand, what was done in the path integral approach is fixing a gauge in terms of zero-momentum variables. We would like to show that this relaxation is what normally happens when one fixes such a gauge at the level of action principle in a Lagrangian theory. Moreover, there is an interesting analogy to be drawn. Namely, one of the ways to quantise a gauge theory is to build an extended Hamiltonian and then add new conditions by hand such as to make it a second class system. The constraints' relaxation occurs when one does the same at the level of the total Hamiltonian, i.e. a second class system with the primary constraints only.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Extensions of Unitary Vertex Operator Algebras and Conformal Nets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03235v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $V$ be one of the following unitary strongly-rational VOAs: unitary WZW models, discrete series W-algebras of type ADE, even lattice VOAs, parafermion VOAs, their tensor products, and their strongly-rational cosets. Let $U$ be a (unitary) VOA extension of $V$, described by a Q-system $Q$.
  We prove that $U$ is strongly local. Let $\mathcal A_V,\mathcal A_U$ be the conformal nets associated to $V,U$ in the sense of Carpi-Kawahigashi-Longo-Weiner (CKLW). We prove that $\mathcal A_U$ is canonically isomorphic to the conformal net extension of $\mathcal A_V$ defined by the Q-system $Q$.
  We prove that all unitary $U$-modules are strongly integrable in the sense of Carpi-Weiner-Xu (CWX). We show that the CWX $*$-functor from the $C^*$-category of unitary $U$-modules to the $C^*$-category of finite-index $\mathcal A_U$-modules is naturally isomorphic to $*$-functor defined by $Q$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13224v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce a graded bracket of forms on multicontact manifolds. This bracket satisfies a graded Jacobi identity as well as two different versions of the Leibniz rule, one of them being a weak Leibniz rule, extending the well-known notions in contact geometry. In addition, we develop the multisymplectization of multicontact structures to relate these brackets to the ones present in multisymplectic geometry and obtain the field equations in an abstract context. The Jacobi bracket also permits to study the evolution of observables and study the dissipation phenomena, which we also address. Finally, we apply the results to classical dissipative field theories.</description>

      <title>Indiscernibility of quantum states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10027v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper provides a systematic study of the operational idea that a quantum ``state'' is only defined up to what can be distinguished by a chosen family of observables. Concretely, any von Neumann algebra of observables $\mathscr{M}$ induces an equivalence relation on pure and mixed states by declaring two preparations indiscernible when they give identical statistics for every observable in $\mathscr{M}$. The corresponding quotient, the \emph{Holevo space} associated with $\mathscr{M}$, is the effective (relational) state space of the experiment, explicitly dependent on the observer's available measurements.
  We analyse the resulting geometry and topology of these quotients, and prove a context-complete classical representation theorem: for every von Neumann algebra $\mathscr{M}$ there is a canonical lift $a\mapsto \widehat a$ to bounded continuous functions on the Holevo space, reproducing expectation values pointwise. In the commutative case this reduces to ordinary probability theory on the joint spectrum.
  The framework is illustrated in explicit examples, including position measurements of a free particle and polarisation measurements in the qubit, EPR, and Bell settings. In particular, in the EPR scenario, Charlie's joint observable defines a simplex of joint outcome distributions, whereas the Alice/Bob marginal viewpoint collapses the effective description to a lower-dimensional space by ``forgetting'' the correlation parameter. We show that by varying the polariser settings, the indiscernibility classes become conjugated (and generically reshuffled), and different settings are typically incompatible at the level of observable algebras.</description>

      <title>Resonating Valence Bond Ground States on Corner-sharing Simplices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10471v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Hubbard model in the $U\to\infty$ limit has been known to have resonating valence bond (RVB) ground states on certain corner-sharing simplex lattices. Examples include both the quasi-1D sawtooth lattice with open boundary and a larger class of higher dimensional lattices without boundaries. The two types of results were obtained by different approaches which do not apply to one another. In the second class of lattices, the simplest simplex is a tetrahedron. We hereby generalize both results by studying the singly hole-doped system on the quasi-1D lattice of a tetrahedron chain, which can be considered a stripe of the pyrochlore or checkerboard lattices. The energy level ordering of irreducible representations of each tetrahedron shows that a chain of them has exponentially degenerate partial RVB or dimer-monomer ground states where each tetrahedron hosts one spin-$1/2$ monomer and one spin-$0$ dimer. The exact ground states in the infinitely long chain limit are analytically solved by introducing basis transformations between local Hilbert spaces of neighboring tetrahedra, and its energy agrees with the extrapolation of numerical exact diagonalization results of finite sized systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Entanglement Index in String Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15939v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define a notion of `quantum entanglement index' with the aim to compute it for black hole horizons in string theory at one-loop order using the stringy replica method. We consider the horizon of BTZ black holes to construct the relevant conical orbifolds, labeled by an odd integer $N$, and compute the partition function as a function of $N$, corresponding to the fractional indexed R\'enyi entropy. We show that it is free of tachyons and naturally finite both in the ultraviolet and the infrared, even though it is generically ultraviolet divergent in the field theory limit. Thus, the index provides a useful diagnostic of the entanglement structure of string theory without the need for analytic continuation in $N$.</description>

      <title>On the Trotter Error in Many-body Quantum Dynamics with Coulomb Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22707v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient simulation of many-body quantum systems is central to advances in physics, chemistry, and quantum computing, with a key question being whether the simulation cost scales polynomially with the system size. In this work, we analyze many-body quantum systems with Coulomb interactions, which are fundamental to electronic and molecular systems. We prove that Trotterization for such unbounded Hamiltonians achieves a $1/4$-order convergence rate, with explicit polynomial dependence on the number of particles. The result holds for all initial wavefunctions in the domain of the Hamiltonian, and the $1/4$-order convergence rate is optimal, as previous work has numerically demonstrated that it can be saturated by a specific initial ground state. The main challenges arise from the many-body structure and the singular nature of the Coulomb potential. Our proof strategy differs from prior state-of-the-art Trotter analyses, addressing both difficulties in a unified framework. Our analysis treats the Coulomb potential as an unbounded operator without modification or regularization, and does not rely on spatial discretization, making it compatible with both first- and second-quantized circuit constructions.</description>

Abstract: It is well-known that the trace-free Einstein tensor of a pseudo-Riemannian metric cannot arise by variation of a local diffeomorphism-invariant action functional with the (inverse) metric as field variable. We show that this statement remains true even for general local actions, without the assumption of diffeomorphism invariance.</description>

      <title>Impact of space-time curvature coupling on the vacuum energy induced by a magnetic topological defect in flat space-time of arbitrary dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06815v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have investigated vacuum polarization of a quantized charged massive scalar field in the presence of a magnetic topological defect, modeled as an impenetrable tube of finite thickness carrying magnetic flux. At the tube's surface, we imposed a general Robin boundary condition. Our analysis demonstrates that, in flat space-time, the total induced vacuum energy is independent of the coupling $\xi$ of the scalar field's interaction with the space-time curvature only in the special cases of Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions. For general Robin boundary conditions, however, the total induced vacuum energy depends on the coupling $\xi$ in a flat space-time and exhibits a nontrivial dependence on the parameter of the Robin boundary condition. We investigated the dependence of this effect not only on Robin's boundary condition parameter, but also on the tube thickness and the space-time dimensionality. We conclude that careful measurements of vacuum polarization effects in flat space-time may, in principle, provide an independent way to probe the $\xi$ coupling.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Formation of Black Holes due to Boundary Effect in Vacuum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09508v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that a marginally outer trapped surface (MOTS) can form as a result of Einsteinian evolution in pure vacuum spacetime starting from regular initial data free of MOTSs due to pure boundary effects. We adapt a Cauchy-double-null framework and use the boundary generalized mean curvature condition for the existence of an interior MOTS imposed by the author S-T Yau in \cite{yau}. In particular, we prove that the condition of \cite{yau} can be met dynamically starting from a configuration that does not verify the same through a focusing mechanism. In fact, a very mild incoming radiation can cause a large enough generalized boundary mean curvature of an isotropically large domain so that a MOTS exists in the interior. This is fundamentally different from black hole formation by standard ``gravitational collapse" and can be interpreted as the dynamical realization of a long-suspected idea in GR: MOTS can form because of ``global geometry", not just quasi-local concentration of gravity/matter.</description>

      <title>Green's function on the Tate curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24935v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the question of defining a $p$-adic string worldsheet action in genus one, we define a Laplacian operator on the Tate curve, and study its Green's function. We show that the Green's function exists. We provide an explicit formula for the Green's function, which turns out to be a non-Archimedean counterpart of the Archimedean Green's function on a flat torus. In particular, it turns out that this Green's function recovers the N\'eron local height function for the Tate curve in the $p\to\infty$ limit, when the $j$-invariant has odd valuation. So this non-Archimedean height function now acquires a physics meaning in terms of the large $p$ limit of a non-Archimedean conformal field theory two point function on the Tate curve, as well as a direct analytic interpretation as a Green's function, on the same footing as in the Archimedean place.</description>

      <title>Failure of the mean-field Hartree approximation for a bosonic many-body system with non-Hermitian Hamiltonian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13038v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mean-field Hartree theory is a central tool for reducing interacting many-body dynamics to an effective nonlinear one-particle evolution. This approximation has been employed also when the Hamiltonian that governs the many-body dynamics is not Hermitian. Indeed, non-Hermitian Hamiltonians model particle gain/loss or the evolution of open quantum systems between consecutive quantum jumps. Furthermore, the validity of the Hartree approximation for generic non-Hermitian Hamiltonians lies at the basis of a quantum algorithm for nonlinear differential equations. In this work, we show that this approximation can fail. We analytically solve a model of $N$ bosonic qubits with two-body interactions generated by a purely anti-Hermitian Hamiltonian, determine an analytic expression for the limit for $N\to\infty$ of the one-particle marginal state and show that such a limit does not agree with the solution of the non-Hermitian Hartree evolution equation. We further show that there exists an initial condition such that the exact one-particle marginal state undergoes a finite-time transition to a mixed state, a phenomenon that is completely absent in the case of Hermitian Hamiltonians. Our findings challenge the validity of the mean-field Hartree approximation for non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, and call for additional conditions for the validity of the mean-field regime to model the dynamics of particle gain and loss and the open-system dynamics in bosonic many-body systems.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we suggest a sufficient condition on the properadic envelope of a quadratic dioperad to be Koszul in terms of twisted associative algebras.
  As a particular new example, we show that the properad of quadratic Poisson structures is Koszul.</description>

      <title>A Modified Center-of-Mass Conservation Law in Finite-Domain Simulations of the Zakharov--Kuznetsov Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15573v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate conservation laws of the two-dimensional Zakharov--Kuznetsov (ZK) equation, a natural higher-dimensional and non-integrable extension of the Korteweg--de Vries equation. The ZK equation admits three scalar conserved quantities -- mass, momentum, and energy -- represented as $I_1$, $I_2$, and $I_3$, as well as a vector-valued quantity $\bm{I}_4$. In high-accuracy numerical simulations on a finite double-periodic domain, most of these quantities are well preserved, while a systematic temporal drift is observed only in the $x$-component $I_{4x}$. We show that the nontrivial evolution of $I_{4x}$ originates from an explicit boundary-flux contribution, which is induced by fluctuations of the solution and its spatial derivatives at the domain boundaries. We successfully identify the source of the inaccuracy in the numerical solutions. Motivated by this analysis, we define a modified center-of-mass quantity $I_{4x}^{\mathrm{mod}}$ and demonstrate its conservation numerically for single-pulse configurations. The modified quantity thus provides a consistent conservation law for the ZK equation and yields an appropriate description of center-of-mass motion in finite-domain numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Averages of Exponentials from the point of view of Superintegrability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20213v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate Gaussian averages of arbitrary exponentials of the matrix variable $X$ with the help of superintegrability, which provides explicit expressions for Schur averages. As in the simpler cases the answer is expressed in terms of Laguerre polynomials, but in a somewhat sophisticated way. It involves triangular sum over partitions, with simple exponential factor and a complicated polynomial prefactor. Some ingredients of the formula are not found in full generality and there is still a room for further work.</description>

      <title>On the discrete spectrum of non-selfadjoint operators with applications to Schr\"odinger operators with complex potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02359v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For relatively form-compact perturbations of non-negative selfadjoint operators, we obtain an upper bound on the number of discrete eigenvalues in half-planes separated from the positive real axis. The bound is given in terms of a partial trace of the real part of the Birman--Schwinger operator, or an appropriate rotation thereof. While eigenvalue counting estimates of this type are classical in the selfadjoint setting, no analogous connection between the number of discrete eigenvalues and the Birman--Schwinger operator has previously been established in the non-selfadjoint theory. The proof proceeds via techniques in antisymmetric tensor product spaces that serve as a non-selfadjoint replacement for the classical arguments. As an application to Schr\"odinger operators, we generalise the Cwikel--Lieb--Rozenblum inequality to complex potentials and derive new Lieb--Thirring type inequalities. We also analyse the sharpness of the obtained bounds and discuss their optimality within the considered framework.</description>

      <title>Clifford algebras, meson algebras and higher order generalisations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.09603v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyse the homogeneous parts of Clifford and meson algebras and point out that for the Clifford algebra it is related to fermionic statistics, that is, to fermionic parastatistics of order 1 while for the meson algebra it is related to fermionic parastatistics of order 2. We extend these homogeneous algebras into corresponding algebras related to fermionic parastatistics of all orders. We then define correspondingly higher order generalizations of Clifford and meson algebras.</description>
