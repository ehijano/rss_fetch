      <title>AI-Powered Energy algorithmic Trading: Integrating Hidden Markov Models with Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the field of quantitative finance, machine learning methods have become essential for alpha generation. This paper presents a pioneering method that uniquely combines Hidden Markov Models (HMM) and neural networks, creating a dual-model alpha generation system integrated with Black-Litterman portfolio optimization. The methodology, implemented on the QuantConnect platform, aims to predict future price movements and optimize trading strategies. Specifically, it filters for highly liquid, top-cap energy stocks to ensure stable and predictable performance while also accounting for broker payments. QuantConnect was selected because of its robust framework and to guarantee experimental reproducibility. The algorithm achieved a 31% return between June 1, 2023, and January 1, 2024, with a Sharpe ratio of 1.669, demonstrating its potential. The findings suggest significant improvements in trading strategy performance through the combined use of the HMM and neural networks. This study explores the architecture of the algorithm, data pre-processing techniques, model training procedures, and performance evaluation, highlighting its practical applicability and effectiveness in real-world trading environments.

      <title>Risk management in multi-objective portfolio optimization under uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In portfolio optimization, decision makers face difficulties from uncertainties inherent in real-world scenarios. These uncertainties significantly influence portfolio outcomes in both classical and multi-objective Markowitz models. To address these challenges, our research explores the power of robust multi-objective optimization. Since portfolio managers frequently measure their solutions against benchmarks, we enhance the multi-objective min-regret robustness concept by incorporating these benchmark comparisons.
  This approach bridges the gap between theoretical models and real-world investment scenarios, offering portfolio managers more reliable and adaptable strategies for navigating market uncertainties. Our framework provides a more nuanced and practical approach to portfolio optimization under real-world conditions.</description>

      <title>Optimal retirement in presence of stochastic labor income: a free boundary approach in presence of an incomplete market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note, we show how to solve an optimal retirement problem in presence of a stochastic wage dealing with a free boundary problem. In particular, we show how to deal with an incomplete market case, where the wage cannot be fully hedged investing in the risk-free and the risky asset describing the financial market.</description>

      <title>PO-QA: A Framework for Portfolio Optimization using Quantum Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Portfolio Optimization (PO) is a financial problem aiming to maximize the net gains while minimizing the risks in a given investment portfolio. The novelty of Quantum algorithms lies in their acclaimed potential and capability to solve complex problems given the underlying Quantum Computing (QC) infrastructure. Utilizing QC's applicable strengths to the finance industry's problems, such as PO, allows us to solve these problems using quantum-based algorithms such as Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) and Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). While the Quantum potential for finance is highly impactful, the architecture and composition of the quantum circuits have not yet been properly defined as robust financial frameworks/algorithms as state of the art in present literature for research and design development purposes. In this work, we propose a novel scalable framework, denoted PO-QA, to systematically investigate the variation of quantum parameters (such as rotation blocks, repetitions, and entanglement types) to observe their subtle effect on the overall performance. In our paper, the performance is measured and dictated by convergence to similar ground-state energy values for resultant optimal solutions by each algorithm variation set for QAOA and VQE to the exact eigensolver (classical solution). Our results provide effective insights into comprehending PO from the lens of Quantum Machine Learning in terms of convergence to the classical solution, which is used as a benchmark. This study paves the way for identifying efficient configurations of quantum circuits for solving PO and unveiling their inherent inter-relationships.</description>

      <title>Value-at-Risk constrained portfolios in incomplete markets: a dynamic programming approach to Heston's model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.14152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.14152v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We solve an expected utility-maximization problem with a Value-at-risk constraint on the terminal portfolio value in an incomplete financial market due to stochastic volatility. To derive the optimal investment strategy, we use the dynamic programming approach. We demonstrate that the value function in the constrained problem can be represented as the expected modified utility function of a vega-neutral financial derivative on the optimal terminal wealth in the unconstrained utility-maximization problem. Via the same financial derivative, the optimal wealth and the optimal investment strategy in the constrained problem are linked to the optimal wealth and the optimal investment strategy in the unconstrained problem. In numerical studies, we substantiate the impact of risk aversion levels and investment horizons on the optimal investment strategy. We observe a 20% relative difference between the constrained and unconstrained allocations for average parameters in a low-risk-aversion short-horizon setting.</description>

      <title>The Democratization of Wealth Management: Hedged Mutual Fund Blockchain Protocol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02302v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop several innovations to bring the best practices of traditional investment funds to the blockchain landscape. Specifically, we illustrate how: 1) fund prices can be updated regularly like mutual funds; 2) performance fees can be charged like hedge funds; 3) mutually hedged blockchain investment funds can operate with investor protection schemes, such as high water marks; and 4) measures to offset trading related slippage costs when redemptions happen. Using our concepts - and blockchain technology - traditional funds can calculate performance fees in a simplified manner and alleviate several operational issues. Blockchain can solve many problems for traditional finance, while tried and tested wealth management techniques can benefit decentralization, speeding its adoption. We provide detailed steps - including mathematical formulations and instructive pointers - to implement these ideas and discuss how our designs overcome several blockchain bottlenecks, making smart contracts smarter. We provide numerical illustrations of several scenarios related to our mechanisms.</description>
