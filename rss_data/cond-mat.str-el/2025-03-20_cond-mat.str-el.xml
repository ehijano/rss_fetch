      <title>A quantum monomer-dimer model on Penrose tilings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define a quantum monomer-dimer model in the space of maximal dimer coverings of quasicrystalline Penrose tilings. Since Penrose tilings do not admit perfect dimer coverings, as shown by F. Flicker et al., PRX 10, 011005 (2020), monomers are necessarily present in our model. The model features a frustration-free Rokhsar-Kivelson (RK) point where the ground state is a uniform superposition of all the exponentially many maximal dimer coverings, despite the presence of a finite density of monomers. We map our model to a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory with matter and calculate various correlators to characterize the phase of the system at the RK point using classical Monte Carlo calculations. Specifically, we compute the dimer-dimer and vison-vison correlators, as well as open Wilson lines and closed Wilson loops corresponding to the monomers and the visons. We find that both the dimer-dimer and vison-vison correlators decay exponentially with distance. The open Wilson lines and closed Wilson loops decay exponentially with the same correlation length, indicating that the gauge theory is in the confined phase, which implies that the system is likely in an ordered phase.</description>

      <title>From Paramagnet to Dipolar Topological Order via Duality and Dipolar SPT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A scheme for the adaptive preparation of a topological state with dipole symmetry, dubbed the dipolar topological state (dTS), which serves as an example of translation symmetry-enriched topological phase, is proposed. The midcircuit state emerging during the preparation process is identified as a two-dimensional symmetry-protected topological (SPT) state protected by dipole bundle symmetry alongside charge and 1-form symmetries. The non-trivial boundary modes of the dipolar SPT state exhibiting the spontaneous breaking of charge and dipole bundle symmetries are analyzed. The duality map between the paramagnetic state and the dipolar topological state is established in the framework of the {\it simultaneous gauging} of two charge symmetries and one dipole symmetry that cannot be reduced as sequential gauging of the individual symmetry. Leveraging this duality, we work out the phase diagram of the dipolar topological state under perturbations by various transverse fields.</description>

      <title>Impact of tiny Fermi pockets with extremely high mobility on the Hall anomaly in the kagome metal CsV$_3$Sb$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The kagome metal CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ exhibits an unusual charge-density-wave (CDW) order, where the emergence of loop current order that breaks time-reversal symmetry (TRS) has been proposed. A key feature of this CDW phase is a non-monotonic Hall effect at low fields, often attributed to TRS breaking. However, its origin remains unclear. Here, we conduct comprehensive magnetotransport measurements on CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ and, through mobility spectrum analysis, identify the formation of tiny Fermi pockets with extremely high mobility below the CDW transition. Furthermore, electron irradiation experiments reveal that the non-monotonic Hall effect is significantly suppressed in samples with reduced mobility, despite no substantial change in the electronic structure. These results indicate that the non-monotonic Hall effect originates from these tiny Fermi pockets with high mobility carriers rather than anomalous Hall mechanisms, providing new insights into understanding the Hall anomaly in this kagome system.</description>

      <title>Effects of Berry curvature on ideal band magnetorotons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the many-body ground states in a family of fractionally-filled bands where the Berry curvature fluctuations can be tuned while maintaining ideal quantum geometry. We numerically find that the neutral gap of the fractional Chern insulator (FCI) ground state decreases as the Berry curvature becomes less homogeneous, ultimately driving an instability to a charge density wave. We derive an analytical model to explain this behavior by applying the single mode approximation to the ground state wave functions of the ideal band, from which we obtain a perturbative expression for the magnetoroton minimum. We extend our analysis to bands where the quantum geometry is weakly perturbed away from ideal and give examples where a less ideal band geometry results in a more stable FCI phase.</description>

      <title>Generalized incommensurability: the role of anomalously strong spin-orbit coupling for the spin ordering in a quasi-2D system, FeSe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study 2D spin and orbital systems, in a classical limit, in a regime where their coupling is so strong that orbital fluctuations are able to change sign of spin-exchange. Our aim is to understand how different phases in the orbital sector determine the ordering in the spin sector. The existence of intermediate vortex crystal (VC) phases, beside the canonical Kosterlitz and Thouless (KT) phases is now a well-established fact. Recently, we found [Phys. Rev. Research 6, 043154] that such a phase can explain phase diagram of FeSe. Motivated by this, here we develop a Renormalization Group (RG) method which can capture the formation of the VC phase. We achieve it by incorporating orbital vortex-vortex interactions through space-dependent incommensurability. Simultaneously, we incorporate the coupling with the spin sector for both short- and long-range interactions. We then derive a phase diagram including the effects of long-range interactions and spin-orbit coupling. The presence of the intermediate VC phase in the orbital sector changes the scaling of long-range spin-spin interactions, making them relevant under specific conditions. We thus find that the regular arrangement of orbital vortices can induce a long-range order in the 2D spin system.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Chiral Anomaly in Spin-1 Fermionic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral anomaly is a key feature of Lorentz-invariant quantum field theories: in presence of parallel external electric and magnetic fields, the number of massless Weyl fermions of a given chirality is not conserved. In condensed matter, emergent chiral fermions in Weyl semimetals exhibit the same anomaly, directly tied to the topological charge of the Weyl node, ensuring a quantized anomaly coefficient. However, many condensed matter systems break Lorentz symmetry while retaining topological nodes, raising the question of how chiral anomaly manifests in such settings. In this work, we investigate this question in spin-1 fermionic systems and show that the conventional anomaly equation is modified by an additional nontopological contribution, leading to a nonquantized anomaly coefficient. This surprising result arises because spin-1 fermions can be decomposed into 2-flavor Weyl fermions coupled to a Lorentz-breaking, momentum-dependent non-Abelian background potential. The interplay between this potential and external electromagnetic fields generates the extra term in the anomaly equation. Our framework naturally generalizes to other Lorentz-breaking systems beyond the spin-1 case.</description>

      <title>Kinetomagnetism and Altermagnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kinetomagnetism refers to magnetization induced by (electric) current, encompassing longitudinal or transverse effects and even- or odd-order phenomena. The essential prerequisite for kinetomagnetism is the breaking of PT (=Parity times Time reversal) symmetry. Altermagnets, characterized by full spin compensation and broken PT symmetry, are associated with spin-split electronic bands. Altermagnets with non-zero net magnetizations (M-type) fall within the ferromagnetic point group and are classified as orbital ferrimagnets. In contrast, S- and A-type altermagnets only exhibit non-zero net magnetizations under external perturbations, such as (electric) current or mechanical stress, which preserve PT symmetry. This study delves into the intriguing interplay between altermagnetism and kinetomagnetism, emphasizing magnetic point group classifications, called as the SAM classification. Various orders of the anomalous Hall effect are analyzed alongside kinetomagnetism, extending the discussion to certain non-magnetic materials with low symmetry. The MPG analysis for kinetomagnetism and altermagnetism highlights significant scientific and technological opportunities, particularly in materials explorations.</description>

      <title>Phonons in Electron Crystals with Berry Curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in 2D materials featuring nonzero Berry curvature have inspired extensions of the Wigner crystallization paradigm. This paper derives a low-energy effective theory for such quantum crystals, including the anomalous Hall crystal (AHC) with nonzero Chern number. First we show that the low frequency dispersion of phonons in AHC, despite the presence of Berry curvature, resembles that of the zero field (rather than finite magnetic field) Wigner crystal due to the commutation of translation generators. We explain how key parameters of the phonon theory such as elastic constants and effective mass can be extracted from microscopic models, and apply them to two families of models: the recently introduced $\lambda$-jellium model and a model of rhombohedral multilayer graphene (RMG). In the $\lambda$-jellium model, we explore the energy landscape as crystal geometry shifts, revealing that AHC can become "soft" under certain conditions. This causes transitions in lattice geometry, although the quantized Hall response remains unchanged. Surprisingly, the Berry curvature seems to enhance the effective mass, leading to a reduction in phonon speed. For the AHC in RMG, we obtain estimates of phonon speed and shear stiffness. We also identify a previously overlooked "kineo-elastic" term in the phonon effective action that is present in the symmetry setting of RMG, and leads to dramatic differences in phonon speeds in opposite directions. We numerically confirm these predictions of the effective actions by time-dependent Hartree-Fock calculations. Our work points to the wealth of new phenomena that can arise when electron crystallization occurs in the presence of band geometry and topology.</description>

      <title>Reallocation of Nonlocal Entanglement in Incommensurate Cold Atom Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cold atom arrays in optical lattices offer a highly tunable platform for exploring complex quantum phenomena that are difficult to realize in conventional materials. Here, we investigate the emergence of controllable long-range quantum correlations in a simulated twisted bilayer structure with fermionic cold atoms. By exploiting the incommensurate nature of the twisted bilayer, we observe a significant enhancement of long-range susceptibility, suggesting the formation of stable entangled states between spatially distant localized spins. We further show that the tunability of the interlayer coupling in terms of driving fields enables us to manipulate these entangled states without deformation of lattice structure and extra doping. Our findings provide a pathway for overcoming challenges in establishing strong correlations across distant sites, highlighting the potential of optical lattices as a versatile platform for advanced quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>The category of anyon sectors for non-abelian quantum double models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Kitaev's quantum double model for arbitrary finite gauge group in infinite volume, using an operator-algebraic approach. The quantum double model hosts anyonic excitations which can be identified with equivalence classes of `localized and transportable endomorphisms', which produce anyonic excitations from the ground state. Following the Doplicher--Haag--Roberts (DHR) sector theory from AQFT, we organize these endomorphisms into a braided monoidal category capturing the fusion and braiding properties of the anyons. We show that this category is equivalent to $\mathrm{Rep}_f \mathcal{D}(G)$, the representation category of the quantum double of $G$. This establishes for the first time the full DHR structure for a class of 2d quantum lattice models with non-abelian anyons.</description>

      <title>Planckian dissipation, anomalous high temperature THz non-linear response and energy relaxation in the strange metal state of the cuprate superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have investigated the nonlinear THz 2D coherent spectroscopic response of superconducting La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ (LSCO) thin films as a function of $T$ across a wide range of doping levels from mildly underdoped through extremely overdoped ($T_c &lt; 5$ K). In addition to the large nonlinearities expected in the superconducting state, we find an extended regime of large normal state THz nonlinearity. This is in sharp contrast to the conventional superconductor NbN where the strong nonlinear response promptly disappears at $T_c$. The size of the nonlinear susceptibility in LSCO is $|\chi^{(3)}|\approx 2.2\times10^{-9} m^2/V^2$, which is one of the largest THz range nonlinearities ever measured. The 2DCS measurement shows that the dominant normal state nonlinearities arise from pump-probe processes, of which there are various possible origins. These may be related to the unconventional interactions that lead to the strange metal or the persistence of superconducting correlations to high temperatures. Irrespective of its origin, the large normal state nonlinearity provides an opportunity to measure the energy relaxation rate ($\Gamma_E$) to temperatures where the momentum relaxation rate is linear in T and close to its ``Planckian" form ($\Gamma_M \approx 2kT/h$). We find $\Gamma_E$ to be $10 - 40$ times smaller than the momentum relaxation. This shows that the scattering that causes momentum loss (and $T$-linear) resistivity do not remove appreciable energy from the electrons. Although the $T$-dependence of the momentum relaxation is consistent with quasi-elastic scattering off bosonic collective modes at temperatures above their characteristic energy (the Bloch-Gruneisen temperature for acoustic phonons) it is inconsistent with $\Gamma_E$'s temperature dependence. $\Gamma_E$ is an increasing function of $T$, which is indicative of {\it inelastic} scattering to the phonon bath.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show how to perform scalable fault-tolerant non-Clifford gates in two dimensions by introducing domain walls between the surface code and a non-Abelian topological code whose codespace is stabilized by Clifford operators. We formulate a path integral framework which provides both a macroscopic picture for different logical gates as well as a way to derive the associated microscopic circuits. We also show an equivalence between our approach and prior proposals where a 2D array of qubits reproduces the action of a transversal gate in a 3D stabilizer code over time, thus, establishing a new connection between 3D codes and 2D non-Abelian topological phases. We prove a threshold theorem for our protocols under local stochastic circuit noise using a just-in-time decoder to correct the non-Abelian code.</description>

      <title>A theory of quasiballistic spin transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A recent work [Mierzejewski et al., Phys. Rev. B 107, 045134 (2023)] observed "quasiballistic spin transport" - long-lived and transiently ballistic modes of the magnetization density - in numerical simulations of infinite-temperature XXZ chains with power-law exchange interactions. We develop an analytical theory of such quasiballistic spin transport. Previous work found that this effect was maximized along a specific locus in the space of model parameters, which interpolated smoothly between the integrable Haldane-Shastry and XX models and whose shape was estimated from numerics. We obtain an analytical estimate for the lifetime of the spin current and show that it has a unique maximum along a different locus, which interpolates more gradually between the two integrable points. We further rule out the existence of a conserved two-body operator that protects ballistic spin transport away from these integrable points by proving that a corresponding functional equation has no solutions. We discuss connections between our approach and an integrability-transport conjecture for spin.</description>

      <title>Angular Interplay of Nematicity, Superconductivity, and Strange Metallicity in a Moir\'e Flat Band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconductivity in strongly correlated electron systems frequently exhibits broken rotational symmetry, raising fundamental questions about the underlying order parameter symmetry. In this work, we demonstrate that electronic nematicity--driven by Coulomb-mediated rotational symmetry breaking--serves as a crucial link to understanding the nature of superconductivity. Utilizing a novel framework of angle-resolved measurement, we reveal an interring angular interplay among nematicity, superconductivity, and strange metallicity in magic-angle twisted trilayer graphene. By establishing a direct correlation between the preferred superconducting transport direction and the principal axis of the metallic phase, our findings place strong constrains on the symmetry of the superconducting order parameter. This work introduces a new paradigm for probing the microscopic mechanisms governing superconductivity in strongly interacting two-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo study on Heisenberg model with local dipolar interaction</title>

Abstract: Aharony and Fisher showed that non-local dipolar effects in magnetism destabilize the Heisenberg fixed point in real ferromagnets, leading to a new fixed point, called the dipolar fixed point. The non-perturbative nature of the new fixed point, however, has not been uncovered for many decades. Inspired by the recent understanding that the dipolar fixed point is scale-invariant but not conformal invariant, we perform the Monte Carlo simulation of the local Heisenberg-dipolar model on the lattice of $40^3$ by introducing the local cost function parameterized by a parameter $\lambda$ and study its critical exponents, which should become identical to the dipolar fixed point of Aharony and Fisher in the infinite coupling limit $\lambda = \infty$. We find that the critical exponents become noticeably different from those of the Heisenberg fixed point for a finite coupling constant $\lambda=8$ (e.g. $\nu=0.601(2)(^{+0}_{-2})$ in the local Heisenberg-dipolar model while $\nu=0.712(1)(^{+3}_{-0})$ in the Heisenberg model), and the spin correlation function has a feature that it becomes divergence-free, implying the lack of conformal invariance.</description>

      <title>Quantum skyrmions and antiskyrmions in monoaxial chiral magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical monoaxial chiral magnets represent a unique magnetic system that allows for the stabilization of both skyrmions and antiskyrmions of equal energy. Unlike a similar situation in frustrated magnets, the energy landscape here is much simpler, consisting of four states: the saturated ferromagnetic state, spin-spiral, skyrmion, and antiskyrmion. This simplicity makes such systems interesting for potential applications that rely on manipulating these states. We study the quantum analog of the already established classical theory by investigating the low-energy excitation spectra of a spin-1/2 quantum Heisenberg model with monoaxial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. Using the density matrix renormalization group method, we establish that such a model supports the existence of skyrmion and antiskyrmion states of equal energy. This degeneracy allows for the existence of a mesoscopic Schr\"odinger cat state exhibiting properties of both skyrmion and antiskyrmion. To characterize this superposition, we calculate two-point correlation functions that can be measured in neutron scattering experiments. Finally, we introduce a perturbation in the form of a magnetic field gradient to induce a non-trivial time evolution of the superposition state. We study this time evolution using both a numerical variational approach and the collective coordinates method.</description>

      <title>Many exact area-law scar eigenstates in the nonintegrable PXP and related models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present new, highly non-trivial area-law exact zero-energy eigenstates of the one-dimensional (1D) PXP and related models. We formulate sufficient conditions for a matrix product state to represent an exact zero-energy eigenstate of a given 1D kinetically constrained model and use them to prove our new states. We also demonstrate that all previously known exact eigenstates of PXP-type models satisfy these conditions, and, in fact, can be directly deduced from them. We discuss and demonstrate a remarkably effective general numerical technique for discovering finite-bond-dimension eigenstates residing in degenerate subspaces of a broad class of Hamiltonians. Our results highlight a previously unrecognized structure characteristic of the exponentially large nullspaces in kinetically constrained models, suggesting the possibly of extensively many increasingly complex area-law zero-energy eigenstates in the thermodynamic limit. The important implications of these emergent exact eigenstates for the general thermalization phenomenology are exemplified by one of the states introduced in this work, which we propose is a member of the primary $\mathbb{Z}_2$ quantum many-body scar tower responsible for long-lived revivals in the Rydberg atom chain experiment.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous vortex-antivortex lattice and Majorana fermions in rhombohedral graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of superconducting states in multilayer rhombohedral graphene with spin and valley polarization has raised an interesting question: how does superconductivity cope with time-reversal symmetry breaking? %In the normal state, spin and valley polarization break time-reversal symmetry, while trigonal warping enforces $C_{3z}$. Below the critical temperature, the superconducting phase displays signatures of chiral behavior and is stabilized by out-of-plane fields as large as $\sim 0.5\,\text{T}$. In this work, using Ginzburg-Landau theory and microscopic calculation, we predict the existence of a new superconducting state at low electron density, which exhibits a spontaneously formed lattice of vortices and antivortices hosting Majorana zero-modes in their cores. We further identify this vortex-antivortex lattice (VAL) state in the experimental phase diagram and describe its experimental manifestations.</description>

      <title>Entanglement R\'{e}nyi Negativity of Interacting Fermions from Quantum Monte Carlo Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14155v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many-body entanglement unveils additional aspects of quantum matter and offers insights into strongly correlated physics. While ground-state entanglement has received much attention in the past decade, the study of mixed-state quantum entanglement using negativity in interacting fermionic systems remains largely unexplored. We demonstrate that the partially transposed density matrix of interacting fermions, similar to their reduced density matrix, can be expressed as a weighted sum of Gaussian states describing free fermions, enabling the calculation of rank-$n$ R\'{e}nyi negativity within the determinant quantum Monte Carlo framework. We calculate the rank-two R\'{e}nyi negativity for the half-filled Hubbard model and the spinless $t$-$V$ model. Our calculation reveals that the area law coefficient of the R\'{e}nyi negativity for the spinless $t$-$V$ model has a logarithmic finite-size scaling at the finite-temperature transition point. Our work contributes to the calculation of entanglement and sets the stage for future studies on quantum entanglement in various fermionic many-body mixed states.</description>

      <title>Unprecedented Fractional Magnetization Plateaus in a New Shastry-Sutherland Ising Compound</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12405v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Geometrically frustrated magnetic systems, such as those based on the Shastry-Sutherland lattice (SSL), offer a rich playground for exploring unconventional magnetic states. The delicate balance between competing interactions in these systems leads to the emergence of novel phases. We present the characterization of Er2Be2GeO7, an SSL compound with Er3+ ions forming orthogonal dimers separated by non-magnetic layers whose structure is invariant under the P-421m space group. Neutron scattering reveals an antiferromagnetic dimer structure at zero field, typical of Ising spins on that lattice and consistent with the anisotropic magnetization observed. However, magnetization measurements exhibit fractional plateaus at 1/4 and 1/2 of saturation, in contrast to the expected 1/3 plateau of the SSL Ising model. By comparing the energy of candidate states with ground-state lower bounds we show that this behavior requires spatially anisotropic interactions, leading to an anisotropic Shastry-Sutherland Ising Model (ASSLIM) symmetric under the Cmm2 space group. This anisotropy is consistent with the small orthorhombic distortion observed with single-crystal neutron diffraction. The other properties, including thermodynamics, which have been investigated theoretically using tensor networks, point to small residual interactions, potentially due to further couplings and quantum fluctuations. This study highlights Er2Ge2GeO7 as a promising platform for investigating exotic magnetic phenomena.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamics as the effective field theory of strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08760v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by the hunt for new phases of matter in quantum mixed states, it has recently been proposed that the equivalence of microcanonical and canonical ensembles in statistical mechanics is a manifestation of strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking (SWSSB) in an underlying many-body quantum description. Here, we build an effective field theory for SWSSB of a global U(1) symmetry; the answer exactly reproduces the Schwinger-Keldysh effective field theory of diffusion for the conserved charge. We conclude that hydrodynamics can be understood as a theory of "superfluidity" for the broken strong symmetry: a non-vanishing susceptibility is a measurable order parameter for SWSSB, the diffusion mode is the Goldstone boson of the spontaneously broken continuous symmetry, and a generalization of Goldstone's Theorem implies that the diffusion mode is always long-lived. This perspective provides a transparent physical explanation for the unusual "reparameterization" symmetries which are a necessary ingredient of Schwinger-Keldysh effective field theories for "normal fluids".</description>

      <title>Broken symmetry solutions in one-dimensional lattice models via many-body perturbation theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15020v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we study self-consistent solutions in one-dimensional lattice models obtained via many-body perturbation theory. The Dyson equation is solved in a fully self-consistent manner via the algorithmic-inversion method based on the sum-over-poles representation (AIM-SOP) of dynamical operators. In particular, we focus on the GW approximation, analyzing the spectral properties and the emergence of possible magnetic- or charge-density-wave broken symmetry solutions. We start by validating our self-consistent AIM-SOP implementation by taking as test case the one-dimensional Hubbard model. We then move to the study of antiferromagnetic and charge density wave solutions in one-dimensional lattice models, taking into account a long-range Coulomb interaction between the electrons. We show that moving from local to non-local electronic interactions leads to a competition between antiferromagnetic and charge-density-wave broken symmetry solutions. Complementary, by solving the Sham-Schl\"uter equation, we can compute the non-interacting Green's function reproducing the same charge density of the interacting system. In turn, this allows for the evaluation of the derivative discontinuity of the Kohn-Sham (KS) potential, showing that its contribution to the fundamental gap can become dominating in some of the studied cases.</description>

      <title>Anti Kibble-Zurek behavior in the quantum XY spin-1/2 chain driven by correlated noisy magnetic field and anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03409v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the non-adiabatic dynamics across a quantum phase transition, the Kibble-Zurek paradigm describes that the average number of topological defects is suppressed as a universal power law with the quench time scale. A conflicting observation, which termed anti-Kibble-Zurek dynamics has been reported in several studies, specifically in the driven systems with an uncorrelated stochastic (white) noise. Here, we study the defect generation in the driven transverse field/anisotropy quantum $XY$ model in the presence of a correlated (colored) Gaussian noise. We propose a generic conjecture that properly capture the noise-induced excitation features, which shows good agreement with the numerical simulations. We show that, the dynamical features of defect density are modified by varying the noise correlation time. Our numerical simulations confirm that, for fast noises, the dynamics of the defect density is the same as that of the uncorrelated (white) noise, as is expected. However, the larger ratio of noise correlation time to the annealing time results in larger defects density formation and reforms the universal dynamical features. Our finding reveals that, the noise-induced defects scale linearly with the annealing time for fast noises, while in the presence of the slow noises, the noise-induced defects scale linearly with the square of the annealing time. The numerical simulations confirm that, the optimal annealing time, at which the defects density is minimum, scales linearly in logarithmic scale with the total noise power having different exponents for the fast and slow noises.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetic splitting of magnons in hematite ($\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11623v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a four-sublattice spin-wave theory for the $g$-wave altermagnet candidate hematite ($\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$), considering both its easy-axis phase below and its weak ferromagnetic phase above the Morin temperature. A key question is whether the defining altermagnetic feature - magnon spin splitting (also called chirality or polarization splitting) due to nonrelativistic time-reversal symmetry breaking - remains intact when relativistic corrections, which contribute to hematite's magnetic order, are included. Using a detailed symmetry analysis supported by density functional theory, we show that capturing the magnon splitting within a Heisenberg model requires exchange interactions extending at least to the 13th neighbor. We find an altermagnetic band splitting of approximately 2 meV, which contrasts with the total band width of about 100 meV. To evaluate the experimental observability of this splitting, we analyze relativistic corrections to the magnon spectrum in both magnetic phases. We show that spin-orbit coupling - manifesting as magnetocrystalline anisotropies and the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) - does not obscure the key altermagnetic features. These findings indicate that inelastic neutron scattering can directly probe altermagnetic magnon splitting in hematite. We also discuss implications for magnon transport, particularly magnonic contributions to the thermal Hall effect (which requires spin-orbit coupling) and to spin splitter effects (which do not). Notably, we predict a third-order nonlinear magnon spin splitter effect. This result suggests that the $g$-wave magnon spin splitting in hematite enables transverse heat-to-spin conversion without requiring an external magnetic field.</description>

Abstract: The emergence of moir\'e materials, such as twisted transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), has created a fertile ground for discovering novel quantum phases of matter. However, solving many-electron problems in moir\'e systems presents significant challenges due to strong electron correlation and strong moir\'e band mixing. Recent advancements in neural quantum states hold the promise for accurate and unbiased variational solutions. Here, we introduce a powerful neural wavefunction to solve ground states of twisted MoTe2 across various fractional fillings, reaching unprecedented accuracy and system size. From the full structure factor and quantum weight, we conclude that our neural wavefunction accurately captures both the electron crystal at $\nu = 1/3$ and various fractional quantum liquids in a unified manner.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14221v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Symmetry breaking has been a central theme in classifying quantum phases and phase transitions. Recently, this concept has been extended to the mixed states of open systems, attracting considerable attention due to the emergence of novel physics beyond closed systems. In this Letter, we reveal a new type of phase transition in mixed states, termed \emph{quantum} strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking (SWSSB). Using a combination of field theory calculations and large-scale matrix product state simulations, we map out the global phase diagram of the XXZ critical spin chain under two-site XX decoherence, which features an SWSSB phase and a trivial Luttinger liquid phase, separated by a straight critical line that belongs to the boundary Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless universality class with a varying effective central charge. Remarkably, the SWSSB transition in our case is \emph{purely quantum} in the sense that it can only be driven by tuning the Hamiltonian parameter even under arbitrarily small decoherence strength, fundamentally distinguishing it from the decoherence-driven SWSSB transitions extensively discussed in previous literature. Conversely, no such phase transition occurs under ZZ decoherence. Finally, we also discuss the experimental relevance of our theory on quantum simulator platforms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06590v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The adaptive variational quantum dynamics simulation (AVQDS) method performs real-time evolution of quantum states using automatically generated parameterized quantum circuits that often contain substantially fewer gates than Trotter circuits. Here we report an improved version of the method, which we call AVQDS(T), by porting the Tiling Efficient Trial Circuits with Rotations Implemented Simultaneously (TETRIS) technique. The algorithm adaptively adds layers of disjoint unitary gates to the ansatz circuit so as to keep the McLachlan distance, a measure of the accuracy of the variational dynamics, below a fixed threshold. We perform benchmark noiseless AVQDS(T) simulations of quench dynamics in local spin models demonstrating that the TETRIS technique significantly reduces the circuit depth and two-qubit gate count. We also show a method based on eigenvalue truncation to solve the linear equations of motion for the variational parameters with enhanced noise resilience. Finally, we propose a way to substantially alleviate the measurement overhead of AVQDS(T) while maintaining high accuracy by synergistically integrating quantum circuit calculations on quantum processing units with classical calculations using, e.g., tensor networks to evaluate the quantum geometric tensor. We showcase that this approach enables AVQDS(T) to deliver more accurate results than simulations using a fixed ansatz of comparable final depth for a significant time duration with fewer quantum resources.</description>

      <title>Exceptional stationary state in a dephasing many-body open quantum system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13820v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a dephasing many-body open quantum system that hosts, together with the infinite-temperature state, another additional stationary state. The latter is exceptional in many respects, as it is pure and retains memory of the initial condition, whereas any orthogonal state evolves towards the infinite-temperature state erasing any information on the initial state. We discuss the approach to stationarity of the model focusing in particular on the fate of interfaces between the two states; a simple classical model based on a membrane picture helps developing an effective hydrodynamic theory even if the dynamics does not feature any conserved quantity. The fact that the model reaches stationary properties on timescales that depend on the system size while the asymptotic decay rate is finite is duly highlighted. We point out the reasons for considering these exceptional stationary states as quantum many-body scars in the open system framework.</description>
