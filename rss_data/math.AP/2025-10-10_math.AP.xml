      <title>Consistency of some well-posed five-field theories of dissipative relativistic fluid dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the FTBDNK family of formulations of relativistic Navier-Stokes (H. Freist\"uhler and B. Temple, Proc. R. Soc. A 470, 20140055 (2014), Proc. R. Soc. A 473 (2017), 20160729; F. S. Bemfica, M. Disconzi, and J. Noronha, Phys. Rev. D 98, 104064 (2018), Phys. Rev. D 100, 104020 (2019); P. Kovtun, J. High Energy Phys. 2019, 034 (2019)), this paper collects some consistency properties for certain causal hyperbolic five-field theories obtained from the Landau-Lifshitz formulation via Eulerian gradient shifts, a family, EGS(L), of models that slightly generalize a class identified in H. Freist\"uhler, J. Math.\ Phys. 61, 033101 (2020). With $\epsilon$ the magnitude of the dissipation coefficients that quantify viscosity and heat conduction, the paper shows that any element of EGS(L) is $O(\epsilon^2)$ equivalent to the Landau-Lifshitz formulation, has an $O(\epsilon^3)$ excess entropy production, and represents heterogeneous local thermodynamic equilibria cleanly.</description>

      <title>First order equation on random measures as superposition of weak solutions to the McKean-Vlasov equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to define an evolution equation for a curve of random probability measures $(M_t)_{t\in[0,T]}\subset \mathcal{P}(\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R}^d))$ associated to a non-local drift $b:[0,T]\times\mathbb{R}^d \times \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R}^d) \to \mathbb{R}^d$ and a non-local diffusion term $a:[0,T]\times \mathbb{R}^d \times \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R}^d) \to \operatorname{Sym}_+(\mathbb{R}^{d\times d})$. Then, we show that any solution to that equation can be lifted to a superposition of solutions to a non-linear Kolmogorov-Fokker-Planck equation and also to a superposition of weak solutions to the McKean-Vlasov equations. Finally, we use this superposition result to show how existence and uniqueness can be transferred from the equation on random measures to the associated non-linear Kolmogorov-Fokker-Planck equation and to the McKean-Vlasov equation, assuming uniqueness of the linearized KFP.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Stability of the Rayleigh-Taylor Problem in Quantum Navier-Stokes Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well-known that the Rayleigh--Taylor (abbr. RT) instability can be completely inhibited by the quantum effect stabilization in proper circumstances leading to a cutoff wavelength in the \emph{linear} motion equations. Motivated by the linear theory, we further investigate the {stability} for the \emph{nonlinear} RT problem of quantum Navier--Stokes equations in a slab with Navier boundary condition, and rigorously prove the inhibition of RT instability by the quantum effect under a proper setting. More precisely, if the RT density profile $\bar\rho$ satisfies an additional stabilizing condition, then there is a threshold ${\varepsilon_{{c}}}$ of the scaled Planck constant, such that if the scaled Planck constant is bigger than ${\varepsilon_{{c}}}$, the small perturbation solutions around an RT equilibrium state are algebraically stable in time. The mathematical proof is realized by a complicated multi-layer energy method with anisotropic norms of spacial derivatives.</description>

      <title>A log-free estimate for the diagonal paraproduct high $\times$ high $\to$ low in the 3D Navier-Stokes equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the diagonal paraproduct arising in the nonlinearity $(u\cdot \nabla) u$ for the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations. On scale-critical windows and in the range $1/6 &lt; \delta \le 5/8$ we obtain a log-free estimate at the level $L^2_t {\dot H}^{-1}_x$ for the projection $P_{&lt; N^{1-\delta}} \nabla(u_N \otimes v_N)$, consistent with the critical energy scheme. The main tools are phase-geometric integration, anisotropic local estimates on cylinders, and bilinear $ell^2$ decoupling on a finite-rank surface; the narrow diagonal zone is controlled via suppression of the null form. The work is restricted to a single resonant component; extensions to the full structure $(u \cdot\nabla) u$ and to sup$_t$ versions are left for further analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a one-dimensional cross-diffusion system for two interacting populations on the torus, with a fast-diffusion law with exponent $0&lt; \alpha\le 1$ and different external potentials. For arbitrary non-negative $L^{1}$ initial data with bounded entropy and a mixing condition we prove the existence of global weak solutions. This extends the recent result of M\'esz\'aros, Parker from the linear diffusion ($\alpha=1$) to the fast-diffusion.</description>

      <title>Gradient regularity for widely degenerate parabolic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we are interested in the regularity of weak solutions $u\colon\Omega_T\to\mathbb{R}$ to parabolic equations of the type \begin{equation*}
  \partial_t u - \mathrm{div} \nabla \mathcal{F}(x,t,Du) = f\qquad\mbox{in $\Omega_T$}, \end{equation*} where $\mathcal{F}$ is only elliptic for values of $Du$ outside a bounded and convex set $E\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ with the property that $0\in \mathrm{Int}{E}$. Here, $\Omega_T :=\Omega\times(0,T)\subset\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ denotes a space-time cylinder taken over a bounded domain $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ for some finite time $T&gt;0$. The function $\mathcal{F} : \Omega_T\times\mathbb{R}^n \to\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$ present in the diffusion is assumed to satisfy: the partial mapping $\xi\mapsto \mathcal{F}(x,t,\xi)$ is regular whenever $\xi$ lies outside of $E$, and vanishes entirely whenever $\xi$ lies within this set. Additionally, the datum $f$ is assumed to be of class $L^{n+2+\sigma}(\Omega_T)$ for some parameter $\sigma &gt; 0$. As our main result we establish that
  \begin{equation*}
  \mathcal{K}(Du)\in C^0(\Omega_T)
  \end{equation*} for any continuous function $\mathcal{K}\in C^0(\mathbb{R}^n)$ that vanishes on $E$. This article aims to extend the $C^1$-regularity result for the elliptic case to the parabolic setting.</description>

      <title>Stability of Traveling Fronts of the FitzHugh-Nagumo Equations on Cylindrical Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The FitzHugh-Nagumo equations are known to admit traveling front solutions in one spatial dimension that are nonlinearly stable. This paper concerns the stability of traveling front solutions propagating on cylindrical surfaces. It is shown that such traveling fronts are nonlinearly stable on the surface of standard cylinders of constant radius. The analysis is extended to warped cylinders with slowly varying radius, where persistence of front-like solutions is established. Numerical simulations support the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Determining a magnetic Schr\"odinger equation by a single far-field measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the inverse scattering problem for the magnetic Schr\"odinger equation. We first establish the well-posedness of the direct problem through a variational approach under physically meaningful assumptions on the magnetic and electric potentials. Our main results demonstrate that a single far-field measurement uniquely determines the support of the potential functions when the scatterer has polyhedral structures.
  A significant theoretical byproduct of our analysis reveals that transmission eigenfunctions must vanish at corners in two dimensions and edge corners in three dimensions, provided the angle is not $\pi$. This geometric property of eigenfunctions extends previous results for the non-magnetic case and provides new insights into the interaction between quantum effects and singular geometries. The proof combines complex geometric optics solutions with careful asymptotic analysis near singular points.
  From an inverse problems perspective, our work shows that minimal measurement data suffices for shape reconstruction in important practical cases, advancing the theoretical understanding of inverse scattering with magnetic potentials. The results have potential applications in quantum imaging, material characterization, and nondestructive testing where magnetic fields play a crucial role.</description>

      <title>A survey on the optimal partition problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This survey synthesizes the current state of the art on the regularity theory for solutions to the optimal partition problem. Namely, we consider non-negative, vector-valued Sobolev functions whose components have mutually disjoint support, and which are either local minimizers of the Dirichlet energy or, more generally, critical points satisfying a system of variational inequalities. This is particularly meaningful as the problem has emerged on several occasions and in diverse contexts: our aim is then to provide a coherent point of view and an up-to-date account of the progress concerning regularity of the solutions and their free boundaries, both in the interior and up to a fixed boundary.</description>

      <title>On the Cahn-Hilliard equation with nonlinear diffusion: the non-convex case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the Cahn-Hilliard equation with nonlinear diffusion and non-degenerate mobility modeling phase separation phenomena in complex systems (e.g., crystals and polymers). Previous results in the literature on this model relied on the strong convexity assumption of the gradient part of the energy, which excludes relevant cases. In this work, we remove the convexity condition and establish new qualitative properties of solutions under general assumptions on the diffusion and mobility functions. In two spatial dimensions, we prove uniqueness of weak solutions, their smoothing effect for positive times, and convergence to equilibrium as time tends to infinity. In three dimensions, we show local well-posedness of strong solutions for arbitrary initial data and global existence for data close to energy minimizers, yielding a Lyapunov stability principle. A key ingredient of our analysis is a Lojasiewicz-Simon inequality tailored to the nonlinear diffusion case, which enables us to characterize the longtime dynamics.</description>

      <title>The Space-Time Connectivity Theorem for Normal Currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work establishes a Space-Time Connectivity Theorem for normal currents. In analogy to classical results by Federer and Fleming as well as a recent theorem for integral currents by the second author, this result allows one to witness the weak* convergence of a uniformly bounded sequence of boundaryless normal currents with a space-time normal current that connects the elements of the sequence with their limit. The space-time setting is distinguished from the classical case in that this connecting current has a time coordinate and thus constitutes a progressive-in-time way to deform an element of the sequence to the limit.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the transmission eigenvalue problem for biharmonic scattering considering penetrable scatterers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide an analytical study of the transmission eigenvalue problem in the context of biharmonic scattering with a penetrable obstacle. We will assume that the underlying physical model is given by an infinite elastic two--dimensional Kirchhoff--Love plate in $\mathbb{R}^2$, where the plate's thickness is small relative to the wavelength of the incident wave. In previous studies, transmission eigenvalues have been studied for acoustic scattering, whereas in this case, we consider biharmonic scattering. We prove the existence and discreteness of the transmission eigenvalues as well as study the dependence on the refractive index. We are able to prove the monotonicity of the first transmission eigenvalue with respect to the refractive index. Lastly, we provide numerical experiments to validate the theoretical work.</description>

      <title>Stress concentration via quasi-Minnaert resonance in bubble-elastic structures and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stress concentration in bubble-elastic scattering scenarios has significant applications in engineering blasting and medical treatments. This study provides a comprehensive mathematical analysis of stress concentration in bubbly-elastic structures, induced by the quasi-Minnaert resonance. The quasi-Minnaert resonance manifests as two distinct wave patterns near the bubble's boundary: boundary localization and high-oscillation phenomena. We demonstrate how to leverage the quasi-Minnaert resonance to induce stress concentration in the elastic total wave field near the air bubble's boundary by appropriately selecting the incident elastic wave and high-contrast structure. The interaction between the air bubble and the elastic background couples two physical wave fields-acoustic and elastic waves-across the bubble's boundary. The intricate transmission conditions, combined with the scalar nature of acoustic waves and the vectorial nature of elastic waves, present significant analytical challenges. To address these, we employ layer potential theory and asymptotic analysis to rigorously establish the stress concentration and quasi-Minnaert resonance phenomena in a radially geometry bubble-elastic model. Extensive numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the stress concentration phenomenon alongside quasi-Minnaert resonance for various bubble geometries, including a unit disk, a corner domain, an apple-shaped domain in $\mathbb{R}^2$, and a ball in $\mathbb{R}^3$. The findings of this study enhance the understanding of stress concentration mechanisms and their applications in engineering blasting and medical therapies.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically flat black holes with a singular Cauchy horizon and a spacelike singularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In our recent work [Van de Moortel, The coexistence of null and spacelike singularities inside spherically symmetric black holes], we analyzed the transition between null and spacelike singularities in spherically symmetric dynamical black holes and demonstrated that the spacelike portion is described by a Kasner metric with positive varying exponents that degenerate to $(1,0,0)$ near the null-spacelike transition. In the present paper, we provide examples of global spacetimes satisfying the assumptions of this previous result and apply its analysis to obtain a large class of asymptotically flat (spherically symmetric) black hole spacetimes that exhibit coexisting null and spacelike singularities. Our main results include:
  _The construction of one-ended asymptotically flat black hole spacetimes solving the Einstein-Maxwell-charged-scalar-field equations. The proof relies on a new spacelike-characteristic gluing method between any uncharged spherically symmetric solution and the event horizon of a charged dynamical black hole.
  _The construction of a large class of two-ended asymptotically flat black hole spacetimes solving the Einstein-Maxwell-(uncharged)-scalar-field equations.
  In both cases, we show that the terminal boundary in the black hole interior only has two distinct components: a weakly singular (null) Cauchy horizon $\mathcal{CH}_{i^+}$ where curvature blows up and a strong singularity $\mathcal{S}=\{r=0\}$.
  Our construction provides the first examples of black holes with coexisting null and spacelike singularities. These examples hold particular significance in the one-ended case as a model of gravitational collapse, where this phenomenon is conjecturally generic for the Einstein-scalar-field model, even beyond spherical symmetry.</description>

      <title>Sharp Non-uniqueness in Law for Stochastic Differential Equations on the Whole Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the stochastic differential equation on $\mathbb{R}^d,d\geq2$: \begin{align*}
  \dif X_t&amp;=v(t,X_t)\dif t+\sqrt{2} \dif W_t. \end{align*} For any finite collection of initial probability measures $\{\mu^i_0\}_{1\leq i\leq M}$ on $\mathbb{R}^d$ and $\frac{d}{p}+\frac{1}{r}&gt;1$, we construct a divergence-free drift field $v\in L_t^rL^p\cap C_tL^{d-}$ such that the associated SDE admits at least two distinct weak solutions originating from each initial measure $\mu^i_0$. This result is sharp in view of the well-known uniqueness of strong solutions for drifts in $C_tL^{d+}$, as established in \cite{KR05}. As a corollary, there exists a measurable set $A\subset\mathbb{R}^d$ with positive Lebesgue measure such that for any $x\in A$, the SDE with drift $v$ admits at least two weak solutions when with start in $x\in A$. The proof proceeds by constructing two distinct probability solutions to the associated Fokker-Planck equation via a convex integration method adapted to all of $\mathbb{R}^d$ (instead of merely the torus), together with refined heat kernel estimate.</description>

Abstract: We construct a blowing-up solution for the energy critical focusing biharmonic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation in infinite time in dimension $N\geq 13$. Our solution is radially symmetric and converges asymptotically to the sum of two bubbles. The scale of one of the bubble is of order $1$ whereas the other one is of order $|t|^{-\frac{2}{N-12}}$. Moreover, the phase between the two bubbles form a right angle.</description>

      <title>Stable factorization of the Calder\'on problem via the Born approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06321v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we prove the existence of the Born approximation in the context of the radial Calder\'on problem for Schr\"odinger operators. The Born approximation naturally appears as the linear component of a factorization of the Calder\'on problem; we show that the non-linear part, obtaining the potential from the Born approximation, enjoys several interesting properties. First, this map is local, in the sense that knowledge of the Born approximation in a neighborhood of the boundary is equivalent to knowledge of the potential in the same neighborhood, and, second, it is H\"older stable. This proves that the ill-posedness of the Calder\'on problem arises from the linear step, which consists in computing the Born approximation from the DtN map by solving a Hausdorff moment problem. Moreover, we present an effective algorithm to compute the potential from the Born approximation. Finally, we use the Born approximation to obtain a partial characterization of the set of DtN maps for radial potentials. The proofs of these results do not make use of Complex Geometric Optics solutions or its analogues; they are based on results on inverse spectral theory for Schr\"odinger operators on the half-line, in particular on the concept of $A$-amplitude introduced by Barry Simon.</description>

      <title>On anomalous dissipation induced by transport noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03525v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that suitable transport noises produce anomalous dissipation of both enstrophy of solutions to 2D Navier-Stokes equations and of energy of solutions to diffusion equations in all dimensions. The key ingredients are Meyers' type estimates for SPDEs with transport noise, which are combined with recent scaling limits for such SPDEs. The former enables us to establish, for the first time, uniform-in-time convergence in a space of positive smoothness for such scaling limits. Compared to previous work, one of the main novelties is that anomalous dissipation might take place even in the presence of a transport noise of arbitrarily small intensity. Physical interpretations of our results are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Normalized NLS ground states on a double plane hybrid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19810v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the existence and the properties of normalized ground states of a nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation on a quantum hybrid formed by two planes connected at a point. The nonlinearities are of power type and $L^2$-subcritical, while the matching condition between the two planes generates two point interactions of different strengths on each plane, together with a coupling condition between the two planes. We prove that ground states exist for every value of the mass and two different qualitative situations are possible depending on the matching condition: either ground states concentrate on one of the plane only, or ground states distribute on both the planes and are positive, radially symmetric, decreasing and present a logarithmic singularity at the origin of each plane. Moreover, we discuss how the mass distributes on the two planes and compare the strengths of the logarithmic singularities on the two planes when the parameters of the matching condition and the powers of the nonlinear terms vary.</description>

      <title>An explicitly solvable NLS model with discontinuous standing waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03374v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the NLS Equation on the line with a point interaction given by the superposition of an attractive delta potential with a dipole interaction, in the cases of $L^2$-subcritical and $L^2$-critical nonlinearity. For a subcritical nonlinearity we prove the existence and the uniqueness of Ground States at any mass. If the mass exceeds an explicit threshold, then there exists a positive excited state too. For the critical nonlinearity we prove that Ground States exist only in a specific interval of masses, while in a different interval excited states exist. We provide the value of the optimal constant in the Gagliardo-Nirenberg estimate and describe in the dipole case the branches of the stationary states as the strength of the interaction varies. Since all stationary states are explicitly computed, ours is a solvable model involving a non-standard interplay of a nonlinearity with a point interaction.</description>

      <title>Lipschitz stability and reconstruction in inverse problems for semi-discrete parabolic operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01143v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work addresses an inverse problem for a semi-discrete parabolic equation, consisting of identifying the right-hand side of the equation from solution measurements at an intermediate time and within a spatial subdomain. We apply this result to establish a stability estimate for a coefficient inverse problem involving the recovery of a spatially dependent potential function. Furthermore, we present a reconstruction algorithm for recovering this coefficient and provide a proof of its convergence. Our approach relies on a novel semi-discrete Carleman estimate in which the parameter is constrained by the mesh size. Due to the discrete terms arising in the Carleman inequality, this method naturally introduces an error term associated with the solution's initial condition.</description>

Abstract: We consider a 2D non-standard Modica-Mortola type functional. This functional arises from the Ginzburg-Landau theory of type-I superconductors in the case of an infinitely long sample and in the regime of comparable penetration and coherence lengthes. We prove that the functional $\Gamma$-converges to the perimeter functional. This result is a first step in understanding how to extend the results of Conti, Goldman, Otto, Serfaty (2018) to the regime of non vanishing Ginzburg-Landau parameter $\kappa$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01890v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a weighted mixed-norm $L_q(L_p)$-estimates for solutions to fractional evolution equations of the form \[ \partial_t^\alpha w(t,x) = \phi(\Delta) w(t,x) + h(t,x), \quad w(0,\cdot) = w_0, \quad t &gt; 0, \; x \in \mathbb{R}^d, \] where $\partial_t^\alpha$ denotes the Caputo derivative of $\alpha \in (0,1)$ and $\phi(\Delta)$ is a nonlocal operator associated with a Bernstein function $\phi$. For all $p, q \in (1, \infty)$ and $\gamma \in \mathbb{R}$, we prove the estimate \begin{align*} &amp;\left\| \partial_t^\alpha w \right\|_{L_q(0,T,\mu_2dt; H^{\phi,\gamma}_p(\mu_1))} + \left\| \phi(\Delta) w \right\|_{L_q(0,T,\mu_2dt; H^{\phi,\gamma}_p(\mu_1))} \\ &amp;\qquad\leq C \left( \left\| h \right\|_{L_q(0,T,\mu_2dt; H^{\phi,\gamma}_p(\mu_1))} + \left\| w_0 \right\|_{N_{\alpha,p,\phi}} \right), \end{align*} where $\mu_1\in A_p(\mathbb{R}^d)$ and $\mu_2\in A_q(\mathbb{R})$ are Muckenhoupt weights, and $N_{\alpha,p,\phi}$ is a Banach space characterizing admissible initial data. In particular, when $\mu_2\equiv 1$ and $\alpha q&gt;1$, $N_{\alpha,p,\phi}$ coincides with the weighted Besov space $B^{\phi,\gamma+2-\frac{2}{\alpha q}}_{p,q}(\mu_1)$.
  The analysis employs tools from harmonic analysis, including the Fefferman--Stein inequality, Hardy-Littlewood maximal estimates in weighted mixed-norm spaces, and sharp function methods for bounding solution operators. These results extend and unify previous work by K.~H.~Kim et al, providing a general analytic framework for weighted $L_q(L_p)$-theory of time-space nonlocal evolution equations.</description>

      <title>A new critical exponent for semi-linear damped wave equations with the initial data from Sobolev spaces of negative order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07802v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we would like to study the critical exponent for semi-linear damped wave equations with power nonlinearity and the initial data belonging to Sobolev spaces of negative order $\dot{H}_m^{-\gamma}$. Precisely, we obtain a new critical exponent $$p_{\rm c}(m,\gamma,n): = 1 + \frac{2m}{n+m\gamma} $$ for $m \in (1, 2], \,\gamma \in \big[0, \frac{n(m-1)}{m}\big)$ by proving the global (in time) existence of small data Sobolev solutions when $p \geq p_{\rm c}(m,\gamma,n)$ and the blow-up result for weak solutions in finite time even for small data if $1 &lt; p &lt; p_{\rm c}(m,\gamma,n)$. In addition, a novelty of this paper is that the critical value $p= p_{\rm c}(m,\gamma,n)$ belongs to the global existence range. Furthermore, we are going to provide lifespan estimates for solutions when a blow-up phenomenon occurs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13962v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the inverse problem of recovering a degeneracy point within the diffusion coefficient of a one-dimensional complex parabolic equation by observing the normal derivative at one point of the boundary. The strongly degenerate case is analyzed. In particular, we derive sufficient conditions on the initial data that guarantee the stability and uniqueness of the solution obtained from a one-point measurement. Moreover, we present more general uniqueness theorems, which also cover the identification of the initial data, the coefficient of the zero order term and the degeneracy power, using measurements taken over time. Our method is based on a careful analysis of the spectral problem and relies on an explicit form of the solution in terms of Bessel functions. Our investigation also covers the case of real 1-D degenerate parabolic systems of equations coupled with a specific structure. Theoretical results are also supported by numerical simulations.</description>

Abstract: We study the global existence of solutions to a class of nonlocal Geirer-Meinhardt system. This is a two component reaction-diffusion model on a bounded domain in $\mathbb{R}^n$, $n \ge 1$, with nonlocal diffusion given by a nonlocal convolution operator. We have used semigroup theory and derive estimate to guarantee global existence. Then we build an $L^b$ functional to bound our solution independent of the nonlocal convolution kernel for $2 \le b &lt; \infty$. Next, we have used this result to obtain a diffusive limit similar to \cite{laurenccot2023nonlocal} for our model. We also numerically simulate our model to show the formation of patterns by this model and compare the results with the patterns with the traditional local/classical Geirer-Meinhardt model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03408v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the inverse problem of recovering an initial source for the wave equation with fractional attenuation, motivated by photoacoustic tomography (PAT). The attenuation is modeled by a Caputo fractional derivative of order $\alpha\in(0,1)$. We establish uniqueness under a geometric foliation condition via an adaptation of two types of Carleman estimates to the fractional setting, prove stability through continuity inequalities for fractional time-derivatives of wave solutions, and derive a reconstruction scheme based on a Neumann series. While our results apply directly to PAT, we expect that the analytic approach and tools employed might be of broader relevance to the analysis of PDEs with memory effects and to inverse problems for attenuated wave models.</description>

      <title>Non-uniqueness in Mean Curvature Flow: Non-canonical solutions via the parabolic Allen--Cahn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06979v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When mean curvature flow evolves non-uniquely, the flow is said to fatten. The work of Ilmanen shows that any weak MCF is supported inside the fattening, and work of Hershkovits--White identified canonical weak flows supported on the boundary of the fattening, known as the outermost flows. It is natural to ask, when the flow fattens, are there weak mean curvature flows supported strictly inside the fattening? Outside of some special cases (e.g. flow from cones), this question was entirely open. We show these interior flows exist, providing a general construction for non-outermost flows as limits of solutions to the parabolic $\varepsilon$-Allen--Cahn. This gives the first examples of closed, non-trivial, non-canonical, integral Brakke motions. As part of this construction, we study the $\varepsilon$-Allen--Cahn flow from low regularity initial data, and our results demonstrate the existence of integral Brakke motions from fractal sets. This includes the existence portion of Hershkovits's work on mean curvature flow from Reifenberg sets.</description>

      <title>Growth and nodal current of complexified horocycle eigenfunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.08244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.08244v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study horocycle eigenfunctions at Lobachevsky plane. They are functions $u\colon \mathbb H=\mathbb C^+=\{z\in\mathbb C\colon \Im z&gt;0\}\to\mathbb C$ such that $\left(-y^2\left(\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}+\frac{\partial^2}{\partial y^2}\right)+ 2i\tau y\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\right)u(x+iy)=s^2 u(x+iy)$, $x+iy\in\mathbb C^+$, with $\tau,s\in\mathbb R$, $\tau$ large and $s/\tau$ small. In other words, we study eigenfunctions of magnetic quantum Hamiltonian on hyperbolic plane. By Bohr semiclassical correspondence principle, the asymptotic behavior of such functions is related to horocycle flow on $T\mathbb H$. Let $u^{\mathbb C}$ be analytic continuation of function $u$ to Grauert tube; the latter is an open neighbourhood of $\mathbb H$ in the complexified Lobachevsky plane $\mathbb H^{\mathbb C}$. If a sequence of horocycle functions possesses microlocal quantum ergodicity at the admissible energy level (with $\hbar=1/\tau$) then we may find asymptotic distribution of divisor of $u^{\mathbb C}$. This is done by establishing the asymptotic estimates on $|u^{\mathbb C}|$ in $\mathbb H^{\mathbb C}$. Under imaginary-time horocycle flow, microlocalization of $u$ in $T^*\mathbb H$ is taken to localization of $u^{\mathbb C}$ on $\mathbb H^{\mathbb C}$. The growth of functions $u^{\mathbb C}$ as $\tau\to\infty$ turns to be governed by the growth of complexified gauge factor occurring in $\tau$-automorphic kernels for functions on $\mathbb H$.</description>

      <title>Cohomology for Linearized Boundary-Value Problems on General Riemannian Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18494v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a framework for casting the solvability and uniqueness conditions of linearized geometric boundary-value problems in cohomological terms. The theory is designed to be applicable without assumptions on the underlying geometric structure and provides tools to study the emergent cohomology explicitly. To achieve this generality, we extend Hodge theory to sequences of Douglas--Nirenberg systems that interact via Green's formulae, overdetermined ellipticity, and a condition we call the order-reduction property, replacing the classical requirement that the sequence form a cochain complex. This property typically arises from linearized symmetries and constraints, as demonstrated in several examples, including exterior covariant derivatives, linearized prescribed Riemann curvature, and linearized Einstein equations with sources.</description>
