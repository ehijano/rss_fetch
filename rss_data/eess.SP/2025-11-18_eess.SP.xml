      <title>Inverted C-Shaped Slots Loaded Exponential Tapered Triple Band Notched Ultra Wideband (UWB) Antenna</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research presents a simple strategy for designing an exponentially tapered, triple-notched ultrawideband antenna. The antenna's microstrip line feed and radiating patch are matched using an exponential tapered transformer. This method inserts antenna notch elements, by cutting two inverted C-shaped slots in the radiating patch; frequency rejection can be achieved for WI-MAX and wireless LAN. The X-band is rejected by etching a U-shaped slot in the feedline. When embedding the notch elements, cross-coupling was minimized. The desired antenna was designed, simulated, and measured. The measured results and graphs show that our proposed design is reliable. This band notched antenna rejects 3.5 GHz (Wi-MAX band, 3.3 to 3.7 GHz), 5.5 GHz (WLAN 2 band, 5.15 to 5.825 GHz), and 7.5 GHz (for satellite downlink X - band-7.25 GHz to 7.75 GHz). The proposed antenna meets UWB design requirements.</description>

      <title>AI-Open-RAN for Non-Terrestrial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose the concept of AIO-RAN-NTN, a unified all-in-one Radio Access Network (RAN) for Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTNs), built on an open architecture that leverages open interfaces and artificial intelligence (AI)-based functionalities. This approach advances interoperability, flexibility, and intelligence in next-generation telecommunications. First, we provide a concise overview of the state-of-the-art architectures for Open-RAN and AI-RAN, highlighting key network functions and infrastructure elements. Next, we introduce our integrated AIO-RAN-NTN blueprint, emphasizing how internal and air interfaces from AIO-RAN and the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) can be applied to emerging environments such as NTNs. To examine the impact of mobility on AIO-RAN, we implement a testbed transmission using the OpenAirInterface platform for a standalone (SA) New Radio (NR) 5G system. We then train an AI model on realistic data to forecast key performance indicators (KPIs). Our experiments demonstrate that the AIO-based SA architecture is sensitive to mobility, even at low speeds, but this limitation can be mitigated through AI-driven KPI forecasting.</description>

      <title>Temporal Micro-Doppler Spectrogram-based ViT Multiclass Target Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new Temporal MDS-Vision Transformer (T-MDS-ViT) for multiclass target classification using millimeter-wave FMCW radar micro-Doppler spectrograms. Specifically, we design a transformer-based architecture that processes stacked range-velocity-angle (RVA) spatiotemporal tensors via patch embeddings and cross-axis attention mechanisms to explicitly model the sequential nature of MDS data across multiple frames. The T-MDS-ViT exploits mobility-aware constraints in its attention layer correspondences to maintain separability under target overlaps and partial occlusions. Next, we apply an explainable mechanism to examine how the attention layers focus on characteristic high-energy regions of the MDS representations and their effect on class-specific kinematic features. We also demonstrate that our proposed framework is superior to existing CNN-based methods in terms of classification accuracy while achieving better data efficiency and real-time deployability.</description>

      <title>Resource Allocation for Transmissive RIS Transceiver Enabled SWIPT Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel transmissive reconfigurable intelligent surface (TRIS) transceiver-empowered simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) framework is proposed. The sum-rate of the information decoding (ID) users is maximized by optimizing the TRIS transceiver's beamforming, subject to the energy harvesting (EH) users' quality-of-harvest and the per-antenna power constraints. To solve this non-convex problem, we develop an efficient optimization algorithm. First, the original problem is reformulated as a semi-definite programming (SDP) problem. The resulting SDP problem is then addressed using successive convex approximation (SCA) combined with a penalty-based method. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm.</description>

      <title>Beamforming for Transmissive RIS Transmitter Enabled Simultaneous Wireless Information and Power Transfer Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates a novel transmissive reconfigurable intelligent surface (TRIS) transceiver-empowered simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) system with multiple information decoding (ID) and energy harvesting (EH) users. Under the considered system model, we formulate an optimization problem that maximizes the sum-rate of all ID users via the design of the TRIS transceiver's active beamforming. The design is constrained by per-antenna power limits at the TRIS transceiver and by the minimum harvested energy demand of all EH users. Due to the non-convexity of the objective function and the energy harvesting constraint, the sum-rate problem is difficult to tackle. To solve this challenging optimization problem, by leveraging the weighted minimum mean squared error (WMMSE) framework and the majorization-minimization (MM) method, we propose a second-order cone programming (SOCP)-based algorithm. Per-element power constraints introduce a large number of constraints, making the problem considerably more difficult. By applying the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) method, we successfully develop an analytical, computationally efficient, and highly parallelizable algorithm to address this challenge. Numerical results are provided to validate the convergence and effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. Furthermore, the low-complexity algorithm significantly reduces computational complexity without performance degradation.</description>

      <title>MUSTEM: A Dual-Modality System for Vibrotactile and Visual Translation of Music as an Assistive Technology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emotional and structural experience of music remains a significant accessibility challenge for the deaf and hard of hearing community. This paper introduces MUSTEM (Multisensorial Emotional Translation), a novel system designed to translate music into a rich, coherent, and scientifically-grounded sensory experience. We present a dual-modality approach addressing this challenge through two interconnected components. First, a low-cost, portable hardware prototype that performs real-time audio analysis, mapping distinct frequency bands (sub-bass, bass, mid-range, treble) to a four-channel vibrotactile system, allowing users to feel the music's rhythmic and foundational structure. Second, to overcome the processing limitations of embedded hardware, we developed a high-fidelity software simulation that demonstrates the full potential of the visual translation. This assistive dashboard decodes musical components - such as rhythm, harmony, and frequency spectrum - into an intuitive and educational visual interface. MUSTEM offers a comprehensive framework for sensory substitution, presenting a viable and accessible pathway for the deaf community to experience music not just as vibration, but as a structured, substantiated and emotionally resonant visual and tactile language. Preliminary feedback from seven deaf users suggests the system's spatial vibrotactile mapping is perceptible and engaging. All source code and hardware designs are released as open-source. Video demonstrations and open-source code are available on the project's official channel.</description>

      <title>Near-Real-Time InSAR Phase Estimation for Large-Scale Surface Displacement Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Operational near-real-time monitoring of Earth's surface deformation using Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) requires processing algorithms that efficiently incorporate new acquisitions without reprocessing historical archives. We present sequential phase linking approach using compressed single-look-complex images (SLCs) capable of producing surface displacement estimates within hours of the time of a new acquisition. Our key algorithmic contribution is a mini-stack reference scheme that maintains phase consistency across processing batches without adjusting or re-estimating previous time steps, enabling straightforward operational deployment. We introduce online methods for persistent and distributed scatterer identification that adapt to temporal changes in surface properties through incremental amplitude statistics updates. The processing chain incorporates multiple complementary metrics for pixel quality that are reliable for small SLC stack sizes, and an L1-norm network inversion to limit propagation of unwrapping errors across the time series. We use our algorithm to produce OPERA Surface Displacement from Sentinel-1 product, the first continental-scale surface displacement product over North America. Validation against GPS measurements and InSAR residual analysis demonstrates millimeter-level agreement in velocity estimates in varying environmental conditions. We demonstrate our algorithm's capabilities with a successful recovery of meter-scale co-eruptive displacement at Kilauea volcano during the 2018 eruption, as well as detection of subtle uplift at Three Sisters volcano, Oregon- a challenging environment for C-band InSAR due to dense vegetation and seasonal snow. We have made all software available as open source libraries, providing a significant advancement to the open scientific community's ability to process large InSAR data sets in a cloud environment.</description>

      <title>Informed Bootstrap Augmentation Improves EEG Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) offers detailed access to neural dynamics but remains constrained by noise and trial-by-trial variability, limiting decoding performance in data-restricted or complex paradigms. Data augmentation is often employed to enhance feature representations, yet conventional uniform averaging overlooks differences in trial informativeness and can degrade representational quality. We introduce a weighted bootstrapping approach that prioritizes more reliable trials to generate higher-quality augmented samples. In a Sentence Evaluation paradigm, weights were computed from relative ERP differences and applied during probabilistic sampling and averaging. Across conditions, weighted bootstrapping improved decoding accuracy relative to unweighted (from 68.35% to 71.25% at best), demonstrating that emphasizing reliable trials strengthens representational quality. The results demonstrate that reliability-based augmentation yields more robust and discriminative EEG representations. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/lyricists/NeuroBootstrap.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Learning Aided Simultaneous Sparse Estimation of Dual-Wideband THz Channels in Multi-User Hybrid MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work conceives the Bayesian Group-Sparse Regression (BGSR) for the estimation of a spatial and frequency wideband, i.e., a dual wideband channel in Multi-User (MU) THz hybrid MIMO scenarios. We develop a practical dual wideband THz channel model that incorporates absorption losses, reflection losses, diffused ray modeling and angles of arrival/departure (AoAs/AoDs) using a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). Furthermore, a low-resolution analog-to-digital converter (ADC) is employed at each RF chain, which is crucial for wideband THz massive MIMO systems to reduce power consumption and hardware complexity, given the high sampling rates and large number of antennas involved. The quantized MU THz MIMO model is linearized using the popular Bussgang decomposition followed by BGSR based channel learning framework that results in sparsity across different subcarriers, where each subcarrier has its unique dictionary matrix. Next, the Bayesian Cram\'er Rao Bound (BCRB) is devised for bounding the normalized mean square error (NMSE) performance. Extensive simulations were performed to assess the performance improvements achieved by the proposed BGSR method compared to other sparse estimation techniques. The metrics considered for quantifying the performance improvements include the NMSE and bit error rate (BER).</description>

      <title>A 24-GHz CMOS Transformer-Based Three-Tline Series Doherty Power Amplifier Achieving 39% PAE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a transformer-based three- transmission-line (Tline) series Doherty power amplifier (PA) implemented in 65-nm CMOS, targeting broadband K/Ka-band applications. By integrating an impedance-scaling network into the output matching structure, the design enables effective load modulation and reduced impedance transformation ratio (ITR) at power back-off when employing stacked cascode transistors. The PA demonstrates a -3-dB small-signal gain bandwidth from 22 to 32.5 GHz, a saturated output power (Psat) of 21.6 dBm, and a peak power-added efficiency (PAE) of 39%. At 6dB back-off, the PAE remains above 24%, validating its suitability for high- efficiency mm-wave phased-array transmitters in next-generation wireless systems.</description>

      <title>A Linear Implementation of an Analog Resonate-and-Fire Neuron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Oscillatory dynamics have recently proven highly effective in machine learning (ML), particularly through State-Space-Models (SSM) that leverage structured linear recurrences for long-range temporal processing. Resonate-and-Fire neurons capture such oscillatory behavior in a spiking framework, offering strong expressivity with sparse event-based communication. While early analog RAF circuits employed nonlinear coupling and suffered from process sensitivity, modern ML practice favors linear recurrence. In this work, we introduce a resonate-and-fire (RAF) neuron, built in 22nm Fully-Depleted Silicon-on-Insulator technology, that aligns with SSM principles while retaining the efficiency of spike-based communication. We analyze its dynamics, linearity, and resilience to Process, Voltage, and Temperature variations, and evaluate its power, performance, and area trade-offs. We map the characteristics of our circuit into a system-level simulation where our RAF neuron is utilized in a keyword-spotting task, showing that its non-idealities do not hinder performance. Our results establish RAF neurons as robust, energy-efficient computational primitives for neuromorphic hardware.</description>

      <title>ISAC with Affine Frequency Division Multiplexing: An FMCW-Based Signal Processing Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the sensing potential of affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) in high-mobility integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) from the perspective of radar waveforms. We introduce an innovative parameter selection criterion that establishes a precise mathematical equivalence between AFDM subcarriers and Nyquist-sampled frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW). This connection not only provides a clear physical insight into AFDM's sensing mechanism but also enables a direct mapping from the DAFT index to delay-Doppler (DD) parameters of wireless channels. Building on this, we develop a novel input-output model in a DD-parameterized DAFT (DD-DAFT) domain for AFDM, which explicitly reveals the inherent DD coupling effect arising from the chirp-channel interaction. Subsequently, we design two matched-filtering sensing algorithms. The first is performed in the time-frequency domain with low complexity, while the second is operated in the DD-DAFT domain to precisely resolve the DD coupling. Simulations show that our algorithms achieve effective pilot-free sensing and demonstrate a fundamental trade-off between sensing performance, communication overhead, and computational complexity. The proposed AFDM outperforms classical AFDM and other variants in most scenarios.</description>

      <title>Toward ISAC-empowered subnetworks: Cooperative localization and iterative node selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper tackles the sensing-communication trade-off in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC)-empowered subnetworks for mono-static target localization. We propose a low-complexity iterative node selection algorithm that exploits the spatial diversity of subnetwork deployments and dynamically refines the set of sensing subnetworks to maximize localization accuracy under tight resource constraints. Simulation results show that our method achieves sub-7 cm accuracy in additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels within only three iterations, yielding over 97% improvement compared to the best-performing benchmark under the same sensing budget. We further demonstrate that increasing spatial diversity through additional antennas and subnetworks enhances sensing robustness, especially in fading channels. Finally, we quantify the sensing-communication trade-off, showing that reducing sensing iterations and the number of sensing subnetworks improves throughput at the cost of reduced localization precision.</description>

      <title>Cross-Layer Design for Near-Field mmWave Beam Management and Scheduling under Delay-Sensitive Traffic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Next-generation wireless networks will rely on mmWave/sub-THz spectrum and extremely large antenna arrays (ELAAs). This will push their operation into the near field where far-field beam management degrades and beam training becomes more costly and must be done more frequently. Because ELAA training and data transmission consume energy and training trades off with service time, we pose a cross-layer control problem that couples PHY-layer beam management with MAC-layer service under delay-sensitive traffic. The controller decides when to retrain and how aggressively to train (pilot count and sparsity) while allocating transmit power, explicitly balancing pilot overhead, data-phase rate, and energy to reduce the queueing delay of MAC-layer frames/packets to be transmitted. We model the problem as a partially observable Markov decision process and solve it with deep reinforcement learning. In simulations with a realistic near-field channel and varying mobility and traffic load, the learned policy outperforms strong 5G-NR--style baselines at a comparable energy: it achieves 85.5% higher throughput than DFT sweeping and reduces the overflow rate by 78%. These results indicate a practical path to overhead-aware, traffic-adaptive near-field beam management with implications for emerging low-latency, high-rate next-generation applications such as digital twin, spatial computing, and immersive communication.</description>

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals are often degraded by various noise sources such as baseline wander, motion artifacts, and electromyographic interference, posing a major challenge in clinical settings. This paper presents a lightweight deep learning-based denoising framework, forming a compact autoencoder architecture. The model was trained under severe noise conditions (-5 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)) using a rigorously partitioned dataset to ensure no data leakage and robust generalization. Extensive evaluations were conducted across seven noise configurations and three SNR levels (-5 dB, 0 dB, and +5 dB), showing consistent denoising performance with minimal morphological distortion, critical for maintaining diagnostic integrity. In particular, tests on clinically vital rhythms such as ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF) confirm that the proposed model effectively suppresses noise without altering arrhythmic features essential for diagnosis. Visual and quantitative assessments, including SNR improvement, RMSE, and correlation metrics, validate the model's efficacy in preserving waveform fidelity. To demonstrate real-world applicability, the model was deployed on a Raspberry Pi 4 using TensorFlow Lite with float16 precision. Inference latency was measured at just 1.41 seconds per 14-second ECG segment, indicating feasibility for near-real-time use in edge devices. Overall, this study introduces a lightweight, hardware-validated, and morphologically reliable ECG denoising solution suitable for integration into portable or wearable healthcare systems.</description>

      <title>Robust Radar HRRP Recognition under Non-uniform Jamming Based on Complex-valued Frequency Attention Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex electromagnetic environments, often containing multiple jammers with different jamming patterns, produce non-uniform jamming power across the frequency spectrum. This spectral non-uniformity directly induces severe distortion in the target's HRRP, consequently compromising the performance and reliability of conventional HRRP-based target recognition methods. This paper proposes a novel, end-to-end trained network for robust radar target recognition. The core of our model is a CFA module that operates directly on the complex spectrum of the received echo. The CFA module learns to generate an adaptive frequency-domain filter, assigning lower weights to bands corrupted by strong jamming while preserving critical target information in cleaner bands. The filtered spectrum is then fed into a classifier backbone for recognition. Experimental results on simulated HRRP data with various jamming combinations demonstrate our method's superiority. Notably, under severe jamming conditions, our model achieves a recognition accuracy nearly 9% higher than traditional model-based approaches, all while introducing negligible computational overhead. This highlights its exceptional performance and robustness in challenging jamming environments.</description>

      <title>A mixed-signal analogue front-end for brain-implantable neural interfaces using a digital fixed-point IIR filter and bulk offset cancellation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advances in miniaturised implantable neural electronics have paved the way for therapeutic brain-computer interfaces with clinical potential for movement disorders, epilepsy, and broader neurological applications. This paper presents a mixed-signal analogue front end (AFE) designed to record both extracellular action potentials (EAPs) and local field potentials (LFPs). The feedforward path integrates a low-noise amplifier (LNA) and a successive-approximation-register (SAR) analogue-to-digital converter (ADC), while the feedback path employs a fixed-point infinite-impulse-response (IIR) Chebyshev Type II low-pass filter to suppress sub-mHz components via bulk-voltage control of the LNA input differential pair using two R-2R pseudo-resistor digital-to-analogue converters (DACs). The proposed AFE achieves up to 41.42dB gain, consumes 2.178uA per channel, occupies 0.198mm2 per channel, and supports neural signal monitoring from 0.1Hz to 10kHz with 3.59uVrms input-referred integrated noise.</description>

      <title>Near Field Tapering with Slepian Window: Balancing the Range Angle Sidelobe Trade off</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Near-field beamforming enables target discrimination in both range (axial) and angle (lateral) dimensions. Elevated sidelobes along either dimension, however, increase susceptibility to interference and degrade detection performance. Conventional amplitude tapering techniques, designed for far-field scenarios, cannot simultaneously suppress axial and lateral sidelobes in near-field. In this letter, we propose a Slepian-based amplitude tapering approach that maximizes mainlobe energy concentration, achieving significant sidelobe reduction in both dimensions. Numerical results show that the proposed taper improves peak sidelobe suppression by approximately 24 dB in the lateral domain and 10 dB in the axial domain compared to a conventional uniform window.</description>

      <title>Uniform Circular Arrays in Near-Field: Omnidirectional Coverage with Limited Capacity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies suggest that uniform circular arrays (UCAs) can extend the angular coverage of the radiative near field region. This work investigates whether such enhanced angular coverage translates into improved spatial multiplexing performance when compared to uniform linear arrays (ULAs). To more accurately delineate the effective near field region, we introduce the effective beamfocusing Rayleigh distance (EBRD), an angle dependent metric that bounds the spatial region where beamfocusing remains effective. Closed form expressions for both beamdepth and EBRD are derived for UCAs. Our analysis shows that, under a fixed antenna element count, ULAs achieve narrower beamdepth and a longer EBRD than UCAs. Conversely, under a fixed aperture length, UCAs provide slightly narrower beamdepth and a marginally longer EBRD. Simulation results further confirm that ULAs achieve higher sum rate under the fixed element constraint, while UCAs offer marginal performance gain under the fixed aperture constraint.</description>

      <title>Distributed Multisensor ISAC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC) will become a service in future mobile communication networks. It enables the detection and recognition of passive objects and environments using radar-like sensing. The ultimate advantage is the reuse of the mobile network and radio access resources for scene illumination, sensing, data transportation, computation, and fusion. It enables building a distributed, ubiquitous sensing network that can be adapted for a variety of radio sensing tasks and services.
  In this article, we develop the principles of multi-sensor ISAC (MS-ISAC). MS-ISAC corresponds to multi-user MIMO communication, which in radar terminology is known as distributed MIMO radar. \ First, we develop basic architectural principles for MS-ISAC and link them to example use cases. We then propose a generic MS-ISAC architecture. After a brief reference to multipath propagation and multistatic target reflectivity issues, we outline multilink access, coordination, precoding and link adaptation schemes for MS-ISAC. Moreover, we review model-based estimation and tracking of delay~/~Doppler from sparse OFDMA~/~TDMA frames. We emphasize Cooperative Passive Coherent Location (CPCL) for bistatic correlation and synchronization. Finally, issues of multisensor node synchronization and distributed data fusion are addressed.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Sensing UAV for Accurate Multi-User Identification and Localization in Cellular Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an autonomous sensing frame- work for identifying and localizing multiple users in Fifth Generation (5G) networks using an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) that is not part of the serving access network. Unlike conventional aerial serving nodes, the proposed UAV operates passively and is dedicated solely to sensing. It captures Uplink (UL) Sounding Reference Signals (SRS), and requires virtually no coordination with the network infrastructure. A complete signal processing chain is proposed and developed, encompassing synchronization, user identification, and localization, all executed onboard UAV during flight. The system autonomously plans and adapts its mission workflow to estimate multiple user positions within a single deployment, integrating flight control with real-time sensing. Extensive simulations and a full-scale low- altitude experimental campaign validate the approach, showing localization errors below 3 m in rural field tests and below 8 m in urban simulation scenarios, while reliably identifying each user. The results confirm the feasibility of infrastructure-independent sensing UAVs as a core element of the emerging Low Altitude Economy (LAE), supporting situational awareness and rapid deployment in emergency or connectivity-limited environments.</description>

      <title>Pinching-Antenna-Enabled Cognitive Radio Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates a pinching-antenna (PA)-enabled cognitive radio network, where both the primary transmitter (PT) and secondary transmitter (ST) are equipped with a single waveguide and multiple PAs to facilitate simultaneous spectrum sharing. Under a general Ricean fading channel model, a closed-form analytical expression for the average spectral efficiency (SE) achieved by PAs is first derived. Based on this, a sum-SE maximization problem is formulated to jointly optimize the primary and secondary pinching beamforming, subject to system constraints on the transmission power budgets, minimum antenna separation requirements, and feasible PA deployment regions. To address this non-convex problem, a three-stage optimization algorithm is developed to sequentially optimize both the PT and ST pinching beamforming, and the ST power control. For the PT and ST pinching beamforming optimization, the coarse positions of PA are first determined at the waveguide-level. Then, wavelength-level refinements achieve constructive signal combination at the intended user and destructive superposition at the unintended user. For the ST power control, a closed-form solution is derived. Simulation results demonstrate that i) PAs can achieve significant SE improvements over conventional fixed-position antennas; ii) the proposed pinching beamforming design achieves effective interference suppression and superior performance for both even and odd numbers of PAs; and iii) the developed three-stage optimization algorithm enables nearly orthogonal transmission between the primary and secondary networks.</description>

      <title>Sensing-enabled Secure Rotatable Array System Enhanced by Multi-Layer Transmitting RIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Programmable metasurfaces and adjustable antennas are promising technologies. The security of a rotatable array system is investigated in this paper. A dual-base-station (BS) architecture is adopted, in which the BSs collaboratively perform integrated sensing of the eavesdropper (the target) and communication tasks. To address the security challenge when the sensing target is located on the main communication link, the problem of maximizing the secrecy rate (SR) under sensing signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio requirements and discrete constraints is formulated. This problem involves the joint optimization of the array pose, the antenna distribution on the array surface, the multi-layer transmitting RIS phase matrices, and the beamforming matrices, which is non-convex. To solve this challenge, an two-stage online algorithm based on the generalized Rayleigh quotient and an offline algorithm based on the Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient are proposed. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. Compared to conventional schemes without array pose adjustment, the proposed approach achieves approximately 22\% improvement in SR. Furthermore, array rotation provides higher performance gains than position changes.</description>

      <title>Weyl-Heisenberg Transform Capabilities in JPEG Compression Standard</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the development and research of a new compression technology based on Weyl-Heisenberg bases (WH-technology) for modifying the JPEG compression standard and improving its characteristics. For this purpose, the paper analyzes the main stages of the JPEG compression algorithm, notes its key features and problems that limit further enhancement of its efficiency. To overcome these limitations, it is proposed to use the real version of the two-dimensional discrete orthogonal Weyl-Heisenberg transform (DWHT) instead of the discrete cosine transform (DCT) at the stage of transformation coding. This transformation, unlike DCT, initially has a block structure and is built on the basis of the Weyl-Heisenberg optimal signal basis, the functions of which are orthogonal and well localized both in the frequency and time domains. This feature of DWHT allows for more efficient decorrelation and compression of element values in each block of the image after transformation coding. As a result, it is possible to obtain more efficient selection and screening of insignificant elements at the subsequent stages of quantization and information coding. Based on DWHT, a new version of the JPEG compression algorithm was developed, and convenient criteria for evaluating the compression efficiency and metrics of quality losses were proposed. The results of an experimental study are presented, confirming the higher compression efficiency of the proposed algorithm in comparison with the JPEG compression standard.</description>

      <title>Learning the relative composition of EEG signals using pairwise relative shift pretraining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) offers a promising approach for learning electroencephalography (EEG) representations from unlabeled data, reducing the need for expensive annotations for clinical applications like sleep staging and seizure detection. While current EEG SSL methods predominantly use masked reconstruction strategies like masked autoencoders (MAE) that capture local temporal patterns, position prediction pretraining remains underexplored despite its potential to learn long-range dependencies in neural signals. We introduce PAirwise Relative Shift or PARS pretraining, a novel pretext task that predicts relative temporal shifts between randomly sampled EEG window pairs. Unlike reconstruction-based methods that focus on local pattern recovery, PARS encourages encoders to capture relative temporal composition and long-range dependencies inherent in neural signals. Through comprehensive evaluation on various EEG decoding tasks, we demonstrate that PARS-pretrained transformers consistently outperform existing pretraining strategies in label-efficient and transfer learning settings, establishing a new paradigm for self-supervised EEG representation learning.</description>

      <title>A digital SRAM-based compute-in-memory macro for weight-stationary dynamic matrix multiplication in Transformer attention score computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compute-in-memory (CIM) techniques are widely employed in energy-efficient artificial intelligent (AI) processors. They alleviate power and latency bottlenecks caused by extensive data movements between compute and storage units. This work proposes a digital CIM macro to compute Transformer attention. To mitigate dynamic matrix multiplication that is unsuitable for the common weight-stationary CIM paradigm, we reformulate the attention score computation process based on a combined QK-weight matrix, so that inputs can be directly fed to CIM cells to obtain the score results. Moreover, the involved binomial matrix multiplication operation is decomposed into 4 groups of bit-serial shifting and additions, without costly physical multipliers in the CIM. We maximize the energy efficiency of the CIM circuit through zero-value bit-skipping, data-driven word line activation, read-write separate 6T cells and bit-alternating 14T/28T adders. The proposed CIM macro was implemented using a 65-nm process. It occupied only 0.35 mm2 area, and delivered a 42.27 GOPS peak performance with 1.24 mW power consumption at a 1.0 V power supply and a 100 MHz clock frequency, resulting in 34.1 TOPS/W energy efficiency and 120.77 GOPS/mm2 area efficiency. When compared to the CPU and GPU, our CIM macro is 25x and 13x more energy efficient on practical tasks, respectively. Compared with other Transformer-CIMs, our design exhibits at least 7x energy efficiency and at least 2x area efficiency improvements when scaled to the same technology node, showcasing its potential for edge-side intelligent applications.</description>

      <title>Chicken Swarm Kernel Particle Filter: A Structured Rejuvenation Approach with KLD-Efficient Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Particle filters (PFs) are often combined with swarm intelligence (SI) algorithms, such as Chicken Swarm Optimization (CSO), for particle rejuvenation. Separately, Kullback--Leibler divergence (KLD) sampling is a common strategy for adaptively sizing the particle set. However, the theoretical interaction between SI-based rejuvenation kernels and KLD-based adaptive sampling is not yet fully understood.
  This paper investigates this specific interaction. We analyze, under a simplified modeling framework, the effect of the CSO rejuvenation step on the particle set distribution. We propose that the fitness-driven updates inherent in CSO can be approximated as a form of mean-square contraction. This contraction tends to produce a particle distribution that is more concentrated than that of a baseline PF, or in mathematical terms, a distribution that is plausibly more ``peaked'' in a majorization sense.
  By applying Karamata's inequality to the concave function that governs the expected bin occupancy in KLD-sampling, our analysis suggests a connection: under the stated assumptions, the CSO-enhanced PF (CPF) is expected to require a lower \emph{expected} particle count than the standard PF to satisfy the same statistical error bound. The goal of this study is not to provide a fully general proof, but rather to offer a tractable theoretical framework that helps to interpret the computational efficiency empirically observed when combining these techniques, and to provide a starting point for designing more efficient adaptive filters.</description>

      <title>Design of A Low-Latency and Parallelizable SVD Dataflow Architecture on FPGA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.12461v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Singular value decomposition (SVD) is widely used for dimensionality reduction and noise suppression, and it plays a pivotal role in numerous scientific and engineering applications. As the dimensions of the matrix grow rapidly, the computational cost increases significantly, posing a serious challenge to the efficiency of data analysis and signal processing systems,especially in time-sensitive scenarios with large-scale datasets. Although various dedicated hardware architectures have been proposed to accelerate the computation of intensive SVD, many of these designs suffer from limited scalability and high consumption of on-chip memory resources. Moreover, they typically overlook the computational and data transfer challenges associated with SVD, enabling them unsuitable for real-time processing of large-scale data stream matrices in embedded systems. In this express, we propose a Data Stream-Based SVD processing algorithm (DSB Jacobi), which significantly reduces on-chip BRAM usage while improving computational speed, offering a practical solution for real-time SVD computation of large-scale data streams. Compared with previous works, our experimental results indicate that the proposed method reduces on-chip RAM consumption by 41.5 percent and improves computational efficiency by 23 times.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Review of Advancements in Powering and Charging Systems for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) or drones have witnessed a spectacular surge in applications for military, commercial, and civilian purposes. However, their potential for flight is always limited by the finite power budget of their onboard power supplies. The limited flight time problem has led to intensive research into new sources of power and innovative charging strategies to enable protracted, autonomous flight. This paper gives a comparative summary of the current state-of-the-art in UAV power and refuelling technology. The paper begins with an analysis of the variety of energy sources, from classical batteries to fuel cells and hybrid systems, based on their relative advantages and disadvantages in energy density, weight, and safety. Subsequently, the review explores a spectrum of replenishment options, from simple manual battery swapping to sophisticated high-tech automatic docking stations and smart contact-based charging pads. Most of the review is dedicated to the newer technology of wireless power transfer, which involves near-field (inductive, capacitive) and far-field (laser, microwave) technology. The article also delves into the most important power electronic converter topologies, battery management systems, and control approaches that form the core of these charging systems. Finally, it recapitulates the most significant challenges in technical, economic, and social aspects for promising avenues of future research.

      <title>Joint Transmit Beamforming and Reflection Optimization for Beyond Diagonal RIS Aided Multi-Cell MIMO Communication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks will rely on ultra-dense multi-cell deployment to meet the high rate and connectivity demands. However, frequency reuse leads to severe inter-cell interference, particularly for cell-edge users, which limits the communication performance. To overcome this challenge, we investigate a beyond diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS) aided multi-cell multi-user downlink MIMO communication system, where a BD-RIS is deployed to enhance desired signals and suppress both intra-cell and inter-cell interference.We formulate the joint optimization problem of the transmit beamforming matrices at the BSs and the BD-RIS reflection matrix to maximize the weighted sum rate of all users, subject to the challenging unitary constraint of the BD-RIS reflection matrix and transmit power constraints at the BSs. To tackle this non-convex and difficult problem, we apply the weighted minimum mean squared error (WMMSE) method to transform the problem into an equivalent tractable form, and propose an efficient alternating optimization (AO) based algorithm to iteratively update the transmit beamforming and BD-RIS reflection using Lagrange duality theory and manifold optimization. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed design over various benchmark schemes, and provide useful practical insights on the BD-RIS deployment strategy for multi-cell systems.</description>

      <title>PDRs4All XX. Haute Couture: Spectral stitching of JWST MIRI-IFU cubes with matrix completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: MIRI is the imager and spectrograph covering wavelengths from $4.9$ to $27.9$ $\mu$m onboard the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). The Medium-Resolution Spectrometer (MRS) consists of four integral field units (IFU), each of which has three sub-channels. The twelve resulting spectral data cubes have different fields of view, spatial, and spectral resolutions. The wavelength range of each cube partially overlaps with the neighboring bands, and the overlap regions typically show flux mismatches which have to be corrected by spectral stitching methods. Stitching methods aim to produce a single data cube incorporating the data of the individual sub-channels, which requires matching the spatial resolution and the flux discrepancies. We present Haute Couture, a novel stitching algorithm which uses non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) to perform a matrix completion, where the available MRS data cubes are treated as twelve sub-matrices of a larger incomplete matrix. Prior to matrix completion, we also introduce a novel pre-processing to homogenize the global intensities of the twelve cubes. Our pre-processing consists in jointly optimizing a set of global scale parameters that maximize the fit between the cubes where spectral overlap occurs. We apply our novel stitching method to JWST data obtained as part of the PDRs4All observing program of the Orion Bar, and produce a uniform cube reconstructed with the best spatial resolution over the full range of wavelengths.</description>

      <title>On the Capacity of Pixel Antenna based MIMO Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pixel antenna is a promising technology to enhance the wireless communication data rate by adaptively reconfiguring each antenna's radiation pattern via a so-called antenna coding technique which controls the states of switches connected to multiple pixel ports. This paper studies a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system where both the transmitter and the receiver are equipped with multiple pixel antennas. We aim to characterize the fundamental capacity limit of this MIMO system by jointly optimizing the transmit covariance matrix and the antenna coders at both the transmitter and the receiver. This problem is a mixed-integer non-linear program (MINLP) which is non-convex and particularly challenging to solve due to the binary-valued optimization variables corresponding to the antenna coders. We first propose an exhaustive search based method to obtain the optimal solution to this problem, which corresponds to the fundamental capacity limit. Then, we propose a branch-and-bound based iterative algorithm aiming to find a high-quality suboptimal solution with lower complexity than exhaustive search as the number of pixel ports becomes large. Finally, we devise an alternating optimization (AO) based algorithm with polynomial complexity. Numerical results show that our proposed algorithms achieve a flexible trade-off between performance and complexity. Moreover, equipping the transceivers with pixel antennas can enhance the achievable rate of MIMO communications.</description>

      <title>HBNET-GIANT: A communication-efficient accelerated Newton-type fully distributed optimization algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article presents a second-order fully distributed optimization algorithm, HBNET-GIANT, driven by heavy-ball momentum, for $L$-smooth and $\mu$-strongly convex objective functions. A rigorous convergence analysis is performed, and we demonstrate global linear convergence under certain sufficient conditions. Through extensive numerical experiments, we show that HBNET-GIANT with heavy-ball momentum achieves acceleration, and the corresponding rate of convergence is strictly faster than its non-accelerated version, NETWORK-GIANT. Moreover, we compare HBNET-GIANT with several state-of-the-art algorithms, both momentum-based and without momentum, and report significant performance improvement in convergence to the optimum. We believe that this work lays the groundwork for a broader class of second-order Newton-type algorithms with momentum and motivates further investigation into open problems, including an analytical proof of local acceleration in the fully distributed setting for convex optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Smooth Total variation Regularization for Interference Detection and Elimination (STRIDE) for MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: MRI is increasingly desired to function near electronic devices that emit potentially dynamic electromagnetic interference (EMI). To accommodate for this, we propose the STRIDE method, which improves on previous external-sensor-based EMI removal methods by exploiting inherent MR image smoothness in its total variation. STRIDE measures data from both EMI detectors and primary MR imaging coils, transforms this data into the image domain, and for each column of the resulting image array, combines and subtracts data from the EMI detectors in a way that optimizes for total-variation smoothness. Performance was tested on phantom and in-vivo datasets with a 0.5T scanner. STRIDE resulted in visually better EMI removal, higher temporal SNR, larger EMI removal percentage, and lower RMSE than standard implementations. STRIDE is a robust technique that leverages inherent MR image properties to provide improved EMI removal performance over standard algorithms, particularly for time-varying noise sources.</description>

      <title>Cross-Learning from Scarce Data via Multi-Task Constrained Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A learning task, understood as the problem of fitting a parametric model from supervised data, fundamentally requires the dataset to be large enough to be representative of the underlying distribution of the source. When data is limited, the learned models fail generalize to cases not seen during training. This paper introduces a multi-task \emph{cross-learning} framework to overcome data scarcity by jointly estimating \emph{deterministic} parameters across multiple, related tasks. We formulate this joint estimation as a constrained optimization problem, where the constraints dictate the resulting similarity between the parameters of the different models, allowing the estimated parameters to differ across tasks while still combining information from multiple data sources. This framework enables knowledge transfer from tasks with abundant data to those with scarce data, leading to more accurate and reliable parameter estimates, providing a solution for scenarios where parameter inference from limited data is critical. We provide theoretical guarantees in a controlled framework with Gaussian data, and show the efficiency of our cross-learning method in applications with real data including image classification and propagation of infectious diseases.</description>

      <title>SomnoNet: A Lightweight and Interpretable Framework for Sleep Staging from Single-Channel EEG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19246v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sleep quality is central to human health, yet reliable and scalable sleep assessment remains an unmet challenge in both clinical and home-care settings. Manual scoring is labor-intensive and impractical for long-term monitoring, whereas existing automatic approaches often lack computational efficiency, deployability, and interpretability. Here we present SomnoNet, a domain-informed neural architecture that unifies accurate, lightweight, and interpretable sleep staging.
  SomnoNet is an end-to-end framework that learns directly from raw single-channel EEG, eliminating hand-crafted preprocessing and achieving state-of-the-art performance on two large-scale benchmarks (80.9\% accuracy on SHHS; 88.0\% on Physio2018). We further develop SomnoNet-Nano, a highly compact variant that achieves an extreme parameter reduction-approximately 6\% of the smallest prior model-while still preserving more than 99\% of state-of-the-art accuracy, thereby enabling deployment on portable and wearable devices.
  To promote clinical trust, we conduct interpretability analyses that quantify the contribution of EEG features across epochs, exposing physiologically meaningful patterns that reveal the network's decision process. By jointly addressing accuracy, efficiency, and transparency, SomnoNet provides a practical pathway toward reliable and scalable AI-driven sleep assessment. The implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/komdec/SomnoNet.git.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06550v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted communication is a key enabling technology for next-generation wireless communication networks, allowing for the reshaping of wireless channels without requiring traditional radio frequency (RF) active components. While their passive nature makes RISs highly attractive, it also presents a challenge: RISs cannot actively identify themselves to user equipments (UEs). Recently, a new method has been proposed to detect and identify RISs by letting them modulate their identities in the signals reflected from their surfaces. In this letter, we first propose a new and simpler modulation method for RISs and then validate the concept of RIS detection and identification (RIS-ID) using a real-world experimental setup. The obtained results validate the RIS-ID concept and show the effectiveness of our proposed modulation method over different operating scenarios and systems settings.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-based OTFS Channel Estimation and Symbol Detection with Plug-and-Play Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11102v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Orthogonal Time Frequency Space (OTFS) modulation has recently attracted significant interest due to its potential for enabling reliable communication in high-mobility environments. However, the effectiveness of OTFS receivers relies on the inherent characteristic of the Delay-Doppler (DD) domain channel, where the sparsity of the discretized channel varies across different communication scenarios. For instance, the fractional Doppler effect reduces the inherent channel sparsity, which consequently degrades channel estimation accuracy and increases the complexity of symbol detection. Traditional algorithms relying on fixed sparsity priors often require manual design, while purely data-driven deep learning (DL) methods typically struggle to generalize across diverse channel conditions. To address these challenges, we propose a novel unsupervised DL-based plug-and-play (PnP) framework that provides a flexible solution for OTFS receiver design. The proposed framework can be applied to both channel estimation and symbol detection, jointly leveraging the flexibility of optimization-based methods and the powerful generalization capability of data-driven models. Specifically, a lightweight encoder-decoder network (EDN) is incorporated as an implicit channel prior for channel estimation, enabling robust performance across varying levels of channel sparsity. Furthermore, for symbol detection, we realize the PnP framework with a time-domain matrix inversion for model-based equalization, followed by a small multi-layer perceptron (MLP) pre-trained for specific constellations, thereby achieving low complexity and enabling flexible adaptation to various modulation formats. Finally, numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the algorithm.</description>

Abstract: The implementation of the conjugate gradient (CG) method for massive MIMO detection is computationally challenging, especially for a large number of users and correlated channels. In this paper, we propose a low computational complexity CG detection from a finite-precision perspective. First, we develop a finite-precision CG (FP-CG) detection to mitigate the computational bottleneck of each CG iteration and provide the attainable accuracy, convergence, and computational complexity analysis to reveal the impact of finite-precision arithmetic. A practical heuristic is presented to select suitable precisions. Then, to further reduce the number of iterations, we propose a joint finite-precision and block-Jacobi preconditioned CG (FP-BJ-CG) detection. The corresponding performance analysis is also provided. Finally, simulation results validate the theoretical insights and demonstrate the superiority of the proposed detection.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Modality Gap: Enhancing Channel Prediction with Semantically Aligned LLMs and Knowledge Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate channel prediction is essential in massive multiple-input multiple-output (m-MIMO) systems to improve precoding effectiveness and reduce the overhead of channel state information (CSI) feedback. However, existing methods often suffer from accumulated prediction errors and poor generalization to dynamic wireless environments. Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable modeling and generalization capabilities in tasks such as time series prediction, making them a promising solution. Nevertheless, a significant modality gap exists between the linguistic knowledge embedded in pretrained LLMs and the intrinsic characteristics of CSI, posing substantial challenges for their direct application to channel prediction. Moreover, the large parameter size of LLMs hinders their practical deployment in real-world communication systems with stringent latency constraints. To address these challenges, we propose a novel channel prediction framework based on semantically aligned large models, referred to as CSI-ALM, which bridges the modality gap between natural language and channel information. Specifically, we design a cross-modal fusion module that aligns CSI representations . Additionally, we maximize the cosine similarity between word embeddings and CSI embeddings to construct semantic cues. To reduce complexity and enable practical implementation, we further introduce a lightweight version of the proposed approach, called CSI-ALM-Light. This variant is derived via a knowledge distillation strategy based on attention matrices. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that CSI-ALM achieves a 1 dB gain over state-of-the-art deep learning methods. Moreover, under limited training data conditions, CSI-ALM-Light, with only 0.34M parameters, attains performance comparable to CSI-ALM and significantly outperforms conventional deep learning approaches.</description>

Abstract: Pinching antenna systems (PASS) present a breakthrough among the flexible-antenna technologies, and distinguish themselves by facilitating large-scale antenna reconfiguration, line-of-sight creation, scalable implementation, and near-field benefits, thus bringing wireless communications from the last mile to the last meter. A comprehensive tutorial is presented in this paper. First, the fundamentals of PASS are discussed, including PASS signal models, hardware models, power radiation models, and pinching antenna activation methods. Building upon this, the information-theoretic capacity limits achieved by PASS are characterized, and several typical performance metrics of PASS-based communications are analyzed to demonstrate its superiority over conventional antenna technologies. Next, the pinching beamforming design is investigated. The corresponding power scaling law is first characterized. For the joint transmit and pinching design in the general multiple-waveguide case, 1) a pair of transmission strategies is proposed for PASS-based single-user communications to validate the superiority of PASS, namely sub-connected and fully connected structures; and 2) three practical protocols are proposed for facilitating PASS-based multi-user communications, namely waveguide switching, waveguide division, and waveguide multiplexing. A possible implementation of PASS in wideband communications is further highlighted. Moreover, the channel state information acquisition in PASS is elaborated with a pair of promising solutions. To overcome the high complexity and suboptimality inherent in conventional convex-optimization-based approaches, machine-learning-based methods for operating PASS are also explored, focusing on selected deep neural network architectures and training algorithms. Finally, several promising applications of PASS in next-generation wireless networks are highlighted.</description>

Abstract: Recently, the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) technology has ushered in the prospect of control over the wireless propagation environment. By establishing alternative propagation paths for the transmitted signals, and by reflecting them in a controllable manner, the RIS is able to improve the signal reception. However, an aspect often overlooked is the potential bandwidth restrictions on the wideband signal reflected by the RIS. If not carefully considered, this can become an impediment for the adoption of the RIS in the next generation of communications systems. Therefore, in this work we propose a RIS configuration method that provides frequency selective signal reflection for wideband signals.</description>

      <title>Credible Uncertainty Quantification under Noise and System Model Mismatch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03311v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: State estimators often provide self-assessed uncertainty metrics, such as covariance matrices, whose credibility is critical for downstream tasks. However, these self-assessments can be misleading due to underlying modeling violations like noise model mismatch (NMM) or system model misspecification (SMM). This letter addresses this problem by developing a unified, multi-metric framework that integrates noncredibility index (NCI), negative log-likelihood (NLL), and energy score (ES) metrics, featuring an empirical location test (ELT) to detect system model bias and a directional probing technique that uses the metrics' asymmetric sensitivities to distinguish NMM from SMM. Monte Carlo simulations reveal that the proposed method achieves excellent diagnosis accuracy (80-100%) and significantly outperforms single-metric diagnosis methods. The effectiveness of the proposed method is further validated on a real-world UWB positioning dataset. This framework provides a practical tool for turning patterns of credibility indicators into actionable diagnoses of model deficiencies.</description>

      <title>Interpretable machine learning for cardiogram-based biometrics</title>

Abstract: This study investigates the role of electrocardiogram (ECG) and impedance cardiogram (ICG) features in biometric identification, emphasizing their discriminative capacity and robustness to emotional variability. A total of 29 features spanning four domains (temporal, amplitude, slope, and morphological) are evaluated using random forest (RF) models combined with multiple interpretability methods. Feature importance shows that both ECG- and ICG-derived features are consistently ranked among the top 10 by Gini importance, permutation importance, and SHAP values, with ECG features, particularly QRS-centric descriptors, occupying the highest positions. In parallel, ICG BCX features contribute complementary, however, with lower cross-method stability. Correlation analysis reveals substantial multicollinearity, where the RF distributes and diminishes importance across highly correlated pairs, confirming reduced independent contributions. Statistical analysis identifies 14 features with significant differences between baseline and anger, without a clear pattern by domain. Feature selection with recursive feature elimination and genetic algorithms converges on a subset (12 features) that attains accuracy within 1% of the full set (99%), improving efficiency in storage and computation. These complementary analyses indicate that the individuality required for reliable identification is primarily encoded in QRS-related ECG features across all four domains. Meanwhile, BCX-derived ICG features contribute mainly through amplitude and slope, providing supportive but less stable discriminatory cues. The confirmed resilience of QRS-centric descriptors to emotional variation, where stable inter-individual differences in the QRS complex could be traced to variations in ventricular mass, conduction pathways, and thoracic geometry may indicate their central role in future models of cardiogram-based identity.</description>

      <title>Cram\'er-Rao Bound Optimization for Fluid Antenna-Empowered Integrated Sensing and Uplink Communication System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25246v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is a promising solution for the future sixth-generation (6G) system. However, classical fixed-position antenna (FPA) ISAC systems fail to fully utilize spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs), resulting in limited gains for both radar sensing and communication functionalities. This challenge can be addressed by the emerging novel fluid antenna (FA) technology, which can pursue better channel conditions and improve sensing and communication performances. In this paper, we aim to minimize the Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB) for estimating the target's angle while guaranteeing communication performance. This involves jointly optimizing active beamforming, power allocation, receiving filters, and FA position configurations, which is a highly non-convex problem. To tackle this difficulty, we propose an efficient iterative solution that analytically optimizes all variables without relying on numerical solvers, i.e., CVX. Specifically, by leveraging cutting-edge majorization-minimization (MM) and penalty-dual-decomposition (PDD) methods, we develop a low-complexity algorithm to solve the beamformer configuration problem containing the fractional and quartic terms. Numerical simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed algorithm, highlighting significant performance improvements achieved by employing FA in the ISAC system.</description>

      <title>3D Cooperative User Tracking for Distributed Integrated Sensing and Communication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03612v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) becomes an integral part of 6G networks, distributed ISAC (DISAC) is expected to enhance both sensing and communication performance through its decentralized architecture. This paper presents a complete framework to address the challenge of cooperative user tracking in DISAC systems. By incorporating a global probability hypothesis density (PHD) filter and a field-of-view-aware access point (AP) management strategy, the framework enables accurate user tracking using radio signals while optimizing AP scheduling. In addition, a real-world distributed MIMO channel measurement campaign is performed to evaluate the effectiveness of the framework. The results demonstrate that a centimeter-level root mean-square trajectory error can be achieved. Furthermore, the results show that it is not necessary to keep APs active at all times to maintain high tracking accuracy, indicating the need for robust and efficient AP management. These findings provide valuable insights into practical deployments and the further development of cooperative user tracking techniques in DISAC systems.</description>

      <title>RCMCL: A Unified Contrastive Learning Framework for Robust Multi-Modal (RGB-D, Skeleton, Point Cloud) Action Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04351v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Human action recognition (HAR) with multi-modal inputs (RGB-D, skeleton, point cloud) can achieve high accuracy but typically relies on large labeled datasets and degrades sharply when sensors fail or are noisy. We present Robust Cross-Modal Contrastive Learning (RCMCL), a self-supervised framework that learns modality-invariant representations and remains reliable under modality dropout and corruption. RCMCL jointly optimizes (i) a cross-modal contrastive objective that aligns heterogeneous streams, (ii) an intra-modal self-distillation objective that improves view-invariance and reduces redundancy, and (iii) a degradation simulation objective that explicitly trains models to recover from masked or corrupted inputs. At inference, an Adaptive Modality Gating (AMG) network assigns data-driven reliability weights to each modality for robust fusion. On NTU RGB+D 120 (CS/CV) and UWA3D-II, RCMCL attains state-of-the-art accuracy in standard settings and exhibits markedly better robustness: under severe dual-modality dropout it shows only an 11.5% degradation, significantly outperforming strong supervised fusion baselines. These results indicate that self-supervised cross-modal alignment, coupled with explicit degradation modeling and adaptive fusion, is key to deployable multi-modal HAR.</description>

      <title>Distributed MIMO Positioning: Fundamental Limit Analysis and User Tracking Framework Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06440v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive study on the 3D positioning capabilities in distributed multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Unlike previous studies that mainly rely on idealized isotropic antenna models, we adopt a polarimetric model that takes advantage of effective aperture distribution functions to characterize realistic antenna patterns, placements, and polarization effects. Based on this model, we analyze the fundamental limits of UE positioning using the Fisher information matrix (FIM) and the position error bound (PEB). The FIM is shown to be expressed as a weighted sum of the information contributions from individual access point (AP)-UE pairs, with each contribution interpreted geometrically across distance, azimuth, and elevation dimensions. The impact of the UE tilt and the spatial distribution of APs on the PEBs is further analyzed. As a further advancement, we propose a complete positioning framework from a UE tracking perspective. By integrating a global probability hypothesis density filter and a PEB-aware AP management strategy, the framework enables accurate tracking while optimizing AP scheduling. Finally, we present a distributed MIMO channel measurement campaign to validate the proposed framework. The results demonstrate a centimeter-level tracking accuracy. In addition, the PEB-aware AP management strategy is shown to maintain robust tracking performance while significantly reducing the number of concurrently active APs, thus lowering the overall system overhead.</description>

      <title>A Scalable and Exact Relaxation for Densest $k$-Subgraph via Error Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11451v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given an undirected graph and a size parameter $k$, the Densest $k$-Subgraph (D$k$S) problem extracts the subgraph on $k$ vertices with the largest number of induced edges. While D$k$S is NP--hard and difficult to approximate, penalty-based continuous relaxations of the problem have recently enjoyed practical success for real-world instances of D$k$S. In this work, we propose a scalable and exact continuous penalization approach for D$k$S using the error bound principle, which enables the design of suitable penalty functions. Notably, we develop new theoretical guarantees ensuring that both the global and local optima of the penalized problem match those of the original problem. The proposed penalized reformulation enables the use of first-order continuous optimization methods. In particular, we develop a non-convex proximal gradient algorithm, where the non-convex proximal operator can be computed in closed form, resulting in low per-iteration complexity. We also provide convergence analysis of the algorithm. Experiments on large-scale instances of the D$k$S problem and one of its variants, the Densest ($k_1, k_2$) Bipartite Subgraph (D$k_1k_2$BS) problem, demonstrate that our method achieves a favorable balance between computation cost and solution quality.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Real-Time Volcano-Seismic Event Recognition Based on Multi-Station Seismograms and Semantic Segmentation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20595v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In volcano monitoring, effective recognition of seismic events is essential for understanding volcanic activity and raising timely warning alerts. Traditional methods rely on manual analysis, which can be subjective and labor-intensive. Furthermore, current automatic approaches often tackle detection and classification separately, mostly rely on single station information and generally require tailored preprocessing and representations to perform predictions. These limitations often hinder their application to real-time monitoring and utilization across different volcano conditions. This study introduces a novel approach that utilizes Semantic Segmentation models to automate seismic event recognition by applying a straight forward transformation of multi-channel 1D signals into 2D representations, enabling their use as images. Our framework employs a data-driven, end-to-end design that integrates multi-station seismic data with minimal preprocessing, performing both detection and classification simultaneously for five seismic event classes. We evaluated four state-of-the-art segmentation models (UNet, UNet++, DeepLabV3+ and SwinUNet) on approximately 25.000 seismic events recorded at four different Chilean volcanoes: Nevados del Chill\'an Volcanic Complex, Laguna del Maule, Villarrica and Puyehue-Cord\'on Caulle. Among these models, the UNet architecture was identified as the most effective model, achieving mean F1 and Intersection over Union (IoU) scores of up to 0.91 and 0.88, respectively, and demonstrating superior noise robustness and model flexibility to unseen volcano datasets.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Risk Assessment for Autonomous Vehicles from Spatio-Temporal Probabilistic Occupancy Heatmaps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16480v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurately assessing collision risk in dynamic traffic scenarios is a crucial requirement for trajectory planning in autonomous vehicles~(AVs) and enables a comprehensive safety evaluation of automated driving systems. To that end, this paper presents a novel probabilistic occupancy risk assessment~(PORA) metric. It uses spatiotemporal heatmaps as probabilistic occupancy predictions of surrounding traffic participants and estimates the risk of a collision along an AV's planned trajectory based on potential vehicle interactions. The use of probabilistic occupancy allows PORA to account for the uncertainty in future trajectories and velocities of traffic participants in the risk estimates. The risk from potential vehicle interactions is then further adjusted through a Cox model\edit{,} which considers the relative \edit{motion} between the AV and surrounding traffic participants. We demonstrate that the proposed approach enhances the accuracy of collision risk assessment in dynamic traffic scenarios, resulting in safer vehicle controllers, and provides a robust framework for real-time decision-making in autonomous driving systems. From evaluation in Monte Carlo simulations, PORA is shown to be more effective at accurately characterizing collision risk compared to other safety surrogate measures.

      <title>Meta-Learning Driven Movable-Antenna-assisted Full-Duplex RSMA for Multi-User Communication: Performance and Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03982v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Full-duplex (FD) radios at base station (BS) have gained significant interest because of their ability to simultaneously transmit and receive signals on the same frequency band. However, FD communication is hindered by self-interference (SI) and intra-cell interference caused by simultaneous uplink (UL) transmissions affecting downlink (DL) reception. These interferences significantly limit the ability to fully exploit FD's potential. Recently, movable antenna (MA) technology has emerged as a groundbreaking innovation, offering an effective way to mitigate interference by adjusting the position of each MA within the transmitter or receiver region. This dynamic repositioning allows MAs to move away from high-interference zones to areas with minimal interference, thereby enhancing multiplexing gain and improving spectral efficiency (SE). In light of this, in this paper, we investigate an FD communication system by integrating it with MAs to evaluate and investigate its effectiveness in handling SI and intra-cell interference. Moreover, we utilize rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) as our multiple access technique in both UL and DL transmission. To achieve the full potential of the system, we evaluated three different scenarios with FD-BS-RSMA with MAs where our goal is to maximize the total sum rate of the system by jointly optimizing the transmitting and receiving beamforming vectors, UL user equipment (UE) transmission power, MA positions, and common stream split ratio of RSMA while satisfying the minimum data rate requirements of all UEs, common stream constraint, power budget requirements of BS and UL UEs, and inter-MA distance. The formulated optimization problem is highly non-convex in nature, and hence, we propose a gradient-based meta-learning (GML) approach which can handle the non-convexity in a discrete manner by optimizing each variable in a different neural network.</description>

      <title>Whitened Score Diffusion: A Structured Prior for Imaging Inverse Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10311v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conventional score-based diffusion models (DMs) may struggle with anisotropic Gaussian diffusion processes due to the required inversion of covariance matrices in the denoising score matching training objective \cite{vincent_connection_2011}. We propose Whitened Score (WS) diffusion models, a novel framework based on stochastic differential equations that learns the Whitened Score function instead of the standard score. This approach circumvents covariance inversion, extending score-based DMs by enabling stable training of DMs on arbitrary Gaussian forward noising processes. WS DMs establish equivalence with flow matching for arbitrary Gaussian noise, allow for tailored spectral inductive biases, and provide strong Bayesian priors for imaging inverse problems with structured noise. We experiment with a variety of computational imaging tasks using the CIFAR, CelebA ($64\times64$), and CelebA-HQ ($256\times256$) datasets and demonstrate that WS diffusion priors trained on anisotropic Gaussian noising processes consistently outperform conventional diffusion priors based on isotropic Gaussian noise.

      <title>Customising Electricity Contracts at Scale with Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19551v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The electricity system becomes more complex, connecting massive numbers of end-users and distributed generators. Adding or removing grid connections requires expert studies to align technical constraints with user requests. In times of labour shortages, carrying out these studies represents a significant amount of time that engineers at system operators spend in planning departments. As time is limited, only standard block connectivity contracts can be offered to end-users, or the requests pile up. Even if offers are made, these often do not perfectly match the user's requirements, leading to overpaying or underusing the grid capacity. This paper investigates whether end-users can negotiate individual, flexible time-of-use contracts directly with the grid using Large Language Models (LLMs) in chats at scale. This work addresses core technical challenges in automating contract design under grid constraints, integrating LLMs with power system models, and ensuring secure, reliable interaction. We develop a chat system using functional programs for power system analysis, enabling users to request customised, technically feasible contracts at scale. We demonstrate high accuracy in executing engineering studies, robustness to user input variations, self-assessment of connection requests by small and medium enterprises, and potential for secure, chat-enabled maintenance planning. This initial study paves the way toward developing a tailored LLM system, resulting in possible high-efficiency gains for grid planning and customer management.

      <title>Phase-Pole-Free Images and Smooth Coil Sensitivity Maps by Regularized Nonlinear Inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04685v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Purpose: Phase singularities are a common problem in image reconstruction with auto-calibrated sensitivities due to an inherent ambiguity of the estimation problem. The purpose of this work is to develop a method for detecting and correcting phase poles in non-linear inverse (NLINV) reconstruction of MR images and coil sensitivity maps.
  Methods: Phase poles are detected in individual coil sensitivity maps by computing the curl in each pixel. A weighted average of the curl in each coil is computed to detect phase poles. Phase pole detection and correction is then integrated into the iteratively regularized Gauss-Newton method of the NLINV algorithm, which then avoid phase singularities in the reconstructed images. The method is evaluated for reconstruction of accelerated Cartesian MPRAGE data of the brain and interactive radial real-time MRI of the human heart.
  Results: Phase poles are reliably removed in NLINV reconstructions for both applications. NLINV with phase pole correction can reliably and efficiently estimate coil sensitivity profiles free from singularities even from very small ($7\times7$) auto-calibration (AC) regions.
  Conclusion: NLINV emerges as an efficient and reliable tool for image reconstruction and coil sensitivity estimation in challenging MRI applications.</description>

      <title>Systematic validation of time-resolved diffuse optical simulators via non-contact SPAD-based measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09587v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Objective: Time-domain diffuse optical imaging (DOI) requires accurate forward models for photon propagation in scattering media. However, existing simulators lack comprehensive experimental validation, especially for non-contact configurations with oblique illumination. This study rigorously evaluates three widely used open-source simulators, including MMC, NIRFASTer, and Toast++, using time-resolved experimental data. Approach: All simulations employed a unified mesh and point-source illumination. Virtual source correction was applied to FEM solvers for oblique incidence. A time-resolved DOI system with a 32 $\times$ 32 single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) array acquired transmission-mode data from 16 standardized phantoms with varying absorption coefficient $\mu_a$ and reduced scattering coefficient $\mu_s'$. The simulation results were quantified across five metrics: spatial-domain (SD) precision, time-domain (TD) precision, oblique beam accuracy, computational speed, and mesh-density independence. Results: Among three simulators, MMC achieves superior accuracy in SD and TD metrics, and shows robustness across all optical properties. NIRFASTer and Toast++ demonstrate comparable overall performance. In general, MMC is optimal for accuracy-critical TD-DOI applications, while NIRFASTer and Toast++ suit scenarios prioritizing speed with sufficiently large $\mu_s'$. Besides, virtual source correction is essential for non-contact FEM modeling, which reduced average errors by &gt; 34% in large-angle scenarios. Significance: This work provides benchmarked guidelines for simulator selection during the development phase of next-generation TD-DOI systems. Our work represents the first study to systematically validate TD simulators against SPAD array-based data under clinically relevant non-contact conditions, bridging a critical gap in biomedical optical simulation standards.</description>
