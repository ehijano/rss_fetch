      <title>An asynchronous discontinuous Galerkin method for combustion simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method has been widely considered in recent years to develop scalable flow solvers for its ability to handle discontinuities, such as shocks and detonations, with greater accuracy and high arithmetic intensity. However, its scalability is severely affected by communication bottlenecks that arise from data movement and synchronization at extreme scales. Recently, an asynchronous discontinuous Galerkin (ADG) method was proposed to reduce communication overhead by either relaxing synchronization or avoiding communication between processing elements (PEs). The numerical properties of the ADG method were verified by solving simple one-dimensional partial differential equations. In this study, the application of the ADG method is extended to complex chemically reacting flows, particularly to evaluate its efficacy in capturing flame fronts and detonations. New asynchrony-tolerant weighted essentially non-oscillatory (AT-WENO) limiters are derived to accurately capture flow discontinuities with communication delays at the PE boundaries. The numerical accuracy of the ADG method is verified on the premixed spontaneous ignition of a fuel-lean mixture with detailed chemistry. The progression of the flame front is accurately represented by the ADG method, and the numerical errors incurred at the PE boundaries turn out to be insignificant. The efficacy of the AT-WENO limiters in capturing discontinuities is demonstrated by the propagation of a detonation wave. The findings of this study serve as a basis for the development of highly scalable discontinuous Galerkin-based solvers for combustion simulations on massively parallel supercomputers.</description>

      <title>Dual formulation of the maximum entropy method applied to analytic continuation of quantum Monte Carlo data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many fields of physics use quantum Monte Carlo techniques, but struggle to estimate dynamic spectra via the analytic continuation of imaginary-time quantum Monte Carlo data. One of the most ubiquitous approaches to analytic continuation is the maximum entropy method (MEM). We supply a dual Newton optimization algorithm to be used within the MEM and provide analytic bounds for the algorithm's error. The MEM is typically used with Bryan's controversial algorithm [Rothkopf, "Bryan's Maximum Entropy Method" Data 5.3 (2020)]. We present new theoretical issues that are not yet in the literature. Our algorithm has all the theoretical benefits of Bryan's algorithm without these theoretical issues. We compare the MEM with Bryan's optimization to the MEM with our dual Newton optimization on test problems from lattice quantum chromodynamics and plasma physics. These comparisons show that in the presence of noise the dual Newton algorithm produces better estimates and error bars; this indicates the limits of Bryan's algorithm's applicability. We use the MEM to investigate authentic quantum Monte Carlo data for the uniform electron gas at warm dense matter conditions and further substantiate the roton-type feature in the dispersion relation.</description>

      <title>Continuum limit of the Green function in scaled affine $\varphi^4_4$ quantum Euclidean covariant relativistic field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10903v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove through path integral Monte Carlo computer experiments that the affine quantization of the $\varphi_4^4$ scaled Euclidean covariant relativistic scalar field theory is a valid quantum field theory with a well defined continuum limit of the one- and two-point-function. Affine quantization leads to a completely satisfactory quantization of field theories using situations that involve scaled behavior leading to an unexpected, $\hbar^2/\varphi^2$ which arises only in the quantum aspects.</description>

      <title>pyBoLaNO: A Python symbolic package for normal ordering involving bosonic ladder operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present pyBoLaNO, a Python symbolic package based on SymPy to quickly normal-order (Wick-order) any polynomial in bosonic ladder operators. By extension, this package offers the normal ordering of commutators of any two polynomials in bosonic ladder operators and the evaluation of the normal-ordered expectation value evolution in the Lindblad master equation framework for open quantum systems. The package also supports multipartite descriptions and multiprocessing. We describe the package's workflow, show examples of use, and discuss its computational performance. All codes and examples are available on our GitHub repository.</description>

      <title>A hyperreduced reduced basis element method for reduced-order modeling of component-based nonlinear systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a hyperreduced reduced basis element method for model reduction of parameterized, component-based systems in continuum mechanics governed by nonlinear partial differential equations. In the offline phase, the method constructs, through a component-wise empirical training, a library of archetype components defined by a component-wise reduced basis and hyperreduced quadrature rules with varying hyperreduction fidelities. In the online phase, the method applies an online adaptive scheme informed by the Brezzi-Rappaz-Raviart theorem to select an appropriate hyperreduction fidelity for each component to meet the user-prescribed error tolerance at the system level. The method accommodates the rapid construction of hyperreduced models for large-scale component-based nonlinear systems and enables model reduction of problems with many continuous and topology-varying parameters. The efficacy of the method is demonstrated on a two-dimensional nonlinear thermal fin system that comprises up to 225 components and 68 independent parameters.</description>

      <title>QuantumBind-RBFE: Accurate Relative Binding Free Energy Calculations Using Neural Network Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of protein-ligand binding affinities is crucial in drug discovery, particularly during hit-to-lead and lead optimization phases, however, limitations in ligand force fields continue to impact prediction accuracy. In this work, we validate relative binding free energy (RBFE) accuracy using neural network potentials (NNPs) for the ligands. We utilize a novel NNP model, AceForce 1.0, based on the TensorNet architecture for small molecules that broadens the applicability to diverse drug-like compounds, including all important chemical elements and supporting charged molecules. Using established benchmarks, we show overall improved accuracy and correlation in binding affinity predictions compared with GAFF2 for molecular mechanics and ANI2-x for NNPs. Slightly less accuracy but comparable correlations with OPLS4. We also show that we can run the NNP simulations at 2 fs timestep, at least two times larger than previous NNP models, providing significant speed gains. The results show promise for further evolutions of free energy calculations using NNPs while demonstrating its practical use already with the current generation. The code and NNP model are publicly available for research use.</description>

      <title>Deposition Rates in Thermal Laser Epitaxy: Simulation and Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The modeling of deposition rates in Thermal Laser Epitaxy (TLE) is essential for the accurate prediction of the evaporation process and for improved dynamic process control. We demonstrate excellent agreement between experimental data and a model based on a finite element simulation that describes the temperature distribution of an elemental source when irradiated with continuous wave laser radiation. The simulation strongly depends on the thermophysical constants of the material, data of which is lacking for many elements. Effective values for the parameters may be determined with precision by means of an unambiguous reference provided by the melting point of the material, which is directly observed during the experiments. TLE may therefore be used to study the high temperature thermophysical and optical properties of the elements.</description>

      <title>Linear Scaling Calculation of Atomic Forces and Energies with Machine Learning Local Density Matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately calculating energies and atomic forces with linear-scaling methods is a crucial approach to accelerating and improving molecular dynamics simulations. In this paper, we introduce HamGNN-DM, a machine learning model designed to predict atomic forces and energies using local density matrices in molecular dynamics simulations. This approach achieves efficient predictions with a time complexity of O(n), making it highly suitable for large-scale systems. Experiments in different systems demonstrate that HamGNN-DM achieves DFT-level precision in predicting the atomic forces in different system sizes, which is vital for the molecular dynamics. Furthermore, this method provides valuable electronic structure information throughout the dynamics and exhibits robust performance.</description>

      <title>Positivity-preserving hybrid DG/FV method for compressible Euler equations with stiff source terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.05867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2007.05867v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In numerical simulations of complex fluid dynamical problems, unphysical negative density or pressure may appear, causing blow-up of the computation. With the aim of obtaining positivity-preserving solutions with multi-scale resolution for solving strongly compressible flows, including hypersonic flows and stiff detonation waves, we present a positivity-preserving hybrid discontinuous Galerkin/finite volume (DG/FV) method. The approach is based on a priori and a posteriori computational methodology. The a priori computation utilizes relaxed boundary variation diminishing (BVD) algorithm to find troubled cells where the DG operators are replaced by the FV operators. The FV operators then deploy a hyperbolic tangent function in the reconstruction procedure to prevent unphysical values appearing in the flux evaluation. The a posteriori computation detects unphysical negative values in a simplified version of multidimensional optimal order detection (MOOD) paradigm and in the worst case applies the first-order FV Godunov scheme to guarantee the positivity of the solution. The a priori computation produces fewer oscillatory solutions, so that the a posteriori computation triggers less first-order evaluation. A technique of utilizing the tangent of hyperbola for interface capturing (THINC) with anti-diffusion effect, which is also referred to as the technique of adaptive reconstruction in this work, is suggested to reduce the numerical dissipation of the shock-capturing scheme. The current approaches retain the capability of the DG scheme to resolve small scales and the capability of the FV scheme to capture sharp discontinuities at the subgrid level.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12598v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe efficient differentiation methods for computing Jacobians and gradients of a large class of matrix functions including the matrix logarithm $\log(A)$ and $p$-th roots $A^{\frac{1}{p}}$. We exploit contour integrals and conformal maps as described by (Hale et al., SIAM J. Numer. Anal. 2008) for evaluation and differentiation and analyze the computational complexity as well as numerical accuracy compared to high accuracy finite difference methods. As a demonstrator application we compute properties of structural defects in silicon crystals at positive temperatures, requiring efficient and accurate gradients of matrix trace-logarithms.</description>
