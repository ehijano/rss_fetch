      <title>Visibility-Graph Asymmetry as a Structural Indicator of Volatility Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Volatility clustering is one of the most robust stylized facts of financial markets, yet it is typically detected using moment-based diagnostics or parametric models such as GARCH. This paper shows that clustered volatility also leaves a clear imprint on the time-reversal symmetry of horizontal visibility graphs (HVGs) constructed on absolute returns in physical time. For each time point, we compute the maximal forward and backward visibility distances, $L^{+}(t)$ and $L^{-}(t)$, and use their empirical distributions to build a visibility-asymmetry fingerprint comprising the Kolmogorov--Smirnov distance, variance difference, entropy difference, and a ratio of extreme visibility spans. In a Monte Carlo study, these HVG asymmetry features sharply separate volatility-clustered GARCH(1,1) dynamics from i.i.d.\ Gaussian noise and from randomly shuffled GARCH series that preserve the marginal distribution but destroy temporal dependence; a simple linear classifier based on the fingerprint achieves about 90\% in-sample accuracy. Applying the method to daily S\&amp;P500 data reveals a pronounced forward--backward imbalance, including a variance difference $\Delta\mathrm{Var}$ that exceeds the simulated GARCH values by two orders of magnitude and vanishes after shuffling. Overall, the visibility-graph asymmetry fingerprint emerges as a simple, model-free, and geometrically interpretable indicator of volatility clustering and time irreversibility in financial time series.</description>

      <title>Event-Time Anchor Selection for Multi-Contract Quoting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05749v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When quoting across multiple contracts, the sequence of execution can be a key driver of implementation shortfall relative to the target spread~\cite{bergault2022multi}. We model the short-horizon execution risk from such quoting as variations in transaction prices between the initiation of the first leg and the completion of the position. Our quoting policy anchors the spread by designating one contract ex ante as a \emph{reference contract}. Reducing execution risk requires a predictive criterion for selecting that contract whose price is most stable over the execution interval. This paper develops a diagnostic framework for reference-contract selection that evaluates this stability by contrasting order-flow Hawkes forecasts with a Composite Liquidity Factor (CLF) of instantaneous limit order book (LOB) shape. We illustrate the framework on tick-by-tick data for a pair of NIFTY futures contracts. The results suggest that event-history and LOB-state signals offer complementary views of short-horizon execution risk for reference-contract selection.</description>

      <title>Arbitrage with bounded Liquidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02027v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive the arbitrage gains or, equivalently, Loss Versus Rebalancing (LVR) for arbitrage between \textit{two imperfectly liquid} markets, extending prior work that assumes the existence of an infinitely liquid reference market. Our result highlights that the LVR depends on the relative liquidity and relative trading volume of the two markets between which arbitrage gains are extracted. Our model assumes that trading costs on at least one of the markets is quadratic. This assumption holds well in practice, with the exception of highly liquid major pairs on centralized exchanges, for which we discuss extensions to other cost functions.</description>

      <title>The Necessity of Imperfection:Reversing Model Collapse via Simulating Cognitive Boundedness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01354v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although synthetic data is widely promoted as a remedy, its prevailing production paradigm -- one optimizing for statistical smoothness -- systematically removes the long-tail, cognitively grounded irregularities that characterize human text. Prolonged training on such statistically optimal but cognitively impoverished data accelerates model collapse.
  This paper proposes a paradigm shift: instead of imitating the surface properties of data, we simulate the cognitive processes that generate human text. We introduce the Prompt-driven Cognitive Computing Framework (PMCSF), whose core consists of a Cognitive State Decoder (CSD) that reverse-engineers unstructured text into structured cognitive vectors, and a Cognitive Text Encoder (CTE) that re-materializes these states into text enriched with human-typical imperfections via mathematically defined Cognitive Perturbation Operators.
  The framework is validated through a two-stage objective evaluation pipeline. First, in cognitive codec verification, CTE text yields a Jensen-Shannon divergence of 0.0614 from human text (vs. 0.4431 for standard LLM output), passes double-blind professional media review, and achieves an intraclass correlation coefficient ICC &gt; 0.9 for cognitive profile alignment across heterogeneous models. Second, in functional gain evaluation, isomorphic stress tests in the A-share market show that strategies incorporating CTE-generated data reduce maximum drawdown by 47.4% during the 2015 crash and deliver 8.6% Defensive Alpha, exceeding transaction costs by a factor of 33.
  Our findings demonstrate that modelling human cognitive limitations -- not copying surface data -- enables synthetic data with genuine functional gain, offering a viable technical pathway toward resolving the AI data-collapse crisis.</description>
