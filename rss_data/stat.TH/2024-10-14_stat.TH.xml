      <title>Quantifying Jitter Transfer for Differential Measurement: Enhancing Security of Oscillator-Based TRNGs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to describe a way to improve the reliability of the measurement of the statistical parameters of the phase noise in a multi-ring oscillator-based TRNG. This is necessary to guarantee that the entropy rate is within the bounds prescribed by standards or security specifications. According to the literature, to filter out global noises which may strongly affect the measurement of the phase noise parameters, it is necessary to perform a differential measure. But a differential measurement only returns the parameters of the phase noise resulting of the composition of the noises of two oscillators whereas jitters parameters of individual oscillators are required to compute the entropy rate of a multi-ring oscillator-based TRNG. In this paper, we revisit the "jitter transfer principle" in conjunction with a tweaked design of an oscillator based TRNG to enjoy the precision of differential measures and, at the same time, obtain jitter parameters of individual oscillators. We show the relevance of our method with simulations and experiments with hardware implementations.</description>

      <title>Minimax Hypothesis Testing for the Bradley-Terry-Luce Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) model is one of the most widely used models for ranking a collection of items or agents based on pairwise comparisons among them. Given $n$ agents, the BTL model endows each agent $i$ with a latent skill score $\alpha_i &gt; 0$ and posits that the probability that agent $i$ is preferred over agent $j$ is $\alpha_i/(\alpha_i + \alpha_j)$. In this work, our objective is to formulate a hypothesis test that determines whether a given pairwise comparison dataset, with $k$ comparisons per pair of agents, originates from an underlying BTL model. We formalize this testing problem in the minimax sense and define the critical threshold of the problem. We then establish upper bounds on the critical threshold for general induced observation graphs (satisfying mild assumptions) and develop lower bounds for complete induced graphs. Our bounds demonstrate that for complete induced graphs, the critical threshold scales as $\Theta((nk)^{-1/2})$ in a minimax sense. In particular, our test statistic for the upper bounds is based on a new approximation we derive for the separation distance between general pairwise comparison models and the class of BTL models. To further assess the performance of our statistical test, we prove upper bounds on the type I and type II probabilities of error. Much of our analysis is conducted within the context of a fixed observation graph structure, where the graph possesses certain ``nice'' properties, such as expansion and bounded principal ratio. Additionally, we derive several auxiliary results, such as bounds on principal ratios of graphs, $\ell^2$-bounds on BTL parameter estimation under model mismatch, stability of rankings under the BTL model, etc. We validate our theoretical results through experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets and propose a data-driven permutation testing approach to determine test thresholds.</description>

      <title>Causal inference targeting a concentration index for studies of health inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A concentration index, a standardized covariance between a health variable and relative income ranks, is often used to quantify income-related health inequalities. There is a lack of formal approach to study the effect of an exposure, e.g., education, on such measures of inequality. In this paper we contribute by filling this gap and developing the necessary theory and method. Thus, we define a counterfactual concentration index for different levels of an exposure. We give conditions for their identification, and then deduce their efficient influence function. This allows us to propose estimators, which are regular asymptotic linear under certain conditions. In particular, these estimators are $\sqrt n$-consistent and asymptotically normal, as well as locally efficient. The implementation of the estimators is based on the fit of several nuisance functions. The estimators proposed have rate robustness properties allowing for convergence rates slower than $\sqrt{n}$-rate for some of the nuisance function fits. The relevance of the asymptotic results for finite samples is studied with simulation experiments. We also present a case study of the effect of education on income-related health inequalities for a Swedish cohort.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Personalization in FedProx: A Fine-grained Analysis on Statistical Accuracy and Communication Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: FedProx is a simple yet effective federated learning method that enables model personalization via regularization. Despite remarkable success in practice, a rigorous analysis of how such a regularization provably improves the statistical accuracy of each client's local model hasn't been fully established. Setting the regularization strength heuristically presents a risk, as an inappropriate choice may even degrade accuracy. This work fills in the gap by analyzing the effect of regularization on statistical accuracy, thereby providing a theoretical guideline for setting the regularization strength for achieving personalization. We prove that by adaptively choosing the regularization strength under different statistical heterogeneity, FedProx can consistently outperform pure local training and achieve a nearly minimax-optimal statistical rate. In addition, to shed light on resource allocation, we design an algorithm, provably showing that stronger personalization reduces communication complexity without increasing the computation cost overhead. Finally, our theory is validated on both synthetic and real-world datasets and its generalizability is verified in a non-convex setting.</description>

      <title>Maximizing the Potential of Synthetic Data: Insights from Random Matrix Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synthetic data has gained attention for training large language models, but poor-quality data can harm performance (see, e.g., Shumailov et al. (2023); Seddik et al. (2024)). A potential solution is data pruning, which retains only high-quality data based on a score function (human or machine feedback). Previous work Feng et al. (2024) analyzed models trained on synthetic data as sample size increases. We extend this by using random matrix theory to derive the performance of a binary classifier trained on a mix of real and pruned synthetic data in a high dimensional setting. Our findings identify conditions where synthetic data could improve performance, focusing on the quality of the generative model and verification strategy. We also show a smooth phase transition in synthetic label noise, contrasting with prior sharp behavior in infinite sample limits. Experiments with toy models and large language models validate our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Linear Convergence of Diffusion Models Under the Manifold Hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Score-matching generative models have proven successful at sampling from complex high-dimensional data distributions. In many applications, this distribution is believed to concentrate on a much lower $d$-dimensional manifold embedded into $D$-dimensional space; this is known as the manifold hypothesis. The current best-known convergence guarantees are either linear in $D$ or polynomial (superlinear) in $d$. The latter exploits a novel integration scheme for the backward SDE. We take the best of both worlds and show that the number of steps diffusion models require in order to converge in Kullback-Leibler~(KL) divergence is linear (up to logarithmic terms) in the intrinsic dimension $d$. Moreover, we show that this linear dependency is sharp.</description>

      <title>Generalized Median of Means Principle for Bayesian Inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.06617v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The topic of robustness is experiencing a resurgence of interest in the statistical and machine learning communities. In particular, robust algorithms making use of the so-called median of means estimator were shown to satisfy strong performance guarantees for many problems, including estimation of the mean, covariance structure as well as linear regression. In this work, we propose an extension of the median of means principle to the Bayesian framework, leading to the notion of the robust posterior distribution. In particular, we (a) quantify robustness of this posterior to outliers, (b) show that it satisfies a version of the Bernstein-von Mises theorem that connects Bayesian credible sets to the traditional confidence intervals, and (c) demonstrate that our approach performs well in applications.</description>

      <title>Consistency for constrained maximum likelihood estimation and clustering based on mixtures of elliptically-symmetric distributions under general data generating processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.06108v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The consistency of the maximum likelihood estimator for mixtures of elliptically-symmetric distributions for estimating its population version is shown, where the underlying distribution $P$ is nonparametric and does not necessarily belong to the class of mixtures on which the estimator is based. In a situation where $P$ is a mixture of well enough separated but nonparametric distributions it is shown that the components of the population version of the estimator correspond to the well separated components of $P$. This provides some theoretical justification for the use of such estimators for cluster analysis in case that $P$ has well separated subpopulations even if these subpopulations differ from what the mixture model assumes.</description>

      <title>A primer on linear classification with missing data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09196v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Supervised learning with missing data aims at building the best prediction of a target output based on partially-observed inputs. Major approaches to address this problem  can be decomposed into $(i)$ impute-then-predict strategies, which first fill in the empty input components and then apply a unique predictor and $(ii)$ Pattern-by-Pattern (P-b-P) approaches, where a predictor is built on each missing pattern. In this paper, we theoretically analyze how three classical linear classifiers, namely perceptron, logistic regression and linear discriminant analysis (LDA), behave with Missing Completely At Random (MCAR) data, depending on the strategy (imputation or P-b-P) used to handle missing values. We prove that both imputation and P-b-P approaches are ill-specified in a logistic regression framework, thus questioning the relevance of such approaches to handle missing data. The most favorable auspices to perform classification with missing data concern P-b-P LDA methods. We provide finite-sample bounds for the excess risk in this framework, even for high-dimensional or MNAR settings. Experiments illustrate our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Precise Asymptotics of Bagging Regularized M-estimators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We characterize the squared prediction risk of ensemble estimators obtained through subagging (subsample bootstrap aggregating) regularized M-estimators and construct a consistent estimator for the risk. Specifically, we consider a heterogeneous collection of $M \ge 1$ regularized M-estimators, each trained with (possibly different) subsample sizes, convex differentiable losses, and convex regularizers. We operate under the proportional asymptotics regime, where the sample size $n$, feature size $p$, and subsample sizes $k_m$ for $m \in [M]$ all diverge with fixed limiting ratios $n/p$ and $k_m/n$. Key to our analysis is a new result on the joint asymptotic behavior of correlations between the estimator and residual errors on overlapping subsamples, governed through a (provably) contractible nonlinear system of equations. Of independent interest, we also establish convergence of trace functionals related to degrees of freedom in the non-ensemble setting (with $M = 1$) along the way, extending previously known cases for square loss and ridge, lasso regularizers.
  When specialized to homogeneous ensembles trained with a common loss, regularizer, and subsample size, the risk characterization sheds some light on the implicit regularization effect due to the ensemble and subsample sizes $(M,k)$. For any ensemble size $M$, optimally tuning subsample size yields sample-wise monotonic risk. For the full-ensemble estimator (when $M \to \infty$), the optimal subsample size $k^\star$ tends to be in the overparameterized regime $(k^\star \le \min\{n,p\})$, when explicit regularization is vanishing. Finally, joint optimization of subsample size, ensemble size, and regularization can significantly outperform regularizer optimization alone on the full data (without any subagging).</description>

      <title>Certified Multi-Fidelity Zeroth-Order Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.00978v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of multi-fidelity zeroth-order optimization, where one can evaluate a function $f$ at various approximation levels (of varying costs), and the goal is to optimize $f$ with the cheapest evaluations possible. In this paper, we study certified algorithms, which are additionally required to output a data-driven upper bound on the optimization error. We first formalize the problem in terms of a min-max game between an algorithm and an evaluation environment. We then propose a certified variant of the MFDOO algorithm and derive a bound on its cost complexity for any Lipschitz function $f$. We also prove an $f$-dependent lower bound showing that this algorithm has a near-optimal cost complexity. As a direct example, we close the paper by addressing the special case of noisy (stochastic) evaluations, which corresponds to $\eps$-best arm identification in Lipschitz bandits with continuously many arms.</description>

      <title>Online Performance Estimation with Unlabeled Data: A Bayesian Application of the Hui-Walter Paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09376v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the industrial practice of machine learning and statistical modeling, practitioners often work under the assumption of accessible, static, labeled data for evaluation and training. However, this assumption often deviates from reality, where data may be private, encrypted, difficult-to-measure, or unlabeled. In this paper, we bridge this gap by adapting the Hui-Walter paradigm, a method traditionally applied in epidemiology and medicine, to the field of machine learning. This approach enables us to estimate key performance metrics such as false positive rate, false negative rate, and priors in scenarios where no ground truth is available. We further extend this paradigm for handling online data, opening up new possibilities for dynamic data environments. Our methodology involves partitioning data into latent classes to simulate multiple data populations (if natural populations are unavailable) and independently training models to replicate multiple tests. By cross-tabulating binary outcomes across multiple categorizers and multiple populations, we are able to estimate unknown parameters through Gibbs sampling, eliminating the need for ground-truth or labeled data. This paper showcases the potential of our methodology to transform machine learning practices by allowing for accurate model assessment under dynamic and uncertain data conditions.</description>

      <title>Spatio-temporal point process intensity estimation using zero-deflated subsampling applied to a lightning strikes dataset in France</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11564v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cloud-to-ground lightning strikes observed in a specific geographical domain over time can be naturally modeled by a spatio-temporal point process. Our focus lies in the parametric estimation of its intensity function, incorporating both spatial factors (such as altitude) and spatio-temporal covariates (such as field temperature, precipitation, etc.). The events are observed in France over a span of three years. Spatio-temporal covariates are observed with resolution $0.1^\circ \times 0.1^\circ$  ($\approx 100$km$^2$) and six-hour periods. This results in an extensive dataset, further characterized by a significant excess of zeroes (i.e., spatio-temporal cells with no observed events). We reexamine composite likelihood methods commonly employed for spatial point processes, especially in situations where covariates are piecewise constant. Additionally, we extend these methods to account for zero-deflated subsampling, a strategy involving dependent subsampling, with a focus on selecting more cells in regions where events are observed. A simulation study is conducted to illustrate these novel methodologies, followed by their application to the dataset of lightning strikes.</description>

      <title>A Modified Satterthwaite (1941,1946) Effective Degrees of Freedom Approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14606v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study introduces a correction to the approximation of effective degrees of freedom as proposed by Satterthwaite (1941, 1946), specifically addressing scenarios where component degrees of freedom are small. The correction is grounded in analytical results concerning the moments of standard normal random variables. This modification is applicable to complex variance estimates that involve both small and large degrees of freedom, offering an enhanced approximation of the higher moments required by Satterthwaite's framework. Additionally, this correction extends and partially validates the empirically derived adjustment by Johnson &amp; Rust (1992), as it is based on theoretical foundations rather than simulations used to derive empirical transformation constants.</description>
