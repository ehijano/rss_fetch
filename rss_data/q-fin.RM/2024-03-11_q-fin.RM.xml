      <title>On Geometrically Convex Risk Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geometrically convex functions constitute an interesting class of functions obtained by replacing the arithmetic mean with the geometric mean in the definition of convexity. As recently suggested, geometric convexity may be a sensible property for financial risk measures ([7,13,4]).
  We introduce a notion of GG-convex conjugate, parallel to the classical notion of convex conjugate introduced by Fenchel, and we discuss its properties. We show how GG-convex conjugation can be axiomatized in the spirit of the notion of general duality transforms introduced in [2,3].
  We then move to the study of GG-convex risk measures, which are defined as GG-convex functionals defined on suitable spaces of random variables. We derive a general dual representation that extends analogous expressions presented in [4] under the additional assumptions of monotonicity and positive homogeneity. As a prominent example, we study the family of Orlicz risk measures. Finally, we introduce multiplicative versions of the convex and of the increasing convex order and discuss related consistency properties of law-invariant GG-convex risk measures.</description>

      <title>Financial Default Prediction via Motif-preserving Graph Neural Network with Curriculum Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: User financial default prediction plays a critical role in credit risk forecasting and management. It aims at predicting the probability that the user will fail to make the repayments in the future. Previous methods mainly extract a set of user individual features regarding his own profiles and behaviors and build a binary-classification model to make default predictions. However, these methods cannot get satisfied results, especially for users with limited information. Although recent efforts suggest that default prediction can be improved by social relations, they fail to capture the higher-order topology structure at the level of small subgraph patterns. In this paper, we fill in this gap by proposing a motif-preserving Graph Neural Network with curriculum learning (MotifGNN) to jointly learn the lower-order structures from the original graph and higherorder structures from multi-view motif-based graphs for financial default prediction. Specifically, to solve the problem of weak connectivity in motif-based graphs, we design the motif-based gating mechanism. It utilizes the information learned from the original graph with good connectivity to strengthen the learning of the higher-order structure. And considering that the motif patterns of different samples are highly unbalanced, we propose a curriculum learning mechanism on the whole learning process to more focus on the samples with uncommon motif distributions. Extensive experiments on one public dataset and two industrial datasets all demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.</description>
