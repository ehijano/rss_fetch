      <title>Information Greenhouse: Optimal Persuasion for Medical Test-Avoiders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Patients often delay or reject medical tests due to information avoidance, which hinders timely reception of necessary treatments. This paper studies the optimal information policy to persuade an information-avoidant patient to undergo the test and make the best choice that maximizes his health. The patient sequentially decides whether to take the test and the optimal treatment plan. The information provided is about the background knowledge of the disease, which is complementary with the test result, and disclosure can take place both before and after the test decision. The optimal information policy depends on whether the patient is willing to be tested when he is completely pessimistic. If so, the optimal policy features \textit{preemptive warning}: the disclosure only takes place before the test, and the bad news guarantees the patient to be tested and be treated even without further information. If not, the optimal policy constructs an \textit{information greenhouse}: an information structure that provides high anticipatory utility is committed when the patient is tested and the test result is bad. I consider extensions to general information preference and ex ante participation constraint.</description>

      <title>An extension of May's Theorem to three alternatives: axiomatizing Minimax voting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14256v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: May's Theorem [K. O. May, Econometrica 20 (1952) 680-684] characterizes majority voting on two alternatives as the unique preferential voting method satisfying several simple axioms. Here we show that by adding some desirable axioms to May's axioms, we can uniquely determine how to vote on three alternatives (setting aside tiebreaking). In particular, we add two axioms stating that the voting method should mitigate spoiler effects and avoid the so-called strong no show paradox. We prove a theorem stating that any preferential voting method satisfying our enlarged set of axioms, which includes some weak homogeneity and preservation axioms, must choose from among the Minimax winners in all three-alternative elections. When applied to more than three alternatives, our axioms also distinguish Minimax from other known voting methods that coincide with or refine Minimax for three alternatives.</description>

      <title>Monitoring with Rich Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16789v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider moral hazard problems where a principal has access to rich monitoring data about an agent's action. Rather than focusing on optimal contracts (which are known to in general be complicated), we characterize the optimal rate at which the principal's payoffs can converge to the first-best payoff as the amount of data grows large. Our main result suggests a novel rationale for the widely observed binary wage schemes, by showing that such simple contracts achieve the optimal convergence rate. Notably, in order to attain the optimal convergence rate, the principal must set a lenient cutoff for when the agent receives a high vs. low wage. In contrast, we find that other common contracts where wages vary more finely with observed data (e.g., linear contracts) approximate the first-best at a highly suboptimal rate. Finally, we show that the optimal convergence rate depends only on a simple summary statistic of the monitoring technology. This yields a detail-free ranking over monitoring technologies that quantifies their value for incentive provision in data-rich settings and applies regardless of the agent's specific utility or cost functions.</description>
