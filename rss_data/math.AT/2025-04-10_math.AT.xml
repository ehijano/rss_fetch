      <title>Power Operations on $K(n-1)$-Localized Morava $E$-theory at Height $n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the $K(n-1)$-localized $E_n$ theory for symmetric groups, and deduce a modular interpretation of the total power operation $\psi^p_F$ on $F=L_{K(n-1)}E_n$ in terms of augmented deformations of formal groups and their subgroups. We compute the Dyer-Lashof algebra structure over $K(n-1)$-local $E_n$-algebra. Then we specify our calculation to the $n=2$ case. We calculate an explicit formula for $\psi^p_F$ using the formula of $\psi^p_E$, and explain connections between these computations and elliptic curves, modular forms and $p$-divisible groups.</description>

      <title>SKK groups of manifolds and non-unitary invertible TQFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work considers the computation of controllable cut-and-paste groups $\mathrm{SKK}^{\xi}_n$ of manifolds with tangential structure $\xi:B_n\to BO_n$. To this end, we apply the work of Galatius-Madsen-Tillman-Weiss, Genauer and Schommer-Pries, who showed that for a wide range of structures $\xi$ these groups fit into a short exact sequence that relates them to bordism groups of $\xi$-manifolds with kernel generated by the disc-bounding $\xi$-sphere. The order of this sphere can be computed by knowing the possible values of the Euler characteristic of $\xi$-manifolds. We are thus led to address two key questions: the existence of $\xi$-manifolds with odd Euler characteristic of a given dimension and conditions for the exact sequence to admit a splitting. We resolve these questions in a wide range of cases.
  $\mathrm{SKK}$ groups are of interest in physics as they play a role in the classification of non-unitary invertible topological quantum field theories, which classify anomalies and symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases of matter. Applying our topological results, we give a complete classification of non-unitary invertible topological quantum field theories in the tenfold way in dimensions 1-5.</description>

      <title>Cech - de Rham Chern character on the stack of holomorphic vector bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a formula for the Chern character of a holomorphic vector bundle in the hyper-cohomology of the de Rham complex of holomorphic sheaves on a complex manifold. This Chern character can be thought of as a completion of the Chern character in Hodge cohomology obtained as the trace of the exponential of the Atiyah class, which is \v{C}ech closed, to one that is \v{C}ech-Del closed. Such a completion is a key step toward lifting O'Brian-Toledo-Tong invariants of coherent sheaves from Hodge cohomology to de Rham cohomology. An alternate approach toward the same end goal, instead using simplicial differential forms and Green complexes, can be found in Hosgood's works [Ho1, Ho2]. In the algebraic setting, and more generally for K\"{a}hler manifolds, where Hodge and de Rham cohomologies agree, such extensions are not necessary, whereas in the non-K\"{a}hler, or equivariant settings the two theories differ. We provide our formulae as a map of simplicial presheaves, which readily extend the results to the equivariant setting and beyond. This paper can be viewed as a sequel to [GMTZ1] which covered such a discussion in Hodge cohomology. As an aside, we give a conceptual understanding of how formulas obtained by Bott and Tu for Chern classes using transition functions and those from Chern-Weil theory using connections, are part of a natural unifying story.</description>

      <title>Standard $t$-structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a general construction of induced $t$-structures, that generalizes standard $t$-structures for $\infty$-categories of sheaves. More precisely, given a presentable $\infty$-category $\mathcal{X}$ and a presentable stable $\infty$-category $\mathcal{E}$ equipped with an accessible $t$-structure $\tau = (\mathcal{E}_{\geq 0}, \mathcal{E}_{\leq 0})$, we show that $\mathcal{X} \otimes \mathcal{E}$ is equipped with a canonical $t$-structure whose coconnective part is given in $\mathcal{X} \otimes \mathcal{E}_{\leq 0}$. When $\mathcal{X}$ is an $\infty$-topos, we give a more explicit description of the connective part as well.</description>

      <title>Computing gradient vector fields with Morse sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We rely on the framework of Morse sequences to enable the direct computation of gradient vector fields on simplicial complexes. A Morse sequence is a filtration from a subcomplex L to a complex K via elementary expansions and fillings, naturally encoding critical and regular simplexes. Maximal increasing and minimal decreasing schemes allow constructing these sequences, and are linked to algorithms like Random Discrete Morse and Coreduction. Extending the approach to cosimplicial complexes (S = K \ L), we define operations -- reductions, perforations, coreductions, and coperforations -- for efficient computation. We further generalize to F -sequences, which are Morse sequences weighted by an arbitrary stack function F , and provide algorithms to compute maximal and minimal sequences. A particular case is when the stack function is given through a vertex map, as it is common in topological data analysis. We show that we retrieve existing methods when the vertex map is injective; in this case, the complex partitions into lower stars, facilitating parallel processing. Thus, this paper proposes simple, flexible, and computationally efficient approaches to obtain Morse sequences from arbitrary stack functions, allowing to generalize previous approaches dedicated to computing gradient vector fields from injective vertex maps.</description>

      <title>Hardness of 4-Colourings G-Colourable Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the complexity of a class of promise graph homomorphism problems. For a fixed graph H, the H-colouring problem is to decide whether a given graph has a homomorphism to H. By a result of Hell and Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il, this problem is NP-hard for any non-bipartite loop-less graph H. Brakensiek and Guruswami [SODA 2018] conjectured the hardness extends to promise graph homomorphism problems as follows: fix a pair of non-bipartite loop-less graphs G, H such that there is a homomorphism from G to H, it is NP-hard to distinguish between graphs that are G-colourable and those that are not H-colourable. We confirm this conjecture in the cases when both G and H are 4-colourable. This is a common generalisation of previous results of Khanna, Linial, and Safra [Comb. 20(3): 393-415 (2000)] and of Krokhin and Opr\v{s}al [FOCS 2019]. The result is obtained by combining the algebraic approach to promise constraint satisfaction with methods of topological combinatorics and equivariant obstruction theory.</description>

      <title>Filtering through a topological lens: homology for point processes on the time-frequency plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a very general approach to the analysis of signals from their noisy measurements from the perspective of Topological Data Analysis (TDA). While TDA has emerged as a powerful analytical tool for data with pronounced topological structures, here we demonstrate its applicability for general problems of signal processing, without any a-priori geometric feature. Our methods are well-suited to a wide array of time-dependent signals in different scientific domains, with acoustic signals being a particularly important application. We invoke time-frequency representations of such signals, focusing on their zeros which are gaining salience as a signal processing tool in view of their stability properties. Leveraging state-of-the-art topological concepts, such as stable and minimal volumes, we develop a complete suite of TDA-based methods to explore the delicate stochastic geometry of these zeros, capturing signals based on the disruption they cause to this rigid, hyperuniform spatial structure. Unlike classical spatial data tools, TDA is able to capture the full spectrum of the stochastic geometry of the zeros, thereby leading to powerful inferential outcomes that are underpinned by a principled statistical foundation. This is reflected in the power and versatility of our applications, which include competitive performance in processing. a wide variety of audio signals (esp. in low SNR regimes), effective detection and reconstruction of gravitational wave signals (a reputed signal processing challenge with non-Gaussian noise), and medical time series data from EEGs, indicating a wide horizon for the approach and methods introduced in this paper.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2008.03363v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using techniques of A^1-homotopy theory, we produce motivic lifts of elements in classical homotopy groups of spheres; these lifts provide polynomial maps of spheres and allow us to construct ``low rank'' algebraic vector bundles on ``simple'' smooth affine varieties of high dimension.</description>
