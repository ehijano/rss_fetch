      <title>Gravitational wave memory: further examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ehlers and Kundt [1] argued in favor of the velocity effect: particles initally at rest hit by a burst of gravitational waves should fly apart with constant velocity after the wave has passed. Zel'dovich and Polnarev [2] suggested instead that waves generated by flyby would be merely displaced. Their prediction is confirmed provided the wave parameters take some particular values.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Effects of Coupling Extended Proca-Nuevo Gravity on Cosmic Expansion with Recent Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Coupling Extended Proca-Nuevo gravity, a non-linear theory extending from dRGT massive gravity with a spin-1 field. This theory is shown to yield reliable, ghost-free cosmological solutions, modeling both the Universe's thermal history and late-time acceleration. By analyzing data from Dark energy spectroscopic instruments (DESI), Cosmic Chronometer (CCh), Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs), and Type Ia Supernova (SNeIa), we derive parameter constraints with up to 3$\sigma$ confidence, demonstrating good agreement with observations. Our comparison of $BAO$ data from $WiggleZ$ and $DESI$ highlights its constraining power on the Hubble constant. The analysis of the cosmographic parameter, $q$ shows the statistical compatibility with the recent data. Further, this indicates that Universe's current accelerated expansion aligns with quintessential behavior.</description>

      <title>Regular black holes from thin-shell collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish that regular black holes can form from gravitational collapse. Our model builds on a recent construction that realized regular black holes as exact solutions to purely gravitational theories that incorporate an infinite tower of higher curvature corrections in any dimension $D \ge 5$ [arXiv:2403.04827]. We identify a two-dimensional Horndeski theory that captures the spherically symmetric dynamics of the theories in question and use this to prove a Birkhoff theorem and obtain the generalized Israel junction conditions. Armed with these tools, we consider the collapse of thin shells of pressureless matter, showing that this leads generically to the formation of regular black holes. The interior dynamics we uncover is intricate, consisting of shell bounces and white hole explosions into a new universe. The result is that regular black holes are the unique spherically symmetric solutions of the corresponding theories and also the endpoint of gravitational collapse of matter. Along the way, we establish evidence for a solution-independent upper bound on the curvature, suggestive of Markov's limiting curvature hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Formation of Regular Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study dynamical gravitational collapse in a theory with an infinite tower of higher-derivative corrections to the Einstein-Hilbert action and we show that, under very general conditions, it leads to the formation of regular black holes. Our results are facilitated by the use of a class of theories that possess second-order equations on spherically symmetric metrics, but which are general enough to provide a basis for the gravitational effective action. We analytically solve the collapse of a thin shell of dust and show that it inevitably experiences a bounce at small radius and that its motion can be extended to arbitrary proper time. The collapse of the shell always gives rise to a singularity-free, geodesically complete spacetime that contains horizons if the total mass is above a critical value. In that case, the shell bounces into a new universe through a white hole explosion. Our construction provides, to the best of our knowlege, the first fully dynamical description of formation of regular black holes, and it suggests that higher-derivative corrections may be the most natural way to resolve the singularities of Einstein's theory.</description>

      <title>Deep in the Knotted Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the transition rate of a freely falling Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detector, coupled linearly to a massless scalar quantum field prepared in the Hartle-Hawking-Israel state, as a probe of the interior of a black hole. Specifically, we consider the transition rate of a detector in the spinless Ba\~nados-Teitelboim-Zanelli (BTZ) black hole as it freely falls toward and across the horizon and compare it to the corresponding situation for an $\mathbb{R}\text{P}^{2}$ geon. Both the BTZ black hole and its geon counterpart are quotients of $\text{AdS}_3$ spacetime that are identical exterior to the horizon but have different interior topologies. We find outside the horizon that the rates are qualitatively similar, but with the amplitude in the geon spacetime larger than in the BTZ case. Once the detector crosses the horizon, there are notable distinctions characterized by different discontinuities in the temporal derivative of the response rate. These discontinuities can appear outside the horizon if the detector is switched on at a sufficiently early time, within the past white hole horizon. In general, the detector can act as an `early warning system' that both spots the black hole horizon and discerns its interior topology.</description>

      <title>Quasi-normal mode expansions of black hole perturbations: a hyperboloidal Keldysh's approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study asymptotic quasinormal mode expansions of linear fields propagating on a black hole background by adopting a Keldysh scheme for the spectral construction of the resonant expansions. This scheme requires to cast quasinormal modes in terms of a non-selfadjoint problem, something achieved by adopting a hyperboloidal scheme for black hole perturbations. The method provides a spectral version of Lax-Phillips resonant expansions, adapted to the hyperboloidal framework, and extends and generalises Ansorg &amp; Macedo black hole quasinormal mode expansions beyond one-dimensional problems. We clarify the role of scalar product structures in the Keldysh construction that prove non-necessary to construct the resonant expansion, in particular providing a unique quasinormal mode time-series at null infinity, but are required to define constant coefficients in the bulk resonant expansion by introducing a notion of 'size' (norm). By (numerical) comparison with the time-domain signal for test-bed initial data, we demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the Keldysh spectral approach. Indeed, we are able to recover Schwarzschild black hole tails, something that goes beyond the a priori limits of validity of the method and constitutes one of the main results. We also demonstrate the critical role of highly-damped quasinormal mode overtones to accurately account for the early time behaviour. As a by-product of the analysis, we present the Weyl law for the counting of quasinormal modes in black holes with different (flat, De Sitter, anti-De Sitter) asymptotics, as well as the $H^p$-Sobolev pseudospectra for the P\"oschl-Teller potential.</description>

      <title>Extremal Black Hole Weather</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider weakly non-linear gravitational perturbations of a near-extremal Kerr black hole governed by the second order vacuum Einstein equation. Using the GHZ formalism [Green et al., Class. Quant. Grav. 7(7):075001, 2020], these are parameterized by a Hertz potential. We make an ansatz for the Hertz potential as a series of zero-damped quasinormal modes with time-dependent amplitudes, and derive a non-linear dynamical system for them. We find that our dynamical system has a time-independent solution within the near horizon scaling limit. This equilibrium solution is supported on axisymmetric modes, with amplitudes scaling as $c_\ell \sim C^{\rm low} 2^{-\ell/2} \ell^{-\frac{7}{2}}$ for large polar angular momentum mode number $\ell$, where $C^{\rm low}$ is a cumulative amplitude of the low $\ell$ modes. We interpret our result as evidence that the dynamical evolution will approach, for a parametrically long time as extremality is approached, a distribution of mode amplitudes dyadically exponentially suppressed in $\ell$, hence as the endpoint of an inverse cascade. It is reminiscent of weather-like phenomena in certain models of atmospheric dynamics of rotating bodies. During the timescale considered, the decay of the QNMs themselves plays no role given their parametrically long half-life. Hence, our result is due entirely to weakly non-linear effects.</description>

      <title>Impact of the Hawking Effect on the Fully Entangled Fraction of Three-qubit States in Schwarzschild Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wu et al. [J. High Energ. Phys. 2023, 232 (2023)] first found that the fidelity of quantum teleportation with a bipartite entangled resource state, completely determined by the fully entangled fraction (FEF) characterized by the maximal fidelity between the given quantum state and the set of maximally entangled states, can monotonically increase in Schwarzschild spacetime. We investigated the Hawking effect on the FEF of quantum states in tripartite systems. In this paper, we show that the Hawking effect of a black hole may both decrease and increase the FEF in Schwarzschild spacetime. For an initial X-type state, we found that the Hawking effect of the black hole has both positive and negative impacts on the FEF of Dirac fields, depending on the selection of initial states. For an initial W-like state, the Hawking effect of the black hole has only a positive impact on the FEF of Dirac fields, independent of the selection of initial states. Our results provide an insightful view of quantum teleportation in multipartite systems under the influence of Hawking effects, from the perspective of quantum information and general relativity.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the global structures of neutron stars within the framework of general relativity, treating the entire star as a quantum-degenerate system. Rather than relying on the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equation, we solve the Einstein-Cartan (EC) field equations self-consistently, incorporating the energy-momentum tensor contributions from neutrons. Neutron wave functions are obtained by solving the Dirac equation in a curved spacetime with both torsion and curvature effects. Given that neutron stars contain about 10^57 particles, we adopt a scaled h-bar approach to efficiently describe the quantum state of highly degenerate system.</description>

      <title>Chebyshev cosmography in the framework of extended symmetric teleparallel theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmography has been extensively utilized to constrain the kinematic state of the Universe using measured distances. In this work, we propose a new method to reconstruct coupling theories using the first kind of Chebyshev polynomial for two variables in which the functional form of the $f(Q,T)$ theory has been obtained. Further, the unknowns that appeared in the series are constrained using the cosmographic parameters. We find the explicit form of the luminosity distance in terms of cosmographic parameters to perform MCMC analysis using the PANTHEON+SH0ES data set. Through the distance modulus function, we observe that the result comes out to be an excellent match to the standard cosmological model and data.</description>

      <title>Neutron star in Logarithmic model of Cartan $F(R)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cartan $F(R)$ gravity introduces the equivalent scalar-tensor theory by the effect of torsion. The interaction coupled with the scalar field and four-fermion term is derived through local Lorentz symmetry. We put the fermion model with a mechanism of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking to the Cartan $F(R)$ gravity. We numerically analyze neutron stars incorporating scalar fields with the obtained effective potentials and evaluate their effects. As a result, the effect is insignificant at dark energy and QCD scales, while corrections to the minimum mass of neutron stars appear at tens of MeV scale corrections. This could give theoretical plausibility to the current observations.</description>

      <title>Extending Finch-Skea Isotropic Model to Anisotropic Domain in Modified $f(\mathcal{R},\mathcal{T})$ Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers the Finch-Skea isotropic solution and extends its domain to three different anisotropic interiors by using the gravitational decoupling strategy in the context of $f(\mathcal{R},\mathcal{T})$ gravitational theory. For this, we consider that a static spherical spacetime is initially coupled with the perfect matter distribution. We then introduce a Lagrangian corresponding to a new gravitating source by keeping in mind that this new source produces the effect of pressure anisotropy in the parent fluid source. After calculating the field equations for the total matter setup, we apply a transformation on the radial component, ultimately providing two different systems of equations. These two sets are solved independently through different constraints that lead to some new solutions. Further, we consider an exterior spacetime to calculate three constants engaged in the seed Finch-Skea solution at the spherical interface. The estimated radius and mass of a star candidate LMC X-4 are utilized to perform the graphical analysis of the developed models. It is concluded that only the first two resulting models are physically relevant in this modified theory for all the considered parametric choices.</description>

      <title>Quiescent Big Bang formation in $2+1$ dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the past asymptotics of $(2+1)$-dimensional solutions to the Einstein scalar-field Vlasov system which are close to Friedman-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker spacetimes on an initial hypersurface diffeomorphic to a closed orientable surface $M$ of arbitrary genus. We prove that such solutions are past causally geodesically incomplete and exhibit stable Kretschmann scalar blow-up in the contracting direction. In particular, they are $C^2$-inextendible towards the past where causal geodesics become incomplete. Moreover, we show that geometry and matter are asymptotically velocity term dominated toward the past, remaining close to their background counterparts. Where the asymptotics do not coincide with those of the isotropic background solution, the momentum support of the Vlasov distribution approaches a smooth one-dimensional subbundle of the mass shell. Compared to previous results in higher dimensions, inhomogeneous terms in the wave and Vlasov equations factor in more strongly in our setting, which a priori creates additional hurdles to establish stability. As a corollary, our main result shows that the Strong Cosmic Censorship conjecture holds for certain polarized $U(1)$-symmetric solutions to the Einstein vacuum equations that emanate from a spatial hypersurface diffeomorphic to $M\times\mathbb{S}^1$.</description>

      <title>An asymptotic characterisation of the Kerr spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a characterisation of the Kerr spacetime close to future null infinity using the asymptotic characteristic initial value problem in a conformally compactified spacetime. Stewart's gauge is used to set up the past-oriented characteristic initial value problem. By a theorem of M. Mars characterising the Kerr spacetime, we provide conditions for the existence of an asymptotically timelike Killing vector on the development of the initial data by demanding that the spacetime is endowed with a Killing spinor. The conditions on the characteristic initial data ensuring the existence of a Killing spinor are, in turn, analysed. Finally, we write the conditions on the initial data in terms of the free data in the characteristic initial value problem. As a result, we characterise the Kerr spacetime using only a section of future null infinity and its intersection with an outgoing null hypersurface.</description>

      <title>The impact of initial conditions on quasi-normal modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the influence of initial conditions on the evolution and properties of linear quasi-normal modes (QNMs). Using a toy model in which the quasi-normal mode can be unambiguously identified, we highlight an aspect of QNMs that is long known yet often ignored: the amplitude of a QNM (after factoring out the corresponding exponential with a complex frequency) is not constant but instead varies with time. We stress that this is true even within the regime of validity of linear perturbation theory. The precise time variation depends on the initial conditions. In particular, it is possible to find initial conditions for which the QNM fails to materialize; it is also possible to find those for which the QNM amplitude grows indefinitely. Focusing on cases where the QNM amplitude does stabilize at late times, we explore how the timescale for amplitude stabilization depends on the shape and location of the initial perturbation profile. Our findings underscore the need for care in fitting linear QNMs to ringdown data. They also suggest recent computations of quadratic QNMs, sourced purely by {\it stabilized} linear QNMs, do not fully capture what determines the amplitude of the quadratic QNMs, even at late times. Our results motivate a detailed investigation of the initial perturbations generated in the aftermath of a binary merger.</description>

      <title>Decoding Long-duration Gravitational Waves from Binary Neutron Stars with Machine Learning: Parameter Estimation and Equations of State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) from binary neutron stars (BNSs) offer valuable understanding of the nature of compact objects and hadronic matter. However, their analysis requires substantial computational resources due to the challenges in Bayesian stochastic sampling. The third-generation (3G) GW detectors are expected to detect BNS signals with significantly increased signal duration, detection rates, and signal strength, leading to a major computational burden in the 3G era. We demonstrate a machine learning-based workflow capable of producing source parameter estimation and constraints on equations of state (EOSs) for hours-long BNS signals in seconds with minimal hardware costs. We employ efficient compressions on the GW data and EOS using neural networks, based on which we build normalizing flows for inferences. Given that full Bayesian analysis is prohibitively time-intensive, we validate our model against (semi-)analytical predictions. Additionally, we estimate the computational demands of BNS signal analysis in the 3G era, showing that the machine learning methods will be crucial for future catalog-level analysis.</description>

      <title>Big Bang as spacetime defect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review the suggestion that it is possible to eliminate the Big Bang curvature singularity of the Friedman cosmological solution by considering a particular type of degenerate spacetime metric. Specifically, we take the 4-dimensional spacetime metric to have a 3-dimensional defect with a vanishing determinant of the metric. This new solution suggests the existence of another "side" of the Big Bang (perhaps a more appropriate description than "pre-big-bang" phase used in our original paper). The corresponding new solution for defect wormholes is also briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Acoustic black holes, white holes, and wormholes in Bose-Einstein condensates in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a previous article, we studied stationary solutions to the dynamics of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) corresponding to acoustic (or Unruh) black/white holes, namely configurations where the flow becomes supersonic creating a horizon for phonons. In this paper, we consider again the Gross-Pitaevskii Equation (GPE) but looking for stationary numerical solutions in the case where the couplings are position dependent in a prescribed manner. Initially we consider a 2D quantum gas in a funnel-like spatial metric. We then reinterpret this solution as a solution in a flat metric but with spatially dependent coupling and external potential. In these solutions the local speed of sound and magnitude of flow velocity cross, indicating the existence of a supersonic region and therefore of sonic analogues of black/white holes and wormholes. We discuss the numerical techniques used. We also study phase (and density) fluctuations in these solutions and derive approximate acoustic metric tensors. For certain external potentials, we find uniform density acoustic black hole configurations and obtain their Hawking temperature.</description>

      <title>Self-Similar acoustic white hole solutions in Bose-Einstein condensates and their Borel analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study Self-Similar configurations of non-relativistic Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) described by the Gross-Pitaevskii Equation (GPE). To be precise, we discuss singular Self-similar solutions of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation in 2D (with circular symmetry) and 3D (with spherical symmetry). We use these solutions to check for the crossover between the local speed of sound in the condensate and the magnitude of the flow velocity of the condensate, indicating the existence of a supersonic region and thus a sonic analog of a black/white hole. This is because phonons cannot go against the condensate flow from the supersonic to the subsonic region in such a system. We also discuss numerical techniques used and study the semi-analytical Laplace-Borel resummation of asymptotic series solutions while making use of the asymptotic transseries to justify the choice of numerical and semi-analytical approaches taken.</description>

      <title>Dark matter fraction derived from the M31 rotation curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mass estimates derived from galactic rotation curves must account for past accretion histories of galaxies. There are several lines of evidence indicating that M31 experienced a major merger 2 to 3 Gyr ago. Here, we have generated a dynamical model of M31 as a merger remnant that reproduces most of its properties, from the central bar to the outskirts. The model accounts for the past major merger, and reproduces the details of M31's rotation curve, including its 14 kpc bump and the observed increase of velocity beyond 25 kpc. Furthermore, we find non-equilibrium and oscillatory motions in the gas of the merger-remnant outskirts caused by material in a tidal tail returning to the merger remnant. A total dynamical M31 mass of 4.5 $\times 10^{11} M_{\odot}$ within 137 kpc has been obtained after scaling it to the observed HI rotation curve. Within this radial distance, 68% of the total dynamical mass is dark.</description>

      <title>Gravitational-Wave Signatures of Nonstandard Neutrino Properties in Collapsing Stellar Cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel multi-messenger approach for probing nonstandard neutrino properties through the detection of gravitational waves (GWs) from collapsing stellar cores and associated supernova explosions. We show that neutrino flavor conversion inside the proto-neutron star (PNS), motivated by physics Beyond the Standard Model (BSM), can significantly boost PNS convection. This effect leads to large-amplitude GW emission over a wide frequency range during an otherwise relatively quiescent GW phase shortly after core bounce. Such a signal provides a promising new avenue for exploring nonstandard neutrino phenomena and other BSM physics impacting PNS convection.</description>

      <title>Quantum scalar field theory on equal-angular-momenta Myers-Perry-AdS black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the canonical quantization of a massive scalar field on a five dimensional, rotating black hole space-time. We focus on the case where the space-time is asymptotically anti-de Sitter and the black hole's two angular momentum parameters are equal. In this situation the geometry possesses additional symmetries which simplify both the mode solutions of the scalar field equation and the stress-energy tensor. When the angular momentum of the black hole is sufficiently small that there is no speed-of-light surface, there exists a Killing vector which is time-like in the region exterior to the event horizon. In this case classical superradiance is absent and we construct analogues of the usual Boulware and Hartle-Hawking quantum states for the quantum scalar field. We compute the differences in expectation values of the square of the quantum scalar field operator and the stress-energy tensor operator between these two quantum states.</description>

      <title>Probability Distribution for Vacuum Energy Flux Fluctuations in Two Spacetime Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The probability distribution for vacuum fluctuations of the energy flux in two dimensions will be constructed, along with the joint distribution of energy flux and energy density. Our approach will be based on previous work on probability distributions for the energy density in two dimensional conformal field theory. In both cases, the relevant stress tensor component must be averaged in time, and the results are sensitive to the form of the averaging function. Here we present results for two classes of such functions, which include the Gaussian and Lorentzian functions. The distribution for the energy flux is symmetric, unlike that for the energy density. In both cases, the distribution may possess an integrable singularity. The functional form of the flux distribution function involves a modified Bessel function, and is distinct from the shifted Gamma form for the energy density. By considering the joint distribution of energy flux and energy density, we show that the distribution of energy flux tends to be more centrally concentrated than that of the energy density. We also determine the distribution of energy fluxes, conditioned on the energy density being negative. Some applications of the results will be discussed.</description>

      <title>Efficient reanalysis of events from GWTC-3 with RIFT and asimov</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Different waveform models can yield notably different conclusions about the properties of individual gravitational wave events. For instance, previous analyses using the SEOBNRv4PHM, IMRPhenomXPHM models, and NRSur7dq4 have led to varying results regarding event properties. This variability complicates the interpretation of the data and understanding of the astrophysical phenomena involved. There is an ongoing need to reassess candidate events with the best available interpretations and models. Current approaches lack efficiency or consistency, making it challenging to perform large-scale reanalyses with updated models or improved techniques. It is imperative that investigations into waveform systematics be reproducible. Frameworks like asimov can facilitate large-scale reanalyses with consistent settings and high-quality results, and can reliably show how different waveform models affect the interpretation of gravitational wave events. This, in combination with other provided tools, allow for reanalysis of several events from the GWTC-3 catalog. We include access to full analysis settings that facilitate public use of GWOSC data on the Open Science Grid, particularly those conducted with the IMRPhenomPv2, SEOBNRv4PHM, SEOBNRv5PHM, and NRSur7dq4 waveform models. Our parameter inference results find similar conclusions to previously published work: for several events, all models largely agree, but for a few exceptional events these models disagree substantially on the nature of the merging binary.</description>

      <title>Energy extraction from a rotating black hole via magnetic reconnection: parameters in reconnection models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Works on the energy extraction from a rotating black hole via magnetic reconnection attract more attentions in recent years. Discussions on this topic, however, are often based on many simplifications, such as assuming a circularly flowing bulk plasma and a fixed orientation angle. A significant gap remains between theoretical models and the magnetic reconnection occurring in real astrophysical scenarios. In our previous work, we investigated the influence of orientation angle on energy extraction and figured out the differences between the plunging and circularly flowing bulk plasma. We introduced the concept of covering factor to quantify the capability of an accretion system in extracting energy via magnetic reconnection from a rotating black hole. In this work, as an improvement, we extend our discussions by treating the parameters in reconnection models as free parameters, bringing the theoretical model closer to the situations in real astrophysical systems. We employ two reconnection models, in which the geometric index and the guide field fraction are respectively induced. We separately present the dependences of energy extraction on the geometric index and the guide field fraction. More importantly, we propose to define the averaged covering factor weighted by reconnection rate to quantify the overall capability of an accretion system in extracting energy via magnetic reconnection from a rotating black hole, under the assumption that the magnetic reconnection process occurs stochastically and randomly within the ergosphere.</description>

      <title>The anti-de Sitter supergeometry revisited</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a supergravity framework, the $\cal N$-extended anti-de Sitter (AdS) superspace in four spacetime dimensions, $\text{AdS}^{4|4\cal N} $, is a maximally symmetric background that is described by a curved superspace geometry with structure group $\mathsf{SL}(2, \mathbb{C}) \times \mathsf{U}({\cal N})$. On the other hand, within the group-theoretic setting, $\text{AdS}^{4|4{\cal N}} $ is realised as the coset superspace $\mathsf{OSp}(\cal{N}|4;\mathbb{R}) /\big[ \mathsf{SL}(2, \mathbb{C}) \times \mathsf{O}(\cal{N}) \big]$, with its structure group being $\mathsf{SL}(2, \mathbb{C}) \times \mathsf{O}({\cal N})$. Here we explain how the two frameworks are related. We give explicit realisations of $\text{AdS}^{4|4{\cal N}} $ as a conformally flat superspace, thus extending the ${\cal N}=1$ and ${\cal N}=2$ results available in the literature. As applications, we describe: (i) the $\kappa$-symmetric action for a superparticle in $\text{AdS}^{4|4{\cal N}} $; and (ii) some implications of conformal flatness in the ${\cal N}=2$ case.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the impact of ideas of open quantum systems and quantum information to various facets of neutrino and neutral meson oscillations. These oscillations are characterized by a number of quantum correlations, both spatial as well as temporal. For neutrinos, the correlations are shown to be simple functions of the product of neutrino survival and oscillation probabilities. The quantum correlations in the neutral mesons are seen to be non-trivially different from their stable counterparts.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the particle creation rate in the context of quantum fields in curved spacetimes, by evaluating the imaginary part of the effective action up to second order in the curvatures. For arbitrary metrics in dimensions $D\geq4$, we express the vacuum persistence amplitude in terms of the Ricci scalar and the Weyl tensor, showing that, up to their second power, no particle creation occurs for conformal fields in conformally flat spacetimes. We pinpoint an analogy with the electromagnetic pair creation, by writing the squared Weyl tensor invariant in terms of its electric and magnetic parts. In addition, we present an alternative expression for the imaginary part of the effective action employing the Cotton tensor. This is particularly useful in $D=3$, where the Weyl tensor trivially vanishes and the Cotton tensor is related to conformal flatness. Finally, we highlight the importance of the threshold for particle creation, a point that has been overlooked in some recent studies.</description>

      <title>Impact of hyperons on structural properties of neutron stars and hybrid stars within four-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of hyperons and phase transition to quark matter on the structural properties of neutron stars within the four-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity (EGB). We employ the density-dependent relativistic mean-field model (DDME2) for the hadronic phase and the density-dependent quark mass (DDQM) model for the quark phase to construct hadronic and hybrid equations of state (EoSs) that are consistent with the astrophysical constraints. The presence of hyperons softens the EoS and with a phase transition, the EoS further softens, and the speed of sound squared drops to around 0.2 for the maximum mass configuration which lies in the pure quark phase. Adjusting the Gaussian-Bonnet coupling constant $\alpha$ within its allowed range results in a decrease in the mass-radius relationship for negative $\alpha$, and an increase for positive $\alpha$. In addition, functions are fitted to the maximum mass and its associated radius as a function of constant $\alpha$ to observe its impact on these properties.</description>

      <title>Revising the Spin and Kick Connection in Isolated Binary Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The origin of black hole (BH) spins remains one of the least understood aspects of BHs. Despite many uncertainties, it is commonly assumed that if BHs originated from isolated massive star binaries, their spins should be aligned with the orbital angular momentum of the binary system. This assumption stems from the notion that BHs inherit their spins from their progenitor stars. In this study, we relax this long-held viewpoint and explore various mechanisms that can spin up BHs before or during their formation. In addition to natal spins, we discuss physical processes that can spin BHs isotropically, parallel to natal kicks, and perpendicular to natal kicks. These different mechanisms leave behind distinct imprints on the observable distributions of spin magnitudes, spin-orbit misalignments and the effective inspiral spin of merging binaries. In particular, these mechanisms allow even the binaries originating in the field to exhibit precession and retrograde spin ($\chi_{\rm eff}&lt;0$). This broadens the parameter space allowed for isolated binary evolution into regimes which were previously thought to be exclusive to dynamically assembled binaries.</description>

Abstract: Recent observations by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have revealed the presence of bright and well-formed galaxies at high redshifts, challenging the predictions of the standard Lambda-Cold Dark Matter (LCDM) cosmological model. This paper explores the potential of Modified Gravity (MOG), specifically Scalar-Tensor-Vector Gravity (STVG), to account for the rapid formation of these galaxies in the early universe. By enhancing the gravitational constant through a dimensionless parameter $\alpha$ and incorporating a massive vector field $\phi_\mu$, MOG predicts deeper gravitational wells that can accelerate the collapse of baryonic matter. We present theoretical insights demonstrating how MOG can facilitate the increase in star formation rate and early formation of galaxies, offering a compelling alternative to LCDM. Our findings suggest that MOG provides a viable framework for understanding the rapid growth of galaxies observed by JWST.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.01617v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is common folklore that semiclassical arguments suggest that in black hole evaporation an initially pure state can become mixed. This is known as the \emph{information loss puzzle} (or {\it paradox}). Here we argue that, if taken at face value, semiclassical gravity suggests the formation of a final singularity instead of information loss. A quantum strong cosmic censorship conjecture, for which we give a rigorous statement, supports this conclusion. Thus, there are no reasons to expect a failure of unitarity in black hole evaporation or for any quantum gravity theory that can `cure' singularities.</description>

      <title>Late-time tails in nonlinear evolutions of merging black hole binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12968v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study nonlinear evolutions of binary black hole mergers, uncovering power-law contributions generated by the long-range behaviour of the highly-curved dynamical spacetime. The result is achieved by exploiting the strong increase of the tail relevance due to binary eccentricity, recently observed in perturbative evolutions of a small-mass-ratio binary under accurate radiation reaction by Albanesi and collaborators [PhysRevD.108.084037]. We demonstrate the presence of this enhancement even in the nonlinear case of comparable-mass binary mergers in eccentric orbits, using the public RIT waveform catalog. The instantaneous frequency of the simulations displays large oscillations at intermediate to late-times, due to interference terms in the transition between a fast-decaying, constant-frequency quasinormal-mode driven regime, and a power-law, slowly-decaying one. The power-law exponent displays broad convergence with perturbative predictions, although longer and more accurate simulations will be needed to pinpoint the asymptotic value. Our results offer yet another confirmation of the highly predictive power of black hole perturbation theory in the presence of a source, even when applied to nonlinear solutions. The magnitude of the tail signal is within reach of gravitational-wave detectors measurements, unlocking the possibility of observationally investigating an additional set of general relativistic predictions on the long-range dynamics of relaxing compact objects.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of plasma on deflection angle and shadow by a black hole solution immersed in perfect fluid in Rastall theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07657v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present study examines the gravitational deflection of particles in curved space-times immersed in perfect fluid in the context of Rastall theory, applying the Gibbons-Werner helpful technique. In its application to integral areas inside a four-dimensional space-time, the Gauss-Bonnet theorem studies the computation expression of the deflection angle. The Gibbons-Werner technique has two limitations in Rastall's theory for space-times immersed in perfect fluid: the integral region is generally infinite, and the integral complicates calculation, particularly for complex space-times and highly accurate solutions. An infinite region approach to Gibbons-Werner is proposed to avoid singularity. To demonstrate the Gibbons-Werner method, we use a complete Rastall theory framework. Using the Gibbons-Werner approach, black hole solutions like the dust field, radiation field, quintessence field, cosmological constant field, and phantom field are studied. Additionally, we check the deflection angle from these space-times under the influence of plasma. Furthermore, we analytically compute plasma's impact on a black hole shadow using a ray-tracing approach. Our model describes the plasma in the Hamiltonian equation, so the light ray motion equations are independent of the plasma's velocity. It is assumed that plasma is a dispersive medium, pressure-less and non-magnetized. We further investigate the perfect fluid in Rastall theory, where the plasma particle density corresponds to particle accumulation. The supermassive black hole shadows and emission energy are explored when plasma falls radially from infinity onto a black hole.</description>

      <title>Testing mirror symmetry in the Universe with LIGO-Virgo black-hole mergers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09861v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Certain precessing black-hole mergers produce gravitational waves with net circular polarization, understood as an imbalance between right- and left-handed amplitudes. According to the Cosmological Principle, such emission must average to zero across all binary mergers in our Universe to preserve mirror-reflection symmetry at very large scales. We present a new independent gravitational-wave test of this hypothesis. Using a novel observable based on the Chern-Pontryagin pseudo-scalar, we measure the emission of net circular polarization across 47 black-hole mergers recently analyzed by Islam et. al. with a state-of-the art model for precessing black-hole mergers in General Relativity. The average value obtained is consistent with zero. Remarkably, however, we find that at least $82\%$ of the analysed sources must have produced net circular polarization. Of these, GW200129 shows strong evidence for mirror asymmetry, with a Bayes Factor of 12.6 or, equivalently, $93.1\%$ probability. We obtain consistent (although stronger) results of $97.5\%$ and $94.3\%$ respectively using public results on this event from Hannam et. al. and performing our own parameter inference. This finding further implies evidence of astrophysical sources that can spontaneously emit circularly polarized photons by quantum effects. Forthcoming black-hole merger detections will enable stronger constraints on large-scale mirror asymmetry and the Cosmological Principle.</description>

      <title>Effect of Deviations from General Relativity on Searches for Gravitational Wave Microlensing and Type II Strong Lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08957v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As the gravitational wave detector network is upgraded and the sensitivity of the detectors improves, novel scientific avenues open for exploration. For example, tests of general relativity will become more accurate as smaller deviations can be probed. Additionally, the detection of lensed gravitational waves becomes more likely. However, these new avenues could also interact with each other, and a gravitational wave event presenting deviations from general relativity could be mistaken for a lensed one. Here, we explore how phenomenological deviations from general relativity or binaries of exotic compact objects could impact those lensing searches focusing on a single event. We consider strong lensing, millilensing, and microlensing and find that certain phenomenological deviations from general relativity may be mistaken for all of these types of lensing. Therefore, our study shows that future candidate lensing events would need to be carefully examined to avoid a false claim of lensing where instead a deviation from general relativity has been seen.</description>

      <title>Motion of spinning particles around a polymer black hole in loop quantum gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14164v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the curved spacetime background, the trajectory of a spinning test particle will deviate from the geodesic. Using the effective potential method, we study the motion of a spinning test particle on the equatorial plane of a polymer black hole in loop quantum gravity described by the Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon equations with minimal spin-gravity interaction. We find that for the bounded orbits in the radial direction, the particle's motion is timelike when its spin is small. The radial range of the orbit and its eccentricity decrease with the loop quantum gravity parameter. However, when the particle takes a large enough spin, we observe an interesting phenomenon that the timelike and spacelike motions alternately appear while are separated by a critical radius. Outside the critical radius, the motion is timelike, however inside it is spacelike, and on the radius $r_c$ it is null. This property shares similarities with the event horizon radius. However, unlike the event horizon radius, the value of $r_c$ is related to both the particle's motion and the black hole parameters. To explore more observable effects of the loop quantum gravity parameter on the motion of the spinning particle, we focus our attention on the circular orbits, particularly the innermost stable circular orbits, near the black hole. The result shows that for the same spin, there are two different innermost stable circular orbits, one with a larger radius and the other with a smaller radius. Both the radii decrease as the loop quantum gravity parameter increases. More significantly, with the increase of the spin of the particle, the small innermost stable circular orbit transition from timelike to spacelike, while the one with large radius does not. Instead, it terminates at a certain value of spin.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamical topology of quantum BTZ black hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14167v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Among the study of black hole thermodynamics, topology offers a novel approach and perspective for classifying black hole systems. In this work, we explore the thermodynamical topology of the quantum BTZ black hole by employing the concept of the generalized free energy. To fully characterize the thermodynamics, we introduce two distinct topological numbers. The first one is determined by an expression, denoted by $z$, derived from the free energy. Although it can provide us with some local physical explanations, sufficient physical significance still lacks from a global perspective. On the other hand, the second topological number is based on the entropy expression of the generalized free energy, leading to a more meaningful interpretation of its physical implications. This result highlights the natural choice of entropy as the domain variable for the generalized free energy. Regarding the second topological number, our analysis reveals a topological transition that is associated with the thermodynamical stability of the ``cold" black hole state of the quantum BTZ black hole. And the thermodynamical topology of BTZ black hole and quantum BTZ black hole can be different, which implies a significant impact of quantum effects on thermodynamics. Furthermore, our study suggests the existence of topological numbers beyond the conventional values of $\pm 1,0$.</description>

      <title>Relativistic time delay analysis of pulsar signals near ultra-compact objects</title>

Abstract: The upcoming discoveries of pulsars orbiting the center of the Milky Way will present unparalleled opportunities to examine the causal structure of the spacetime geometry of Sagittarius A*. In this paper, we investigate the fully relativistic propagation time delay of pulsar signals in the Joshi-Malafarina-Narayan (JMN-1) and Janis-Newman-Winicour (JNW) spacetimes. This delay arises basically from the spacetime curvatures in the vicinity of these ultra-compact objects, induced by the intense gravitational field near the Galactic Center (GC). Using the principles of gravitational lensing, we compute the arrival time of photons originating from a pulsar in orbit around the GC. To validate our approach, we compare our time delay analysis of the Schwarzschild black hole with the corresponding delay in the post-Newtonian framework. Subsequently, we find that the propagation time of pulsar signal is greater and lesser for the given horizon-less ultra-compact objects for direct and indirect propagation respectively. Therefore, our results suggest quite significant propagation time delay differences in JMN-1 and JNW spacetimes, when compared to the Schwarzschild black hole case. This can be inferred as a possible distinguishing feature for these ultra-compact objects' geometries.</description>

Abstract: Pulsar timing arrays (PTA) hunt for gravitational waves (GW) by searching for the correlations that GWs induce in the time-of-arrival residuals from different pulsars. If the GW sources are of astrophysical origin, then they are located at discrete points on the sky. However, PTA data are often modeled, and subsequently analyzed, via a "standard Gaussian ensemble". That ensemble is obtained in the limit of an infinite density of vanishingly weak, Poisson-distributed sources. In this paper, we move away from that ensemble, to study the effects of two types of "source anisotropy". The first (a), which is often called "shot noise", arises because there are $N$ discrete GW sources at specific sky locations. The second (b) arises because the GW source positions are not a Poisson process, for example, because galaxy locations are clustered. Here, we quantify the impact of (a) and (b) on the mean and variance of the pulsar-averaged Hellings and Downs correlation. For conventional PTA sources, we show that the effects of shot noise (a) are much larger than the effects of clustering (b).</description>

Abstract: Next-generation gravitational-wave detectors like the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer, currently in their preparatory phase, have the potential to significantly improve our understanding of astrophysics, cosmology and fundamental physics. We examine how the arm orientations of the proposed detectors influence the sensitivity of a combined Einstein Telescope - Cosmic Explorer network with respect to the sensitivity to the stochastic gravitational-wave background and compact binary coalescences, where measuring both gravitational-wave polarizations is favorable. We present a method to optimize the arm orientations in the network for these two targets, and also demonstrate how to achieve a balanced configuration for both stochastic background and compact binary coalescence searches. For five specific network configurations, we explicitly compare the sensitivity to the stochastic background and binary neutron star mergers. For the latter, we conduct Bayesian parameter estimation on the extrinsic parameters of a reference binary neutron star system to assess sky localization and distance estimation capabilities. These are illustrated through efficiency curves showing the fraction of events meeting sky localization and distance uncertainty criteria as a function of redshift. Our findings suggest that globally coordinating efforts towards the next-generation gravitational-wave detector network is advantageous.</description>

      <title>Spin the black circle: horizon absorption on non-circular, planar binary black hole dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15322v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Binary systems of black holes emit gravitational waves as they move through their orbits. While most of the emitted radiation escapes to future null infinity, a small fraction is absorbed by the black holes themselves. This is known as horizon absorption or tidal heating/torquing, and causes the black holes' masses and spins to change as the system evolves. In this work, we quantify the effects of the horizon fluxes on binary black hole dynamics by computing them up to next-to-next-to-leading order on generic planar orbits, also exploring physically motivated factorizations of the results. We integrate these fluxes over unbound, hyperbolic-like trajectories obtained with the Effective-One-Body model TEOBResumS-Dal\'i. We discuss the resulting phenomenology across a sizable slice of the relevant parameter space, finding a very small effect in most cases, except on highly energetic orbits. However, the predicted mass and spin variations are quantitatively and qualitatively very sensitive to the analytical representation chosen for the fluxes in that regime. We then perform comparisons with numerical relativity data of induced spins from hyperbolic encounters of initially nonrotating black holes, finding that the next-to-next-to-leading order factorized expressions we derive are crucial to reproduce the data. An optimization on the initial conditions (energy, angular momentum) is necessary for this, however, with differences of up to 9% between the numerical and optimal initial data. Finally, we use our analytical expressions to model possible astrophysical implications for black holes in globular clusters.</description>

Abstract: Spontaneous scalarization in Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet theory admits both vacuum-general relativity (GR) and scalarized hairy black holes as valid solutions, which provides a distinctive signature of new physics in strong gravity regime. In this paper, we shall examine the optical features of Gauss-Bonnet black holes with spontaneous scalarization, which is governed by the coupling parameter $\lambda$. We find that the photon sphere, critical impact parameter and innermost stable circular orbit all decrease as the increasing of $\lambda$. Using observable data from Event Horizon Telescope, we establish the upper limit for $\lambda$. Then we construct the optical appearances of the scalarized black holes illuminated by various thin accretions. Our findings reveal that the scalarized black holes consistently exhibit smaller shadow sizes and reduced brightness compared to Schwarzschild black holes. Notably, in the case of thin spherical accretion, the shadow of the scalarized black hole is smaller, but the surrounding bright ring is more pronounced. Our results highlight the observable features of the scalarized black holes, providing a distinguishable probe from their counterpart in GR in strong gravity regime.</description>

      <title>Broadband limits on stochastic length fluctuations from a pair of table-top interferometers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09175v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Quantum-Enhanced Space-Time (QUEST) experiment consists of a pair of co-located Power Recycled Michelson Interferometers, each designed to have a broadband, shot-noise limited displacement sensitivity of $2\times10^{-19}$ $\mathrm{m/\sqrt{Hz}}$ from 1 to 200 MHz. Here we present the first results of QUEST that set new upper limits on correlated length fluctuations from 13 to 80 MHz, constituting the first broadband constraints for a stochastic gravitational wave background at these frequencies. In a coincident observing run of $10^{4}$ s the averaging of the cross-correlation spectra between the two interferometer signals resulted in a strain sensitivity of $3\times10^{-20}$ $\mathrm{1/\sqrt{Hz}}$ at 40 MHz, making QUEST the most sensitive table-top interferometric system to date.</description>

      <title>Superradiance of charged black holes embedded in dark matter halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11952v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Astrophysical environments are ubiquitous in the Universe; from accretion disks around black holes to galactic dark matter halos, distributions of astrophysical material veil the vast majority of Cosmos. Including environmental effects in strong-field gravity and astrophysics is, therefore, a rather tantalizing task in the quest for novel gravitational-wave phenomena. Here, we examine how environments affect the high-energy process of superradiance. In particular, we study the amplification of charged scalar waves under the expense of the electrostatic energy contained in a charged black hole that is embedded in an observationally-motivated, and qualitatively generic, dark matter halo. We find that the superradiant amplification of massless charged scalar fields scattering off environmentally-enriched charged black holes can be equally efficient to those occurring in vacuum charged black holes. This occurs due to the fact that the sole interplay between the scalar wave and the black hole is the electromagnetic interaction. The addition of mass on the charged scalar waves leads to a rapid suppression of superradiant amplification. This transpires to a great extent due to the `friction' that the mass introduces to the black hole potential. Nevertheless, for sufficiently large scalar masses, the amplification factors can be also subdominantly affected by the compactness of the halo. This occurs because the gravitational interaction between the dense halo and the wave's mass grows, thus further suppressing the superradiant amplification.</description>

      <title>Noncanonical warm inflation with nonminimal derivative coupling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16839v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study extended noncanonical warm inflation to the nonminimal derivative coupling scenario. The fundamental equations, including the evolution equations and the slow roll equations of this new framework, were derived. The enlarged damping term, which encompasses both gravitationally enhanced friction and thermal damping, resulted in a well overdamped inflationary process, ensuring that the slow roll approximations can be satisfactorily satisfied. A linear stability analysis corroborated the viability of this approach, yielding significantly relaxed slow roll conditions within the context of noncanonical warm inflation with nonminimal derivative coupling. Subsequently, the density fluctuations in this new framework were analyzed, leading to approximately analytic results for the power spectrum, spectral index, and related quantities. Both the energy scale at horizon crossing and the tensor-to-scalar ratio decreased considerably because of the effects of thermal damping and nonminimal derivative coupling. The upper bound for field excursion remained safely sub-Planckian in this inflationary scenario. Thus we reached a successful and meaningful model to broad the scope of warm inflation.</description>

      <title>Explicit symplectic integrators with adaptive time steps in curved spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01045v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, our group developed explicit symplectic methods for curved spacetimes that are not split into several explicitly integrable parts, but are via appropriate time transformations. Such time-transformed explicit symplectic integrators should have employed adaptive time steps in principle, but they are often difficult in practical implementations. In fact, they work well if time transformation functions cause the time-transformed Hamiltonians to have the desired splits and approach 1 or constants for sufficiently large distances. However, they do not satisfy the requirement of step-size selections in this case. Based on the step-size control technique proposed by Preto $\&amp;$ Saha, the nonadaptive time step time-transformed explicit symplectic methods are slightly adjusted as adaptive ones. The adaptive methods have only two additional steps and a negligible increase in computational cost as compared with the nonadaptive ones. Their implementation is simple. Several dynamical simulations of particles and photons near black holes have demonstrated that the adaptive methods typically improve the efficiency of the nonadaptive methods. Because of the desirable property, the new adaptive methods are applied to investigate the chaotic dynamics of particles and photons outside the horizon in a Schwarzschild-Melvin spacetime. The new methods are widely applicable to all curved spacetimes corresponding to Hamiltonians or time-transformed Hamiltonians with the expected splits. Also application to the backwards ray-tracing method for studying the motion of photons and shadows of black holes is possible.</description>

      <title>Stability of Euclidean 3-space for the positive mass theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.07414v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the Euclidean 3-space $\mathbb{R}^3$ is stable for the Positive Mass Theorem in the following sense. Let $(M_i,g_i)$ be a sequence of complete asymptotically flat $3$-manifolds with nonnegative scalar curvature and suppose that the ADM mass $m(g_i)$ of one end of $M_i$ converges to $0$. Then for all $i$, there is a subset $Z_i$ in $M_i$ such that $M_i\setminus Z_i$ contains the given end, the area of the boundary $\partial Z_i$ converges to zero, and $(M_i\setminus Z_i,g_i)$ converges to $\mathbb{R}^3$ in the pointed measured Gromov-Hausdorff topology for any choice of basepoints. This confirms a conjecture of G. Huisken and T. Ilmanen. Additionally, we find an almost quadratic upper bound for the area of $\partial Z_i$ in terms of $m(g_i)$. As an application of the main result, we also prove R. Bartnik's strict positivity conjecture.</description>

      <title>Loop Corrections in Gravitational Wave Spectrum in Single Field Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.01527v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the one-loop corrections in power spectrum of long gravitational waves induced from small scale modes in the models of single field inflation undergoing a phase of ultra-slow-roll (USR). We show that the spectrum of long tensor perturbations are largely unaffected by the loop corrections from the short scalar modes. In particular, the spectrum of long tensor perturbations is insensitive to the sharpness of the transition from the USR phase to the final slow-roll phase. This is in contrast to the case of scalar power spectrum in which the loop corrections can be large for a sharp transition while it is slow-roll suppressed in a mild transition. We study the tensor-scalar-scalar bispectrum in the squeezed limit and demonstrate that the Maldacena consistency condition does hold.</description>

      <title>Canonical Quantization of the U(1) Gauge Field in the right Rindler-wedge in the Rindler Coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.09798v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, the canonical quantization of the U(1) gauge field in the Lorentz-covariant gauge in the right Rindler-wedge (RRW) of the four-dimensional Rindler coordinates is performed. Specifically, we obtain the gauge-fixed Lagrangian by the Lorentz-covariant gauge in the RRW of the Rindler coordinates, which is composed of the U(1) gauge field and B-field. Then, we obtain the mode-solutions of the U(1) gauge field and B-field by solving the equations of motion obtained from that gauge-fixed Lagrangian. Subsequently, defining the Klein-Gordon inner-product in the RRW of the Rindler coordinates, we determine the normalization constants of all directions of the mode-solutions of the U(1) gauge field and $B$-field. Then, for the U(1) gauge field given by those normalized mode-expanded solutions, we obtain the commutation relations of the creation and annihilation operators defined in the RRW of the Rindler coordinates by formulating the canonical commutation relations. In addition, we provide a polarization vector for the annihilation operators obtained in this way.
  Using these result, we show that the Minkowski ground state can be expressed as the outer-product of the left and right Rindler-wedges state on which those creation and annihilation operators act. Then, tracing out the left Rindler states of that Minkowski ground state, we obtain the density matrix of the U(1) gauge field in the RRW. From this, we show that the U(1) gauge field in a constant accelerated system will feel the Unruh temperature as well.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the tension between cosmological models and JWST red candidate massive galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.02866v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a Python tool to estimate the tail distribution of the number of dark matter halos beyond a mass threshold and in a given volume in a light-cone. The code is based on the extended Press-Schechter model and is computationally efficient, typically taking a few seconds on a personal laptop for a given set of cosmological parameters. The high efficiency of the code allows a quick estimation of the tension between cosmological models and the red candidate massive galaxies released by the James Webb Space Telescope, as well as scanning the theory space with the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method. As an example application, we use the tool to study the cosmological implication of the candidate galaxies presented in Labb\'e et al. (2023). The standard $\Lambda$ cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model is well consistent with the data if the star formation efficiency can reach $\sim 0.3$ at high redshift. For a low star formation efficiency $\epsilon \sim 0.1$, $\Lambda$CDM model is disfavored at $\sim 2\sigma$-$3\sigma$ confidence level.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03866v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Open system dynamics of an electron is studied in the presence of radiation field, confined between two parallel conducting pates. It has been suggested in previous works that the quantized zero-point modes of this field lead to finite decoherence effects, possibly due to the Casimir force. However, in this work it is shown that the decoherence found in previous works is due to the sudden switching on of the system-environment interaction and due to the acceleration of the electron enforced by the background paths whose superposition was analyzed. The work discusses important theoretical aspects of the setup and shows that while coherence might be lost due to bremsstrahlung induced by an external or the image potential, it cannot be lost due to the mere presence of the quantum vacuum fluctuations between the plates.</description>

      <title>Current density induced by a cosmic string in de Sitter spacetime in the presence of two flat boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05691v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the vacuum bosonic current density induced by a carrying-magnetic-flux cosmic string in a $(D+1)$-de Sitter spacetime considering the presence of two flat boundaries perpendicular to it. In this setup, the Robin boundary conditions are imposed on the scalar charged quantum field on the boundaries. The particular cases of Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions are studied separately. Due to the coupling of the quantum scalar field with the classical gauge field, corresponding to a magnetic flux running along the string's core, a nonzero vacuum expectation value for the current density operator along the azimuthal direction is induced. The two boundaries divide the space in three regions with different properties of the vacuum states. In this way, our main objective is to calculate the induced currents in these three regions. In order to develop this analysis we calculate, for both regions, the positive frequency Wightman functions. Because the vacuum bosonic current in dS space has been investigated before, in this paper we consider only the contributions induced by the boundaries. We show that for each region the azimuthal current densities are odd functions of the magnetic flux along the string. To probe the correctness of our results, we take the particular cases and analyze some asymptotic limits of the parameters of the model. Also some graphs are presented exhibiting the behavior of the current with relevant physical parameter of the system.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the primordial curvature perturbations on small scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18887v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The power spectrum of the primordial curvature perturbation $\mathcal{P}_\mathcal{R}$ has been measured with high precision on large scales $10^{-4}\lesssim k\lesssim 3~\rm Mpc^{-1}$, basing on the observations of cosmic microwave background, Lyman-$\alpha$ forest and large scale structure. On small scales $3\lesssim k \lesssim 10^{23}~\rm Mpc^{-1}$, the constrains are mainly from the studies on the primordial black holes (PBHs). Specifically, on small scales $10^{17}\lesssim k\lesssim 10^{23}~{\rm Mpc^{-1}}$, the limits arise from studies on the lightest supersymmetric particles produced by PBHs radiation and the stable Planck-mass relics after its evaporation. It has been demonstrated that the big bang nucleosynthesis can be used to constrain the initial fraction of PBHs with masses $10^{9}\lesssim M_{\rm PBH}\lesssim 10^{13}~{\rm g}$, corresponding to the scales $10^{16}\lesssim k\lesssim 10^{18}~{\rm Mpc^{-1}}$. Recently, on one hand, it is found that the evaporation of light PBHs ($M_{\rm PBH}\lesssim 10^{9}\rm g$) can modify the expansion rate of the Universe and the baryon-to-photon ratio, resulting in the influences on the primordial abundance of light nuclei. On the other hand, it has been proposed that the `memory burden' effect can slow down the mass loss rate of black hole (BH), leading to the existence of light PBHs by now. Based on the recent theoretical research process of BH and the limits on the (initial) mass fraction of light PBHs with masses $10^{4}\lesssim M_{\rm PBH}\lesssim 10^{10}~\rm g$, we derive new constraints on $\mathcal{P}_\mathcal{R}$ on small scales $1.5\times 10^{18}\lesssim k\lesssim 2.5\times 10^{21}~\rm Mpc^{-1}$, which are rarely studied in previous literature.</description>

      <title>Dynamical black hole entropy beyond general relativity from the Einstein frame</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00647v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently Hollands, Wald and Zhang proposed a new formula for the entropy of a dynamical black hole for an arbitrary theory of gravity obtained from a diffeomorphism covariant Lagrangian via the Noether charge method. We present an alternative, pedagogical derivation of the dynamical black hole entropy for $f(R)$ gravity as well as canonical scalar-tensor theory by means of conformal transformations. First, in general relativity we generalize Visser and Yan's pedagogical proof of the non-stationary physical process first law to black holes that may not be in vacuum, and give a pedagogical derivation of the second-order behavior of the dynamical black hole entropy for vacuum perturbations by considering the second-order variation of the Raychaudhuri equation. Second, we apply the derivation for general relativity to theories in the Einstein frames, and then recast the conclusions in their original frames. We show that the dynamical black hole entropy formulae of these theories satisfy both the non-stationary physical process first law and the non-stationary comparison first law via the Einstein frame. We further study the second-order behavior of the dynamical black hole entropy for vacuum perturbations, and observe that the second law is obeyed at second order in those theories. Using the Einstein frame, we also determine the relationship between the dynamical black hole entropy and the Wald entropy of the generalized apparent horizon in the original frame.</description>
