      <title>Minimal cobordisms between thin and thick torus knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine the locally flat cobordism distance between torus knots with small and large braid index, up to high precision. Here small means 2, 3, 4, or 6. As an application, we derive a surprising fact about torus knots that are met along the way of almost minimal cobordisms between two-stranded torus knots and the trivial knot.</description>

      <title>Seifert forms and slice Euler characteristic of links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define the Witt coindex of a link with non-trivial Alexander polynomial, as a concordance invariant from the Seifert form. We show that it provides an upper bound for the (locally flat) slice Euler characteristic of the link, extending the work of Levine on algebraically slice knots and Taylor on the genera of knots. Then we extend the techniques by Levine on isometric structures and characterize completely the forms of coindex $1$ under the condition that the symmetrized Seifert form is non-degenerate. We illustrate our results with examples where the coindex is used to show that a two-component link does not bound a locally flat cylinder in the four-ball, whereas any other known restriction does not show it.</description>

      <title>Quantized geodesic lengths for Teichm\"uller spaces: algebraic aspects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1980's H Verlinde suggested to construct and use a quantization of Teichm\"uller spaces to construct spaces of conformal blocks for the Liouville conformal field theory. This suggestion led to a mathematical formulation by Fock in 1990's, called the modular functor conjecture, based on the Chekhov-Fock quantum Teichm\"uller theory. In 2000's Teschner combined the Chekhov-Fock version and the Kashaev version of quantum Teichm\"uller theory to construct a solution to a modified form of the conjecture. We embark on a direct approach to the conjecture based on the Chekhov-Fock(-Goncharov) theory. We construct quantized trace-of-monodromy along simple loops via Bonahon and Wong's quantum trace maps developed in 2010's, and investigate algebraic structures of them, which will eventually lead to construction and properties of quantized geodesic length operators. We show that a special recursion relation used by Teschner is satisfied by the quantized trace-of-monodromy, and that the quantized trace-of-monodromy for disjoint loops commute in a certain strong sense.</description>

      <title>A Seifert algorithm for integral homology spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From classical knot theory we know that every knot in $S^3$ is the boundary of an oriented, embedded surface. A standard demonstration of this fact achieved by elementary technique comes from taking a regular projection of any knot and employing Seifert's constructive algorithm. In this note we give a natural generalization of Seifert's algorithm to any closed integral homology 3-sphere. The starting point of our algorithm is presenting the handle structure of a Heegaard splitting of a given integral homology sphere as a planar diagram on the boundary of a $3$-ball. (For a well known example of such a planar presentation, see the Poincar\'e homology sphere planar presentation in {\em Knots and Links} by D. Rolfsen \cite{Rolfsen}.) An oriented link can then be represented by the regular projection of an oriented $k$-strand tangle. From there we give a natural way to find a ``Seifert circle" and associated half-twisted bands.</description>

      <title>Foams with flat connections and algebraic K-theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a connection between algebraic K-theory and foam cobordisms, where foams are stratified manifolds with singularities of a prescribed form. We consider $n$-dimensional foams equipped with a flat bundle of finitely-generated projective $R$-modules over each facet of the foam, together with gluing conditions along the subfoam of singular points. In a suitable sense which will become clear, a vertex (or the smallest stratum) of an $n$-dimensional foam replaces an $(n+1)$-simplex with a total ordering of vertices. We show that the first K-theory group of a ring $R$ can be identified with the cobordism group of decorated 1-foams embedded in the plane. A similar relation between the $n$-th algebraic K-theory group of a ring $R$ and the cobordism group of decorated $n$-foams embedded in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ is expected for $n&gt;1$. An analogous correspondence is proposed for arbitrary exact categories. Modifying the embedding and other conditions on the foams may lead to new flavors of K-theory groups.</description>

      <title>Proper affine deformations of positive representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define for every positive Anosov representation of a nonabelian free group into $\mathrm{SO}(2n,2n-1)$ a family of $\mathbb{R}^{4n-1}$-valued cocycles which induce proper affine actions on $\mathbb{R}^{4n-1}$. We construct fundamental domains in $\mathbb{R}^{4n-1}$ bounded by generalized crooked planes for these affine actions, and deduce that the quotient manifolds are homeomorphic to handlebodies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2005.11696v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We point out that recent constructions of inequivalent smooth structures yield a manufacturing procedure of infinite sets of pairwise smoothly non-isotopic nullhomologous 2-tori and spheres inside a myriad of 4-manifolds. The corresponding infinite set consists of topologically isotopic surfaces that topologically bound a handlebody in several instances.</description>

      <title>Harmonic measures and rigidity for surface group actions on the circle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.08411v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study rigidity properties of actions of a torsion-free lattice of $\operatorname{PSU}(1,1)$ on the circle $S^1$. We follow the approaches of Frankel and Thurston proposed in preprints via foliated harmonic measures on the suspension bundles. Our main results are a curvature estimate and a Gauss--Bonnet formula for the $S^1$ connection obtained by taking the average of the flat connection with respect to a harmonic measure. As consequences, we give a precise description of the harmonic measure on suspension foliations with maximal Euler number and an alternative proof of rigidity theorems of Matsumoto and Burger--Iozzi--Wienhard.</description>

      <title>$n$-Fold Cyclic Branched Covers and Overtwisted Contact Structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.05703v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article presents an alternate way to prove a result originally proven by Harvey, Kawamuro, and Plamenvskaya in \cite{HaKaPl}. We accomplish this by explicitly constructing an overtwisted disk in the $p$-fold cyclic branched cover of $S^3$ with the standard contact structure branched along a carefully selected transverse knot. Furthermore, by utilizing this construction of the overtwisted disk, we can see that the overtwisted disk is contained in the complement of the branch locus.</description>

      <title>Boundary conditions for scalar curvature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2012.09127v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based on the Atiyah-Patodi-Singer index formula, we construct an obstruction to positive scalar curvature metrics with mean convex boundaries on spin manifolds of infinite K-area. We also characterize the extremal case. Next we show a general deformation principle for boundary conditions of metrics with lower scalar curvature bounds. This implies that the relaxation of boundary conditions often induces weak homotopy equivalences of spaces of such metrics. This can be used to refine the smoothing of codimension-one singularites a la Miao and the deformation of boundary conditions a la Brendle-Marques-Neves, among others. Finally, we construct compact manifolds for which the spaces of positive scalar curvature metrics with mean convex boundaries have nontrivial higher homotopy groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.19363v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate a categorification of Robertson's conjecture analogous to the categorical graph minor conjecture of Miyata--Proudfood--Ramos. We show that these conjectures imply the existence of a finite list of atomic graphs generating the homology of configuration spaces of graphs -- in fixed degree, with a fixed number of particles, under topological embeddings. We explain how the simplest case of our conjecture follows from work of Barter and Miyata--Proudfoot, implying that the category of cographs is Noetherian, a result of potential independent interest.</description>

      <title>Assouad-Nagata dimension of minor-closed metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12273v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Assouad-Nagata dimension addresses both large and small scale behaviors of metric spaces and is a refinement of Gromov's asymptotic dimension. A metric space $M$ is a minor-closed metric if there exists an (edge-)weighted graph $G$ satisfying a fixed minor-closed property such that the underlying space of $M$ is the vertex-set of $G$, and the metric of $M$ is the distance function in $G$. Minor-closed metrics naturally arise when removing redundant edges of the underlying graphs by using edge-deletion and edge-contraction. In this paper, we determine the Assouad-Nagata dimension of every minor-closed metric. Our main theorem simultaneously generalizes known results about the asymptotic dimension of $H$-minor free unweighted graphs and about the Assouad-Nagata dimension of complete Riemannian surfaces with finite Euler genus.</description>
