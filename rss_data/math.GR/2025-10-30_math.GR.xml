      <title>Obstructions for quantitative measure equivalence between locally compact groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a measure equivalence coupling between two finitely generated groups, Delabie, Koivisto, Le Ma\^itre and Tessera have found explicit upper bounds on how integrable the associated cocycles can be. We extend these results to the broader framework of unimodular compactly generated locally compact groups. We also generalize a result by the first-named author, showing that the integrability threshold described in these statements cannot be achieved.</description>

      <title>The Flag-Transitive and Point-Imprimitive Symmetric $(v,k,\lambda)$ Designs with $v&lt;100$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A complete classification of the flag-transitive point-imprimitive symmetric $2$-$(v,k,\lambda )$ designs with $v&lt;100$ is provided. Apart from the known examples with $\lambda \leq 10$, the complementary design of $PG_{5}(2)$, and the $2$-design $\mathcal{S}^{-}(3)$ constructed by Kantor in \cite{Ka75}, we found two non isomorphic $2$-$(64,28,12)$ designs. They were constructed via computer as developments of $(64,28,12)$-difference sets by AbuGhneim in \cite{OAG}. In the present paper, independently from \cite{OAG}, we construct the aforementioned two $2$-designs and we prove that their full automorhpism group is flag-transitive and point-imprimitive. The construction is theoretical and relies on the the absolutely irreducible $8$-dimensional $\mathbb{F}_{2}$-representation of $PSL_{2}(7)$. Our result, together with that about the flag-transitive point-primitive symmetric $2$-designs with $v&lt;2500$ by Brai\'{c}-Golemac-Mandi\'{c}-Vu\v{c}i\v{c}i\'{c} \cite{BGMV}, provides a complete classification of the flag-transitive $2$-designs with $v&lt;100$.</description>

      <title>Enhanced power graph from the power graph of a group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The power graph of a group $G$ is a graph with vertex set $G$, where two distinct vertices $a$ and $b$ are adjacent if one of $a$ and $b$ is a power of the other. Similarly, the enhanced power graph of $G$ is a graph with vertex set $G$, where two distinct vertices are adjacent if they belong to the same cyclic subgroup. In this paper we give a simple algorithm to construct the enhanced power graph from the power graph of a group without the knowledge of the underlying group. This answers a question raised by Peter J. Cameron of constructing enhanced power graph of group $G$ from its power graph. We do this by defining an arithmetical function on finite group $G$ that counts the number of closed twins of a given vertex in the power graph of a group. We compute this function and prove many of its properties. One of the main ingredients of our proofs is the monotonicity of this arithmetical function on the poset of all cyclic subgroups of $G$.</description>

      <title>Strongly Regular Graphs of Rank Four</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strongly regular graphs are regular graphs with a constant number of common neighbours between adjacent vertices, and a constant number of common neighbours between non-adjacent vertices. These graphs have been of great interest over the last few decades and often give rise to interesting groups of automorphisms. In this paper we take a reverse approach, and leverage strong classification results on rank four permutation groups to classify the strongly regular graphs which yield such groups as a group of automorphisms.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal roots, quantum Hafnians, and generalized Rothe diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $U$ be a set of positive roots of type $ADE$, and let $\Omega_U$ be the set of all maximum cardinality orthogonal subsets of $U$. For each element $R \in \Omega_U$, we define a generalized Rothe diagram whose cardinality we call the level, $\rho(R)$, of $R$. We define the generalized quantum Hafnian of $U$ to be the generating function of $\rho$, regarded as a $q$-polynomial in $U$. Several widely studied algebraic and combinatorial objects arise as special cases of these constructions, and in many cases, $\Omega_U$ has the structure of a graded partially ordered set with rank function $\rho$. A motivating example of the construction involves a certain set of $k^2$ roots in type $D_{2k}$, where the elements of $\Omega_U$ correspond to permutations in $S_k$, the generalized Rothe diagrams are the traditional Rothe diagrams associated to permutations, the level of a permutation is its length, the generalized quantum Hafnian is the $q$-permanent, and the partial order is the Bruhat order. We exhibit many other natural examples of this construction, including one involving perfect matchings, two involving labelled Fano planes, and one involving the invariant cubic form in type $E_6$.</description>

      <title>The Dual Burnside Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Burnside process is a classical Markov chain for sampling uniformly from group orbits. We introduce the dual Burnside process, obtained by interchanging the roles of group elements and states. This dual chain has stationary law $\pi(g)\propto |X_g|$, is reversible, and admits a matrix factorization $Q=AB$, $K=BA$ with the classical Burnside kernel $K$. As a consequence the two chains share all nonzero eigenvalues and have mixing times that differ by at most one step. We further establish universal Doeblin floors, orbit and conjugacy-class lumpings, and transfer principles between $Q$ and $K$. We analyze explicit examples: the value-permutation model $S_k$ acting on $[k]^n$ and the coordinate-permutation model $S_n$ acting on $[k]^n$. These results show that the dual chain provides both a conceptual mirror to the classical Burnside process and practical advantages for symmetry-aware Markov chain Monte Carlo.</description>

      <title>On torsion in the homology of the Torelli group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $S_g$ be a closed, oriented surface of genus $g$, and let $\operatorname{Mod}(S_g)$ denote its mapping class group. The Torelli group $\mathcal{I}_g$ is the subgroup of $\operatorname{Mod}(S_g)$ consisting of mapping classes that act trivially on $H_1(S_g)$. For any collection of pairwise disjoint, separating simple closed curves on $S_g$, the corresponding Dehn twists pairwise commute and determine a homology class in $H_k(\mathcal{I}_g)$, which is called an abelian cycle. We prove that the subgroup of $H_k(\mathcal{I}_g)$ generated by such abelian cycles is a $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$-vector space for all $k$, and that it is finite-dimensional for $k = 2$ and $g \geq 4$.</description>

      <title>An algebraic criterion for the vanishing of bounded cohomology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.16259v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the vanishing of bounded cohomology with separable dual coefficients for many groups of interest in geometry, dynamics, and algebra. These include compactly supported structure-preserving diffeomorphism groups of certain manifolds; the group of interval exchange transformations of the half line; piecewise linear and piecewise projective groups of the line, giving strong answers to questions of Calegari and Navas; direct limit linear groups of relevance in algebraic $K$-theory, thereby answering a question by Kastenholz and Sroka and a question of two of the authors and L{\"o}h; and certain subgroups of big mapping class groups, such as the stable braid group and the stable mapping class group, proving a conjecture of Bowden. Moreover, we prove that in the recently introduced framework of enumerated groups, the generic group has vanishing bounded cohomology with separable dual coefficients. At the heart of our approach is an elementary algebraic criterion called the commuting cyclic conjugates condition that is readily verifiable for the aforementioned large classes of groups.</description>

      <title>Local--global generation property of commutators in finite $\pi$-soluble groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03017v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a group $A$ acting by automorphisms on a group $G$, let $I_G(A)$ denote the set of commutators $[g,a]=g^{-1}g^a$, where $g\in G$ and $a\in A$, so that $[G,A]$ is the subgroup generated by $I_G(A)$. We prove that if $A$ is a $\pi$-group of automorphisms of a $\pi$-soluble finite group $G$ such that any subset of $I_G(A)$ generates a subgroup that can be generated by $r$ elements, then the rank of $[G,A]$ is bounded in terms of $r$. Examples show that such a result does not hold without the assumption of $\pi$-solubility. Earlier we obtained this type of results
  for groups of coprime automorphisms and for Sylow $p$-subgroups of $p$-soluble groups.</description>

      <title>Virtual retractions in free constructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18054v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A group $G$ has property (VRC) if every cyclic subgroup is a virtual retract. This property is stable under many standard group-theoretic constructions and is enjoyed by all virtually special groups (in the sense of Haglund and Wise). In this paper we study property (VRC) for fundamental groups of finite graphs of groups.
  Our main criterion shows that the fundamental group of a finite graph of finitely generated virtually abelian groups has (VRC) if and only if it has a homomorphism to a Euclidean-by-finite group that is injective on all vertex groups. This result allows us to determine property (VRC) for such groups using basic tools from Euclidean Geometry and Linear Algebra. We use it to produce examples and to give sufficient criteria for fundamental groups of finite graphs of finitely generated abelian groups with cyclic edge groups to have (VRC).
  In the last two sections and in the appendix we give applications of property (VRC). We show that if a fundamental group of a finite graph of groups with finitely generated virtually abelian vertex groups has (VRC) then it is CAT($0$). We also show that tubular groups with (VRC) are virtually free-by-cyclic and virtually special.</description>

Abstract: The action of $SL(2, {\bf Z})$ on the integer torus and its quotient by central symmetry and Artin's presentation of three strings braid group $B_{3}$, produces a presentation with parabolic generators $\pmatrix{1&amp; -1\cr 0&amp; 1\cr}$ and $\pmatrix{1&amp; 0\cr 1&amp; 1\cr}$. This braided presentation describes the action of the derived group on Poincar\'e's half plane and its quotient the modular torus, just as Nielsen's theorem giving the group of direct automorphisms of the free group on two generators as semi-direct product, amalgamated on the index $2$ subgroup of the center of $B_{3}$, of inner automorphisms with $B_{3}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05101v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a sequence of simple non-discrete totally disconnected locally compact (tdlc) groups separated by finiteness properties; that is, for every positive integer $n$ there exists a simple non-discrete tdlc group that is of type $F_{n-1}$ but not of type $F_n$. This generalizes a result for discrete groups of Skipper--Witzel--Zaremsky. Furthermore, we construct a simple non-discrete tdlc group that is of type $FP_2$ over $\mathbb{Z}$ but not compactly presented. Our examples arise as Smith universal groups $\mathcal{U}(M, N)$ associated to permutation groups $M$ and $N$. We generalize a theorem of Haglund--Wise to tdlc groups and show that under mild conditions on $M$ and $N$ the finiteness properties of $\mathcal{U}(M, N)$ reflect those of its local actions $M$ and $N$.</description>

Abstract: Let $p$ be a prime number. We compute the trivial source character tables of finite Frobenius groups $G$ with an abelian Frobenius complement $H$ and an elementary abelian Frobenius kernel of order $p^2$. More precisely, we deal with all infinite families of such groups which occur in the two extremal cases for the fusion of $p$-subgroups: the case in which there exists exactly one $G$-conjugacy class of non-trivial cyclic $p$-subgroups, and the case in which there exist exactly $p+1$ distinct $G$-conjugacy classes of non-trivial cyclic $p$-subgroups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.20059v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Civino et al. (2019) have shown how some diffusion layers can expose a Substitution-Permutation Network to vulnerability from differential cryptanalysis when employing alternative operations coming from groups isomorphic to the translation group on the message space. In this study, we present a classification of diffusion layers that exhibit linearity with respect to certain parallel alternative operations, enabling the possibility of an alternative differential attack simultaneously targeting all the s-boxes within the block. Furthermore, we investigate the differential behaviour with respect to alternative operations for all classes of optimal 4-bit s-boxes, as defined by Leander and Poschmann (2007). Our examination reveals that certain classes contain weak permutations w.r.t. alternative differential attacks. Finally, we leverage these vulnerabilities to execute a series of experiments showing the effectiveness of the cryptanalysis performed with a parallel alternative operation compared to the classical one.</description>

      <title>Invariant quasimorphisms and generalized mixed Bavard duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04319v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article provides an expository account of the celebrated duality theorem of Bavard and three its strengthenings. The Bavard duality theorem connects scl (stable commutator length) and quasimorphisms on a group. Calegari extended the framework from a group element to a chain on the group, and established the generalized Bavard duality. Kawasaki, Kimura, Matsushita and Mimura studied the setting of a pair of a group and its normal subgroup, and obtained the mixed Bavard duality. The first half of the present article is devoted to an introduction to these three Bavard dualities. In the latter half, we present a new strengthening, the generalized mixed Bavard duality, and provide a self-contained proof of it. This third strengthening recovers all of the Bavard dualities treated in the first half; thus, we supply complete proofs of these four Bavard dualities in a unified manner. In addition, we state several results on the space $\mathrm{W}(G,N)$ of non-extendable quasimorphisms, which is related to the comparison problem between scl and mixed scl via the mixed Bavard duality.</description>
