      <title>Angularly Selective Enhanced Vortex Screening in Extremely Layered Superconductors with Tilted Columnar Defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on two mechanisms of angularly selective enhanced screening in the solid vortex phase of extremely layered superconductors with tilted columnar defects (CDs). We study Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$ samples with different densities of CD tilted 45$^{\circ}$ from the $c$-axis, and conduct local ac Hall magnetometry measurements, probing the sustainable current of the vortex system. We reveal two types of maxima in sustainable current for particular directions, detected as dips in the magnetic transmittivity of the vortex system. First, for a smaller number of vortices than of defects, an enhancement of screening is detected at an angular location $\Theta^{1}_{\rm dip}$$\sim$45$^{\circ}$ for $H$ applied close to the direction of CD. For a larger number of vortices than of CD, $\Theta^{1}_{\rm dip}$ decreases towards the $ab$-plane direction upon warming. Second, a pair of additional dips in transmittivity are detected at angles $\Theta^{2}_{dip}$ closer to, and quite symmetric with, the $ab$-plane. These two types of angularly selective enhanced screening reveal the effective pinning by tilted CD even for the composite vortex lattices nucleated in tilted fields in Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$.</description>

      <title>Gapless superconductivity and its real-space topology in quasicrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study superconductivity in Ammann-Beenker quasicrystals under magnetic field. By assuming an intrinsic $s$-wave pairing interaction and solving for mean-field equations self-consistently, we find gapless superconductivity in the quasicrystals at and near half filling. We show that gapless superconductivity originates in broken translational symmetry and confined states unique to the quasicrystals. When Rashba spin-orbit coupling is present, the quasicrystalline gapless superconductor can be topologically nontrivial and characterized by a nonzero pseudospectrum invariant given by a spectral localizer. The gapless topological superconducting phase exhibits edge states with near-zero energy. These findings suggest that quasicrystals can be a unique platform for realizing gapless superconductivity with nontrivial topology.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of superconductivity coexisting with charge density wave in lattice expanded $\textrm{NbTe}_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a significant enhancement of superconducting transition temperature ($\textit{T}_\textrm{c}$) of transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) superconductor $\textrm{NbTe}_2$ from 0.56 K to 2.8 K. Detailed x-ray structure analysis reveals that our $\textit{T}_\textrm{c}$-enhanced sample has an anisotropic lattice distortion inducing ~1% expansion of the unit cell volume and multi-domain formation in the $\textit{ab}$ planes. Despite the unit cell expansion, the distorted 1T structure, closely related to the charge density wave (CDW) order in this material, persists. Hall measurements show almost identical behaviors for both samples indicating that electronic structure does not change much due to the unit cell expansion. These results suggest that the CDW still coexists with the enhanced superconductivity unlike the other TMD superconductors.</description>

      <title>Itinerant magnetism in Hubbard models with long-range interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A wide variety of experimental platforms, ranging from semiconductor quantum-dot arrays to moir\'e materials, have recently emerged as powerful quantum simulators for studying the Hubbard model and its variants. Motivated by these developments, here, we investigate a generalization of the Hubbard model which includes the effects of long-range Coulomb interactions. Working on finite-sized two-dimensional square and triangular lattices, we use exact diagonalization and density-matrix renormalization group calculations to probe the magnetic structure of the ground state in the strong-coupling regime, where $U$ (the onsite repulsion) $\gg$ $t$ (the nearest-neighbor hopping). For small electron dopings above the half-filled antiferromagnet, we numerically uncover a rich variety of magnetically ordered states, and in conjunction with theoretical arguments, infer the phase diagram of the system as a function of doping and interaction strengths. In particular, we find that the inclusion of long-range Coulomb interactions induces an instability of high-spin states$\unicode{x2014}$such as the saturated Nagaoka ferromagnet$\unicode{x2014}$towards phase separation and stripe ordering. We also present proposals for the observation of some of our key findings in experiments that would shed further light on this paradigmatic strongly correlated system.</description>

      <title>Multi-orbital two-particle self-consistent approach -- strengths and limitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extending many-body numerical techniques which are powerful in the context of simple model calculations to the realm of realistic material simulations can be a challenging task. Realistic systems often involve multiple active orbitals, which increases the complexity and numerical cost because of the large local Hilbert space and the large number of interaction terms or sign-changing off-diagonal Green's functions. The two-particle self-consistent approach (TPSC) is one such many-body numerical technique, for which multi-orbital extensions have proven to be involved due to the substantially more complex structure of the local interaction tensor. In this paper we extend earlier multi-orbital generalizations of TPSC by setting up two different variants of a fully self-consistent theory for TPSC in multi-orbital systems. We first investigate the strengths and limitations of the approach analytically, and then benchmark both variants against exact diagonalization (ED) and dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) results. We find that the exact behavior of the system can be faithfully reproduced in the weak coupling regime, while at stronger couplings the performance of the two approaches strongly depends on details of the system.</description>

      <title>Non-Fermi-liquid transport phenomena in infinite-layer nickelates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently discovered superconducting infinite-layer nickelates $R$NiO$_2$ ($R$=Nd, La, Pr) attract increasing attention due to the similarites to cuprates. Both $R$NiO$_2$ and YBCO cuprates exhibit the non-fermi-liquid transport behavior, characterized by resistivity proportional to temperature near the quantum critical point of the charge or spin density wave. In this study, we analyze the resistivity of infinite-layer nickelate Nd$_{0.85}$Sr$_{0.15}$NiO$_2$ based on a three-dimensional tight-binding model by applying linear response theory. We take account of the self-energy by the fluctuation exchange (FLEX) approximation for the Ni orbital and the T-matrix approximation for an impurity effect on the Nd orbitals. We find that (i) the $T$-linear resistivity at low temperatures is derived from the spin fluctuations, and (ii) a negative and $T$-linear Seebeck coefficient is obtained. The resulting $T$-linear resistivity suggests that NdNiO$_2$ behaves as a quasi-two-dimensional electron system similar to CeCoIn$_5$.</description>

      <title>A method for the automatic generation of a minimal basis set of structural templates for material phase-space exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel method for predicting binary phase diagrams through the automatic construction of a minimal basis set of representative templates. The core assumption is that any materials space can be divided into a small number of regions with similar chemical tendencies and bonding properties, and that a minimal set of templates can efficiently represent the key chemical trends across the different regions. By combining data-driven techniques with ab-initio crystal structure prediction, we can efficiently partition the materials space and construct templates reflecting variations in chemical behavior. Preliminary results demonstrate that our method predicts binary convex hulls with accuracy comparable to resource-intensive EA searches, while achieving a significant reduction in computational time (by a factor of 25). The method can be extended to ternary and multinary systems, enabling efficient high-throughput exploration and mapping of complex material spaces. By providing a transformative solution for high-throughput materials discovery, our approach paves the way for uncovering advanced quantum materials and accelerating in silico design.</description>

      <title>Spin-fermion coupling enhances pairing in the pseudogap regime of the hole-doped Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a fluctuation analysis of the pairing interaction in the hole-doped Hubbard model within the dynamical cluster approximation. Our analysis reveals that spin-fluctuation-mediated pairing differs qualitatively in the over- and underdoped regimes. In the underdoped regime spin fluctuations open a pseudogap. We show that in this regime the spin-fermion coupling mediates a giant attraction between antinodal fermions. As a consequence, despite the lack of coherent fermionic quasiparticles, a strong superconducting pairing is sustained down to small dopings.</description>

      <title>Natural width of the superconducting transition in epitaxial TiN films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.06310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.06310v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of various fluctuation mechanisms on the DC resistance in superconducting devices based on epitaxial titanium nitride (TiN) films. The samples we studied show a relatively steep resistive transition (RT), with a transition width $\Delta T/T_\mathrm{c} \sim 0.002-0.025$, depending on the film thickness (20 nm, 9 nm, and 5 nm) and device dimensions. This value is significantly broader than expected due to conventional superconducting fluctuations ($\Delta T/T_\mathrm{c} \ll 10^{-3}$). The shape and width of the RT can be perfectly described by the well-known effective medium theory, which allows us to understand the origin of the inhomogeneity in the superconducting properties of TiN films. We propose that this inhomogeneity can have both dynamic and static origins. The dynamic mechanism is associated with spontaneous fluctuations in electron temperature (T-fluctuations), while the static mechanism is due to a random spatial distribution of surface magnetic disorder (MD). Our analysis has revealed clear correlations between the transition width and material parameters as well as device size for both proposed mechanisms. While T-fluctuations may contribute significantly to the observed transition width, our findings suggest that the dominant contribution comes from the MD mechanism. Our results provide new insights into the microscopic origin of broadening of the superconducting transition and inhomogeneity in thin superconducting films.</description>

      <title>Sketched Nanoscale KTaO3-Based Superconducting Quantum Interference Device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16051v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discovery of two-dimensional superconductivity in LaAlO3/KTaO3 (111) and (110) interfaces has raised significant interest in this system. In this manuscript we report the first successful fabrication of a superconducting quantum interference device (DC-SQUID) in the KTO system. The key device elements, superconducting weak links, are created by conductive atomic force microscope (c-AFM) lithography which can reversibly control the conductivity at the LAO/KTO(110) interface with nanoscale resolution. The periodic modulation of the SQUID critical current, Ic(B), with magnetic field corresponds well with our theoretical modeling, which reveals a large kinetic inductance of the superconducting two-dimensional electron gas in KTO. The kinetic inductance of the SQUID is tunable by electrical gating from the back, due to the large dielectric constant of KTO. The demonstration of weak links and SQUIDs in KTO broadens the scope for exploring the underlying physics of KTO superconductivity, including the role of spin-orbit-coupling, pairing symmetry, and inhomogeneity. It also promotes KTO as a versatile platform for a growing family of quantum devices, which could be applicable in the realm of quantum computing and information.</description>

      <title>Buried Dirac points in Quantum Spin Hall Insulators: Implications for edge transport and Majorana Kramer Pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19052v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For heterostructures formed by a quantum spin Hall insulator (QSHI) placed in proximity to a superconductor (SC), no external magnetic field is necessary to drive the system into a phase supporting topological superconductivity with Majorana zero energy states, making them very attractive for the realization of non-Abelian states and fault-tolerant qubits. Despite considerable work investigating QSHI edge states, there is still an open question about their resilience to large magnetic fields and the implication of such resilience for the formation of a quasi-1D topological superconducting state. In this work, we investigate the transport properties of helical edge states in a QSHI-SC junction formed by a InAs/GaSb (15nm/5nm) double quantum well and a superconducting tantalum (Ta) constriction. We observe a robust conductance plateau up to 2 T, signaling resilient edge state transport. Such resilience is consistent with the Dirac point for the edge states being buried in the bulk valence band. Using a modified Landauer-Buttiker analysis, we find that the conductance is consistent with 98% Andreev reflection probability owing to the high transparency of the InAs/GaSb-Ta interface. We further theoretically show that a buried Dirac point does not affect the robustness of the quasi-1D topological superconducting phase, and favors the hybridization of Majorana Kramer pairs and fermionic modes in the QSHI resulting in extended MKP states, highlighting the subtle role of buried Dirac points in probing MKPs.</description>

      <title>Charge-Density-Wave State in Extremely Overdoped Cuprates Driven by Phonons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.13868v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent resonant x-ray scattering (RXS) experiments revealed a novel charge order in extremely overdoped La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ (LSCO) [Phys. Rev. Lett. 131,116002]. The observed charge order appears around the $(\pi/3,0)$ wavevector, distinct from the well-known stripe fluctuations near 1/8 doping, and persists from cryogenic temperatures to room temperature. To investigate the origin of this charge order in the overdoped regime, we use determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) simulations to examine correlated models with various interactions. We demonstrate that this distinctive CDW originates from remnant correlations in extremely overdoped cuprates, with its specific pattern shaped by interactions beyond the Hubbard model, particularly electron-phonon couplings. The persistence of the $(\pi/3,0)$ wavevector across different doping levels indicates the presence of nonlocal couplings. Our study reveals the significant role of phonons in cuprates, which assist correlated electrons in the formation of unconventional phases.</description>

      <title>Topological chiral superconductivity beyond paring in Fermi-liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18067v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a mechanism to produce superconductivity by strong purely repulsive interactions, without using paring instability in Fermi-liquid. The resulting superconductors break both time-reversal and reflection symmetries in the orbital motion of electrons, and exhibit non-trivial topological order. Our findings suggest that this topological chiral superconductivity is more likely to emerge near or between fully spin-valley polarized metallic phase and Wigner crystal phase. Unlike conventional BCS superconductors in fully spin-valley polarized metals, these topological chiral superconductors are only partially spin-valley polarized, even though the neighboring normal state remains fully spin-valley polarized. The ratios of electron densities associated with different spin-valley quantum numbers are quantized as simple rational numbers. Furthermore, many of these topological chiral superconductors exhibit charge-4 or higher condensation. One of the topological chiral superconductors is in the same phase as the "spin"-triplet $p+ \textrm{i} p$ BCS superconductor, while others are in different phases than any BCS superconductors. The same mechanism is also used to produce anyon superconductivity between fractional anomalous quantum Hall states in the presence of a periodic potential.</description>
