      <title>A Characterization of Sequential Equilibrium through $\varepsilon$-Perfect $\gamma$-Sequential Equilibrium with Local Sequential Rationality and Its Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sequential equilibrium requires a consistent assessment and sequential rationality, where the consistent assessment emerges from a convergent sequence of totally mixed behavioral strategies and associated beliefs. However, the original definition lacks explicit guidance on constructing such convergent sequences. To overcome this difficulty, this paper presents a characterization of sequential equilibrium by introducing $\varepsilon$-perfect $\gamma$-sequential equilibrium with local sequential rationality. For any $\gamma&gt;0$, we establish a perfect $\gamma$-sequential equilibrium as a limit point of a sequence of $\varepsilon_k$-perfect $\gamma$-sequential equilibrium with $\varepsilon_k\to 0$. A sequential equilibrium is then derived from a limit point of a sequence of perfect $\gamma_q$-sequential equilibrium with $\gamma_q\to 0$. This characterization systematizes the construction of convergent sequences and enables the analytical determination of sequential equilibria and the development of a polynomial system serving as a necessary and sufficient condition for $\varepsilon$-perfect $\gamma$-sequential equilibrium. Exploiting the characterization, we develop a differentiable path-following method to compute a sequential equilibrium.</description>

      <title>A theory of anticipated surprise for understanding risky intertemporal choices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: People often deviate from expected utility theory when making risky and intertemporal choices. While the effects of probabilistic risk and time delay have been extensively studied in isolation, their interplay and underlying theoretical basis are still under debate. In this work, we applied our previously proposed anticipated surprise framework to intertemporal choices with and without explicit probabilistic risk, assuming that delayed reward may fail to materialize at a fixed hazard rate. The model prediction is consistent with key empirical findings: time inconsistency and aversion to timing risk stem from the avoidance of large negative surprises, while differences in mental representations of outcome resolution explain the conflicting effects of probabilistic risk on temporal discounting. This framework is applicable to a broad range of decision-making problems and offers a new perspective over how various types of risk may interact.</description>

      <title>The Design of Monopoly Information Broker</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An information broker incentivizes consumers to share their information, while designing an information structure to shape the market segmentation. The information broker is a metaphor for an Internet platform that matches consumers with retailers. We are interested in a market with heterogeneous retailers and heterogeneous consumers. The optimal broking mechanism consists of a simple threshold-based structure where consumers with strong preferences are assigned to the efficient retailer while consumers with weaker preferences are assigned to the inefficient retailer stochastically. Our analysis suggests that the privacy protection policy may have a stronger impact on less competitive retail markets.</description>

      <title>Redistribution Through Market Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14174v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study how to optimally segment monopolistic markets with a redistributive objective. We characterize optimal redistributive segmentations and show that they (i) induce the seller to price progressively, i.e., richer consumers pay higher prices than poorer ones, and (ii) may not maximize consumer surplus, instead granting extra profits to the monopolist. We further show that optimal redistributive segmentations are implementable via price-based regulation.</description>

      <title>Coarse-Grained Games: A Framework for Bounded Perception in Game Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17598v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In everyday life, we frequently make coarse-grained judgments. When we say that Olivia and Noah excel in mathematics, we disregard the specific differences in their mathematical abilities. Similarly, when we claim that a particular automobile manufacturer produces high-quality cars, we overlook the minor variations among individual vehicles. These coarse-grained assessments are distinct from erroneous or deceptive judgments, such as those resulting from student cheating or false advertising by corporations. Despite the prevalence of such judgments, little attention has been given to their underlying mathematical structure. In this paper, we introduce the concept of coarse-graining into game theory, analyzing games where players may perceive different payoffs as identical while preserving the underlying order structure. We call it a Coarse-Grained Game (CGG). This framework allows us to examine the rational inference processes that arise when players equate distinct micro-level payoffs at a macro level, and to explore how Nash equilibria are preserved or altered as a result. Our key findings suggest that CGGs possess several desirable properties that make them suitable for modeling phenomena in the social sciences. This paper demonstrates two such applications: first, in cases of overly minor product updates, consumers may encounter an equilibrium selection problem, resulting in market behavior that is not driven by objective quality differences; second, the lemon market can be analyzed not only through objective information asymmetry but also through asymmetries in perceptual resolution or recognition ability.</description>

      <title>Efficient Lower Bounding of Single Transferable Vote Election Margins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14847v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The single transferable vote (STV) is a system of preferential proportional voting employed in multi-seat elections. Each ballot cast by a voter is a (potentially partial) ranking over a set of candidates. The margin of victory, or simply 'margin', is the smallest number of ballots that need to be manipulated to alter the set of winners. Knowledge of the margin of an election gives greater insight into both how much time and money should be spent on auditing the election, and whether uncovered mistakes throw the election result into doubt -- requiring a costly repeat election -- or can be safely ignored without compromising the integrity of the result. Lower bounds on the margin can also be used for this purpose, in cases where exact margins are difficult to compute. There is one existing approach to computing lower bounds on the margin of STV elections, while there are multiple approaches to finding upper bounds. In this paper, we present improvements to this existing lower bound computation method for STV margins. The improvements lead to increased computational efficiency and, in many cases, to the algorithm computing tighter (higher) lower bounds.</description>
