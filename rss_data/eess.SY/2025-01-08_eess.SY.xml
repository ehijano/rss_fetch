      <title>Global network control from local information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the classical control of network systems, the control actions on a node are determined as a function of the states of all nodes in the network. Motivated by applications where the global state cannot be reconstructed in real time due to limitations in the collection, communication, and processing of data, here we introduce a control approach in which the control actions can be computed as a function of the states of the nodes within a limited state information neighborhood. The trade-off between the control performance and the size of this neighborhood is primarily determined by the condition number of the controllability Gramian. Our theoretical results are supported by simulations on regular and random networks and are further illustrated by an application to the control of power-grid synchronization. We demonstrate that for well-conditioned Gramians, there is no significant loss of control performance as the size of the state information neighborhood is reduced, allowing efficient control of large networks using only local information.</description>

      <title>A Unified Attack Detection Strategy for Multi-Agent Systems over Transient and Steady Stages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a unified detection strategy against three kinds of attacks for multi-agent systems (MASs) which is applicable to both transient and steady stages. For attacks on the communication layer, a watermarking-based detection scheme with KullbackLeibler (KL) divergence is designed. Different from traditional communication schemes, each agent transmits a message set containing two state values with different types of watermarking. It is found that the detection performance is determined by the relevant parameters of the watermarking signal. Unlike the existing detection manoeuvres, such a scheme is capable of transient and steady stages. For attacks on the agent layer, a convergence rate related detection approach is put forward. It is shown that the resilience of the considered system is characterized by the coefficient and offset of the envelope. For hybrid attacks, based on the above detection mechanisms, a general framework resorting to trusted agents is presented, which requires weaker graph conditions and less information transmission. Finally, an example associated with the platooning of connected vehicles is given to support the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Resilient Distributed Control for Uncertain Nonlinear Interconnected Systems under Network Anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address a distributed adaptive control methodology for nonlinear interconnected systems possibly affected by network anomalies. In the framework of adaptive approximation, the distributed controller and parameter estimator are designed by exploiting a backstepping approach. The stability of the distributed control system under anomalies is analyzed, where both local and neighboring anomaly effects are considered. To quantify the resilience of the interconnected system under the action of network anomalies, we derive bounds on the duration of each anomaly and the resting time between two consecutive anomalies. Specifically, when each anomaly duration is smaller than our designed upper bound, the interconnected system controlled by the distributed approximation-based controller remains asymptotically stable. Moreover, if the resting time between two consecutive anomalies is larger than the proposed bound, then all signals of the control system are guaranteed to be bounded. In the paper, we show that under the action of the proposed distributed adaptive controller, the interconnected system remains stable in the presence of network anomalies, with both the qualitative and quantitative resilient conditions. Extensive simulation results show the effectiveness of our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Proxy Control Barrier Functions: Integrating Barrier-Based and Lyapunov-Based Safety-Critical Control Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces a novel Proxy Control Barrier Function (PCBF) scheme that integrates barrier-based and Lyapunov-based safety-critical control strategies for strict-feedback systems with potentially unknown dynamics. The proposed method employs a modular design procedure, decomposing the original system into a proxy subsystem and a virtual tracking subsystem that are controlled by the control barrier function (CBF)-based and Lyapunov-based controllers, respectively. By integrating these separately designed controllers, the overall system's safety is ensured. Moreover, a new filter-based disturbance observer is utilized to design a PCBF-based safe controller for strict-feedback systems subject to mismatched disturbances. This approach broadens the class of systems to which CBF-based methods can be applied and significantly simplifies CBF construction by requiring only the model of the proxy subsystem. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Wireless Channel Measurements and Characterization in Industrial IoT Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi) communication technologies hold significant potential for realizing the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). In this paper, both Single-Input Single-Output (SISO) and polarized Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) channel measurements are conducted in an IIoT scenario at the less congested Wi-Fi band, i.e., 5.5~GHz. The purpose is to investigate wireless characteristics of communications between access points and terminals mounted on automated guided vehicles as well as those surrounding manufacturing areas. For SISO channel measurements, statistical properties including the delay Power Spectral Density (PSD), path loss, shadowing fading, delay spread, excess delay, K-factor, and amplitude distribution of small-scale fading are analyzed and compared with those observed in an office scenario. For MIMO channel measurements, results show that there are multiple Dense Multipath Component (DMC) processes in the delay PSD. An estimation algorithm based on the algorithm for a single DMC process is proposed to effectively process the multi-processes data. Moreover, delay, angular, power, and polarization properties of DMCs are investigated and compared with those of specular multipath components. Furthermore, effects of DMCs on Singular Values (SVs) and channel capacities are explored. Ignoring DMCs can overestimate SVs and underestimate channel capacities.</description>

      <title>A 3D Continuous-Space Electromagnetic Channel Model for 6G Tri-Polarized Multi-user Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is envisioned that the sixth generation (6G) and beyond 6G (B6G) wireless communication networks will enable global coverage in space, air, ground, and sea. In this case, both base stations and users can be mobile and will tend to move continuously in three-dimensional (3D) space. Therefore, obtaining channel state information (CSI) in 3D continuous-space is crucial for the design and performance evaluation of future 6G and B6G wireless systems. On the other hand, new 6G technologies such as integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) will also require prior knowledge of CSI in 3D continuous-space. In this paper, a 3D continuous-space electromagnetic channel model is proposed for tri-polarized multi-user communications, taking into account scatterers and spherical wavefronts. Scattered fields are calculated using the method of moments (MoM) with high accuracy. Spherical wave functions are utilized to decompose the dyadic Green's functions that connect the transmitted source currents and the received electric fields. Simulation results demonstrate that transmit power, apertures, scatterers, and sample intervals have significant impacts on statistical properties and channel capacities, providing insights into the performance of continuous-space electromagnetic channel models and the design of future wireless systems.</description>

      <title>Study of Frictional and Impact Transients in Active-Passive Mechanical Pair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an active-passive mechanical pair in which the relative motion of the latter is constrained by the mechanical impact. The system dynamics is described by the previously introduced modeling frameworks of force transition and dissipation through the nonlinear Coulomb friction and structural damping, the later in accord with Hertzian contact theory. The focus of the recent study is on combining both interaction mechanisms, and the detailed experimental evaluation which discloses validity of the modeling assumptions. Such mechanical pair interactions can be found in various mechatronic systems and mechanisms, like for example clutches, backlash elements, sliding items on the shaking and inclining surfaces, conveyor belts and others. This practical study demonstrates and discusses the transients of a vibro-impact dynamics and shows theoretical developments in line with experimental evaluation.</description>

      <title>Imitation Learning of MPC with Neural Networks: Error Guarantees and Sparsification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a framework for bounding the approximation error in imitation model predictive controllers utilizing neural networks. Leveraging the Lipschitz properties of these neural networks, we derive a bound that guides dataset design to ensure the approximation error remains at chosen limits. We discuss how this method can be used to design a stable neural network controller with performance guarantees employing existing robust model predictive control approaches for data generation. Additionally, we introduce a training adjustment, which is based on the sensitivities of the optimization problem and reduces dataset density requirements based on the derived bounds. We verify that the proposed augmentation results in improvements to the network's predictive capabilities and a reduction of the Lipschitz constant. Moreover, on a simulated inverted pendulum problem, we show that the approach results in a closer match of the closed-loop behavior between the imitation and the original model predictive controller.</description>

      <title>Robust Moving-horizon Estimation for Nonlinear Systems: From Perfect to Imperfect Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust stability of moving-horizon estimators is investigated for nonlinear discrete-time systems that are detectable in the sense of incremental input/output-to-state stability and are affected by disturbances. The estimate of a moving-horizon estimator stems from the on-line solution of a least-squares minimization problem at each time instant. The resulting stability guarantees depend on the optimization tolerance in solving such minimization problems. Specifically, two main contributions are established: (i) the robust stability of the estimation error, while supposing to solve exactly the on-line minimization problem; (ii) the practical robust stability of the estimation error with state estimates obtained by an imperfect minimization. Finally, the construction of such robust moving-horizon estimators and the performances resulting from the design based on the theoretical findings are showcased with two numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Power System Steady-State Estimation Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In power system steady-state estimation (PSSE), one needs to consider (1) the need for robust statistics, (2) the nonconvex transmission constraints, (3) the fast-varying nature of the inputs, and the corresponding need to track optimal trajectories as closely as possible. In combination, these challenges have not been considered, yet. In this paper, we address all three challenges. The need for robustness (1) is addressed by using an approach based on the so-called Huber model. The non-convexity (2) of the problem, which results in first order methods failing to find global minima, is dealt with by applying global methods. One of these methods is based on a mixed integer quadratic formulation, which provides results of several orders of magnitude better than conventional gradient descent. Lastly, the trajectory tracking (3) is discussed by showing under which conditions the trajectory tracking of the SDP relaxations has meaning.</description>

      <title>TinySense: A Lighter Weight and More Power-efficient Avionics System for Flying Insect-scale Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the prospects and challenges of sensor suites in achieving autonomous control for flying insect robots (FIRs) weighing less than a gram. FIRs, owing to their minuscule weight and size, offer unparalleled advantages in terms of material cost and scalability. However, their size introduces considerable control challenges, notably high-speed dynamics, restricted power, and limited payload capacity. While there have been notable advancements in developing lightweight sensors, often drawing inspiration from biological systems, no sub-gram aircraft has been able to attain sustained hover without relying on feedback from external sensing such as a motion capture system. The lightest vehicle capable of sustained hover -- the first level of "sensor autonomy" -- is the much larger 28 g Crazyflie. Previous work reported a reduction in size of that vehicle's avionics suite to 187 mg and 21 mW. Here, we report a further reduction in mass and power to only 78.4 mg and 15 mW. We replaced the laser rangefinder with a lighter and more efficient pressure sensor, and built a smaller optic flow sensor around a global-shutter imaging chip. A Kalman Filter (KF) fuses these measurements to estimate the state variables that are needed to control hover: pitch angle, translational velocity, and altitude. Our system achieved performance comparable to that of the Crazyflie's estimator while in flight, with root mean squared errors of 1.573 degrees, 0.186 m/s, and 0.139 m, respectively, relative to motion capture.</description>

      <title>Extending Internet Access Over LoRa for Internet of Things and Critical Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LoRa bridges the gap between remote locations and mainstream networks, enabling large-scale Internet of Things (IoT) deployments. Despite the recent advancements around LoRa, Internet access over this technology is still largely unexplored. Most existing solutions only handle packets within the local LoRa network and do not interact with web applications. This limits the scalability and the ability to deliver essential web services in disconnected regions. This work proposes and implements ILoRa to extend the public Internet to disconnected areas for essential service delivery. ILoRa enables accessing Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and web pages on the Internet over a LoRa backbone network. It comprises a ILoRa coordinator code (ICN) and access point nodes (APNs). The ICN interfaces the LoRa network with the public Internet and interprets content. The APN tethers a WiFi hotspot to which devices connect and access the web content. This work further proposes data handling methods for ICNs and APNs. An actual hardware-based implementation validates the proposed system. The implementation achieves a throughput of 1.06 kbps tested for an Internet-based API returning JSON data of 930 B. Furthermore, the APN consumed approximately $0.162$A current, and the resource utilization on the ICN was minimal.</description>

      <title>Distributionally Robust Joint Chance-Constrained Optimal Power Flow using Relative Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing robust algorithms for the optimal power flow (OPF) problem is critical for the control of large-scale power systems under uncertainty. The chance-constrained OPF (CCOPF) problem provides a natural formulation of the trade-off between the operating cost and the constraint satisfaction rate. In this work, we propose a new data-driven algorithm for the CCOPF problem, based on distributionally robust optimization (DRO). \revise{We show that the proposed reformulation of the distributionally robust chance constraints is exact, whereas other approaches in the CCOPF literature rely on conservative approximations. We establish out-of-sample robustness guarantees for the distributionally robust solution and prove that the solution is the most efficient among all approaches enjoying the same guarantees.} We apply the proposed algorithm to the the CCOPF problem and compare the performance of our approach with existing methods using simulations on IEEE benchmark power systems.</description>

      <title>A Novel Approach to Real-Time Short-Term Traffic Prediction based on Distributed Fiber-Optic Sensing and Data Assimilation with a Stochastic Cell-Automata Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper demonstrates real-time short-term traffic flow prediction through distributed fiber-optic sensing (DFOS) and data assimilation with a stochastic cell-automata-based traffic model. Traffic congestion on expressways is a severe issue. To alleviate its negative impacts, it is necessary to optimize traffic flow prior to becoming serious congestion. For this purpose, real-time short-term traffic flow prediction is promising. However, conventional traffic monitoring apparatus used in prediction methods faces a technical issue due to the sparsity in traffic flow data. To overcome the issue for realizing real-time traffic prediction, this paper employs DFOS, which enables to obtain spatially continuous and real-time traffic flow data along the road without dead zones. Using mean velocities derived from DFOS data as a feature extraction, this paper proposes a real-time data assimilation method for the short-term prediction. As the theoretical model, the stochastic Nishinari-Fukui-Schadschneider model is adopted. Future traffic flow is simulated with the optimal values of model parameters estimated from observed mean velocities and the initial condition estimated as the latest microscopic traffic state. This concept is validated using two congestion scenarios obtained in Japanese expressways. The results show that the mean absolute error of the predicted mean velocities is 10-15 km/h in the prediction horizon of 30 minutes. Furthermore, the prediction error in congestion length and travel time decreases by 40-84% depending on congestion scenarios when compared with conventional methods with traffic counters. This paper concludes that real-time data assimilation using DFOS enables an accurate short-term traffic prediction.</description>

      <title>Stabilization of Strictly Pre-Dissipative Receding Horizon Linear Quadratic Control by Terminal Costs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Asymptotic stability in receding horizon control is obtained under a strict pre-dissipativity assumption, in the presence of suitable state constraints. In this paper we analyze how terminal constraints can be replaced by suitable terminal costs. We restrict to the linear-quadratic setting as that allows us to obtain stronger results, while we analyze the full nonlinear case in a separate contribution.</description>

      <title>A Multimodal Lightweight Approach to Fault Diagnosis of Induction Motors in High-Dimensional Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An accurate AI-based diagnostic system for induction motors (IMs) holds the potential to enhance proactive maintenance, mitigating unplanned downtime and curbing overall maintenance costs within an industrial environment. Notably, among the prevalent faults in IMs, a Broken Rotor Bar (BRB) fault is frequently encountered. Researchers have proposed various fault diagnosis approaches using signal processing (SP), machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and hybrid architectures for BRB faults. One limitation in the existing literature is the training of these architectures on relatively small datasets, risking overfitting when implementing such systems in industrial environments. This paper addresses this limitation by implementing large-scale data of BRB faults by using a transfer-learning-based lightweight DL model named ShuffleNetV2 for diagnosing one, two, three, and four BRB faults using current and vibration signal data. Spectral images for training and testing are generated using a Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT). The dataset comprises 57,500 images, with 47,500 used for training and 10,000 for testing. Remarkably, the ShuffleNetV2 model exhibited superior performance, in less computational cost as well as accurately classifying 98.856% of spectral images. To further enhance the visualization of harmonic sidebands resulting from broken bars, Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is applied to current and vibration data. The paper also provides insights into the training and testing times for each model, contributing to a comprehensive understanding of the proposed fault diagnosis methodology. The findings of our research provide valuable insights into the performance and efficiency of different ML and DL models, offering a foundation for the development of robust fault diagnosis systems for induction motors in industrial settings.</description>

      <title>Resilient Control of Dynamic Flow Networks Subject to Stochastic Cyber-Physical Disruptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2004.00159v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern network systems, such as transportation and communication systems, are prone to cyber-physical disruptions and thus suffer efficiency loss. This paper studies network resiliency, in terms of throughput, and develops resilient control to improve throughput. We consider single-commodity networks that admit congestion propagation. We also apply a Markov process to model disruption switches. For throughput analysis, we first use insights into congestion spillback to propose novel Lyapunov functions and then exploit monotone network dynamics to reduce computational costs of verifying stability conditions. For control design, we show that (i) for a network with infinite link storage space, there exists an open-loop control that attains the min-expected-cut capacity; (ii) for a network with observable disruptions that restrict maximum sending and/or receiving flows, there exists a mode-dependent control that attains the expected-min-cut capacity; (iii) for general networks, there exists a closed-loop control with throughput guarantees. We also derive lower bounds of resiliency scores for a set of numerical examples and verify resiliency improvement with our method.</description>

      <title>Optimal Time-Invariant Distributed Formation Tracking for Second-Order Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.12235v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the optimal time-invariant formation tracking problem with the aim of providing a distributed solution for multi-agent systems with second-order integrator dynamics. In the literature, most of the results related to multi-agent formation tracking do not consider energy issues while investigating distributed feedback control laws. In order to account for this crucial design aspect, we contribute by formalizing and proposing a solution to an optimization problem that encapsulates trajectory tracking, distance-based formation control and input energy minimization, through a specific and key choice of potential functions in the optimization cost. To this end, we show how to compute the inverse dynamics in a centralized fashion by means of the Projector-Operator-based Newton's method for Trajectory Optimization (PRONTO) and, more importantly, we exploit such an offline solution as a general reference to devise a stabilizing online distributed control law. Finally, numerical examples involving a cubic formation following a chicane-like path in the 3D space are provided to validate the proposed control strategies.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Uncertainty for a Separation Principle in Direct Data-Driven Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14788v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a powerful method for complex system regulation, but its reliance on an accurate model poses many limitations in real-world applications. Data-driven predictive control (DDPC) aims at overcoming this limitation, by relying on historical data to provide information on the plant to be controlled. In this work, we present a unified stochastic framework for direct DDPC, where control actions are obtained by optimizing the Final Control Error (FCE), which is directly computed from available data only and automatically weighs the impact of uncertainty on the control objective. Our framework allows us to establish a separation principle for Predictive Control, elucidating the role that predictive models and their uncertainty play in DDPC. Moreover, it generalizes existing DDPC methods, like regularized Data-enabled Predictive Control (DeePC) and $\gamma$-DDPC, providing a path toward noise-tolerant data-based control with rigorous optimality guarantees. The theoretical investigation is complemented by a series of experiments (code available on GitHub: https://github.com/marcofabris92/a-separation-principle-in-d3pc), revealing that the proposed method consistently outperforms or, at worst, matches existing techniques without requiring tuning regularization parameters as other methods do.</description>

      <title>Joint Observer Gain and Input Design for Asymptotic Active Fault Diagnosis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09061v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a joint gain and input design method for observer-based asymptotic active fault diagnosis, which is based on a newly-defined notion named the excluding degree of the origin from a zonotope. Using the excluding degree, a quantitative specification is obtained to characterize the performance of set-based robust fault diagnosis. Furthermore, a single gain design method and a joint gain and input design method are proposed, respectively. This is the first work to achieve a joint observer gain and input design for set-based active fault diagnosis. Compared with the existing methods that design gains and input separately, the proposed joint gain and input design method has advantages to exploit the fault diagnosis potential of observer-based schemes. Finally, several examples are used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Robust Backstepping Control of a Quadrotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Under Colored Noises</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05022v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Advances in software and hardware technologies have facilitated the production of quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Nowadays, people actively use quadrotor UAVs in essential missions such as search and rescue, counter-terrorism, firefighting, surveillance, and cargo transportation. While performing these tasks, quadrotors must operate in noisy environments. Therefore, a robust controller design that can control the altitude and attitude of the quadrotor in noisy environments is of great importance. Many researchers have focused only on white Gaussian noise in their studies, whereas researchers need to consider the effects of all colored noises during the operation of the quadrotor. This study aims to design a robust controller that is resistant to all colored noises. Firstly, a nonlinear quadrotor model was created with MATLAB. Then, a backstepping controller resistant to colored noises was designed. The designed backstepping controller was tested under Gaussian white, pink, brown, blue, and purple noises. PID and Lyapunov-based controller designs were also carried out, and their time responses (rise time, overshoot, settling time) were compared with those of the backstepping controller. In the simulations, time was in seconds, altitude was in meters, and roll, pitch, and yaw references were in radians. Rise and settling time values were in seconds, and overshoot value was in percent. When the obtained values are examined, simulations prove that the proposed backstepping controller has the least overshoot and the shortest settling time under all noise types.</description>

      <title>A Volumetric Approach to Privacy of Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02893v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Information-theoretic metrics, such as mutual information, have been widely used to evaluate privacy leakage in dynamic systems. However, these approaches are typically limited to stochastic systems and face computational challenges. In this paper, we introduce a novel volumetric framework for analyzing privacy in systems affected by unknown but bounded noise. Our model considers a dynamic system comprising public and private states, where an observation set of the public state is released. An adversary utilizes the observed public state to infer an uncertainty set of the private state, referred to as the inference attack. We define the evolution dynamics of these inference attacks and quantify the privacy level of the private state using the volume of its uncertainty sets. For linear scalar systems, we derive an explicit formulation of the uncertainty set. For multi-dimensional linear systems, we develop an approximate computation method leveraging interval analysis. We investigate the properties of the proposed volumetric privacy measure and demonstrate that it is bounded by the information gain derived from the observation set. Furthermore, we propose an optimization approach to designing privacy filter using randomization and linear programming based on the proposed privacy measure. The effectiveness of the optimal privacy filter design is evaluated through a production-inventory case study, illustrating its robustness against the inference attack.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Router for LLM Workloads: Improving Performance Through Workload-Aware Load Balancing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13510v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) workloads have distinct prefill and decode phases with different compute and memory requirements which should ideally be accounted for when scheduling input queries across different LLM instances in a cluster. However existing scheduling algorithms treat LLM workloads as monolithic jobs without considering the distinct characteristics of the two phases in each workload. This leads to sub-optimal scheduling and increased response latency. In this work, we start by characterizing factors affecting the response latency during LLM inference serving. We establish that better load balancing of inference requests across the available LLM instances can improve the end-to-end latency to a larger extent than merely focusing on optimizing the instance-level scheduler. Motivated by our findings, we propose a heuristic-guided reinforcement learning-based intelligent router for data-driven and workload-aware scheduling. Our router schedules queries across LLM instances by leveraging a trainable response-length predictor, and a novel formulation for estimating the impact of mixing different workloads and achieves over 11% lower end-to-end latency than existing approaches on a mix of public datasets and 7.8% lower end-to-end latency on real workload data with diverse input and output trends from Cloud Provider X. Additionally, the proposed framework can also serve as a standard for benchmarking different LLM inference schedulers since it provides the best latency for a given model, hardware, and instance-level scheduler combination.</description>

      <title>Soft Adaptive Feet for Legged Robots: An Open-Source Model for Locomotion Simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03191v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, artificial feet based on soft robotics and under-actuation principles emerged to improve mobility on challenging terrains. This paper presents the application of the MuJoCo physics engine to realize a digital twin of an adaptive soft foot developed for use with legged robots. We release the MuJoCo soft foot digital twin as open source to allow users and researchers to explore new approaches to locomotion. The work includes the system modeling techniques along with the kinematic and dynamic attributes involved. Validation is conducted through a rigorous comparison with bench tests on a physical prototype, replicating these experiments in simulation. Results are evaluated based on sole deformation and contact forces during foot-obstacle interaction. The foot model is subsequently integrated into simulations of the humanoid robot COMAN+, replacing its original flat feet. Results show an improvement in the robot's ability to negotiate small obstacles without altering its control strategy. Ultimately, this study offers a comprehensive modeling approach for adaptive soft feet, supported by qualitative comparisons of bipedal locomotion with state of the art robotic feet.</description>
