      <title>Half a century of the theory of synchronization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This review offers a retrospective of the development of the theory of coupled oscillators and synchronization over the past half century. Among the various works made by myself during this period, the following three specific works will be focused on, serving as some key points to illustrate the field's evolution. They are the derivation of (1) a simple partial differential equation exhibiting spatio-tempoeral chaos (Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equaiton), (2) a solvable mathematical model describing synchronization phase transition (Kuramoto model), and the discovery of (3) coexistence of coherence and incoherence in nonlocally coupled oscillators (chimera states). It is emphasized that all these works resulted fron the phase reduction of the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation (or its variants), the equation which was derived with a coworker in 1974 from a certain reaction-diffusion model. A quick overview will also be made on how the above three works influenced the subsequent development of the field of coupled oscillators and synchronization. Finally, a few comments will be made on how the methods of dynamical reduction, such as the center-manifold reduction and phase reduction, are crucial for exploring this field in depth. This article is a largely faithful reproduction of the content presented in my award lecture.</description>

      <title>Body-Reservoir Governance in Repeated Games: Embodied Decision-Making, Dynamic Sentinel Adaptation, and Complexity-Regularized Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Standard game theory explains cooperation in repeated games through conditional strategies such as Tit-for-Tat (TfT), but these require continuous computation that imposes physical costs on embodied agents. We propose a three-layer Body-Reservoir Governance (BRG) architecture: (1) a body reservoir (echo state network) whose $d$-dimensional state performs implicit inference over interaction history, serving as both decision-maker and anomaly detector, (2) a cognitive filter providing costly strategic tools activated on demand, and (3) a metacognitive governance layer with receptivity parameter $\alpha \in [0,1]$. At full body governance ($\alpha=1$), closed-loop dynamics satisfy a self-consistency equation: cooperation is expressed as the reservoir's fixed point, not computed. Strategy complexity cost is defined as the KL divergence between the reservoir's state distribution and its habituated baseline. Body governance reduces this cost, with action variance decreasing up to $1600\times$ with dimension $d$. A dynamic sentinel generates a composite discomfort signal from the reservoir's own state, driving adaptive $\alpha(t)$: near baseline during cooperation, rapidly dropping upon defection to activate cognitive retaliation. Overriding the body incurs thermodynamic cost proportional to internal state distortion. The sentinel achieves the highest payoff across all conditions, outperforming static body governance, TfT, and EMA baselines. A dimension sweep ($d \in \{5,\ldots,100\}$) shows implicit inference scales with bodily richness ($23\times$ to $1600\times$ variance reduction), attributable to reservoir dynamics. A phase diagram in $(d, \tau_{\mathrm{env}})$ space reveals governance regime transitions near $d \approx 20$. The framework reinterprets cooperation as the minimum-dissipation response of an adapted dynamical system -- emergent from embodied dynamics rather than computed.</description>

      <title>Empathy Modeling in Active Inference Agents for Perspective-Taking and Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial agents capable of understanding and aligning with others' intentions are essential for safe and socially robust artificial intelligence. We introduce a computational framework for empathy in active inference agents, grounded in explicit perspective-taking via self-other model transformation.
  We instantiate this framework in a multi-agent Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma and show that empathic perspective-taking induces robust cooperation without explicit communication or reward shaping. Cooperation emerges only when empathy is reciprocated, while asymmetric empathy leads to systematic exploitation. Beyond equilibrium outcomes, empathic agents exhibit synchronized behavior, rapid recovery from stochastic defections, and joint intentional dynamics resembling apology-forgiveness cycles. Near empathy symmetry, interactions display long transients and elevated variance, consistent with critical dynamics near regime boundaries.
  We further examine a learning-enabled variant in which agents infer opponent type via Bayesian updating. While opponent models converge rapidly, long-run cooperation remains primarily determined by the empathy parameter, indicating that cooperation is driven by empathic structure rather than learned reciprocity. Empathy functions as a structural prior over social interaction, shaping coordination stability, robustness, and temporal dynamics. The proposed framework highlights active inference as a principled foundation for socially aligned artificial agents that coordinate through internal simulation rather than behavioral mimicry.</description>

      <title>Dynamic link switching induces stable synchronized states in sparse networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08007v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The flow of information in networked systems composed of multiple interacting elements strongly depends on the level of connectivity among these elements. Sparse connectivity often hinders the emergence of states in which information is globally shared, such as fully synchronized states. In this context, dynamically switching existing network links among system elements can facilitate the onset of synchronization. Here, we address this problem in a double-layer network of FitzHugh-Nagumo oscillators with sparse inter-layer connectivity at fixed density. We show that dynamically switching the existing cross-layer links induces inter-layer synchronization, with a clear dependence on the switching time. In agreement with intuition, shorter switching times suppress large deviations between temporally connected oscillators and more effectively promote synchronization; crucially, this effect persists even when each isolated layer is chaotic. Chaos at the layer level is verified by a strictly positive largest Lyapunov exponent, confirming that synchrony is induced by switching rather than by periodic dynamics. For a minimal double-layer system, we emulate switching using smooth square waves and compute the master stability function (MSF), which is in agreement with direct numerical simulations and delineates the stability regions in parameter space.</description>
