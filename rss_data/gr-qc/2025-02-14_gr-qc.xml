      <title>Rotating and swirling binary black hole system balanced by its gravitational spin-spin interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first exact and analytical solution representing an equilibrium configuration of two stationary black holes, in general relativity, is presented. The metric models two collinear extremal Kerr black holes immersed into an external and back-reacting rotating tidal drag. The gravitational attraction is balanced by the repulsive gravitational spin-spin interaction generated by the interplay between black holes angular momenta with the rotational background. The new solution is built by embedding the double Kerr metric into a swirling universe by means of the Ehlers transformation. The geometry is completely regular outside the event horizons. Thermodynamic properties of the binary black hole system are studied, the Smarr law, the first law and the Christodoulou-Ruffini formulas are verified. Microscopic degrees of freedom of the entropy are computed from the dual CFT living on the boundary of the near horizon geometries.</description>

      <title>The Statistical Mechanics of Hawking Radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hawking radiation and black hole thermodynamics are well understood in the frameworks of quantum field theory and general relativity, with contemporary extensions in string theory, AdS/CFT, and loop quantum gravity. However, an open question remains: \textit{Can Hawking radiation be consistently described using statistical mechanics?} This challenge arises due to the ambiguous quantum nature of Hawking particles and constraints from information conservation. This study develops a heuristic statistical model, treating Hawking particles as timelike with an effective mass and obeying any statistical distribution. The flow of information is modeled as a transfer of microstates from the event horizon to the radiation background within a closed ensemble. From this, we obtain the Hawking particle mass $m_H=\hbar/(2\pi r_S)$ and the system energy of the black hole as its thermal energy: $E=\hbar/(8\pi GM)$. Beyond preserving conventional insights, reinforcing the statistical nature of black hole evaporation, this approach introduces novel perspectives: modeling the black hole as a structured energy well containing microstates, quantifying the evaporation rate of individual microstates, and determining the total number of microstates from the horizon surface area. This study leaves the door open for a stochastic mechanical analysis, which is introduced in the Discussion section.</description>

      <title>Equatorial periodic orbits and gravitational waveforms in a black hole free of Cauchy horizon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the periodic orbits and gravitational wave radiation in an extreme mass ratio inspiral system, where a stellar-mass object orbits a supermassive black hole without Cauchy horizons. Firstly, by using the effective potential, the marginally bound orbits and the innermost stable circular orbits are investigated. It is found that the radius, orbital angular momentum, and energy increase with the hair parameter for both orbits. Based on these results, we examine one special type of orbit, the periodic orbit, around the black hole without the Cauchy horizon. The results show that, for a fixed rational number, the energy and angular momentum of the periodic orbit increase with the hair parameter. In particular, we observe a significant deviation from the Schwarzschild case for small hair parameter with a large amount of external mass outside the black hole horizon. Moreover, we examine the waveforms in the extreme mass ratio inspiral system to explore the orbital information of the periodic orbits and the constraints on the parameters of the black holes. The results reveal that the gravitational waveforms can fully capture the zoom-whirl behavior of periodic orbits. Moreover, the phase of the gravitational waves imposes constraints on the parameters of the black hole solutions. As the system evolves, the phase shift of the waveforms becomes increasingly significant, with cumulative deviations becoming more pronounced over time. Compared to the Schwarzschild black hole background, the waveform phase will advance for the central supermassive black hole without a Cauchy horizon.</description>

      <title>Periodic orbits and their gravitational wave radiations in black hole with dark matter halo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the gravitational dynamics of a spherically symmetric black hole embedded within a dark matter halo, focusing on the impact of the dark matter halo on time-like particle geodesics. We analyze key orbital parameters, including marginally bound orbits, innermost stable circular orbits, and periodic orbits, demonstrating how the dark matter halo alters their energy and angular momentum compared to an isolated black hole. Furthermore, we calculate the gravitational waveforms emitted by these periodic orbits, providing potential observational signatures for such systems. Our results demonstrate a clear correlation between the gravitational waveforms emitted by a small object orbiting a supermassive black hole and the object's zoom-whirl orbital behavior. Higher zoom numbers correspond to more complex waveform substructures. The presence of a dark matter halo significantly impacts these waveforms. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of the interplay between black holes and dark matter halos, offering insights into their complex gravitational interactions.</description>

      <title>Localized past stability of the subcritical Kasner-scalar field spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the nonlinear stability, in the contracting direction, of the entire subcritical family of Kasner-scalar field solutions to the Einstein-scalar field equations in four spacetime dimensions. Our proof relies on a zero-shift, orthonormal frame decomposition of a conformal representation of the Einstein-scalar field equations. To synchronise the big bang singularity, we use the time coordinate $\tau = \exp\bigl(\frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}\phi\bigr)$, where $\phi$ is the scalar field, which coincides with a conformal harmonic time slicing. We show that the perturbed solutions are asymptotically pointwise Kasner, geodesically incomplete to the past and terminate at quiescent, crushing big bang singularities located at $\tau=0$, which are characterised by curvature blow up. Specifically, we establish two stability theorems. The first is a global in-space stability result where the perturbed spacetimes are of the form $M =\bigcup_{t\in (0,t_0]} \tau^{-1}(\{t\}) \cong (0,t_0] \times \mathbb{T}^{3}$. The second is a localised version where the perturbed spacetimes are given by $M=\bigcup_{t\in (0,t_0]}\tau^{-1}(\{t\})\cong \bigcup_{t\in (0,t_0]} \{t\}\times\mathbb{B}_{\rho(t)}$ with time-dependent radius function $\rho(t)=\rho_0+(1-\vartheta)\rho_0\bigl(\bigl(\frac{t}{t_0}\bigr)^{1-\epsilon}-1\bigr)$. Spatial localisation is achieved through our choice of zero-shift, harmonic time slicing that leads to hyperbolic evolution equations with a finite propagation speed.</description>

      <title>Analog charged black hole formation via percolation: Exploring cosmic censorship and Hoop conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate an analog model of charged black hole (BH) formation using the framework of classical percolation. By analyzing the scaling behavior of key quantities, including surface gravity and Komar mass, we establish a robust correspondence between this analog system and gravitational collapse in general relativity. Our numerical simulations of the lattice model show excellent agreement with analytical predictions for the continuum limit, highlighting the potential of analog systems to capture essential features of BH physics. Interestingly, we find that while geometric criteria related to the hoop conjecture are necessary, they are not sufficient for BH formation in our model. Instead, the exponential growth of energy and cluster size emerges as the key indicator, suggesting a novel interpretation of the hoop conjecture and providing further support for cosmic censorship within our analog framework by ensuring horizon formation. This work offers a fresh perspective on the organization of matter within BH event horizons and lays the groundwork for future quantum extensions that could shed light on Hawking radiation and the BH information paradox by linking entanglement entropy in quantum percolation models to BH entropy.</description>

      <title>Incorporating Backreaction in One-Loop Corrections in Ultra-Slow-Roll Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the one-loop quantum correction to the power spectrum of primordial curvature perturbations in the ultra-slow-roll (USR) inflationary scenario, incorporating the backreaction effect from curvature perturbations. In the spatially-flat gauge, we expand the background inflaton field up to second order and identify the one-loop level backreaction term in the action. Utilizing a gauge transformation, we derive the comoving curvature interaction Hamiltonian in the presence of the backreaction term and calculate the one-loop correction using the in-in formalism. Our results reveal that the one-loop super-horizon corrections previously reported in the literature are canceled by the backreaction contributions. This finding underscores the importance of accounting for the backreaction effects in the analysis of quantum corrections during USR inflation.</description>

      <title>Gravitational friction from d'Alembert's principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The least action principle played a central role in the development of modern physics. A major drawback of the principle is that its applicability is limited to holonomic constraints. In the present work, we investigate the energy lost by particles as a result of the gravitational interaction in a homogeneous low-density medium subject to non-holonomic constraints. We perform the calculation for an arbitrary particle and outline the specific result for photons. The energy lost is calculated from first principles based on the principle of virtual work and the d'Alembert principle. Under the formalism mentioned above, the dissipative nature of the effect is established. Furthermore, we show that the results agree with an alternative derivation based on continuum mechanics and the Euler-Cauchy stress principle.</description>

      <title>The Mechanism behind the Information Encoding for Islands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entanglement islands are subregions in a gravitational universe whose information is fully encoded in a disconnected non-gravitational system away from it. In the context of the black hole information paradox, entanglement islands state that the information about the black hole interior is encoded in the early-time Hawking radiation. Nevertheless, it was unclear how this seemingly nonlocal information encoding emerges from a manifestly local theory. In this paper, we provide an answer to this question by uncovering the mechanism behind this information encoding scheme. As we will see, the early understanding that graviton is massive in island models plays an essential role in this mechanism. As an example, we will discuss how this mechanism works in detail in the Karch-Randall braneworld. This study also suggests the potential importance of this mechanism to the ER=EPR conjecture.</description>

      <title>Conservation of superhorizon curvature perturbations at one loop: Backreaction in the in-in formalism and Renormalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the superhorizon-limit curvature perturbations are conserved at one-loop level in single-field inflation models with a transient non-slow-roll period. We take the spatially-flat gauge, where the backreaction plays a crucial role for the conservation of superhorizon curvature perturbations unless the counter terms are tuned. We calculate the backreaction with the in-in formalism. In addition, we explicitly show the renormalization of the UV divergences with the counter terms.</description>

      <title>Constraining Axion Dark Matter with Galactic-Centre Resonant Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the influence of axion dark-matter cores on the orbits of stars at the Galactic centre. This dark matter candidate condenses into dense, solitonic cores, and, if a super-massive black hole is present at the centre of such a core, its central part forms a 'gravitational atom'. Here, we calculate the atom's contribution to the gravitational potential felt by a Galactic-centre star, for a generic quantum state of the atom. We study the angular-momentum dynamics this potential induces, and show that it is similar to vector resonant relaxation. Its influence is found to be sufficiently strong that such a dynamical component should be accounted for in Galactic-centre modelling. For the Milky Way, the atom is expected to have some spherical asymmetry, and we use this to derive a stability condition for the disc of young, massive stars at the Galactic centre - if the atom's mass is too large, then the disc would be destroyed. Thus, the existence of this disc constrains the mass of the axion particles comprising the solitonic core; for plausible parameter values, such a core is found to be in tension with the existence of the clockwise stellar disc at $2\sigma$ for $4.4\times 10^{-20}\,\textrm{eV} \leq m_a \leq 5.3\times 10^{-20}\,\textrm{eV}$. These constraints will tighten significantly with future, improved data.</description>

      <title>Firewalls From General Covariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I define "horizon normalcy" as the approximate validity of Semiclassical Gravity and Effective Field Theory (SGEFT), for the description of observers that approach or cross a black hole horizon. If black holes return information, then horizon normalcy must fail substantially, at least in some global states. Proposals such as ER=EPR and nonisometric maps assert that horizon normalcy persists, so long as the Hawking radiation remains in a computationally simple state. Here I argue that state-dependent horizon normalcy - independently of the underlying mechanism, and independently of the class of radiation states asserted to guarantee normalcy - requires a breakdown of general covariance far from the black hole, or else horizon normalcy will depend on the infinite future of the exterior. This is because the radiation can be in different states at different events, all spacelike to the horizon crossing event whose normalcy is at stake. I discuss a related effect in AdS/CFT, and I argue that its resolution by timefolds is of no help here.</description>

      <title>Vacuum Polarization, Geodesic Equation and Sachs-Wolfe Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the null geodesic equation for photons is modified in the presence of a charged scalar field, with quantum fluctuations acting as an effective mass term that changes the null paths to timelike curves. This effect can be interpreted as a vacuum polarization phenomenon in curved spacetime. The resulting contribution to the Sachs-Wolfe effect varies with photon frequency, leading to frequency-dependent corrections to the cosmic microwave background (CMB) blackbody spectrum in the form of a $\mu$-distortion, as well as modifications to the CMB power spectrum. We estimate these within a standard inflationary scenario and find that while the correction to the CMB power spectrum is significant when the scalar field is light, the magnitude of the $\mu$-distortion depends strongly on the regularization prescription.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we analyze a scalar field model which gives rise to stable bound states in field space characterized by nonzero motion that breaks the underlying time translation symmetry of its Hamiltonian, known as time crystals. We demonstrate that an ideal fluid made up of these time crystals behaves as phantom dark energy characterized by an equation of state $w \le -1$, speed of sound squared $c_{s}^{2} &gt; 0$, and nonnegative energy density $\rho \ge 0$.</description>

      <title>The Nature of Phantom Dark Energy and its Relation to Time Crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this letter we show that, at its fundamental level, phantom dark energy is a fluid made up of time crystals that permeate the fabric of space-time. In turn, any well-behaved stable theory of a non-canonical scalar field that acts as phantom dark energy also leads to the production of time crystals. This relation offers a new way of thinking and a deeper insight into the nature of the most inexplicable of all ingredients in the universe, dark energy.</description>

Abstract: We compute the conservative and radiation-reaction contributions to classical observables in the gravitational scattering between a spinning and a spinless black hole to the fourth order in spin and third order in the gravitational constant. The conservative results are obtained from two-loop amplitudes for the scattering process of a massive scalar with a massive spin-$s$ field $(s=0, 1, 2)$ minimally coupled to gravity, employing the recently introduced spin interpolation method to resolve all spin-Casimir terms. The two-loop amplitude exhibits a spin-shift symmetry in both probe limits, which we conjecture to be a sign of yet unknown integrability of Kerr orbits through the quartic order in spin and to all orders in the gravitational constant. We obtain the radial action from the finite part of the amplitude and use it to compute classical observables, including the impulse and spin kick. This is done using the recently introduced covariant Dirac brackets, which allow for the computation of classical scattering observables for general (non-aligned) spin configurations. Finally, employing the radiation-reaction amplitude proposed by Alessio and Di Vecchia, together with the Dirac brackets, we obtain radiation-reaction contributions to observables at all orders in spin and beyond the aligned-spin limit. We find agreement with known results up to the quadratic order in spin for both conservative and radiation-reaction contributions. Our results advance the state of the art in the understanding of spinning binary dynamics in general relativity and demonstrate the power and simplicity of the Dirac bracket formalism for relating scattering amplitudes to classical observables.</description>

      <title>Gauss-Bonnet-induced symmetry breaking/restoration during inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a mechanism of symmetry breaking or restoration that can occur in the middle of inflation due to the coupling of the Gauss-Bonnet term to a charged scalar. The Gauss-Bonnet coupling results in an inflaton-dependent effective squared mass of the charged scalar, which can change its sign (around the symmetric point) during inflation. This can lead to spontaneous breaking of the symmetry, or to its restoration, if it is initially broken. We show the conditions under which the backreaction of the Gauss-Bonnet coupling on the inflationary background is negligible, such that the predictions of a given inflationary model are unaffected by the symmetry breaking/restoration process.</description>

      <title>PSR J0952-0607: Probing the Stiffest Equations of State and r-Mode Suppression Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze PSR J0952-0607, the most massive and fastest spinning neutron star observed to date, to refine constraints on the neutron star equation of state (EoS) and investigate its robustness against r-mode instabilities. With a mass of \( 2.35 \pm 0.17 \, M_{\odot} \) and a spin frequency of 709.2 Hz, PSR J0952-0607 provides a unique opportunity to examine the effects of rapid rotation on the structure of a neutron star. Using a Bayesian framework, we incorporate the rotationally corrected mass of PSR J0952-0607, alongside PSR J0740+6620's static mass measurement, to constrain the EoS. Our findings demonstrate that neglecting rotational effects leads to biases in the inferred EoS, while including the neutron star spin produces tighter constraints on pressure-density and mass-radius relations. Additionally, we explore the r-mode instability window for PSR J0952-0607 under the assumption of both rigid and elastic crust models and find that a rigid crust allows a higher stable temperature range, whereas an elastic crust places the star within the instability window under certain thermal insulation conditions.</description>

      <title>Low-Acceleration Gravitational Anomaly from Bayesian 3D Modeling of Wide Binary Orbits: Methodology and Results with Gaia DR3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Isolated wide binary stars provide natural laboratories to directly test or measure weak gravity for Newtonian acceleration $g_{\rm{N}}\lesssim 10^{-9}$ m s$^{-2}$. Recent statistical analyses of wide binaries have been performed only with sky-projected relative velocities $v_p$ in the pairs. A new method of Bayesian orbit modeling exploiting three relative velocity components including the radial (line-of-sight) component $v_r$ is developed to measure a gravitational anomaly parameter $\Gamma\equiv\log_{10}\sqrt{G_{\rm{eff}}/G_{\rm{N}}}$ where $G_{\rm{eff}}$ is the effective gravitational constant for pseudo-Newtonian elliptical orbits, while $G_{\rm{N}}$ is Newton's constant. The method infers individual probability distributions of $\Gamma$ and then combines the independent distributions to obtain a consolidated distribution in a specific range of $g_{\rm{N}}$. Here the method is described and applied to a sample of 312 wide binaries in a broad dynamic range $10^{-11.0}\lesssim g_{\rm{N}}\lesssim 10^{-6.7}$ m s$^{-2}$ with $v_r$ uncertainties in the range $168&lt;\sigma_{v_r}&lt;380$ m s$^{-1}$ selected from the Gaia DR3 database. The following results are obtained: $\Gamma = 0.000\pm 0.011$ ($N_{\rm{binary}}=125$) for a high acceleration regime ($10^{-7.9} \lesssim g_{\rm{N}} \lesssim 10^{-6.7}$ m s$^{-2}$) agreeing well with Newton, but $\Gamma = 0.085\pm 0.040$ (35) for a MOND regime ($10^{-11.0}\lesssim g_{\rm{N}}\lesssim 10^{-9.5}$ m s$^{-2}$) and $\Gamma = 0.063\pm 0.015$ (111) for a MOND+transition regime ($10^{-11.0}\lesssim g_{\rm{N}}\lesssim 10^{-8.5}$ m s$^{-2}$). These results show that gravitational anomaly is evident for $g_{\rm{N}}\lesssim 10^{-9}$ m s$^{-2}$ and $\Gamma$ in the MOND regime ($\lesssim 10^{-9.5}$ m s$^{-2}$) agrees with the first-tier prediction ($\approx 0.07$) of MOND gravity theories.</description>

      <title>Rigidity results for free boundary hypersurfaces in initial data sets with boundary</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present several rigidity results for compact free boundary hypersurfaces in initial data sets with boundary. Specifically, in the first part of the paper, we extend the local splitting theorems from [G. J. Galloway and H. C. Jang, Some scalar curvature warped product splitting theorems, Proc. Am. Math. Soc. 148 (2020), no. 6, 2617-2629] to the setting of manifolds with boundary. To achieve this, we build on the approach of the original paper, utilizing results on free boundary marginally outer trapped surfaces (MOTS) applied to specific initial data sets. In the second part, we extend the main results from [A. Barros and C. Cruz, Free boundary hypersurfaces with non-positive Yamabe invariant in mean convex manifolds, J. Geom. Anal. 30 (2020), no. 4, 3542-3562] to the context of free boundary MOTS in initial data sets with boundary.</description>

      <title>Non-Perturbative Hamiltonian and Higher Loop Corrections in USR Inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Calculating the action and the interaction Hamiltonian at higher orders in cosmological perturbation theory is a cumbersome task. We employ the formalism of EFT of inflation in models of single field ultra slow-roll inflation and obtain a non-perturbative result for the Hamiltonian in terms of the Goldstone field $\pi$. To complete the dictionary, a non-linear relation between the curvature perturbations and $\pi$ is presented. Equipped with these non-linear results, we calculate the higher order loop corrections in USR models which are employed for PBHs formation. It is shown that the loop corrections on long CMB scales increase rapidly with the number of loop $L$ and the setup will go out of perturbative control at the four-loop level.</description>

Abstract: We study time-dependent compactification of extra dimensions. We assume that the spacetime is spatially homogeneous, and solve the vacuum Einstein equations without cosmological constant in more than three dimensions. We consider globally hyperbolic spacetimes in which almost Abelian Lie groups act on the spaces isometrically and simply transitively. We give left-invariant metrics on the spaces and solve Ricci-flat conditions of the spacetimes. In the four-dimensional case, our solutions correspond to the Bianchi type II solution. By our results and previous studies, all spatially homogeneous solutions whose spaces have zero-dimensional moduli spaces of left-invariant metrics are found. For the simplest solution, we show that each of the spatial dimensions cannot expand or contract simultaneously in the late-time it.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Systems Analysis of $f(R, L_m)$ Gravity Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.06519v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we examine the dynamical evolution of flat FRW cosmological model in $f(R, L_m)$ gravity theory. We consider the general form of $f(R, L_m)$ defined as $f(R, L_m) = \Lambda + \frac{\alpha}{2} R + \beta L_m^n$, where $\Lambda$, $\alpha$, $\beta$, $n$ are model parameters, with the matter Lagrangian given by $L_m = -p$. We investigate the model through phase plane analysis, actively studying the evolution of cosmological solutions using dynamical systems techniques. To analyse the evolution equations, we introduce suitable transformations of variables and discuss the corresponding solutions by phase-plane analysis. The nature of critical points is analysed and stable attractors are examined for $f(R, L_m)$ gravity cosmological model. We examine the linear and classical stability of the model and discuss it in detail. Further, we investigate the transition stage of the Universe, i.e. from the early decelerating stage to the present accelerating phase of the Universe by evolution of the effective equation of state, $\{r,s\}$ parameters and statefinder diagnostics for the central values of parameters $\alpha, \beta$ and $n$ constrained using MCMC technique with cosmic chronometer data.</description>

      <title>The cosmic trimmer: Black-hole hair in scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity is altered by cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15537v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Static black holes in general relativity modified by a linear scalar coupling to the Gauss-Bonnet invariant always carry hair. We show that the same mechanism that creates the hair makes it incompatible with a cosmological horizon. Other scalar-tensor models do not have this problem when time dependence of the scalar provides a natural matching to cosmology. Scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity is particularly rigid, and such a scenario does not help. An extra operator makes the theory behave like the other models, and the cosmological horizon can be accommodated. The hair, however, is drastically altered.</description>

      <title>Geometry from geodesics: fine-tuning Ehlers, Pirani, and Schild</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03815v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ehlers, Pirani, and Schild argued that measurements of null and timelike geodesics yield Weyl and projective connections, respectively, with compatibility in the lightlike limit giving an integrable Weyl connection. Their conclusions hold only for a 4-dim representation of the conformal connection on the null cone, and by restricting reparameterizations of timelike geodesics to yield a torsion-free, affine connection. An arbitrary connection gives greater freedom. A linear connection for the conformal symmetry of null geodesics requires the SO(4,2) representation. The enlarged class of projective transformations of timelike geodesics changes Weyl's projective curvature, and we find invariant forms of the torsion and nonmetricity, along with a new, invariant, second rank tensor field generalizing the dilatational curvature without requiring a metric. We show that either projective or conformal connections require a monotonic, twice differentiable function on a spacetime region foliated by order isomorphic, totally ordered, twice differentiable timelike curves in a necessarily Lorentzian geometry. We prove that the conditions for projective and conformal Ricci flatness imply each other and gauge choices within either can reduce the geometry to the original Riemannian form. Thus, measurements of null and timelike geodesics lead to an SO(4,2) connection, with no requirement for a lightlike limit. Reduction to integrable Weyl symmetry can only follow from the field equations of a gravity theory. We show that the simplest quadratic spacetime action leads to this reduction.</description>

Abstract: We study semi-classical particle production in non-singular bouncing cosmologies by employing the Unruh-DeWitt model of a particle detector propagating in this class of spacetimes. The scale factor for the bouncing cosmology is derived analytically and is inspired by the modified Friedmann equation employed in the loop quantum cosmology literature. We examine how the detector response varies with the free parameters in this model such as the equation of state during the contraction phase and the critical energy density during the bounce phase. We also investigate whether such a signature in the particle detector survives at late times.</description>

Abstract: We study the interaction between gravitational waves and a quantum two-level system consisting of a spin 1/2 particle using the formalism of the proper detector frame. This approach highlights the effects of gravitational waves on both the particles and the observer, emphasizing that only relative measurements can be made. Specifically, within this framework, the gravitational field of the waves is described using the gravitoelectromagnetic analogy. The interaction of the system is then determined by the gravitomagnetic field of the wave, which induces a time-dependent perturbation. We analyze this perturbation for both generic frequencies and resonance conditions, and discuss its implications.</description>

      <title>Rarity of precession and higher-order multipoles in gravitational waves from merging binary black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03410v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The latest binary black hole population estimates argue for a subpopulation of unequal component mass binaries with spins that are likely small but isotropically distributed. This implies a non-zero probability of detecting spin-induced orbital precession and higher order multipole moments in the observed gravitational-wave signals. In this work we directly calculate the probability for precession and higher-order multipoles in each significant gravitational-wave candidate observed by the LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA collaborations (LVK). We find that only one event shows substantial evidence for precession: GW200129_065458, and two events show substantial evidence for higher-order multipoles: GW190412 and GW190814; any evidence for precession and higher-order multipole moments in other gravitational-wave signals is consistent with random fluctuations caused by noise. We then compare our observations with expectations from population models, and confirm that current population estimates from the LVK accurately predict the number of observed events with significant evidence for precession and higher-order multipoles. In particular, we find that this population model predicts that a binary with significant evidence for precession will occur once in every $\sim 50$ detections, and a binary with significant evidence for higher-order multipoles will occur once in every $\sim 70$ observations. However, we emphasise that since substantial evidence for precession and higher-order multipoles have only been observed in three events, any population model that includes a subpopulation of binaries yielding $\sim 2\%$ of events with detectable precession and higher-order multipole moments will likely be consistent with the data.</description>

Starting from a matter-only reduced Hamiltonian, we present an adapted framework based on the Lie series approach, enabling the derivation of complete perturbative solutions within the conservative sector. Our framework supports both circular and eccentric orbits, and is applicable to any perturbation respecting rotational invariance and time-independence. In the context of the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner (ADM) canonical formalism, this includes up to at least 3PN order and local terms beyond. We provide an example application at 2PN, recovering classical periapsis advance and orbital period corrections, alongside the full orbital evolution in time coordinates. We discuss eventual extension to spinning and time-dependent systems.</description>

      <title>Systematic biases due to waveform mismodeling in parametrized post-Einsteinian tests of general relativity: The impact of neglecting spin precession and higher modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06254v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the robustness of parametrized post-Einsteinian (ppE) tests of General Relativity (GR) with gravitational waves, due to waveform inaccuracy. In particular, we determine the properties of the signal -- signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and source parameters -- such that we are led to falsely identify a ppE deviation in the post-Newtonian (PN) inspiral phase at -1PN, 1PN, or 2PN order, due to neglecting spin precession or higher models in the recovery model. To characterize the statistical significance of the biases, we compute the Bayes factor between the ppE and GR models, and the fitting factor of the ppE model. For highly-precessing, edge-on signals, we find that mismodeling the signal leads to a significant systematic bias in the recovery of the ppE parameters, even at an SNR of 30. However, these biased inferences are characterized by a significant loss of SNR and a weak preference for the ppE model. At a higher SNR, the biased inferences display a strong preference for the ppE model and a significant loss of SNR. For edge-on signals containing asymmetric masses, at an SNR of 30, we find that excluding higher modes does not impact the ppE tests as much as excluding spin precession. Our analysis, therefore, identifies the spin-precessing and mass-asymmetric systems for which parametrized tests of GR are robust. With a toy model and using the linear signal approximation, we illustrate these regimes of bias and characterize them by obtaining bounds on the ratio of systematic to statistical error and the effective cycles incurred due to mismodeling. As a by-product of our analysis, we connect various measures and techniques commonly used to estimate systematic errors -- linear-signal approximation, Laplace approximation, fitting factor, effective cycles, and Bayes factor -- that apply to all studies of systematic uncertainties in gravitational wave parameter estimation.</description>

      <title>Transition from adiabatic inspiral to plunge for eccentric binaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09160v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Black hole binaries with small mass ratios will be critical targets for the forthcoming Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mission. They also serve as useful tools for understanding the properties of binaries at general mass ratios. In its early stages, such a binary's gravitational-wave-driven inspiral can be modeled as the smaller body flowing through a sequence of geodesic orbits of the larger black hole's spacetime. Its motion through this sequence is determined by the rate at which backreaction changes an orbit's integrals of motion $E$, $L_z$, and $Q$. Key to the motion being close to a geodesic at any moment is the idea that the effect of backreaction is small compared to a ``restoring force'' arising from the potential which governs geodesic motion. This restoring force holds the small body on a geodesic trajectory as the backreaction causes that geodesic to slowly evolve. As the inspiraling body approaches the last stable orbit (LSO), the restoring force becomes weaker and the backreaction becomes stronger. Once the small body evolves past the LSO, its trajectory converges to a plunging geodesic. This work aims to smoothly connect these two disparate regimes: the slowly evolving adiabatic inspiral and the final plunge. Past work has focused on this transition to plunge for circular systems. Here, we study the transition for binaries with eccentricity. A well-defined eccentric transition will make it possible to develop small-mass-ratio binary waveform models that terminate in a physically reasonable way, rather than abruptly terminating as an inspiral-only model ends. A model that can explore the parameter space of eccentricity may also be useful for understanding the final cycles of eccentric binaries at less extreme mass ratios, such as those likely to be observed by ground-based detectors.</description>

Abstract: We derive a lower bound on the sensitivity of generic mechanical and electromagnetic gravitational wave detectors. We consider both classical and quantum detection schemes, although we focus on the former. Our results allow for a simple reproduction of the sensitivities of a variety of experiments, including optical interferometers, resonant bars, optomechanical sensors, and electromagnetic conversion experiments. In the high-frequency regime, all detection schemes we consider can be characterised by their stored electromagnetic energy and the signal transfer function, which we provide. We discuss why high-frequency gravitational wave searches are especially difficult and primordial gravitational wave backgrounds might not be detectable above the sensitivity window of existing interferometers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04524v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scalar-tensor theories are promising dark energy models. A promising scalar-tensor theory, called Horndeski-like gravity, is coming from the application of the Horndeski gravity in string theory and cosmology that takes into account two dilaton fields. In this work we study the stability of the scalar sector of this theory and compare it with that coming from the previously studied tensor sector. With the first-order formalism we investigate the allowed background solutions. Focusing on the background solution with a single scalar field, the entropy coming from particle production $S_{in}$ and that of the apparent horizon $S$ will be studied, which translates into \textit{entropy bounds}. These entropy bounds are compared with the stability of the scalar and tensor sector as well. The gravitational slip (minus one) to entropy ratio is also considered as a possible replacement for the usual shear viscosity to entropy ratio for black holes.</description>

      <title>One-loop corrections to the E-type $\alpha$-attractor models of inflation and primordial black hole production</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00628v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The one-loop corrections (1LC) to the power spectrum of scalar perturbations arising from cubic interactions in the single-field E-type $\alpha$-attractor models of inflation and primordial black hole (PBH) production are numerically calculated. The results demonstrate the 1LC contributes merely a few percent to the tree-level power spectrum. The model parameters are chosen to predict the PBH masses in the asteroid-mass range, while maintaining consistency with the cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations within 1$\sigma$ confidence levels, and obeying the upper limits on $\mu$-distortions. The PBHs formed on scales smaller than the inflation scale can constitute a significant fraction of the present dark matter (DM). The PBH-induced gravitational waves (GW) may be detectable by the future space-based gravitational interferometers. We also consider a reconstruction of the scalar potential from possible GW observations and present a numerical approach tested in the model parameter space.</description>

      <title>Interacting Early Dark Energy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08541v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore a model of interacting Early Dark Energy (EDE) in which a minimally coupled scalar field, representing the EDE, interacts with the radiation sector through an exponential coupling function in the radiation-dominated era. This framework can be inspired by modified theories of gravity, including $f(R)$ gravity, the Einstein frame representation of Brans-Dicke theory, and chameleon gravity. Our findings reveal that the traditional law of radiation conservation is altered to $\rho_{\gamma}\propto a^{-4+\epsilon}$, where the parameter $\epsilon$ measures the rate of energy transfer between radiation and EDE. Assuming a constant energy transfer, we show that the scalar field behaves as $\phi\propto\ln a$, indicating that $\phi$ diverges as $a$ approaches zero. Additionally, we demonstrate that the interacting scalar-photon system behaves similar to an effective cosmological constant in the early stages of evolution of the Universe. Moreover, by solving the conservation equation associated with the scalar field, we derive an analytical expression for the ratio $r=\rho_{\phi}/\rho_{\gamma}$. Our results indicate that $r$ diminishes as the Universe expands, which is essential for a successful EDE model. Our investigation into the parameter space confirms that the expected behavior of $r$ during recombination aligns with contemporary cosmological data. These insights underscore crucial aspects necessary for any feasible EDE model and present exciting possibilities for resolving the Hubble tension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.14192v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the relation between higher-dimensional gauge theories and stochastic gravitational wave (GW) spectrums caused by their potential. It is known that the higher-dimensional gauge theories can induce the spontaneous symmetry breaking of the gauge symmetry. If the spontaneous symmetry breaking induces the first-order phase transition, the stochastic GW can be observed in future interferometers. Through our numerical calculations, we reveal that distinctive parameters in the theories, like the compact scale, can change the GW spectrums dynamically. We also discuss the verifiability of the theories through the GW observations.</description>

      <title>Weyl conformal geometry vs Weyl anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11372v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Weyl conformal geometry is a gauge theory of scale invariance that naturally brings together the Standard Model (SM) and Einstein gravity. The SM embedding in this geometry is possible without new degrees of freedom beyond SM and Weyl geometry, while Einstein gravity is generated by the broken phase of this symmetry. This follows a Stueckelberg breaking mechanism in which the Weyl gauge boson becomes massive and decouples, as discussed in the past (arXiv:1812.08613, 1904.06596, 2104.15118). However, Weyl anomaly could break explicitly this gauge symmetry, hence we study it in Weyl geometry. We first note that in Weyl geometry {\it metricity} can be restored with respect to a new differential operator ($\hat \nabla$) that also enforces a Weyl-covariant formulation. This leads to a metric-like Weyl gauge invariant formalism that enables one to do quantum calculations directly in Weyl geometry, rather than use a Riemannian (metric) geometry picture. The result is the Weyl-covariance in $d$ dimensions of all geometric operators ($\hat R$, etc) {\it and} of their derivatives ($\hat\nabla_\mu\hat R$, etc), including the Euler-Gauss-Bonnet term. A natural, Weyl-invariant dimensional regularisation of quantum corrections exists and Weyl gauge symmetry is then maintained and manifest at the quantum level, in $d$ dimensions. This is related to a non-trivial current of this symmetry, the divergence of which cancels the trace of the energy-momentum tensor. The "usual" Weyl anomaly and Riemannian geometry are recovered in the (spontaneously) broken phase. The relation to holographic Weyl anomaly is discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07179v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We constrain the parameters of the $k$-essence scalar field model with inverse square and exponential potentials using data sets including Pantheon+SHOES and the Dark Energy Survey (DES) of Type Ia supernovae, Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data from SDSS and DESI surveys, and direct measurements of the Hubble parameter and redshift obtained from the differential age method (CC). We also provide a brief perspective on the dynamical evolution of both models and derive stability constraints on the model parameters, which are then used to set appropriate priors. We adopt a Bayesian inference procedure to estimate the model parameters that best fit the data. A comprehensive analysis in light of observational data shows that the $k$-essence model fits well across all data combinations. However, according to the BIC criterion, the $\Lambda$CDM model provides a slightly better fit compared to the $k$-essence model.</description>

      <title>Dancing with invisible partners: Three-body exchanges with primordial black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04697v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The abundance of massive primordial black holes has historically been constrained by dynamical probes. Since these objects can participate in hard few-body scattering processes, they can readily transfer energy to stellar systems, and, in particular, can disrupt wide binaries. However, disruption is not the only possible outcome of such few-body processes. Primordial black holes could also participate in exchange processes, in which one component of a binary system is ejected and replaced by the black hole itself. In this case, the remaining object in the binary would dynamically appear to have an invisible companion. We study the rate of exchange processes for primordial black holes as a component of dark matter and evaluate possible mechanisms for detecting such binaries. We find that many such binaries plausibly exist in the Solar neighborhood, and show that this process can account for observed binary systems whose properties run counter to the predictions of isolated binary evolution.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Key Features of Repeating Fast Radio Bursts with Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11173v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are enigmatic high-energy events with unknown origins, which are observationally divided into two categories, i.e., repeaters and non-repeaters. However, there are potentially a number of non-repeaters that may be misclassified, as repeating bursts are missed due to the limited sensitivity and observation periods, thus misleading the investigation of their physical properties. In this work, we propose a repeater identification method based on the t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) algorithm and apply the classification to the first Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment Fast Radio Burst (CHIME/FRB) catalog. We find that the spectral morphology parameters, specifically spectral running ($r$), represent the key features for identifying repeaters from the non-repeaters. Also, the results suggest that repeaters are more biased towards narrowband emission, whereas non-repeaters are inclined toward broadband emission. We provide a list of 163 repeater candidates, 5 of which are confirmed with an updated repeater catalog from CHIME/FRB. Our findings improve our understanding of the various properties underlying repeaters and non-repeaters, as well as guidelines for future FRB detection and categorization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02258v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The de Sitter conjecture yields a severe bound on possible vacua for a consistent quantum gravity. We extend the de Sitter conjecture by taking into account dynamics of the scalar field. We then apply such an extended de Sitter conjecture to a quintessence model of inflation for which dynamics of the scalar field is essential, and obtain an allowed region of parameters of the scalar potential wider than previously considered cases with the conventional de Sitter conjecture. The new bounds in the swampland conjecture could have implications in several situations to construct compactification models.</description>

Abstract: We continue our studies of the ghost condensate (GC) with sixth-order dispersion relation. Contrary to the GC with quartic dispersion relation, we find that the correction to the Newtonian potential explicitly depends on the space and time dependence of matter density. At late times when the Newtonian potential becomes time-independent, one obtains similar oscillatory behavior at the distance $\frac{M_\textrm{Pl}}{M^2}$, but this time at the time scale $\frac{M^4}{M_\textrm{Pl}^3}$, where $M^2$ is the ghost field velocity. We also show that the speed of gravitational wave is modified in a frequency dependent manner at momenta close to $\frac{M_\textrm{Pl}}{\sqrt{|\sigma_1|}}$, where $\sigma_1$ is the coefficient of $\gamma^{ij} \nabla_i K_{lr} \nabla_j K^{lr}$ operator in the unitary gauge action.</description>
