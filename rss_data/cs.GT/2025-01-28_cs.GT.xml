      <title>Efficient Lower Bounding of Single Transferable Vote Election Margins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The single transferable vote (STV) is a system of preferential proportional voting employed in multi-seat elections. Each ballot cast by a voter is a (potentially partial) ranking over a set of candidates. The margin of victory, or simply margin, is the smallest number of ballots that, if manipulated (e.g., their rankings changed, or ballots being deleted or added), can alter the set of winners. Knowledge of the margin of an election gives greater insight into both how much time and money should be spent on auditing the election, and whether uncovered mistakes (such as ballot box losses) throw the election result into doubt -- requiring a costly repeat election -- or can be safely ignored. Lower bounds on the margin can also be used for this purpose, in cases where exact margins are difficult to compute. There is one existing approach to computing lower bounds on the margin of STV elections, while there are multiple approaches to finding upper bounds. In this paper, we present improvements to this existing lower bound computation method for STV margins. In many cases the improvements compute tighter (higher) lower bounds as well as making the computation of lower bounds more computationally efficient. For small elections, in conjunction with existing upper bounding approaches, the new algorithms are able to compute exact margins of victory.</description>

      <title>Allocating Public Goods via Dynamic Max-Min Fairness: Long-Run Behavior and Competitive Equilibria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic max-min fair allocation (DMMF) is a simple and popular mechanism for the repeated allocation of a shared resource among competing agents: in each round, each agent can choose to request or not for the resource, which is then allocated to the requesting agent with the least number of allocations received till then. Recent work has shown that under DMMF, a simple threshold-based request policy enjoys surprisingly strong robustness properties, wherein each agent can realize a significant fraction of her optimal utility irrespective of how other agents' behave. While this goes some way in mitigating the possibility of a 'tragedy of the commons' outcome, the robust policies require that an agent defend against arbitrary (possibly adversarial) behavior by other agents. This however may be far from optimal compared to real world settings, where other agents are selfish optimizers rather than adversaries. Therefore, robust guarantees give no insight on how agents behave in an equilibrium, and whether outcomes are improved under one.
  Our work aims to bridge this gap by studying the existence and properties of equilibria under DMMF. To this end, we first show that despite the strong robustness guarantees of the threshold based strategies, no Nash equilibrium exists when agents participate in DMMF, each using some fixed threshold-based policy. On the positive side, however, we show that for the symmetric case, a simple data-driven request policy guarantees that no agent benefits from deviating to a different fixed threshold policy. In our proposed policy agents aim to match the historical allocation rate with a vanishing drift towards the rate optimizing overall welfare for all users. Furthermore, the resulting equilibrium outcome can be significantly better compared to what follows from the robustness guarantees.</description>

      <title>On the Parallelizability of Approval-Based Committee Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Approval-Based Committee (ABC) rules are an important tool for choosing a fair set of candidates when given the preferences of a collection of voters. Though finding a winning committee for many ABC rules is NP-hard, natural variations for these rules with polynomial-time algorithms exist. The Method of Equal Shares, an important ABC rule with desirable properties, is also computable in polynomial time. However, when working with very large elections, polynomial time is not enough and parallelization may be necessary. We show that computing a winning committee using these ABC rules (including the Method of Equal Shares) is P-hard, thus showing they cannot be parallelized. In contrast, we show that finding a winning committee can be parallelized when the votes are single-peaked or single-crossing for the important ABC rule Chamberlin-Courant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit the problem of approximating a pacing equilibrium in second-price auctions, introduced by Conitzer, Kroer, Sodomka, and Moses [Oper. Res. 2022]. We show that finding a constant-factor approximation of a pacing equilibrium is PPAD-hard, thereby strengthening previous results of Chen, Kroer, and Kumar [Math. Oper. Res. 2024], which established PPAD-hardness only for inverse-polynomial approximations.</description>

      <title>A Game-Theoretic Framework for Distributed Load Balancing: Static and Dynamic Game Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by applications in job scheduling, queuing networks, and load balancing in cyber-physical systems, we develop and analyze a game-theoretic framework to balance the load among servers in both static and dynamic settings. In these applications, jobs/tasks are often held by selfish entities that do not want to coordinate with each other, yet the goal is to balance the load among servers in a distributed manner. First, we provide a static game formulation in which each player holds a job with a certain processing requirement and wants to schedule it fractionally among a set of heterogeneous servers to minimize its average processing time. We show that this static game is a potential game and admits a pure Nash equilibrium (NE). In particular, the best-response dynamics converge to such an NE after $n$ iterations, where $n$ is the number of players. We then extend our results to a dynamic game setting, where jobs arrive and get processed in the system, and players observe the load (state) on the servers to decide how to schedule their jobs among the servers in order to minimize their averaged cumulative processing time. In this setting, we show that if the players update their strategies using dynamic best-response strategies, the system eventually becomes fully load-balanced and the players' strategies converge to the pure NE of the static game. In particular, we show that the convergence time scales only polynomially with respect to the game parameters. Finally, we provide numerical results to evaluate the performance of our proposed algorithms under both static and dynamic settings.</description>

      <title>Fairness-aware Contextual Dynamic Pricing with Strategic Buyers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contextual pricing strategies are prevalent in online retailing, where the seller adjusts prices based on products' attributes and buyers' characteristics. Although such strategies can enhance seller's profits, they raise concerns about fairness when significant price disparities emerge among specific groups, such as gender or race. These disparities can lead to adverse perceptions of fairness among buyers and may even violate the law and regulation. In contrast, price differences can incentivize disadvantaged buyers to strategically manipulate their group identity to obtain a lower price. In this paper, we investigate contextual dynamic pricing with fairness constraints, taking into account buyers' strategic behaviors when their group status is private and unobservable from the seller. We propose a dynamic pricing policy that simultaneously achieves price fairness and discourages strategic behaviors. Our policy achieves an upper bound of $O(\sqrt{T}+H(T))$ regret over $T$ time horizons, where the term $H(T)$ arises from buyers' assessment of the fairness of the pricing policy based on their learned price difference. When buyers are able to learn the fairness of the price policy, this upper bound reduces to $O(\sqrt{T})$. We also prove an $\Omega(\sqrt{T})$ regret lower bound of any pricing policy under our problem setting. We support our findings with extensive experimental evidence, showcasing our policy's effectiveness. In our real data analysis, we observe the existence of price discrimination against race in the loan application even after accounting for other contextual information. Our proposed pricing policy demonstrates a significant improvement, achieving 35.06% reduction in regret compared to the benchmark policy.</description>

      <title>Online Allocation with Multi-Class Arrivals: Group Fairness vs Individual Welfare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and study a multi-class online resource allocation problem with group fairness guarantees. The problem involves allocating a fixed amount of resources to a sequence of agents, each belonging to a specific group. The primary objective is to ensure fairness across different groups in an online setting. We focus on three fairness notions: one based on quantity and two based on utility. To achieve fair allocations, we develop two threshold-based online algorithms, proving their optimality under two fairness notions and near-optimality for the more challenging one. Additionally, we demonstrate a fundamental trade-off between group fairness and individual welfare using a novel representative function-based approach. To address this trade-off, we propose a set-aside multi-threshold algorithm that reserves a portion of the resource to ensure fairness across groups while utilizing the remaining resource to optimize efficiency under utility-based fairness notions. This algorithm is proven to achieve the Pareto-optimal trade-off. We also demonstrate that our problem can model a wide range of real-world applications, including network caching and cloud computing, and empirically evaluate our proposed algorithms in the network caching problem using real datasets.</description>

      <title>The Strong Core of Housing Markets with Partial Order Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the strong core of housing markets when agents' preferences over houses are expressed as partial orders. We provide a structural characterization of the strong core, and propose an efficient algorithm that finds an allocation in the strong core or decides that it is empty, even in the presence of forced and forbidden arcs. The algorithm satisfies the property of group-strategyproofness. Additionally, we show that certain results known for the strong core in the case when agents' preferences are weak orders can be extended to the setting with partial order preferences; among others, we show that the strong core in such housing markets satisfies the property of respecting improvements.</description>

      <title>Online Housing Market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies an online variant of the celebrated housing market problem, where each agent has a single house and seeks to exchange it for another based on her preferences. In this online setting, agents may arrive and depart at any time, meaning that not all agents are present on the housing market simultaneously. I extend the well known serial dictatorship and Gale s top trading cycle mechanisms to this online scenario, aiming to retain their desirable properties such as Pareto efficiency, individual rationality, and strategy proofness. These extensions also seek to prevent agents from strategically delaying their arrival or advancing their departure. I demonstrate that achieving all of these properties simultaneously is impossible in the online context, and I present several variants that achieve different subsets of these properties.</description>

      <title>Galaxy Era: Agent-based Simulation of Execution Tickets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Execution Tickets are currently discussed as a next evolutionary step in Ethereum's block space allocation mechanism, separating consensus rewards from execution rewards and selling execution rights through a dedicated market. We present a theoretical framework identifying three core objectives for this mechanism - Decentralization, MEV capture, and Block Producer Incentive Compatibility - alongside practical metrics for evaluating each objective. To meet these goals, we explore seven key design parameters: ticket quantity, expiry, refundability, resalability, enhanced lookahead, pricing mechanism, and target ticket amount.
  We then evaluate four pricing mechanisms and construct six concrete mechanism designs from these parameters. To assess trade-offs in real-world conditions, we perform an agent-based simulation with over 300 runs. Our findings suggest that auction-driven formats, particularly second-price, excel in capturing significant MEV. The simulation also indicates that offering a secondary market can help alleviate centralization, since specialized ticket holders can enter and exit the market as needed.
  Non-expiring tickets show promise in reducing valuation risks, as ticket holders are not influenced by expiry-related discounting. Likewise, removing refundability simplifies the mechanism without notably impairing performance. Extended lookahead periods benefit price predictability and smoothness at a slight cost to price accuracy.
  Overall, this study provides a theoretical framework on the mechanism design space for Execution Tickets as well as a practical implementation of an agent-based simulation to test mechanism design choices. Further, it provides an exploratory evaluation of Execution Ticket mechanism designs, offering insights into optimal configurations that balance MEV capture, decentralization, and operational efficiency in Ethereum's block space allocation.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Self-Interest Level of Markov Social Dilemmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel method for estimating the self-interest level of computationally intractable Markov social dilemmas. We extend the concept of self-interest level from normal-form games to Markov games, providing a quantitative measure of the minimum reward exchange required to incentivize cooperation by aligning individual and collective interests. We demonstrate our method on three environments from the Melting Pot suite: which represent either common-pool resources or public goods. Our results show that the proposed method successfully identifies a threshold at which learning agents transition from selfish to cooperative equilibria in a Markov social dilemma. This work contributes to the fields of Cooperative AI and multiagent reinforcement learning by providing a practical tool for analysing complex, multistep social dilemmas. Our findings offer insights into how reward structures can promote or hinger cooperation in challenging multiagent scenarios, with potential applications in areas such as mechanism design.</description>

      <title>Sequential Decision Making in Stochastic Games with Incomplete Preferences over Temporal Objectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring that AI systems make strategic decisions aligned with the specified preferences in adversarial sequential interactions is a critical challenge for developing trustworthy AI systems, especially when the environment is stochastic and players' incomplete preferences leave some outcomes unranked. We study the problem of synthesizing preference-satisfying strategies in two-player stochastic games on graphs where players have opposite (possibly incomplete) preferences over a set of temporal goals. We represent these goals using linear temporal logic over finite traces (LTLf), which enables modeling the nuances of human preferences where temporal goals need not be mutually exclusive and comparison between some goals may be unspecified. We introduce a solution concept of non-dominated almost-sure winning, which guarantees to achieve a most preferred outcome aligned with specified preferences while maintaining robustness against the adversarial behaviors of the opponent. Our results show that strategy profiles based on this concept are Nash equilibria in the game where players are risk-averse, thus providing a practical framework for evaluating and ensuring stable, preference-aligned outcomes in the game. Using a drone delivery example, we demonstrate that our contributions offer valuable insights not only for synthesizing rational behavior under incomplete preferences but also for designing games that motivate the desired behavior from the players in adversarial conditions.</description>

      <title>Privacy-aware Nash Equilibrium Synthesis with Partially Ordered LTL$_f$ Objectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nash equilibrium is a fundamental solution concept for modeling the behavior of self-interested agents. We develop an algorithm to synthesize pure Nash equilibria in two-player deterministic games on graphs where players have partial preferences over objectives expressed with linear temporal logic over finite traces. Previous approaches for Nash equilibrium synthesis assume that players' preferences are common knowledge. Instead, we allow players' preferences to remain private but enable communication between players. The algorithm we design synthesizes Nash equilibria for a complete-information game, but synthesizes these equilibria in an incomplete-information setting where players' preferences are private. The algorithm is privacy-aware, as instead of requiring that players share private preferences, the algorithm reduces the information sharing to a query interface. Through this interface, players exchange information about states in the game from which they can enforce a more desirable outcome. We prove the algorithm's completeness by showing that it either returns an equilibrium or certifies that one does not exist. We then demonstrate, via numerical examples, the existence of games where the queries the players exchange are insufficient to reconstruct players' preferences, highlighting the privacy-aware nature of the algorithm we propose.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Web retrieval, there are many cases of competition between authors of Web documents: their incentive is to have their documents highly ranked for queries of interest. As such, the Web is a prominent example of a competitive search setting. Past work on competitive search focused on ranking functions based solely on relevance estimation. We study ranking functions that integrate a results-diversification aspect. We show that the competitive search setting with diversity-based ranking has an equilibrium. Furthermore, we theoretically and empirically show that the phenomenon of authors mimicking content in documents highly ranked in the past, which was demonstrated in previous work, is mitigated when search results diversification is applied.</description>

      <title>Who's Driving? Game Theoretic Path Risk of AGI Development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Who controls the development of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) might matter less than how we handle the fight for control itself. We formalize this "steering wheel problem" as humanity's greatest near-term existential risk may stem not from misaligned AGI, but from the dynamics of competing to develop it. Just as a car crash can occur from passengers fighting over the wheel before reaching any destination, catastrophic outcomes could arise from development competition long before AGI exists. While technical alignment research focuses on ensuring safe arrival, we show how coordination failures during development could drive us off the cliff first.
  We present a game theoretic framework modeling AGI development dynamics and prove conditions for sustainable cooperative equilibria. Drawing from nuclear control while accounting for AGI's unique characteristics, we propose concrete mechanisms including pre-registration, shared technical infrastructure, and automated deterrence to stabilize cooperation. Our key insight is that AGI creates network effects in safety: shared investments become more valuable as participation grows, enabling mechanism designs where cooperation dominates defection. This work bridges formal methodology and policy frameworks, providing foundations for practical governance of AGI competition risks.</description>

      <title>TTC Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the classical object reallocation problem under strict preferences, with a focus on characterizing "TTC domains" -- preference domains on which the Top Trading Cycles (TTC) mechanism is the unique mechanism satisfying individual rationality, Pareto efficiency, and strategyproofness. We introduce a sufficient condition for a domain to be a TTC domain, which we call the top-two condition. This condition requires that, within any subset of objects, if two objects can each be most-preferred, they can also be the top-two most-preferred objects (in both possible orders). A weaker version of this condition, applying only to subsets of size three, is shown to be necessary. These results provide a complete characterization of TTC domains for the case of three objects, unify prior studies on specific domains such as single-peaked and single-dipped preferences, and classify several previously unexplored domains as TTC domains or not.</description>

      <title>Strategic Multi-Armed Bandit Problems Under Debt-Free Reporting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the classical multi-armed bandit problem, but with strategic arms. In this context, each arm is characterized by a bounded support reward distribution and strategically aims to maximize its own utility by potentially retaining a portion of its reward, and disclosing only a fraction of it to the learning agent. This scenario unfolds as a game over $T$ rounds, leading to a competition of objectives between the learning agent, aiming to minimize their regret, and the arms, motivated by the desire to maximize their individual utilities. To address these dynamics, we introduce a new mechanism that establishes an equilibrium wherein each arm behaves truthfully and discloses as much of its rewards as possible. With this mechanism, the agent can attain the second-highest average (true) reward among arms, with a cumulative regret bounded by $O(\log(T)/\Delta)$ (problem-dependent) or $O(\sqrt{T\log(T)})$ (worst-case).</description>

      <title>Will Systems of LLM Agents Cooperate: An Investigation into a Social Dilemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As autonomous agents become more prevalent, understanding their collective behaviour in strategic interactions is crucial. This study investigates the emergent cooperative tendencies of systems of Large Language Model (LLM) agents in a social dilemma. Unlike previous research where LLMs output individual actions, we prompt state-of-the-art LLMs to generate complete strategies for iterated Prisoner's Dilemma. Using evolutionary game theory, we simulate populations of agents with different strategic dispositions (aggressive, cooperative, or neutral) and observe their evolutionary dynamics. Our findings reveal that different LLMs exhibit distinct biases affecting the relative success of aggressive versus cooperative strategies. This research provides insights into the potential long-term behaviour of systems of deployed LLM-based autonomous agents and highlights the importance of carefully considering the strategic environments in which they operate.</description>

      <title>Committee Monotonicity and Proportional Representation for Ranked Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19689v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study committee voting rules under ranked preferences, which map the voters' preference relations to a subset of the alternatives of predefined size. In this setting, the compatibility between proportional representation and committee monotonicity is a fundamental open problem that has been mentioned in several works. We address this research question by designing a new committee voting rule called the Solid Coalition Refinement (SCR) rule that simultaneously satisfies committee monotonicity and Dummett's PSC as well as one of its variants called inclusion PSC. This is the first rule known to satisfy both of these properties. Moreover, we show that this is effectively the best that we can hope for as other fairness notions adapted from approval voting are incompatible with committee monotonicity. Finally, we prove that, for truncated preferences, the SCR rule still satisfies PSC and a property called independence of losing voter blocs, thereby refuting a conjecture of Graham-Squire et al. (2024).</description>

      <title>On The Truthfulness of 'Surprisingly Likely' Responses of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07692v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The principle of rewarding a crowd for surprisingly common answers has been used in the literature for designing a number of truthful information elicitation mechanisms. A related method has also been proposed in the literature for better aggregation of crowd wisdom. Drawing a comparison between crowd based collective intelligence systems and large language models, we define the notion of 'surprisingly likely' textual response of a large language model. This notion is inspired by the surprisingly common principle, but tailored for text in a language model. Using benchmarks such as TruthfulQA and openly available LLMs: GPT-2 and LLaMA-2, we show that the surprisingly likely textual responses of large language models are more accurate in many cases compared to standard baselines. For example, we observe up to 24 percentage points aggregate improvement on TruthfulQA and up to 70 percentage points improvement on individual categories of questions in this benchmark. We also provide further analysis of the results, including the cases when surprisingly likely responses are less or not more accurate.</description>

      <title>PokerBench: Training Large Language Models to become Professional Poker Players</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08328v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce PokerBench - a benchmark for evaluating the poker-playing abilities of large language models (LLMs). As LLMs excel in traditional NLP tasks, their application to complex, strategic games like poker poses a new challenge. Poker, an incomplete information game, demands a multitude of skills such as mathematics, reasoning, planning, strategy, and a deep understanding of game theory and human psychology. This makes Poker the ideal next frontier for large language models. PokerBench consists of a comprehensive compilation of 11,000 most important scenarios, split between pre-flop and post-flop play, developed in collaboration with trained poker players. We evaluate prominent models including GPT-4, ChatGPT 3.5, and various Llama and Gemma series models, finding that all state-of-the-art LLMs underperform in playing optimal poker. However, after fine-tuning, these models show marked improvements. We validate PokerBench by having models with different scores compete with each other, demonstrating that higher scores on PokerBench lead to higher win rates in actual poker games. Through gameplay between our fine-tuned model and GPT-4, we also identify limitations of simple supervised fine-tuning for learning optimal playing strategy, suggesting the need for more advanced methodologies for effectively training language models to excel in games. PokerBench thus presents a unique benchmark for a quick and reliable evaluation of the poker-playing ability of LLMs as well as a comprehensive benchmark to study the progress of LLMs in complex game-playing scenarios.</description>

      <title>Experience-replay Innovative Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12199v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite its groundbreaking success, multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) still suffers from instability and nonstationarity. Replicator dynamics, the most well-known model from evolutionary game theory (EGT), provide a theoretical framework for the convergence of the trajectories to Nash equilibria and, as a result, have been used to ensure formal guarantees for MARL algorithms in stable game settings. However, they exhibit the opposite behavior in other settings, which poses the problem of finding alternatives to ensure convergence. In contrast, innovative dynamics, such as the Brown-von Neumann-Nash (BNN) or Smith, result in periodic trajectories with the potential to approximate Nash equilibria. Yet, no MARL algorithms based on these dynamics have been proposed. In response to this challenge, we develop a novel experience replay-based MARL algorithm that incorporates revision protocols as tunable hyperparameters. We demonstrate, by appropriately adjusting the revision protocols, that the behavior of our algorithm mirrors the trajectories resulting from these dynamics. Importantly, our contribution provides a framework capable of extending the theoretical guarantees of MARL algorithms beyond replicator dynamics. Finally, we corroborate our theoretical findings with empirical results.</description>

      <title>Thunderdome: Timelock-Free Rationally-Secure Virtual Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14418v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Payment channel networks (PCNs) offer a promising solution to address the limited transaction throughput of deployed blockchains. However, several attacks have recently been proposed that stress the vulnerability of PCNs to timelock and censoring attacks. To address such attacks, we introduce Thunderdome, the first timelock-free PCN. Instead, Thunderdome leverages the design rationale of virtual channels to extend a timelock-free payment channel primitive, thereby enabling multi-hop transactions without timelocks. Previous works either utilize timelocks or do not accommodate transactions between parties that do not share a channel.
  At its core, Thunderdome relies on a committee of non-trusted watchtowers, known as wardens, who ensure that no honest party loses funds, even when offline, during the channel closure process. We introduce tailored incentive mechanisms to ensure that all participants follow the protocol's correct execution. Besides a traditional security proof that assumes an honest majority of the committee, we conduct a formal game-theoretic analysis to demonstrate the security of Thunderdome when all participants, including wardens, act rationally. We implement a proof of concept of Thunderdome on Ethereum to validate its feasibility and evaluate its costs. Our evaluation shows that deploying Thunderdome, including opening the underlying payment channel, costs approximately \$15 (0.0089 ETH), while the worst-case cost for closing a channel is about \$7 (0.004 ETH).</description>
