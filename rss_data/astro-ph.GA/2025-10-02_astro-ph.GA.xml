      <title>Geometry of the Milky Way's dark matter from dynamical models of the tilted stellar halo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The shape and orientation of the Milky Way's dark matter halo remain poorly constrained. Observations of the accreted stellar halo show that it is triaxial and tilted with respect to the disc. If this configuration is long-lived, it can be used to place constraints on the shape and orientation of the dark matter halo that can support it close to steady state. We fit equilibrium orbit-superposition (Schwarzschild) models to the stellar halo in a realistic Milky Way potential with a tilted dark matter halo, assuming that the long axes of each halo and the disc normal are coplanar. These models are matched to parametric density fits and velocity anisotropy measurements of Gaia Sausage-Enceladus (GSE) stars at radii $r\in[6,60]$ kpc. The observations are consistent with a (near-)prolate dark matter halo whose density has a short-to-long axis ratio of $q_\mathrm{dm}=0.87_{-0.09}^{+0.05}$. The long axis is inclined at an angle of $\beta_\mathrm{dm}=43_{-8}^{+22}\,^\circ$ to the disc plane, which exceeds the stellar halo tilt by $\approx18^\circ$. Spherical haloes cannot support the observed structure of the GSE in equilibrium. The best-fitting dynamical GSE model has a radius-dependent shape and orientation; between radii of 6 and 60 kpc the tilt increases from $\beta_*(r)\approx10^\circ$ to $\approx35^\circ$. Our model provides a good fit to the observed triaxial structure and dynamics of the GSE. It is therefore an excellent source of realistic initial conditions for simulations of the halo, such as for investigating perturbations from satellites or the Galactic bar.</description>

      <title>Irony at z=6.68: a bright AGN with forbidden Fe emission and multi-component Balmer absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the deepest medium-resolution JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy to date of a bright Little Red Dot (LRD) AGN, Irony at z=6.68. The data reveal broad Balmer emission from H$\alpha$-H$\delta$ and Balmer absorption in H$\alpha$-H$\epsilon$. The absorption lines are kinematically split: H$\alpha$ is blueshifted while higher-order lines are redshifted suggesting complex gas kinematics; their relative ratios are inconsistent with a single, passive absorbing screen. The line depths require absorption of both the BLR and the continuum, ruling out a stellar origin, consistent with the smooth Balmer break. We fit the broad H$\gamma$-H$\alpha$ lines and find the data favor a double-Gaussian effective profile, although exponential wings are evident. Depending on the adopted profile, single-epoch virial estimates give log(M$_\bullet$/M$_\odot$)=7.86-8.39 and $\lambda_{\rm Edd}$=1.7-0.4. The dynamical mass implied by the narrow lines is low log(Mdyn/M$_\odot$)=9.1, suggesting an overmassive black hole. The narrow lines display little attenuation, A$_V&lt;0.5$ mag; while broad H$\alpha$/H$\beta\sim9$ and the broad Balmer decrements are inconsistent with standard dust attenuation curves, suggesting collisional processes. The forbidden-line spectrum includes auroral [S II] and [N II], and a forest of [Fe II] lines. Line ratios and kinematics indicate a stratified narrow-line region with both low (n$_{\rm e}$=420 cm$^{-3}$) and high densities (n$_{\rm e}\gtrsim 6.3\times10^5$ cm$^{-3}$). We detect metal absorption lines in both the optical (Ca II and Na I) and UV range (Fe II UV1-UV3). Our results support a picture of a compact AGN embedded in a dense, high covering-factor and stratified cocoon, with complex neutral-gas kinematics. While the choice of broad-line profile affects the virial estimates of M$_\bullet$, we find the effect to be of order 0.6 dex between the different approaches.</description>

      <title>The warm outer layer of a Little Red Dot as the source of [Fe II] and collisional Balmer lines with scattering wings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The population of the Little Red Dots (LRDs) may represent a key phase of supermassive black hole (SMBH) growth. A cocoon of dense excited gas is emerging as key component to explain the most striking properties of LRDs, such as strong Balmer breaks and Balmer absorption, as well as the weak IR emission. To dissect the structure of LRDs, we analyze new deep JWST/NIRSpec PRISM and G395H spectra of FRESCO-GN-9771, one of the most luminous known LRDs at $z=5.5$. These reveal a strong Balmer break, broad Balmer lines and very narrow [O III] emission. We unveil a forest of optical [Fe II] lines, which we argue is emerging from a dense ($n_{\rm H}=10^{9-10}$ cm$^{-3}$) warm layer with electron temperature $T_{\rm e}\approx7000$ K. The broad wings of H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ have an exponential profile due to electron scattering in this same layer. The high $\rm H\alpha:H\beta:H\gamma$ flux ratio of $\approx10.4:1:0.14$ is an indicator of collisional excitation and resonant scattering dominating the Balmer line emission. A narrow H$\gamma$ component, unseen in the other two Balmer lines due to outshining by the broad components, could trace the ISM of a normal host galaxy with a star formation rate $\sim5$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. The warm layer is mostly opaque to Balmer transitions, producing a characteristic P-Cygni profile in the line centers suggesting outflowing motions. This same layer is responsible for shaping the Balmer break. The broad-band spectrum can be reasonably matched by a simple photoionized slab model that dominates the $\lambda&gt;1500$ {\AA} continuum and a low mass ($\sim10^8$ M$_{\odot}$) galaxy that could explain the narrow [O III], with only subdominant contribution to the UV continuum. Our findings indicate that Balmer lines are not directly tracing gas kinematics near the SMBH and that the BH mass scale is likely much lower than virial indicators suggest.</description>

      <title>JWST-discovered AGN: evidence for heavy obscuration in the type-2 sample from the first stacked X-ray detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most puzzling properties of the high-redshift AGN population recently discovered by JWST, including both broad-line and narrow-line sources, is their X-ray weakness. With very few exceptions, and regardless of the optical classification, they are undetected at the limits of the deepest Chandra fields, even when stacking signals from tens of sources in standard observed-frame energy intervals (soft, hard, and full bands). It has been proposed that their elusive nature in the X-ray band is due to heavy absorption by dust-free gas or intrinsic weakness, possibly due to high, super-Eddington accretion. In this work, we perform X-ray stacking in three customized rest-frame energy ranges (1-4, 4-7.25, and 10-30 keV) of a sample of 50 Type 1 and 38 Type 2 AGN identified by JWST in the CDFS and CDFN fields. For the Type 2 sub-sample, we reach a total of about 210 Ms exposure, and we report a significant ($\sim 3\sigma$) detection in the hardest (10-30 keV rest frame) band, along with relatively tight upper limits in the rest frame softer energy bands. The most straightforward interpretation is in terms of heavy obscuration due to gas column densities well within the Compton thick regime ($&gt; 2 \times 10^{24} $cm$^{-2}$) with a large covering factor, approaching 4$\pi$. The same procedure applied to the Type 1 sub-sample returns no evidence for a significant signal in about 140 Ms stacked data in any of the adopted bands, confirming their surprisingly elusive nature in the X-ray band obtained with previous stacking experiments. A brief comparison with the current observations and the implications for the evolution of AGN are discussed.</description>

      <title>SHAPE. I. A SOM-SED hybrid approach for efficient galaxy parameter estimation leveraging JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the launch and application of next-generation ground- and space-based telescopes, astronomy has entered the era of big data, necessitating more efficient and robust data analysis methods. Most traditional parameter estimation methods are unable to reconcile differences between photometric systems. Ideally, we would like to optimally rely on high-quality observation data provided by, e.g., JWST, for calibrating and improving upcoming wide-field surveys such as the China Space Station Telescope (CSST) and Euclid. To this end, we introduce a new approach (SHAPE, SOM-SED Hybrid Approach for efficient Parameter Estimation) that can bridge different photometric systems and efficiently estimate key galaxy parameters, such as stellar mass ($M_\star$) and star formation rate (SFR), leveraging data from a large and deep JWST/NIRCam and MIRI survey (PRIMER). As a test of the methodology, we focus on galaxies at $z\sim 1.5-2.5$. To mitigate discrepancies between input colors and the training set, we replace the default SOM weights with stacked SEDs from each cell, extending the applicability of our model to other photometric catalogs (e.g., COSMOS2020). By incorporating a SED library (SED Lib), we apply this JWST-calibrated model to the COSMOS2020 catalog. Despite the limited sample size and potential template-related uncertainties, SOM-derived parameters exhibit a good agreement with results from SED-fitting using extended photometry. Under identical photometric constraints from CSST and Euclid bands, our method outperforms traditional SED-fitting techniques in SFR estimation, exhibiting both a reduced bias (-0.01 vs. 0.18) and a smaller $\sigma_{\rm NMAD}$ (0.25 vs. 0.35). With its computational efficiency capable of processing $10^6$ sources per CPU per hour during the estimation phase, this JWST-calibrated estimator holds significant promise for next-generation wide-field surveys.</description>

      <title>The Evolution of Pop III.1 Protostars Powered by Dark Matter Annihilation. II. Dependence on WIMP Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid appearance of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at $z\gtrsim7$ requires efficient pathways to form massive black hole seeds. We investigate whether annihilation of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) can alter primordial (Pop III.1) protostellar evolution sufficiently to enable formation of such `heavy'' seeds. Using the one-dimensional Geneva stellar-evolution code (GENEC) with an implemented Gould single-scatter capture module, we compute a grid of protostellar evolution models covering ambient WIMP mass densities $\rho_\chi=10^{12}$-$10^{16}\ \mathrm{GeV\,cm^{-3}}$, WIMP masses $m_\chi=30$-$3000\ \mathrm{GeV}$, spin-dependent cross sections $\sigma_{\rm SD}=10^{-42}$-$10^{-40}\ \mathrm{cm^2}$, and baryonic accretion rates $\dot{M_*}=(1-3)\times10^{-3}\, M_\odot \,{\rm yr}^{-1}$. We find a robust bifurcation of outcomes. For sufficiently high ambient dark matter density ($\rho_\chi\gtrsim5\times10^{14}\ \mathrm{GeV\,cm^{-3}}$) and capture efficiency ($\sigma_{\rm SD}\gtrsim10^{-41}\ \mathrm{cm^2}$) WIMP annihilation supplies enough energy to inflate protostars onto extended, cool (Hayashi-track) configurations that dramatically suppress ionizing feedback and permit uninterrupted growth to $\sim10^{5}\,M_\odot$. Lighter WIMPs and larger $\sigma_{\rm SD}$ favour earlier and stronger annihilation support; heavier WIMPs delay the effect. For our fiducial case, WIMP masses $&lt;$3 TeV are essential for allowing growth to the supermassive regime, otherwise the protostar evolves to the compact, feedback-limited regime that results in `light'' seeds. These results indicate that, under plausible halo conditions, DM annihilation provides a viable channel for forming heavy black hole seeds.</description>

      <title>JADES: The Star Formation and Dust Attenuation Properties of Galaxies at 3&lt;z&lt;7</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the star formation and dust attenuation properties for a sample of 602 galaxies at redshifts $\rm{3&lt;z&lt;7}$, as part of the JADES survey. Our analysis is based on measurements of the $\rm{H}\alpha/\rm{H}\beta$ Balmer Decrement using medium resolution (R$\sim$1000) spectroscopic observations with the JWST/NIRSpec Micro-Shutter Assembly. Stellar masses and star formation rates (SFRs) are inferred with \texttt{Prospector} using deep multi-band imaging. We utilize the Balmer decrement to measure dust-corrected H$\alpha$-based SFRs, taking into account the subsolar metallicities observed in galaxies at high redshift. We confirm, with our large sample size, that the correlation between the Balmer decrement and stellar mass is already established out to $z\sim7$. We find that the relation between the Balmer decrement and stellar mass does not significantly evolve from the local universe to $z\sim7$. We investigate the UV slope as a function of the Balmer optical depth and find that the best-fit correlation for our high redshift sample is sSFR dependent and significantly different at high redshift when compared to galaxies at $z\approx 0$ and $z \approx 2$. For the highest sSFR galaxies in our sample, there is no significant correlation between the UV slope and Balmer optical depth. This is evidence that the UV slope should be used with great caution to correct for dust in high redshift galaxies.</description>

      <title>The Colors of Ices: Measuring ice column density through photometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ices imprint strong absorption features in the near- and mid-infrared, but until recently they have been studied almost exclusively with spectroscopy toward small samples of bright sources. We show that JWST photometry alone can reveal and quantify interstellar ices and present a new open-source modeling tool, icemodels, to produce synthetic photometry of ices based on laboratory measurements. We provide reference tables indicating which filters are likely to be observably affected by ice absorption. Applying these models to NIRCam data of background stars behind Galactic Center (GC) clouds, and validating against NIRSpec spectra of Galactic disk sources, we find clear signatures of CO, H$_2$O, and CO$_2$ ices and evidence for excess absorption in the F356W filter likely caused by CH-bearing species such as methanol. The ice ratios differ between the Galactic disk and Center, with GC clouds showing a higher H$_2$O fraction. The large ice abundance in CO, H2O, and possibly complex molecules hints that the high complex molecule abundances observed in gas emission in the CMZ are driven by ice-phase chemistry in non-star-forming gas. Accounting for all likely ices, we infer that $&gt;25%$ of the total carbon is frozen into CO ice in the GC, which exceeds the entire solar-neighborhood carbon budget. By assuming the freezeout fraction is the same in GC and disk clouds, we obtain a metallicity measurement indicating that $Z_GC\gtrsim2.5Z_\odot$. These results demonstrate that photometric ice measurements are feasible with JWST and capable of probing the metallicity structure of the cold interstellar medium.</description>

      <title>oMEGACat. VII. Tracing Interstellar and Intracluster Medium of $\omega$ Centauri using Sodium Absorptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the foreground interstellar medium along the line of sight and intracluster medium of $\omega$ Centauri ($\omega$ Cen) by measuring the equivalent width of Na I D absorptions from MUSE observations. The large line-of-sight velocity difference between $\omega$ Cen and the foreground enables us to separate Na I D absorption contributed from atomic gas in the interstellar and intracluster medium. We find that small-scale substructures in the foreground Na I D distribution correlate with differential reddening derived from photometric methods. Using an empirical Na I D equivalent width-reddening relation, we determine an average reddening of $E(B-V)=0.153\pm0.003$ mag within the half-light radius of $\omega$ Cen. However, the Na I D-inferred differential reddening is significantly larger than photometric estimates. This is likely due to scatter in the Na I D-reddening relation. We find no evidence for intracluster atomic gas from spectra of horizontal branch stars, as there is no significant Na I D absorption at $\omega$ Cen's systemic velocity. Given this non-detection, we place the strongest upper limit to date on the intracluster atomic gas column density in $\omega$ Cen of $\lesssim2.17 \times 10^{18}~\rm{cm^{-2}}$. We also estimate the ionized gas density from pulsar dispersion measure variations, which exceed the atomic gas limit by $\sim$50 times. Nevertheless, the strong correlation between dispersion measure and foreground Na I D suggests that much or all of this ionized gas resides in the foreground. Given ongoing mass loss from bright giant stars, our findings imply that the intracluster gas accumulation timescale is short, and gas removal in the cluster is likely not tied to stripping as $\omega$ Cen passes through the Galactic disk.</description>

      <title>Uncertainties in high-$z$ galaxy properties inferred from SED fitting using JWST NIRCam photometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerous high-$z$ galaxies have recently been observed with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), providing new insights into early galaxy evolution. Their physical properties are typically derived through spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting, but the reliability of this approach for such early systems remains uncertain. Applying {\sc Bagpipes} on simulated SEDs at $z=6$ from the {\sc Sphinx$^{20}$} cosmological simulation, we examine uncertainties in the recovery of stellar masses, star formation rates (SFR$_{10}$), and stellar metallicities from mock JWST/Near-Infrared Camera photometry. Even without dust or emission lines, fitting the intrinsic stellar continuum overestimates the stellar mass by about 60\% on average (and by up to a factor of five for low-mass galaxies with recent starbursts) and underestimates SFR$_{10}$ by a factor of two, owing to inaccurate star formation histories and age-metallicity degeneracies. The addition of dust and nebular emission further amplifies these biases, yielding offsets of approximately +0.3 and -0.4 dex in stellar mass and SFR$_{10}$, respectively, while leaving stellar metallicities largely unconstrained. Incorporating bands free of strong emission lines, such as F410M, helps mitigate stellar mass overestimation by disentangling line emission from older stellar populations. We also find that best-fit or likelihood-weighted estimates are generally more accurate than median posterior values. Although stellar mass functions are reproduced reasonably well, the slope of the star formation main sequence depends sensitively on the adopted fitting model. Overall, these results underscore the importance of careful modelling when interpreting high-$z$ photometry, particularly for galaxies with recent star formation burst and/or strong emission lines, to minimise systematic biases in derived physical properties.</description>

Abstract: We analyze nebular dust attenuation and its correlation with stellar mass ($M_{*}$) and UV spectral slope ($\beta$) in 33 lensed, low-mass star-forming galaxies at $1.4\leq z \leq 2.6$, using Keck/MOSFIRE rest-frame optical spectroscopy. Located behind three massive lensing galaxy clusters Abell 1689, MACS J1149.5+2223, and MACS J0717.5+3745, galaxies in our sample have a median stellar mass of $\log(M_{*}/M_{\odot})=8.3$ and an intrinsic UV absolute magnitude range of $-20.9&lt;M_{UV}&lt;-13$. We measure nebular dust attenuation via Balmer optical depth ($\tau_{B}$) defined as the H$\alpha$/H$\beta$ ratio. We also derive physical properties from Hubble Space Telescope multi-wavelength photometry and construct composite spectra using median stacking in bins of $M_{*}$ and $\beta$. We find that the $\tau_{B}-\beta$ relation for the dwarf galaxies in this study is best represented by SMC dust curve. This is consistent with previous studies of low-metallicity galaxies at similar redshifts, which show a steep attenuation curve similar to the SMC curve, in contrast to high-metallicity and more massive galaxies that exhibit a much shallower dust attenuation curve. We also investigate the relationship between nebular dust attenuation and stellar mass, $E(B-V)_{nebular}-M_{*}$, down to $\log(M_{*}/M_{\odot})\sim 7$. We demonstrate that this relation does not notably evolve with redshift and is consistent with what has been observed for local SDSS galaxies at similar low stellar masses.</description>

      <title>Serendipitous Discovery of an Optically-Dark Ultra-Luminous Infrared Galaxy at $z$ = 3.4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dusty, submillimeter-selected galaxies without optical counterparts contribute a non-negligible fraction of the star formation in the early universe. However, such a population is difficult to detect through classical optical/UV-based surveys. We report the serendipitous discovery of such an optically dark galaxy, behind the quadruply-lensed $z=2.56$ quasar, H1413+117, offset to the north by 6\arcsec. From $^{12}$CO $J=4$--3, $J=6$--5, and part of the $J=13$--12 transitions, which all spatially coincide with a compact submillimeter continuum emission, we determine an unambiguous spectroscopic redshift, $z=3.386\pm 0.005$. This galaxy has a molecular mass $M_{\rm mol} \sim 10^{11}$ M$_\odot$ and a black hole mass $M_{\rm BH} \sim 10^{8}$ M$_\odot$, estimated from $^{12}$CO $J=4$--3 and archival {\it Chandra} X-ray data ($L_{\rm 2-10,keV} \sim 4 \times 10^{44}$\,erg\,s$^{-1}$), respectively. We also estimate a total infrared luminosity of $L_{\rm FIR} = (2.8\pm{2.3}) \times 10^{12}$ L$_\odot$ and a stellar mass of $M_* \lesssim 10^{11}$ M$_{\odot}$, from spectral energy distribution fitting. According to these simple mass estimations, this gas-rich and X-ray bright galaxy might be in a transition phase from starburst to quasar offering a unique case for studying galaxy-black hole co-evolution under extremely dusty conditions.</description>

      <title>Kinematic analysis of an Ultra-Strong MgII absorber at z~1.13 linking to Circumgalactic Gas Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a spectroscopic and imaging analysis of the $z_{gal} \approx 1.1334$ ultra-strong MgII absorption system identified in the $VLT$/UVES spectrum of a background quasar located at $\rho \approx 18$ kpc from a star-forming galaxy. Low ionization metal lines like MgI, FeII, and CaII are also detected for this absorber. The HI lines are outside of the wavelength coverage. The MgII has a rest-frame equivalent width of $W_r(2796) =3.185 +/- 0.032 A^{\circ} $, with the absorption spread across $\Delta v \approx 460$ km~s$^{-1}$ in several components. A component-by-component ionization modeling shows several of these components having solar and higher metallicities. The models also predict a total HI column density of $log[N(HI)/cm^{-2}] \approx 22.5$, consistent with ultra-strong MgII absorbers being sub-Damped Lyman Alpha and Damped Lyman Alpha systems. The absorber is well within the virial radius of the nearest galaxy which has a stellar mass $M_* = 4.7 \times 10^{10}$~M$_\odot$, and a star formation rate of $\approx 8.3$~M$_\odot$~yr$^{-1}$. The absorption is along the projected major axis of the galaxy with a velocity spread that is wider than the galaxy's disk rotation. From the kinematic analysis of the absorber and the galaxy, the origin of the absorption can be attributed to a combination of circumgalactic gas structures, some corotating with the disk and the rest at line-of-sight velocities outside of the disk rotation.</description>

      <title>Deep XMM-Newton observation reveals hot gaseous outflow in NGC 5746</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. We present a deep XMM-Newton observation of the massive, edge-on galaxy NGC 5746. The total exposure time of 250 ks provides unprecedented sensitivity to study the diffuse hot gas in the halo, significantly surpassing the depth of previous observations. Aims. While the presence of hot, circumgalactic gas is well tested for starburst galaxies, detections in normal galaxies remain scarce. By studying the diffuse X-ray emission in NGC 5746, we aim to provide new insights into the evolution of star-forming galaxies and their surroundings. Methods. We create X-ray images and surface brightness profiles to quantify the distribution of extraplanar gas in the halo of NGC 5746. In addition, we isolate the diffuse emission component from point source- and background-contamination and study the spectral characteristics of the hot plasma. Results. We detect soft X-ray emission out to 40 kpc from the galactic disc. The gas distribution is reminiscent of a stellar outflow, with two bubbles extending perpendicular to the disc in a biconical shape. The spectral analysis of the halo emission yields a plasma temperature of 0.56 keV, higher than the typical values observed in spiral galaxies (0.2 keV). The disc has an even higher plasma temperature of 0.7 keV, and is dominated by non-thermal emission from unresolved X-ray binaries. The signs of a stellar outflow, bright X-ray emission, and high plasma temperatures indicate that the star-forming activity in NGC 5746 might be higher than previously thought. Conclusions. Our results demonstrate that massive spiral galaxies can host luminous X-ray halos, and support theoretical models that predict their existence. Earlier claims of a lack of hot gas around quiescent spirals might be attributed to the detection thresholds in shallower observations, stressing the need for more, deeper observations of non-starburst galaxies.</description>

      <title>The gas streamer G1-2-3 in the Galactic Center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The black hole in the Galactic Center, Sgr A*, is prototypical for ultra-low-fed galactic nuclei. The discovery of a hand-full of gas clumps in the realm of a few Earth masses in its immediate vicinity provides a gas reservoir sufficient to power Sgr A*. In particular, the gas cloud G2 is of interest due to its extreme orbit, on which it passed at a pericenter distance of around 100 AU and notably lost kinetic energy during the fly-by due to the interaction with the black hole accretion flow. 13 years prior to G2, a resembling gas cloud called G1, passed Sgr A* on a similar orbit. The origin of G2 remained a topic of discussion, with models including a central (stellar) source still proposed as alternatives to pure gaseous clouds. Here, we report the orbit of a third gas clump moving again along (almost) the same orbital trace. Since the probability of finding three stars on close orbits is very small, this strongly argues against stellar-based source models. Instead, we show that the gas streamer G1-2-3 plausibly originates from the stellar wind of the massive binary star IRS16SW. This claim is substantiated by the fact that the small differences between the three orbits - the orientations of the orbital ellipses in their common plane as a function of time - are consistent with the orbital motion of IRS 16SW.</description>

      <title>Forecasting the Observable Rates of Gravitationally Lensed Supernovae for the PASSAGES Dusty Starbursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: More than 60 years have passed since the first formal suggestion to use strongly-lensed supernovae to measure the expansion rate of the Universe through time-delay cosmography. Yet, fewer than 10 such objects have ever been discovered. We consider the merits of a targeted strategy focused on lensed hyperluminous infrared galaxies -- among the most rapidly star-forming galaxies known in the Universe. With star formation rates (SFRs) $\sim {200 - 6000}~\textrm{M}_\odot~\textrm{yr}^{-1}$, the $\sim 30$ objects in the Planck All-Sky Survey to Analyze Gravitationally-lensed Extreme Starbursts (PASSAGES) are excellent candidates for a case study, in particular, and have already led to the discovery of the multiply-imaged SN H0pe. Considering their lens model-corrected SFRs, we estimate their intrinsic supernova rates to be an extraordinary ${1.8 - 65}~\textrm{yr}^{-1}$ (core-collapse) and ${0.2 - 6.4}~\textrm{yr}^{-1}$ (Type Ia). Moreover, these massive starbursts typically have star-forming companions which are unaccounted for in this tally. We demonstrate a strong correlation between Einstein radius and typical time delays, with cluster lenses often exceeding several months (and therefore most favorable for high-precision $H_0$ inferences). A multi-visit monitoring campaign with a sensitive infrared telescope (namely, JWST) is necessary to mitigate dust attenuation. Still, a porous interstellar medium and clumpy star formation in these extreme galaxies might produce favorable conditions for detecting supernovae as transient point sources. Targeted campaigns of known lensed galaxies to discover new lensed supernovae can greatly complement wide-area cadenced surveys. Increasing the sample size helps to realize the potential of supernova time-delay cosmography to elucidate the Hubble tension through a single-step measurement, independent of other $H_0$ techniques.</description>

      <title>Fuzzy dark matter dynamical friction: Defying galactic cannibalism of globular clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new implementation of fuzzy dark matter (FDM) dynamical friction within the galpy framework, enabling orbital integrations of globular clusters (GCs) across a broad range of halo-to-GC mass ratios and boson masses. In this alternative DM scenario, dynamical friction is reduced or even suppressed by heating induced by FDM density granules. We further quantify the role of baryons and solitonic cores, natural consequences of FDM in galaxies, on the efficiency of orbital decay and the long-term survival of GCs. The most significant deviations from the cold DM (CDM) paradigm arise in the dwarf-galaxy regime, where FDM dynamical friction can stall the inspiral of GCs over a Hubble time, thereby preventing their sinking into galactic centers and halting the canonical galactic cannibalism of clusters. Importantly, our FDM-only friction model should be regarded as a conservative lower bound, since the inclusion of realistic FDM cores can only strengthen the survival of GCs through core stalling. This stalling mechanism not only preserves in-situ populations that would otherwise be erased in CDM, but also strongly suppresses the mixing of in-situ and ex-situ clusters, yielding a bimodal radial distribution of GCs. Our results show that the demographics of GC systems encode a distinct dynamical signature of FDM in dwarfs. These predictions open a new pathway to constrain the boson mass parameter with upcoming Euclid DR1 observations of extragalactic GCs, while simultaneously offering a natural explanation for the long-standing Fornax timing problem.</description>

      <title>Euclid: Discovery of bright $z\simeq7$ Lyman-break galaxies in UltraVISTA and Euclid COSMOS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a search for $z\simeq7$ Lyman-break galaxies using the $1.72 \, \rm{deg}^2$ near-infrared UltraVISTA survey in the COSMOS field, reaching $5\,\sigma$ depths in $Y$ of 26.2. We incorporate deep optical and Spitzer imaging for a full spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting analysis. We find 289 candidate galaxies at $6.5\leq z \leq 7.5$ covering $-22.6 \leq M_{\rm UV} \leq -20.2$, faint enough to overlap with Hubble Space Telescope studies. We conduct a separate selection by including complementary Euclid performance verification imaging (reaching $5\,\sigma$ depths of $26.3$), yielding 140 galaxies in $0.65 \, \rm{deg}^2$, with 38 sources unique to this sample. We compute the rest-frame UV luminosity function (UV LF) from our samples, extending below the knee ($M^*=-21.14^{+0.28}_{-0.25}$). We find that the shape of the UV LF is consistent with both a Schechter function and double-power law (DPL) at the magnitudes probed by this sample, with a DPL preferred at $M_{\rm UV}&lt;-22.5$ when bright-end results are included. The UltraVISTA+Euclid sample provides a clean measurement of the LF due to the overlapping near-infrared filters identifying molecular absorption features in the SEDs of ultra-cool dwarf interlopers, and additional faint galaxies are recovered. A comparison with JWST LFs at $z&gt;7$ suggests a gentle evolution in the bright-end slope, although this is limited by a lack of robust bright-end measurements at $z&gt;9$. We forecast that in the Euclid Deep Fields, the removal of contaminant ultra-cool dwarfs as point sources will be possible at $J_{\rm E} &lt; 24.5$. Finally, we present a high-equivalent-width Lyman-$\alpha$ emitter candidate identified by combining HSC, VISTA, and Euclid broadband photometry, highlighting the synergistic power these instruments will have in the Euclid Auxiliary Fields for identifying extreme sources in the Epoch of Reionisation.</description>

      <title>From atoms to stars: Modelling $\mathrm{H}_2$ formation and its impact on galactic evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a sub-grid model for star formation in galaxy simulations, incorporating molecular hydrogen ($\mathrm{H}_2$) production via dust grain condensation and its destruction through star formation and photodissociation. Implemented within the magnetohydrodynamical code AREPO, our model tracks the non-equilibrium mass fractions of molecular, ionised, and atomic hydrogen, as well as a stellar component, by solving a system of differential equations governing mass exchange between these phases. Star formation is treated with a variable rate dependent on the local $\mathrm{H}_2$ abundance, which itself varies in a complex way with key quantities such as gas density and metallicity. Testing the model in a cosmological simulation of a Milky Way-mass galaxy, we obtain a well-defined spiral structure at $z = 0$, including a gas disc twice the size of the stellar one, alongside a realistic star formation history. Our results show a broad range of star formation efficiencies per free-fall time, from as low as $0.001\%$ at high redshift to values between $0.1\%$ and $10\%$ for ages $\gtrsim 3-4 \, \mathrm{Gyr}$. These findings align well with observational estimates and simulations of a turbulent interstellar medium. Notably, our model reproduces a star formation rate versus molecular hydrogen surface densities relation akin to the molecular Kennicutt-Schmidt law. Furthermore, we find that the star formation efficiency varies with density and metallicity, providing an alternative to fixed-efficiency assumptions and enabling comparisons with more detailed star formation models. Comparing different star formation prescriptions, we find that in models that link star formation to $\mathrm{H}_2$, star formation onset is $\sim \! 500 \, \mathrm{Myr}$ later than those relying solely on total or cold gas density.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Approaches for Classifying Star-Forming Galaxies and Active Galactic Nuclei from MIGHTEE-Detected Radio Sources in the COSMOS Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio synchrotron emission originates from both massive star formation and black hole accretion, two processes that drive galaxy evolution. Efficient classification of sources dominated by either process is therefore essential for fully exploiting deep, wide-field extragalactic radio continuum surveys. In this study, we implement, optimize, and compare five widely used supervised machine-learning (ML) algorithms to classify radio sources detected in the MeerKAT International GHz Tiered Extragalactic Exploration (MIGHTEE)-COSMOS survey as star-forming galaxies (SFGs) and active galactic nuclei (AGN). Training and test sets are constructed from conventionally classified MIGHTEE-COSMOS sources, and 18 physical parameters of the MIGHTEE-detected sources are evaluated as input features. As anticipated, our feature analyses rank the five parameters used in conventional classification as the most effective: the infrared-radio correlation parameter ($q_\mathrm{IR}$), the optical compactness morphology parameter (class$\_$star), stellar mass, and two combined mid-infrared colors. By optimizing the ML models with these selected features and testing classifiers across various feature combinations, we find that model performance generally improves as additional features are incorporated. Overall, all five algorithms yield an $F1$-score (the harmonic mean of precision and recall) $&gt;90\%$ even when trained on only $20\%$ of the dataset. Among them, the distance-based $k$-nearest neighbors classifier demonstrates the highest accuracy and stability, establishing it as a robust and effective method for classifying SFGs and AGN in upcoming large radio continuum surveys.</description>

      <title>JADES Data Release 4 Paper I: Sample Selection, Observing Strategy and Redshifts of the complete spectroscopic sample</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper accompanies Data Release 4 of the JWST Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES), which presents the full NIRSpec spectroscopy of the survey. We provide spectra of 5190 targets across GOODS-North and GOODS-South (including the Hubble Ultra Deep Field), observed with the low-dispersion (R $\sim$ 30-300) prism and three medium-resolution (R $\sim$ 1000) gratings spanning 0.8 $&lt; \lambda &lt;$ 5.5 microns; 2654 were also observed with the higher-resolution (R $\sim$ 2700) G395H grating. The tiered survey design obtained more than 20 hr exposures for $\sim$ 700 galaxies in the Deep and Ultra Deep tiers, and shallower observations ($\sim$ 1-3 hr per setting) of $&gt;$ 4400 galaxies in the Medium tiers. Targets were selected from photometric redshifts or colours, with priority given to rest-UV-selected galaxies at $z &gt; 5.7$ and F444W-selected galaxies at $1.5 &lt; z &lt; 5.7$. We describe the full target selection and present spectroscopic redshifts and success rates. In total we obtain robust redshifts for 3297 galaxies, including 396 at $z &gt; 5.7$ and 2545 at $1.5 &lt; z &lt; 5.7$. To facilitate uniform analyses, we define 'gold' sub-samples based on UV- and F444W-selection. Using the parent samples and redshift success rates, we construct rest-UV luminosity functions at $6 \lesssim z \lesssim 9$ from the Medium- and Deep-JWST tiers. Our number densities agree well with previous determinations from both photometric and spectroscopic samples, with modest interloper fractions confirming the reliability of photometric UV-bright galaxy selections at these redshifts.</description>

      <title>JADES Data Release 4 -- Paper II: Data reduction, analysis and emission-line fluxes of the complete spectroscopic sample</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the fourth data release of JADES, the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey, providing deep spectroscopic observations in the two GOODS fields. A companion paper presents the target selection, spectroscopic redshifts and success rates, and in this paper, we discuss the data reduction and present emission line flux measurements. The spectroscopy in this work consists of medium-depth, deep and ultradeep NIRSpec/MSA spectra of 5,190 targets, covering the spectral range $0.6\text{--}5.5$~\mum and observed with both the low-dispersion prism ($R=30\text{--}300$) and all three medium-resolution gratings ($R=500\text{--}1,500$). We describe the data reduction, analysis and description of the data products included in this data release. In total, we measured 3,297 robust redshifts out of 5,190 targets, spanning a redshift range from $z=0.5$ up to $z=14.2$, including 974 at $z&gt;4$. This data release includes 1-d and 2-d fully reduced spectra with 3 and 5 pixel extractions, with slit-loss corrections and background subtraction optimized for point sources. Furthermore, we provide redshifts and $S/N&gt;5$ emission-line flux catalogues for the prism and grating spectra, as well as new guidelines to use these data products. Lastly, we are launching a new JADES Online Database, designed to enable quick selection and browsing of this data release. Altogether, these data provide the largest statistical sample to date to characterise the properties of galaxy populations across Cosmic time.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the formation of molecules and dust in core collapse supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Core-collapse Supernovae of Type II contribute the chemical enrichment of galaxies through explosion. Their role as dust producers in the high-redshift Universe may be of paramount importance. However, the type and amount of dust they synthesise after outburst is still a matter of debate and the formation processes remain unclear.
  Aims. We aim to identify and understand the chemical processes at play in the dust formation scenario, and derive mass yields for molecules and dust clusters at late post-explosion time. Methods. We revisit existing models by improving on the physics and chemistry of the supernova ejecta. We identify and consider new chemical species and pathways underpinning the formation of dust clusters, and apply a unique exhaustive chemical network to the entire ejecta of a Supernova with a 15 Msun progenitor. We test this new chemistry for various gas conditions in the ejecta, and derive mass yields for molecules and dust clusters.
  Results. We obtain the molecular component of the ejecta up to 11 years after explosion. The most abundant species are, in order of decreasing masses, O2, CO, SiS, SiO, CO2, SO2, CaS, N2, and CS. We identify molecules that are tracers of high-density clumps. As for dust clusters, we find the composition is dominated by silicates and silica, along with carbon dust, but with modest amounts of alumina. Pure metal clusters and metal sulphide and oxide clusters have negligible masses. High-density gas favours the formation of carbon clusters in the outer ejecta region whereas low temperatures hamper the formation of silicates in the oxygen core. The results are in good agreement with existing astronomical data and recent observations with the James Webb Space Telescope. They highlight the importance of chemistry for the derivation of dust budget from Supernovae.</description>

      <title>Quasar Main Sequence unfolded by 2.5D FRADO (Natural expression of Eddington ratio, black hole mass, and inclination)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quasar main sequence (QMS), characterized by the Eigenvector 1 (EV1), serves as a unifying framework for classifying type-1 active galactic nuclei (AGNs) based on their diverse spectral properties. Although a fully self-consistent physical interpretation has long been lacking, our physically motivated 2.5D FRADO (Failed Radiatively Accelerated Dusty Outflow) model naturally predicts that the Eddington ratio ($\dot{m}$) is the primary physical driver of the QMS, with black hole mass ($M_{\rm BH}$) and inclination ($i$) acting as secondary contributors. We employed a dense grid of FRADO simulations of the geometry and dynamics of the broad-line region (BLR), covering a representative range of $M_{\rm BH}$ and $\dot{m}$. For each simulation, we computed the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the H$\beta$ line under different $i$. The resulting FWHM--$\dot{m}$ diagram closely resembles the characteristic trend observed in the EV1 parameter space. This establishes the role of $\dot{m}$ as the true proxy for the Fe II strength parameter ($R_{\rm Fe}$), and vice versa. Our results suggest that $\dot{m}$ can be regarded as the sole underlying physical tracer of $R_{\rm Fe}$ and should therefore scale directly with it. The $M_{\rm BH}$ accounts for the virial mass-related scatter in FWHM, while $i$ acts as a secondary driver modulating $R_{\rm Fe}$ and FWHM for a given $\dot{m}$ and $M_{\rm BH}$.</description>

      <title>The causal structure of galactic astrophysics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-driven astrophysics currently relies on the detection and characterisation of correlations between objects' properties, which are then used to test physical theories that make predictions for them. This process fails to utilise information in the data that forms a crucial part of the theories' predictions, namely which variables are directly correlated (as opposed to accidentally correlated through others), the directions of these determinations, and the presence or absence of confounders that correlate variables in the dataset but are themselves absent from it. We propose to recover this information through causal discovery, a well-developed methodology for inferring the causal structure of datasets that is however almost entirely unknown to astrophysics. We develop a causal discovery algorithm suitable for astrophysical datasets and illustrate it on $\sim$5$\times10^5$ low-redshift galaxies from the Nasa Sloan Atlas, demonstrating its ability to distinguish physical mechanisms that are degenerate on the basis of correlations alone.</description>

      <title>JADES: An Abundance of Ultra-Distant T- and Y-Dwarfs in Deep Extragalactic Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultra-cool T- (T$_{\mathrm{eff}} \approx$ 500 - 1200 K) and Y-dwarfs (T$_{\mathrm{eff}}$ $\lessapprox 500$ K) have historically been found only a few hundred parsecs from the Sun. The sensitivity and wavelength coverage of the NIRCam instrument on board the James Webb Space Telescope offer a unique method for finding low-temperature brown dwarfs in deep extragalactic datasets out to multiple kiloparsecs. Here we report on the selection of a sample of 41 brown dwarf and brown dwarf candidates across the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) in the GOODS-S and GOODS-N regions. We introduce a new open-source Bayesian tool, the Near-Infrared Fitting for T and Y-dwarfs (\texttt{NIFTY}), to derive effective temperatures, metallicities, and distances from JWST photometry. We find that 31 candidates have fits consistent with T-dwarf temperatures out to 5 - 6 kpc, and 10 candidates have fits consistent with Y-dwarf temperatures out to 1 - 2 kpc. The majority of the sources are best fit with sub-solar metallicity models, consistent with them being subdwarfs in the Milky Way thick disk and halo. We report proper motions for nine brown dwarf candidates (three are newly presented), and calculate the number density of T- and Y-dwarfs as a function of temperature and distance above the Milky Way midplane. We further discuss how Y-dwarfs can serve as contaminants in the search for ultra-high-redshift galaxies. Together, these results demonstrate the power of deep JWST extragalactic imaging to probe the coldest substellar populations far beyond the solar neighborhood, providing new constraints on the Milky Way's structure and brown dwarf demographics.</description>

      <title>Automated Modeling with AAP-Imfit: Astrometry and Photometry via CASA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) provides the highest-resolution radio intensity maps, crucial for detailed studies of compact sources like active galactic nuclei (AGN) and their relativistic jets. Analyzing jet components in these maps traditionally involves manual Gaussian fitting, a time-consuming bottleneck for large datasets. To address this, we present an automated batch-processing tool, based on the Gaussian fitting capabilities of CASA, designed to streamline VLBI jet component characterization (AAP-Imfit). Our algorithm sets a detection limit, performs automatic 2D Gaussian fitting, and removes model artifacts, efficiently extracting component flux densities and positions. This method enables systematic and reproducible analysis, significantly reducing the time required for fitting extensive VLBI datasets. We validated AAP-Imfit by using VLBI observations of the blazars 3C 279 and 3C 454.3, comparing our results with published fits. The close agreement in residual root mean square (RMS) values and model/residual-to-map RMS ratios confirms the accuracy of our automated approach in reproducing original flux distributions. While visual inspection remains important for complex or faint features, this routine significantly accelerates VLBI component fitting, paving the way for large-scale statistical studies of jet dynamics.</description>

      <title>SN 2025coe: A Triple-Peaked Calcium-Strong Transient from A White-Dwarf Progenitor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: SN 2025coe is a calcium-strong transient located at an extremely large projected offset $\sim$39.3 kpc from the center of its host, the nearby early-type galaxy NGC 3277 at a distance of $\sim$25.5 Mpc. In this paper, we present multi-band photometric and spectroscopic observations spanning $\sim$100 days post-discovery. Its multi-band light curves display three distinct peaks: (1) an initial peak at $t \approx 1.6$ days attributed to shock cooling emission, (2) a secondary peak of $M_{R, \, peak} \approx$ $-$15.8 mag at $t \approx 10.2$ days powered by radioactive decay, and (3) a late-time bump at $t \approx 42.8$ days likely caused by ejecta-circumstellar material/clump interaction. Spectral evolution of SN 2025coe reveals a fast transition to the nebular phase within 2 months, where it exhibits an exceptionally high [Ca II]/[O I] ratio larger than 6. Modeling of the bolometric light curve suggests an ejecta mass of $M_{\rm ej} = 0.29^{+0.14}_{-0.15} \, M_{\odot}$, a $^{56}$Ni mass of $M_{\rm ^{56}Ni} = 2.4^{+0.06}_{-0.05} \times 10^{-2} M_{\odot}$, and a progenitor envelope with mass $M_e = 1.4^{+6.9}_{-1.2} \times 10^{-3} \, M_{\odot}$ and radius $R_e = 13.5^{+64.1}_{-11.1} \, R_{\odot}$. The tidal disruption of a hybrid HeCO white dwarf (WD) by a low-mass CO WD provides a natural explanation for the low ejecta mass, the small fraction of $^{56}$Ni, and the presence of an extended, low-mass envelope.</description>

      <title>ADARI: Visualizing the quality of VLT data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: ADARI (Astronomical DAta Reporting Infrastructure) is a system designed for creating graphical reports of astronomical data so that the quality of these products can be assessed. It has been designed from the ground up to be backend-agnostic, meaning the same ADARI code can be sent to a web plotting API, or a code-based plotting API, with no alteration.
  Quick data inspection is an important feature in data reduction systems. The use cases range from quality control at the telescope, advance quality checks prior to delivering data to the scientists as well as data inspection for users running the pipelines at their home institutes. The goal of ADARI is to deliver the same experience and code for data visualization for all the environments, either running automatically in the Paranal Observatory environment or at the PI premises.
  ADARI contains a library that can be used to develop the creation of reports as well as a command line tool (genreport) to execute such reports. Most of the time the reports are generated as part of the execution of a data reduction workflow implemented with EDPS, the new ESO system for automatically organising data from ESO instruments and for running the reduction pipelines on them.</description>

      <title>Dark-to-black super accretion as a mechanism for early supermassive black hole growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of supermassive black holes with masses $\gtrsim 10^9 M_\odot$ at redshifts $z\gtrsim 10$ challenges conventional formation scenarios based on baryonic accretion and mergers within the first few hundred million years. We propose an alternative channel in which ultralight scalar dark matter undergoes dark-to-black conversion via quasi-bound state depletion around black hole seeds. We estimate the accretion rate of the scalar field as a function of the boson mass parameter $\mu$ and the black hole mass $M_{\rm BH}$, and integrate this rate over cosmological timescales. Our results show that once a critical value of $\mu M_{\rm BH}$ is reached, scalar field accretion becomes highly efficient, enabling substantial black hole growth even from relatively small initial seed masses. For boson masses $\mu \sim 10^{-19}-10^{-16}\,\mathrm{eV}$, black hole seeds of $10^2-10^5 M_\odot$ can reach $10^6-10^8 M_\odot$ within $\sim 10^8$ yr. This dark-to-black mechanism provides a natural pathway for the rapid formation of massive black holes in the early universe, offering a potential probe of the microphysical nature of dark matter.</description>

      <title>The Clustering of Active Galactic Nuclei and Star Forming Galaxies in the LoTSS DeepFields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using deep observations across three of the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey Deep Fields, this work measures the angular clustering of star forming galaxies (SFGs) and low-excitation radio galaxies (LERGs) to $z$$\lesssim$1.5 for faint sources, $S_{\textrm{144 MHz}}$$\geq$200 $\mu$Jy. We measure the angular auto-correlation of LOFAR sources in redshift bins and their cross-correlation with multi-wavelength sources {to} measure the evolving galaxy bias for SFGs and LERGs. Our work shows the bias of the radio-selected SFGs increases from $b=0.90^{+0.11}_{-0.10}$ at $z \sim 0.2$ to $b = 2.94^{+0.36}_{-0.36}$ at $z \sim 1.2$; faster than the assumed $b(z)$$\propto$$1/D(z)$ models adopted in previous LOFAR cosmology studies (at sensitivities where AGN dominate), but in broad agreement with previous work. We further study the luminosity dependence of bias for SFGs and find little evidence for any luminosity dependence at fixed redshift, although uncertainties remain large for the sample sizes available. The LERG population instead shows a weaker redshift evolution with $b=2.33^{+0.28}_{-0.27}$ at $z \sim 0.7$ to $b=2.65^{+0.57}_{-0.55}$ at $z \sim 1.2$, though it is also consistent with the assumed bias evolution model ($b(z)$$\propto$$1/D(z)$) within the measured uncertainties. For those LERGs which reside in quiescent galaxies (QLERGs), there is weak evidence that they are more biased than the general LERG population and evolve from $b = 2.62^{+0.33}_{-0.33}$ at $z \sim 0.7$ to $b = 3.08^{+0.85}_{-0.84}$ at $z \sim 1.2$. This suggests the halo environment of radio sources may be related to their properties. These measurements can help constrain models for the bias evolution of these source populations, and can help inform multi-tracer analyses.</description>

      <title>Curvature Mapping Method: Mapping Lorentz Force in Orion A</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09690v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic force is a fundamental force in nature. Although widely believed to be important in counterbalancing against collapse in star formation, a clear evaluation of the role of the magnetic field in star formation remains hard to achieve. Past research attempts to evaluate the importance of magnetic forces using diagnostics such as the mass-to-flux ratio, which measures its strength but not how it functions. Since star formation is a complex process and the observed regions have complex structures, mapping the importance of the magnetic field is necessary. We propose a new technique, the Curvature Mapping Method, to evaluate the role of the magnetic force by providing maps of the magnetic force estimated using polarization observations. The Curvature Mapping Method provides maps with the contribution of the magnetic force clearly outlined. We apply the method to the star formation region of Orion A and provide a first quantitative result where the magnetic force arising from the pinched magnetic field does provide support against gravity. By comparing it against the gravitational force, we find that the magnetic force is enough to affect the low-density gas but is insufficient to support the dense region from collapse. The method effectively uses information contained in polarization maps and can be applied to data from surveys to understand the role of the B-field.</description>

      <title>Inferring the density and membership of stellar streams with flexible models: The GD-1 stream in Gaia Data Release 3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13236</link>

Abstract: Stellar streams provide one of the most promising avenues for constraining the global mass distribution of the Milky Way and the nature of dark matter (DM). The stream stars' kinematic "track" enables inference of large-scale properties of the DM distribution, while density variations and anomalies provide information about local DM clumps (e.g., from DM subhalos). Using precise astrometric data from the Gaia Mission, which enables clean selections of Milky Way stream stars, we now know of a few streams with perturbations and density anomalies. A full accounting of the density tracks and substructures within all $&gt;100$ Milky Way stellar streams will therefore enable powerful new constraints on DM. However, methods for discovering and characterizing membership of streams are heterogeneous and often highly customized to individual streams. Here, we present a new, flexible framework for modeling stellar stream density and membership. With it, one can empirically model a given stream in a variety of coordinate spaces (\eg on-sky position and velocity) using probability distributions, thereby generating membership probabilities. The most significant improvement over previous methods is the inclusion of off-track or non-Gaussian components to the stream density, meaning we can capture anomalous features (such as the GD-1 steam's spur). We test our model on GD-1, where we characterize previously-known features and provide the largest catalog of probable member stars to date (1689 stars). We then use the derived model to provide measurements of GD-1's density and kinematic tracks, velocity dispersion, as well as its initial and current mass. Our framework (built on JAX and numpyro) provides a path toward uniform analysis of all Milky Way streams, enabling tight constraints on the Galactic mass distribution and its dark matter.</description>

      <title>MaNGA DynPop. VII. A Unified Bulge-Disk-Halo Model for Explaining Diversity in Circular Velocity Curves of 6000 Spiral and Early-Type Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06968</link>

Abstract: We derive circular velocity curves (CVCs) from stellar dynamical models for $\sim6000$ nearby galaxies in the final data release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-IV MaNGA survey with integral-field spectroscopy, exploring connections between the inner gravitational potential (traced by CVC amplitude/shape) and galaxy properties. The maximum circular velocity ($V_{\rm circ}^{\rm max}$) and circular velocity at the half-light radius ($V_{\rm circ}(R_{\rm e}^{\rm maj})$) both scale linearly with the stellar second velocity moment $\sigma_{\rm e}^2\equiv\langle V^2+\sigma^2\rangle$ within the half-light isophote, following $V_{\rm circ}^{\rm max} \approx 1.72\sigma_{\rm e}$ (7$\%$ error) and $V_{\rm circ}(R_{\rm e}^{\rm maj}) \approx 1.62\sigma_{\rm e}$ (7$\%$ error). CVC shapes (rising, flat, declining) correlate strongly with structural and stellar population properties: declining curves dominate in massive, early-type, bulge-dominated galaxies with old, metal-rich stars and early quenching, while rising CVCs prevail in disk-dominated systems with younger stellar populations and ongoing star formation. Using a unified bulge-disk-halo model, we predict CVC shapes with minimal bias, identifying three governing parameters: bulge-to-total mass ratio ($B/T$), dark matter fraction within $R_{\rm e}$, and bulge Sersic index. The distribution of CVC shapes across the mass-size plane reflects evolutionary pathways driven by (i) in situ star formation (spurring bulge growth) and (ii) dry mergers. This establishes CVC morphology as a diagnostic for galaxy evolution, linking dynamical signatures to structural and stellar population histories.</description>

      <title>Seeding Cores: A Pathway for Nuclear Star Clusters from Bound Star Clusters in the First Billion Years</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08779v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We model the formation of star clusters in a dwarf galaxy progenitor during the first $700 ~{\rm Myr}$ of cosmic history using a cosmological radiation-hydrodynamic simulation with a sub-grid star formation efficiency (SFE) model calibrated from AU-scale radiation-MHD simulations of molecular clouds with varying mass, density, and metallicity. In comparison to a constant SFE model, our model yields more bursty star formation, a more abundant massive star cluster population, and overall a higher stellar mass. Clouds reach SFEs up to $80\%$, forming bound star clusters (densities $\sim10^{2-4} ~{\rm M_\odot\:pc^{-2}}$, radii $\lesssim 3~{\rm pc}$) resembling those observed by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) in strongly lensed galaxies. Star clusters follow a flat power-law mass function ${\rm d}N/{\rm d}\log M \propto M^\Gamma$ with slope $\Gamma \sim -0.4$. The most massive star clusters ($10^{4-5} ~{\rm M_\odot}$) grow through mergers and have metallicity spreads of $0.05 - 0.1$ dex that roughly scale with mass. The second burst of star formation produce loosely bound star clusters with higher metallicities: $-1.95 &lt; \log(Z/{\rm Z_\odot}) &lt; -1.50$ at lower SFEs ($2 - 20\%$). At $z \sim 8.7$, a nuclear star cluster (NSC) is seeded, growing $83\%$ of its mass ($ 2.4 \times 10^5 ~{\rm M_\odot}$, $20\%$ of the galaxy's stellar mass) through mergers with pre-existing clusters and the rest through in-situ star formation. The early formation of NSCs has interesting implications for seeding supermassive black holes and the population of $\textit{little red dots}$ recently discovered by JWST at $z \gtrsim 5$</description>

      <title>Polarization-shape alignment of IllustrisTNG star-forming galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06106v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In star-forming disk galaxies, the radio continuum emission ($1$-$10\,$GHz) powered by star formation has an integrated polarization direction imperfectly aligned with the apparent disk minor axis. This polarization-shape alignment effect was previously observed in a small sample of local spirals. If this is prevalent for disk galaxies out to cosmological redshifts, novel measurements of cosmic birefringence and cosmic shear will be enabled by leveraging radio continuum surveys synergized with galaxy shape measurements. We calculate the polarization-shape misalignment angle for star-forming galaxies in the \texttt{IllustrisTNG50} simulation at $0 &lt; z &lt; 2$, assuming that additional polarized radio emission from an AGN is negligible. The alignment found for $z=0$ is consistent with local spiral data, but significantly deteriorates as redshift increases. Moreover, it degrades toward lower frequencies due to internal Faraday depolarization. Thanks to cosmic redshifting, observing higher-$z$ galaxies at a fixed frequency greatly mitigates degradation due to reduced Faraday depolarization at the source-frame frequency. We present analytic fits to the non-Gaussian misalignment angle distribution, and evaluate Fisher information per galaxy for measuring cosmic birefringence. For observation at 4.8 GHz, the effective RMS misalignment angle $\sigma_{\alpha,{\rm eff}}$ is $18^\circ$, $23^\circ$ and $33^\circ$ at $z=0$, $1$ and $2$, respectively. Analyzing $N$ independent galaxies reduces the uncertainty on an isotropic cosmic birefringence signal to $\sigma_{\alpha,{\rm eff}}/\sqrt{N}$, providing competitive sensitivity once large samples are available. Our results motivate pilot observations to empirically characterize polarization-shape alignment, facilitate forecasts of cosmology and fundamental physics applications that exploit this effect.</description>

      <title>FLORAH-Tree: Emulating Dark Matter Halo Merger Trees with Graph Generative Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10652v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Merger trees track the hierarchical assembly of dark matter halos across cosmic time and serve as essential inputs for semi-analytic models of galaxy formation. However, conventional methods for constructing merger trees rely on ad-hoc assumptions and are unable to incorporate environmental information. Nguyen et al. (2024) introduced FLORAH, a generative model based on recurrent neural networks and normalizing flows, for modeling main progenitor branches of merger trees. In this work, we extend this model, now referred to as FLORAH-Tree, to generate complete merger trees by representing them as graph structures that capture the full branching hierarchy. We trained FLORAH-Tree on merger trees extracted from the Very Small MultiDark Planck cosmological N-body simulation. To validate our approach, we compared the generated merger trees with both the original simulation data and with semi-analytic trees produced using the Extended Press-Schechter (EPS) formalism. We show that FLORAH-Tree accurately reproduces key merger rate statistics across a wide range of mass and redshift, outperforming the conventional EPS-based approach. We demonstrate its utility by applying the Santa Cruz semi-analytic model (SAM) to generated trees and showing that the resulting galaxy-halo scaling relations, such as the stellar-to-halo-mass relation and supermassive black hole mass-halo mass relation, closely match those from applying the SAM to trees extracted directly from the simulation. FLORAH-Tree provides a computationally efficient method for generating merger trees that maintain the statistical fidelity of N-body simulations.</description>

      <title>Estimate of Current Mass of the Large Magellanic Cloud from the Orphan-Chenab Tidal Stream</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01086v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By fitting the tilt in the path of the Orphan-Chenab Stream (OCS), we conclude that the current mass of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) within 30 kpc is $4.7$-$5.1 \times 10^{10}$ M$_\odot$. We note that the tidal radius of the LMC of this mass is 16.9 kpc, indicating that our measured mass approximates the current bound mass of the LMC. Previous measurements of the LMC mass based on fitting the observed path of the OCS through the Milky Way (MW) halo reported the total mass of the LMC. We show that because the closest approach of the LMC to the OCS, where the gravitational perturbation of the stream path is the highest, is about 20 kpc, the mass of the LMC outside of 30 kpc is not constrained and depends entirely on the assumed radial profile at large radius. Our best-fit total mass varies between $4.5 \times 10^{10}$ and $2.2 \times 10^{11}$ M$_\odot$ or more, depending on the presumed radial profile of the LMC. We also show that previous measurements of the mass of the LMC that used a particle-spray method to simulate the path of the OCS suffered from systematic error because they assumed that all particles were stripped from the dwarf galaxy at the tidal radius; N-body simulations show that particles are actually released from a range of distances from the center of mass of the OCS. In contrast, the choice of MW potential has little effect on the estimated LMC mass from the OCS.</description>

      <title>Equation vs. AI: Predict Density and Measure Width of molecular clouds by Multiscale Decomposition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01130v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interstellar medium widely exists in the universe at multi-scales. In this study, we introduce the {\it Multi-scale Decomposition Reconstruction} method, an equation-based model designed to derive width maps of interstellar medium structures and predict their volume density distribution in the plane of the sky from input column density data. This approach applies the {\it Constrained Diffusion Algorithm}, based on a simple yet common physical picture: as molecular clouds evolve to form stars, the density of interstellar medium increases while their scale decreases. Extensive testing on simulations confirms that this method accurately predicts volume density with minimal error. Notably, the equation-based model performs comparably or even more accurately than the AI-based DDPM model(Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models), which relies on numerous parameters and high computational resources. Unlike the "black-box" nature of AI, our equation-based model offers full transparency, making it easier to interpret, debug, and validate. Their simplicity, interpretability, and computational efficiency make them indispensable not only for understanding complex astrophysical phenomena but also for complementing and enhancing AI-based methods.</description>

      <title>Wide binaries in an ultra-faint dwarf galaxy: discovery, population modeling, and a nail in the coffin of primordial black hole dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04555v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the discovery and characterization of a wide binary population in the ultrafaint dwarf galaxy Bo\"{o}tes I using deep JWST/NIRCam imaging. Our sample consists of 52 candidate binaries with projected separations of 7,000 - 16,000 au and stellar masses from near the hydrogen-burning limit to the main-sequence turnoff ($\sim0.1$ - $0.8~{\rm M_\odot}$). By forward-modeling selection biases and chance alignments, we find that $1.25\pm0.25\%$ of Bo\"{o}tes I stars are members of wide binaries with separations beyond 5,000 au. This fraction, along with the distributions of separations and mass ratios, matches that in the Solar neighborhood, suggesting that wide binary formation is largely insensitive to metallicity, even down to [Fe/H] $\approx -2.5$. The observed truncation in the separation distribution near 16,000 au is well explained by stellar flyby disruptions. We also discuss how the binaries can be used to constrain the galaxy's dark matter properties. We show that our detection places new limits on primordial black hole dark matter, finding that compact objects with $M \gtrsim 5~{\rm M_\odot}$ cannot constitute more than $\sim1\%$ of the dark matter content. In contrast to previous work, we find that wide binaries are unlikely to provide robust constraints on the dark matter profile of ultrafaint galaxies given the uncertainties in the initial binary population, flyby disruptions, and contamination from chance alignments. These findings represent the most robust detection of wide binaries in an external galaxy to date, opening a new avenue for studying binary star formation and survival in extreme environments.</description>

      <title>Evolution of the infrared luminosity function and its corresponding dust-obscured star formation rate density out to z~6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12922v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new determination of the evolving far-infrared galaxy luminosity function (FIR LF) and the resulting inferred evolution of dust-obscured star-formation rate density (SFRD) out to redshift z~6. To establish the evolving co-moving number density of FIR-bright objects, we make use of the high-resolution ALMA follow-up study (AS2UDS), of the JCMT SCUBA-2 Cosmology Legacy Survey (S2CLS) sub-mm imaging in the UKIDSS UDS survey field. In order to estimate the contributions of faint/low-mass sources we implement a method in which the faint-end of the IR LF is inferred by stacking (in stellar mass and redshift bins) the optical/near-infrared samples of star-forming galaxies into the appropriate FIR Herschel and sub-mm JCMT maps. Using this information we determine the faint-end slope of the FIR LF in two intermediate redshift bins (where it can be robustly established) and then adopt this result at all other redshifts. The evolution of the characteristic luminosity of the galaxy FIR LF, L*, is found to be increase monotonically with redshift, evolving as z^1.38+-0.07, while the characteristic number density is well fitted by double power-law function, constant at z&lt;2.24 and declining as z^-4.95+-0.73 at higher redshifts. The evolution of the corresponding dust-obscured star-formation rate density was then calculated and is here compared with the results from a number of recent studies in the literature. Our analysis confirms that dust-obscured star-formation activity dominates SFRD at cosmic noon, but then becomes progressively less important with increasing redshift: while dusty star-forming galaxies are still found out to the highest redshifts explored here, UV-visible star formation dominates at z&gt;4, and dust-obscured activity contributes &lt;25% of SFRD by z~6.</description>

      <title>The inner rotation curve of the Milky Way</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23581v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derived the inner rotation curve (RC) of the Milky Way by applying the terminal velocity method (TVM) to the longitude-velocity diagrams (LVD) made from the large-scale survey data of the Galactic plane in the HI (HI4PI whole sky survey) and CO lines (CfA-Chile 1.2-m Galactic plane survey, Nobeyama 45-m Galactic plane and Galactic Center surveys, and Mopra 22-m southern Galactic plane survey). The derived RC agrees well with the RCs derived from the astrometric measurements of the maser sources by very long baseline interferometer (VLBI) observations and the GAIA result. We combined them to construct a unified RC from $R=0$ to $\sim 25$ kpc and decomposed the curve into bulge, disc and dark halo components with high precision. The dark matter density near the Sun is estimated to be $0.107 \pm 0.003$ GeV cm$^{-3}$. We present the RC as ascii tables for the solar constants of $(R_0,V_0)=(8.178 {\rm kpc}, 235.1 {\rm km/s})$, We also obtained a detailed comparison of the eastern ($l\ge 0^\circ$) and western ($&lt; 0^\circ$) RCs in the HI and CO lines, which allowed the creation of an E/W asymmetry curve of the velocity difference. The E/W asymmetry is fitted by a sinusoidal function of the radius with the amplitude increasing toward the Galactic Center. We consider the possibility of the origin due to a weak bar inside $\sim 4$ kpc.</description>

      <title>The spectra of a radiative reprocessing outflow model for fast blue optical transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18985v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The radiation reprocessing model, in which an optically-thick outflow absorbs the high-energy emission from a central source and re-emits in longer wavelengths, has been frequently invoked to explain some optically bright transients, such as fast blue optical transients (FBOTs) whose progenitor and explosion mechanism are still unknown. Previous studies on this model did not take into account the frequency dependence of the opacity. We study the radiative reprocessing and calculate the UV-optical-NIR band spectra from a spherical outflow composed of pure hydrogen gas, for a time-dependent outflowing mass rate. Electron scattering and frequency-dependent bound-free, free-free opacities are considered. The spectrum deviates from the blackbody at NIR and UV frequencies; in particular, it has $\nu L_{\nu} \propto \nu^{1.5}$ at NIR frequencies, because at these frequencies the absorption optical depth from the outflow's outer edge to the so-called photon trapping radius is large and is frequency dependent. We apply our model to the proto-type FBOT AT2018cow by {the spectra} to the observed SED. The best-fit mass loss rate suggests that the total outflow mass in AT2018cow is $M_{\rm out} \approx 5.7^{+0.4}_{-0.4} \, M_{\odot}$. If that equals the total mass lost during an explosion, and if the progenitor is a blue supergiant (with a pre-explosion mass of $\sim 20 \, M_{\odot}$), then it will suggest that the central compact remnant mass is at least $\approx \, \rm{14 \, M_{\odot}}$. This would imply that the central remnant is a black hole.</description>

Abstract: Making the most of next-generation galaxy clustering surveys requires overcoming challenges in complex, non-linear modelling to access the significant amount of information at smaller cosmological scales. Field-level inference has provided a unique opportunity beyond summary statistics to use all of the information of the galaxy distribution. However, addressing current challenges often necessitates numerical modelling that incorporates non-differentiable components, hindering the use of efficient gradient-based inference methods. In this paper, we introduce Learning the Universe by Learning to Optimize (LULO), a gradient-free framework for reconstructing the 3D cosmic initial conditions. Our approach advances deep learning to train an optimization algorithm capable of fitting state-of-the-art non-differentiable simulators to data at the field level. Importantly, the neural optimizer solely acts as a search engine in an iterative scheme, always maintaining full physics simulations in the loop, ensuring scalability and reliability. We demonstrate the method by accurately reconstructing initial conditions from $M_{200\mathrm{c}}$ halos identified in a dark matter-only $N$-body simulation with a spherical overdensity algorithm. The derived dark matter and halo overdensity fields exhibit $\geq80\%$ cross-correlation with the ground truth into the non-linear regime $k \sim 1h$ Mpc$^{-1}$. Additional cosmological tests reveal accurate recovery of the power spectra, bispectra, halo mass function, and velocities. With this work, we demonstrate a promising path forward to non-linear field-level inference surpassing the requirement of a differentiable physics model.</description>

      <title>Atacama Cosmology Telescope: Observations of supermassive black hole binary candidates. Strong sinusoidal variations at 95, 147 and 225 GHz in PKS 2131$-$021 and PKS J0805$-$0111</title>

Abstract: Large sinusoidal variations in the radio light curves of the blazars PKS J0805$-$0111 and PKS 2131$-$021 have recently been discovered with an 18-year monitoring programme at the Owens Valley Radio Observatory, making these systems strong supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB) candidates. The sinusoidal variations in PKS 2131$-$021 dominate its light curves from 2.7 GHz to optical frequencies. We report sinusoidal variations observed in both objects with the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) at 95, 147 and 225 GHz consistent with the radio light curves. The ACT 95 GHz light curve of PKS 2131$-$021 agrees well with the contemporaneous 91.5 GHz ALMA light curve and is comparable in quality, while the ACT light curves of PKS J0805$-$0111, for which there are no ALMA or other millimetre light curves, show that PKS 2131$-$021 is not an isolated case, and that this class of AGN exhibits the following properties: (a) the sinusoidal pattern dominates over a broad range of frequencies; (b) the amplitude of the sine wave compared to its mean value is monochromatic (i.e., nearly constant across frequencies); (c) the phase of the sinusoid phase changes monotonically as a function of frequency; (d) the sinusoidal variations are intermittent. We describe a physical model for SMBHB systems, the modified Kinetic Orbital model, that explains all four of these phenomena. Monitoring of ${\sim}8000$ blazars by the Simons Observatory over the next decade should provide a large number of SMBHB candidates that will shed light on the nature of the nanohertz gravitational-wave background.</description>

      <title>DARKSKIES: A suite of super-sampled zoom-in simulations of galaxy clusters with self-interacting dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19842v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the "DARKSKIES" suite of one hundred, zoom-in hydrodynamic simulations of massive ($M_{200}&gt;5\times10^{14}{\rm M}_\odot)$ galaxy clusters with self-interacting dark matter (SIDM). We super-sample the simulations such that $m_{\rm DM}/m_{\rm gas}\sim0.1$, enabling us to simulate a dark matter particle mass of $m=0.68\times10^{8}M_\odot$ an order of magnitude faster, whilst exploring SIDM in the core of clusters at extremely high resolution. We calibrate the baryonic feedback to produce observationally consistent and realistic galaxy clusters across all simulations and simulate five models of velocity-independent SIDM targeting the expected sensitivity of future telescopes - $\sigma_{\rm DM}/m=0.,0.01,0.05,0.1,0.2$ cm$^2$/g. We find the density profiles exhibit the characteristic core even in the smallest of cross-sections, with cores developing only at late times ($z&lt;0.5$). We investigate the dynamics of the brightest cluster galaxy inside the dark matter halo and find in SIDM cosmologies there exists a so-called wobbling not observed in collisionless dark matter. We find this wobble is driven by accreting mass on to a cored density profile with the signal peaking at $z=0.25$ and dropping thereafter. This finding is further supported by the existence of an anti-correlation between the offset between the BCG and the dark matter halo and its relative velocity in SIDM only, a hallmark of harmonic oscillation.</description>
