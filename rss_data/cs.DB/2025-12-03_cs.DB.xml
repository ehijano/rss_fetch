      <title>FCDB (Functorial-Categorical Database): A Compositional Framework for Information Preservation and Anti-Commutativity Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional database architectures often secure local consistency by discarding information, entangling correctness with loss. We introduce the Functorial-Categorical Database (FCDb), which models data operations as morphisms in a layered functor category and establishes a Complete Preserving Family (CPF) of projections spanning content invariance (CAS), capability, and ownership, with optional observational projections for local order (B+Tree), temporal history (append-only/LSM), and adjacency (Graph). We identify a minimal kernel (F_core = Own o Cap o CAS) that preserves information and collapses non-commutativity to the ethical grant/revoke boundary. Under adjoint lifts and a fibred structure, operational pairs commute in the categorical limit while ownership integrity and capability constraints are maintained. The framework connects to information geometry via projection interpretations and supports empirical validation without discarding semantic, temporal, or relational entropy.</description>

      <title>Trinity: Disaggregating Vector Search from Prefill-Decode Disaggregation in LLM Serving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prefill and decode (PD) disaggregation separates prompt prefill and token-by-token decode stages into distinct GPU pools and has become the dominant architecture for large-scale LLM serving in industry. Also, retrieval tasks via vector search remains entangled with the model inference process, like heterogeneous RAG requests and prompt answer caches, inflating tail latency. We are motivated to investigate how vector search should be orchestrated along with PD disaggregation with a dedicated deployment architecture without violating SLOs in various retrieval workloads. We present Trinity, a practical framework that consolidates all retrieval into a single, shared vector-search GPU pool and make it work with PD disaggregated LLM serving in match. Trinity introduces (1) a novel architecture for deploying GPU-based vector search service in PD disaggregation. (2) Continuous batching for vector search that make full used of GPUs under heterogeneous queries; (3) Stage-aware scheduling that preempts vector search requests between both decode and prefill tasks.</description>

      <title>Multi-Objective Agentic Rewrites for Unstructured Data Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One year ago, we open-sourced DocETL, a declarative system for LLM-powered data processing that, as of November 2025, has 3.2K GitHub stars and users across domains (e.g., journalism, law, medicine, policy, finance, and urban planning). In DocETL, users build pipelines by composing operators described in natural language, also known as semantic operators, with an LLM executing each operator's logic. However, due to complexity in the operator or the data it operates on, LLMs often give inaccurate results. To address this challenge, DocETL introduced rewrite directives, or abstract rules that guide LLM agents in rewriting pipelines by decomposing operators or data. For example, decomposing a single filter("is this email sent from an executive and discussing fraud?") into the conjunction of two separate semantic filters may improve accuracy. However, DocETL only optimizes for accuracy, not cost. How do we optimize for both?
  We present MOAR (Multi-Objective Agentic Rewrites), a new optimizer for DocETL. To target cost optimization, we introduce two new categories of directives and extend all three existing categories with new ones, bringing the total to over 30 directives -- more than doubling what DocETL originally had. Moreover, since operators can interact with each other unpredictably due to LLM behavior, optimizing operators or sub-pipelines individually can yield suboptimal overall plans. Recognizing this, we design a new global search algorithm that explores rewrites in the context of entire pipelines. Since the space of rewrites is infinite -- pipelines can be rewritten in many ways, and each rewritten pipeline can itself be rewritten -- our algorithm adapts a multi-armed bandit framework to prioritize which pipelines to rewrite. Across six workloads, MOAR achieves 27% higher accuracy than ABACUS, the next-best optimizer, while matching its best accuracy at 55% of its cost.</description>

      <title>QJoin: Transformation-aware Joinable Data Discovery Using Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discovering which tables in large, heterogeneous repositories can be joined and by what transformations is a central challenge in data integration and data discovery. Traditional join discovery methods are largely designed for equi-joins, which assume that join keys match exactly or nearly so. These techniques, while efficient in clean, well-normalized databases, fail in open or federated settings where identifiers are inconsistently formatted, embedded, or split across multiple columns. Approximate or fuzzy joins alleviate minor string variations but cannot capture systematic transformations. We introduce QJoin, a reinforcement-learning framework that learns and reuses transformation strategies across join tasks. QJoin trains an agent under a uniqueness-aware reward that balances similarity with key distinctiveness, enabling it to explore concise, high-value transformation chains. To accelerate new joins, we introduce two reuse mechanisms: (i) agent transfer, which initializes new policies from pretrained agents, and (ii) transformation reuse, which caches successful operator sequences for similar column clusters. On the AutoJoin Web benchmark (31 table pairs), QJoin achieves an average F1-score of 91.0%. For 19,990 join tasks in NYC+Chicago open datasets, Qjoin reduces runtime by up to 7.4% (13,747 s) by using reusing. These results demonstrate that transformation learning and reuse can make join discovery both more accurate and more efficient.</description>

Abstract: Social science research increasingly demands data-driven insights, yet researchers often face barriers such as lack of technical expertise, inconsistent data formats, and limited access to reliable datasets.Social science research increasingly demands data-driven insights, yet researchers often face barriers such as lack of technical expertise, inconsistent data formats, and limited access to reliable datasets. In this paper, we present a Datalake infrastructure tailored to the needs of interdisciplinary social science research. Our system supports ingestion and integration of diverse data types, automatic provenance and version tracking, role-based access control, and built-in tools for visualization and analysis. We demonstrate the utility of our Datalake using real-world use cases spanning governance, health, and education. A detailed walkthrough of one such use case -- analyzing the relationship between income, education, and infant mortality -- shows how our platform streamlines the research process while maintaining transparency and reproducibility. We argue that such infrastructure can democratize access to advanced data science practices, especially for NGOs, students, and grassroots organizations. The Datalake continues to evolve with plans to support ML pipelines, mobile access, and citizen data feedback mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Stress-Testing Causal Claims via Cardinality Repairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Causal analyses derived from observational data underpin high-stakes decisions in domains such as healthcare, public policy, and economics. Yet such conclusions can be surprisingly fragile: even minor data errors - duplicate records, or entry mistakes - may drastically alter causal relationships. This raises a fundamental question: how robust is a causal claim to small, targeted modifications in the data? Addressing this question is essential for ensuring the reliability, interpretability, and reproducibility of empirical findings. We introduce SubCure, a framework for robustness auditing via cardinality repairs. Given a causal query and a user-specified target range for the estimated effect, SubCure identifies a small set of tuples or subpopulations whose removal shifts the estimate into the desired range. This process not only quantifies the sensitivity of causal conclusions but also pinpoints the specific regions of the data that drive those conclusions. We formalize this problem under both tuple- and pattern-level deletion settings and show both are NP-complete. To scale to large datasets, we develop efficient algorithms that incorporate machine unlearning techniques to incrementally update causal estimates without retraining from scratch. We evaluate SubCure across four real-world datasets covering diverse application domains. In each case, it uncovers compact, high-impact subsets whose removal significantly shifts the causal conclusions, revealing vulnerabilities that traditional methods fail to detect. Our results demonstrate that cardinality repair is a powerful and general-purpose tool for stress-testing causal analyses and guarding against misleading claims rooted in ordinary data imperfections.</description>

      <title>PystachIO: Efficient Distributed GPU Query Processing with PyTorch over Fast Networks &amp; Fast Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The AI hardware boom has led modern data centers to adopt HPC-style architectures centered on distributed, GPU-centric computation. Large GPU clusters interconnected by fast RDMA networks and backed by high-bandwidth NVMe storage enable scalable computation and rapid access to storage-resident data. Tensor computation runtimes (TCRs), such as PyTorch, originally designed for AI workloads, have recently been shown to accelerate analytical workloads. However, prior work has primarily considered settings where the data fits in aggregated GPU memory. In this paper, we systematically study how TCRs can support scalable, distributed query processing for large-scale, storage-resident OLAP workloads. Although TCRs provide abstractions for network and storage I/O, naive use often underutilizes GPU and I/O bandwidth due to insufficient overlap between computation and data movement. As a core contribution, we present PystachIO, a PyTorch-based distributed OLAP engine that combines fast network and storage I/O with key optimizations to maximize GPU, network, and storage utilization. Our evaluation shows up to 3x end-to-end speedups over existing distributed GPU-based query processing approaches.</description>

      <title>From Administrative Chaos to Analytical Cohorts: A Three-Stage Normalisation Pipeline for Longitudinal University Administrative Records</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing use of longitudinal university administrative records in data-driven decision-making often overlooks a critical layer: how raw, inconsistent data are normalised before modelling. This article presents a three-stage normalisation pipeline for a dataset of 24,133 engineering students at a Latin American public university, spanning four decades (1980-2019). The pipeline comprises: (i) N1 CENSAL, harmonising demographics into a single person-level layer; (ii) N1b IDENTITY RESOLUTION, consolidating duplicate identifiers into a canonical ID while preserving an audit trail; and (iii) N1c GEO and SECONDARY-SCHOOL NORMALISATION, which builds reference tables, classifies school types (state national, state provincial, private secular, private religious), and flags irrecoverable cases as DATA_MISSING. The pipeline preserves 100% of students, achieves full geocoding, and yields valid school types for 56.6% of the population. The remaining 43.4% are identified as structurally missing due to legacy enrolment practices rather than stochastic non-response. Forensic analysis (chi-square, logistic regression) shows missingness is highly predictable from entry decade and geography, confirming a structural, historically induced mechanism. The article contributes: (a) a transparent, reproducible normalisation pipeline tailored to higher education; (b) a framework for treating structurally missing information without speculative imputation; and (c) guidance on defining analytically coherent cohorts (full population vs. secondary-school-informed subcohorts) for downstream learning analytics and policy evaluation.</description>

      <title>UniCom: Towards a Unified and Cohesiveness-aware Framework for Community Search and Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Searching and detecting communities in real-world graphs underpins a wide range of applications. Despite the success achieved, current learning-based solutions regard community search, i.e., locating the best community for a given query, and community detection, i.e., partitioning the whole graph, as separate problems, necessitating task- and dataset-specific retraining. Such a strategy limits the applicability and generalization ability of the existing models. Additionally, these methods rely heavily on information from the target dataset, leading to suboptimal performance when supervision is limited or unavailable. To mitigate this limitation, we propose UniCom, a unified framework to solve both community search and detection tasks through knowledge transfer across multiple domains, thus alleviating the limitations of single-dataset learning. UniCom centers on a Domain-aware Specialization (DAS) procedure that adapts on the fly to unseen graphs or tasks, eliminating costly retraining while maintaining framework compactness with a lightweight prompt-based paradigm. This is empowered by a Universal Graph Learning (UGL) backbone, which distills transferable semantic and topological knowledge from multiple source domains via comprehensive pre-training. Both DAS and UGL are informed by local neighborhood signals and cohesive subgraph structures, providing consistent guidance throughout the framework. Extensive experiments on both tasks across 16 benchmark datasets and 22 baselines have been conducted to ensure a comprehensive and fair evaluation. UniCom consistently outperforms all state-of-the-art baselines across all tasks under settings with scarce or no supervision, while maintaining runtime efficiency.</description>

      <title>Data-Semantics-Aware Recommendation of Diverse Pivot Tables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06171v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data summarization is essential to discover insights from large datasets. In a spreadsheets, pivot tables offer a convenient way to summarize tabular data by computing aggregates over some attributes, grouped by others. However, identifying attribute combinations that will result in useful pivot tables remains a challenge, especially for high-dimensional datasets. We formalize the problem of automatically recommending insightful and interpretable pivot tables, eliminating the tedious manual process. A crucial aspect of recommending a set of pivot tables is to diversify them. Traditional works inadequately address the table-diversification problem, which leads us to consider the problem of pivot table diversification.
  We present SAGE, a data-semantics-aware system for recommending k-budgeted diverse pivot tables, overcoming the shortcomings of prior work for top-k recommendations that cause redundancy. SAGE ensures that each pivot table is insightful, interpretable, and adaptive to the user's actions and preferences, while also guaranteeing that the set of pivot tables are different from each other, offering a diverse recommendation. We make two key technical contributions: (1) a data-semantics-aware model to measure the utility of a single pivot table and the diversity of a set of pivot tables, and (2) a scalable greedy algorithm that can efficiently select a set of diverse pivot tables of high utility, by leveraging data semantics to significantly reduce the combinatorial search space. Our extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show that SAGE outperforms alternative approaches, and efficiently scales to accommodate high-dimensional datasets. Additionally, we present several case studies to highlight SAGE's qualitative effectiveness over commercial software and Large Language Models (LLMs).</description>

      <title>SQLBarber: A System Leveraging Large Language Models to Generate Customized and Realistic SQL Workloads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06192v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Database research and development often require a large number of SQL queries for benchmarking purposes. However, acquiring real-world SQL queries is challenging due to privacy concerns, and existing SQL generation methods are limited in customization and in satisfying realistic constraints. To address this issue, we present SQLBarber, a system based on Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate customized and realistic SQL workloads. SQLBarber (i) eliminates the need for users to manually craft SQL templates in advance, while providing the flexibility to accept natural language specifications to constrain SQL templates, (ii) scales efficiently to generate large volumes of queries matching any user-defined cost distribution (e.g., cardinality and execution plan cost), and (iii) uses execution statistics from Amazon Redshift and Snowflake to derive SQL template specifications and query cost distributions that reflect real-world query characteristics. SQLBarber introduces (i) a declarative interface for users to effortlessly generate customized SQL templates, (ii) an LLM-powered pipeline augmented with a self-correction module that profiles, refines, and prunes SQL templates based on query costs, and (iii) a Bayesian Optimizer to efficiently explore different predicate values and identify a set of queries that satisfy the target cost distribution. We construct and open-source ten benchmarks of varying difficulty levels and target query cost distributions based on real-world statistics from Snowflake and Amazon Redshift. Extensive experiments on these benchmarks show that SQLBarber is the only system that can generate customized SQL templates. It reduces query generation time by one to three orders of magnitude, and significantly improves alignment with the target cost distribution, compared with existing methods.</description>
