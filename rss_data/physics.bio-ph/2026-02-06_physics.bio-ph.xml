      <title>Auditory frequency analysis as an active dissipative process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An active dissipative process organizes auditory frequency analysis in the mammalian cochlea. A minimal active beam model reveals that a spatially varying viscous coupling operator, $\partial_{xx}\kappa\partial_{xx}$, generates dissipative forces with wave--like propagation. Local energy injection and spatial redistribution compete to govern the dynamics. This balance enables the quantitative reproduction of four key features: sharp tuning, high gain, compression, and spontaneous otoacoustic emissions. Hearing thereby belongs to a broad class of nonequilibrium pattern-forming systems.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneity dominates irreversibility in random Markov models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a two-parameter ensemble of random discrete-time Markov models that simultaneously captures critical slowing down and broken detailed balance. Extending a previously studied heterogeneous Markov ensemble, we incorporate correlations between forward and backward transition rates through a single asymmetry parameter $\gamma$, while heterogeneity is controlled by $\epsilon$. Using results from random matrix theory, we identify a critical locus $\epsilon_c(\gamma,N)$ at which relaxation times diverge and spectral universality breaks down. We characterize the behavior of entropy production, predictive information, and relaxation dynamics across the ensemble, showing that many observables depend strongly on heterogeneity but only weakly on asymmetry, except near the symmetric limit. Applying maximum-likelihood inference to human fMRI and EEG data, we find that both modalities operate near the predicted critical locus and occupy a similar region of the $\epsilon-\gamma$ plane, supporting a super-universality of human brain dynamics. While ensemble averages are well captured by the null model, empirical data exhibit substantially enhanced variability, indicating subject-specific structure beyond random expectations. Our results unify criticality and nonequilibrium measures within a single framework and clarify their intertwined role in the analysis of complex biological dynamics.</description>

      <title>Metastability and ripening of multi-component liquid mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how multi-component liquid mixtures undergo phase separation is central to elucidating biophysical organization in the cell. Here, combining analytical and numerical results, we characterise the dynamics of mixtures with disordered interactions among the components. We first study how two coexisting phases become unstable, leading to multiphase coexistence. We then show that the scaling of droplet radius as $t^{1/3}$ and droplet number as $n^{-2/3}$, characteristic of Ostwald ripening in two dimensions, can be severely delayed. This delay arises from glass-like relaxation and the emergence of long-lived metastable states characterized by different wetting angles.</description>

      <title>Controlling tissue size by active fracture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03126v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Groups of cells, including clusters of cancerous cells, multicellular organisms, and developing organs, may both grow and break apart. What physical factors control these fractures? In these processes, what sets the eventual size of clusters? We first develop a one-dimensional framework for understanding cell clusters that can fragment due to cell motility using an active particle model. We compute analytically how the break rate of cell-cell junctions depends on cell speed, cell persistence, and cell-cell junction properties. Next, we find the cluster size distributions, which differ depending on whether all cells can divide or only the cells on the edge of the cluster divide. Cluster size distributions depend solely on the ratio of the break rate to the growth rate - allowing us to predict how cluster size and variability depend on cell motility and cell-cell mechanics. Our results suggest that organisms can achieve better size control when cell division is restricted to the cluster boundaries or when fracture can be localized to the cluster center. Additionally, we derive a universal survival probability for an intact cluster $S(t)=\mathrm{e}^{-k_d t}$ at steady state if all cells can divide, which is independent of the rupture kinetics and depends solely on the cell division rate $k_d$. Finally, we further corroborate the one-dimensional analytics with two-dimensional simulations, finding quantitative agreement with some - but not all - elements of the theory across a wide range of cell motility. Our results link the general physics problem of a collective active escape over a barrier to size control, providing a quantitative measure of how motility can regulate organ or organism size.</description>

      <title>V-Reactor Dynamics: Dual Chaotic Systems and Synchronizing Human Defenses with Viral Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03655v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic exposed critical gaps in our ability to predict viral emergence and trajectory. Moving beyond sequence-dependent surveillance, we introduce V-Reactor Dynamics, a physics-based framework that models host-virus interaction as a synchronized dual chaotic system. At its core is the reactivity parameter ($\rho$), a measurable quantity derived from viral replication, immune neutralization, and drug interaction cross sections. We show that $\rho$ dictates both intra-host viral load phases, peak ($\rho&gt;0$), plateau ($\rho\approx0$), and clearance ($\rho&lt;0$), and, through a scaling law, the Lyapunov Exponent governing population-level transmission dynamics. Retrospectively, the model correctly differentiates SARS-CoV-2's higher transmissibility from SARS-CoV's lethality, accurately forecasts Omicron waves, and quantifies trade-offs between lockdown intensity and socioeconomic cost. Crucially, V-Dynamics enables pre-outbreak prediction via in vitro measurement of viral reaction cross sections, offering a pathway to proactive pandemic defense. By integrating quantum-mechanical interaction models with chaos theory across scales, this framework provides a quantitative roadmap for anticipating, controlling, and ultimately preempting future viral threats.</description>
