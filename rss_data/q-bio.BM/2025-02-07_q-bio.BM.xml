      <title>Artificial Intelligence Approaches for Anti-Addiction Drug Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Drug addiction is a complex and pervasive global challenge that continues to pose significant public health concerns. Traditional approaches to anti-addiction drug discovery have struggled to deliver effective therapeutics, facing high attrition rates, long development timelines, and inefficiencies in processing large-scale data. Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative solution to address these issues. Using advanced algorithms, AI is revolutionizing drug discovery by enhancing the speed and precision of key processes. This review explores the transformative role of AI in the pipeline for anti-addiction drug discovery, including data collection, target identification, and compound optimization. By highlighting the potential of AI to overcome traditional barriers, this review systematically examines how AI addresses critical gaps in anti-addiction research, emphasizing its potential to revolutionize drug discovery and development, overcome challenges, and advance more effective therapeutic strategies.</description>

      <title>Frustration In Physiology And Molecular Medicine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecules provide the ultimate language in terms of which physiology and pathology must be understood. Myriads of proteins participate in elaborate networks of interactions and perform chemical activities coordinating the life of cells. To perform these often amazing tasks, proteins must move and we must think of them as dynamic ensembles of three dimensional structures formed first by folding the polypeptide chains so as to minimize the conflicts between the interactions of their constituent amino acids. It is apparent however that, even when completely folded, not all conflicting interactions have been resolved so the structure remains "locally frustrated". Over the last decades it has become clearer that this local frustration is not just a random accident but plays an essential part of the inner workings of protein molecules. We will review here the physical origins of the frustration concept and review evidence that local frustration is important for protein physiology, protein-protein recognition, catalysis and allostery. Also, we highlight examples showing how alterations in the local frustration patterns can be linked to distinct pathologies. Finally we explore the extensions of the impact of frustration in higher order levels of organization of systems including gene regulatory networks and the neural networks of the brain.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Role of Molecular Dynamics Simulations in Most Recent Cancer Research: Insights into Treatment Strategies</title>

Abstract: Cancer is a complex disease that is characterized by uncontrolled growth and division of cells. It involves a complex interplay between genetic and environmental factors that lead to the initiation and progression of tumors. Recent advances in molecular dynamics simulations have revolutionized our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying cancer initiation and progression. Molecular dynamics simulations enable researchers to study the behavior of biomolecules at an atomic level, providing insights into the dynamics and interactions of proteins, nucleic acids, and other molecules involved in cancer development. In this review paper, we provide an overview of the latest advances in molecular dynamics simulations of cancer cells. We will discuss the principles of molecular dynamics simulations and their applications in cancer research. We also explore the role of molecular dynamics simulations in understanding the interactions between cancer cells and their microenvironment, including signaling pathways, proteinprotein interactions, and other molecular processes involved in tumor initiation and progression. In addition, we highlight the current challenges and opportunities in this field and discuss the potential for developing more accurate and personalized simulations. Overall, this review paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of molecular dynamics simulations in cancer research, with a focus on the molecular mechanisms underlying cancer initiation and progression.</description>

      <title>GOProteinGNN: Leveraging Protein Knowledge Graphs for Protein Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00057v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Proteins play a vital role in biological processes and are indispensable for living organisms. Accurate representation of proteins is crucial, especially in drug development. Recently, there has been a notable increase in interest in utilizing machine learning and deep learning techniques for unsupervised learning of protein representations. However, these approaches often focus solely on the amino acid sequence of proteins and lack factual knowledge about proteins and their interactions, thus limiting their performance. In this study, we present GOProteinGNN, a novel architecture that enhances protein language models by integrating protein knowledge graph information during the creation of amino acid level representations. Our approach allows for the integration of information at both the individual amino acid level and the entire protein level, enabling a comprehensive and effective learning process through graph-based learning. By doing so, we can capture complex relationships and dependencies between proteins and their functional annotations, resulting in more robust and contextually enriched protein representations. Unlike previous methods, GOProteinGNN uniquely learns the entire protein knowledge graph during training, which allows it to capture broader relational nuances and dependencies beyond mere triplets as done in previous work. We perform a comprehensive evaluation on several downstream tasks demonstrating that GOProteinGNN consistently outperforms previous methods, showcasing its effectiveness and establishing it as a state-of-the-art solution for protein representation learning.</description>

      <title>MOL-Mamba: Enhancing Molecular Representation with Structural &amp; Electronic Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16483v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Molecular representation learning plays a crucial role in various downstream tasks, such as molecular property prediction and drug design. To accurately represent molecules, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Graph Transformers (GTs) have shown potential in the realm of self-supervised pretraining. However, existing approaches often overlook the relationship between molecular structure and electronic information, as well as the internal semantic reasoning within molecules. This omission of fundamental chemical knowledge in graph semantics leads to incomplete molecular representations, missing the integration of structural and electronic data. To address these issues, we introduce MOL-Mamba, a framework that enhances molecular representation by combining structural and electronic insights. MOL-Mamba consists of an Atom &amp; Fragment Mamba-Graph (MG) for hierarchical structural reasoning and a Mamba-Transformer (MT) fuser for integrating molecular structure and electronic correlation learning. Additionally, we propose a Structural Distribution Collaborative Training and E-semantic Fusion Training framework to further enhance molecular representation learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MOL-Mamba outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across eleven chemical-biological molecular datasets.</description>
