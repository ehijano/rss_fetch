      <title>Key Science Goals for the Next Generation Very Large Array (ngVLA): Update from the ngVLA Science Advisory Council (2024)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2017, the next generation Very Large Array (ngVLA) Science Advisory Council, together with the international astronomy community, developed a set of five Key Science Goals (KSGs) to inform, prioritize and refine the technical capabilities of a future radio telescope array for high angular resolution operation from 1.2 - 116 GHz with 10 times the sensitivity of the Jansky VLA and ALMA. The resulting KSGs, which require observations at centimeter and millimeter wavelengths that cannot be achieved by any other facility, represent a small subset of the broad range of astrophysical problems that the ngVLA will be able address. This document presents an update to the original ngVLA KSGs, taking account of new results and progress in the 7+ years since their initial presentation, again drawing on the expertise of the ngVLA Science Advisory Council and the broader community in the ngVLA Science Working Groups. As the design of the ngVLA has also matured substantially in this period, this document also briefly addresses initial expectations for ngVLA data products and processing that will be needed to achieve the KSGs. The original ngVLA KSGs endure as outstanding problems of high priority. In brief, they are: (1) Unveiling the Formation of Solar System Analogues; (2) Probing the Initial Conditions for Planetary Systems and Life with Astrochemistry; (3) Charting the Assembly, Structure, and Evolution of Galaxies from the First Billion Years to the Present; (4) Science at the Extremes: Pulsars as Laboratories for Fundamental Physics; (5) Understanding the Formation and Evolution of Stellar and Supermassive Black Holes in the Era of Multi-Messenger Astronomy.</description>

      <title>$\chi^2$ from Redundant Calibration as a Tool in the Detection of Faint Radio-frequency Interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio-frequency interference detection and flagging is one of the most difficult and urgent problems in 21 cm Epoch of Reionization research. In this work, we present $\chi^2$ from redundant calibration as a novel method for RFI detection and flagging, demonstrating it to be complementary to current state-of-the-art flagging algorithms. Beginning with a brief overview of redundant calibration and the meaning of the $\chi^2$ metric, we demonstrate a two-step RFI flagging algorithm which uses the values of this metric to detect faint RFI. We find that roughly 27.4\% of observations have RFI from digital television channel 7 detected by at least one algorithm of the three tested: 18.0\% of observations are flagged by the novel $\chi^2$ algorithm, 16.5\% are flagged by SSINS, and 6.8\% are flagged by AOFlagger (there is significant overlap in these percentages). Of the 27.4\% of observations with detected DTV channel 7 RFI, 37.1\% (10.2\% of the total observations) are detected by $\chi^2$ alone, and not by either SSINS or AOFlagger, demonstrating a significant population of as-yet undetected RFI. We find that $\chi^2$ is able to detect RFI events which remain undetectable to SSINS and AOFlagger, especially in the domain of long-duration, weak RFI from digital television. We also discuss the shortcomings of this approach, and discuss examples of RFI which seems undetectable using $\chi^2$ while being successfully flagged by SSINS and/or AOFlagger.</description>

      <title>Data downlink prioritization using image classification on-board a 6U CubeSat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanosatellites are proliferating as low-cost dedicated sensing systems with lean development cycles. Kyushu Institute of Technology and collaborators have launched a joint venture for a nanosatellite mission, VERTECS. The primary mission is to elucidate the formation history of stars by observing the optical-wavelength cosmic background radiation. The VERTECS satellite will be equipped with a small-aperture telescope and a high-precision attitude control system to capture the cosmic data for analysis on the ground. However, nanosatellites are limited by their onboard memory resources and downlink speed capabilities. Additionally, due to a limited number of ground stations, the satellite mission will face issues meeting the required data budget for mission success. To alleviate this issue, we propose an on-orbit system to autonomously classify and then compress desirable image data for data downlink prioritization and optimization. The system comprises a prototype Camera Controller Board (CCB) which carries a Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 which is used for classification and compression. The system uses a lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify and determine the desirability of captured image data. The model is designed to be lean and robust to reduce the computational and memory load on the satellite. The model is trained and tested on a novel star field dataset consisting of data captured by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The dataset is meant to simulate the expected data produced by the 6U satellite. The compression step implements GZip, RICE or HCOMPRESS compression, which are standards for astronomical data. Preliminary testing on the proposed CNN model results in a classification accuracy of about 100\% on the star field dataset, with compression ratios of 3.99, 5.16 and 5.43 for GZip, RICE and HCOMPRESS that were achieved on tested FITS image data.</description>

      <title>The Fluorescence Camera of the POEMMA-Balloon with Radio (PBR): Design and Scientific goals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The POEMMA-Balloon with Radio (PBR) is a proposed payload to fly on a NASA Super Pressure Balloon (SPB). It will act as a pathfinder of the Probe Of Extreme Multi-Messenger Astrophysics (POEMMA) detector. PBR will consist of an innovative hybrid focal surface featuring a Fluorescence Camera (FC, based on Multi-Anode Photomultiplier Tubes [MAPMTs], 1.05 $\mu$s time resolution) and a Cherenkov Camera (based on SiPMs, 10 ns time resolution), both mounted on the same tiltable frame that can point from nadir up to 13$^\circ$ above the horizon. The FC's main scientific goal is to observe, for the first time, the fluorescence emission of Extensive Air Showers produced by Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Rays from sub-orbital altitudes. This measurement will validate the detection strategy for future space-based missions, such as POEMMA. As a secondary goal, the FC will perform a search for macroscopic dark matter through slowly evolving showers that will leave a signal similar to (but distinct from) a meteor. PBR targets a launch in 2027 as a payload of an ultra-long duration balloon flight with a duration of up to 100 days.</description>

      <title>In-Lab High Resolution Mid-infrared Up-conversion Stellar Interferometer Based on Synthetic Long Base-Line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting mid-infrared (MIR) radiation has significant astronomical applications, although limited by unsatisfactory MIR detectors. Here we reported on the realization of a MIR up-conversion interferometer based on synthetic long base-line (SLBL) in the laboratory. The experimental system consisted of an interferometer and subsequent up-conversion detection part of mid-infrared signal, which streamlined the structure and enhanced the reliability of the system. By using a tungsten filament lamp as an imitated star, we not only achieved the single target angle resolution of 1.10 times 10^(-4) rad, but also obtained the field angle resolution of 3.0 times 10^(-4) rad of double star targets. The angular resolution is in inverse proportion to the length of baseline. The maximum length of simulated baseline in the laboratory is about 3cm. In a Keck Interferometer (KI) liked program, the base line can reach up to 85m leading to a corresponding angular resolution of 3.0 times 10^(-9) rad (about 1.8mas). The study will offer potential benefits in extending the usage of mid-infrared light in astronomical exploration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Satellite constellation interference occurs across astronomical disciplines. We present examples of interference from radio and $\gamma$-Ray astronomy to optical and spectroscopic interference in ground-based and space-borne facilities. In particular, we discuss the impact of artificial satellites on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.), an Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescope, as well as possible mitigation strategies for the European Southern Observatory 4-metre Multi-Object Spectrograph Telescope (ESO 4MOST). Furthermore, we shed light on how ground-based optical telescopes such as the Oukaimeden Observatory contribute to IAU Centre for the Protection of the Dark and Quiet Sky from Satellite Constellation Interference (IAU CPS) efforts that quantify satellite brightness.</description>

      <title>MADNESS Deblender: Maximum A posteriori with Deep NEural networks for Source Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the unprecedented depth of the upcoming ground-based Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) at the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, approximately two-thirds of the galaxies are likely to be affected by blending - the overlap of physically separated galaxies in images. Thus, extracting reliable shapes and photometry from individual objects will be limited by our ability to correct blending and control any residual systematic effect. Deblending algorithms tackle this issue by reconstructing the isolated components from a blended scene, but the most commonly used algorithms often fail to model complex realistic galaxy morphologies.
  As part of an effort to address this major challenge, we present MADNESS, which takes a data-driven approach and combines pixel-level multi-band information to learn complex priors for obtaining the maximum a posteriori solution of deblending. MADNESS is based on deep neural network architectures such as variational auto-encoders and normalizing flows. The variational auto-encoder reduces the high-dimensional pixel space into a lower-dimensional space, while the normalizing flow models a data-driven prior in this latent space.
  Using a simulated test dataset with galaxy models for a 10-year LSST survey and a galaxy density ranging from 48 to 80 galaxies per arcmin2 we characterize the aperture-photometry g-r color, structural similarity index, and pixel cosine similarity of the galaxies reconstructed by MADNESS. We compare our results against state-of-the-art deblenders including scarlet. With the r-band of LSST as an example, we show that MADNESS performs better than in all the metrics. For instance, the average absolute value of relative flux residual in the r-band for MADNESS is approximately 29% lower than that of scarlet. The code is publicly available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Photometric Redshifts Probability Density Estimation from Recurrent Neural Networks in the DECam Local Volume Exploration Survey Data Release 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photometric wide-field surveys are imaging the sky in unprecedented detail. These surveys face a significant challenge in efficiently estimating galactic photometric redshifts while accurately quantifying associated uncertainties. In this work, we address this challenge by exploring the estimation of Probability Density Functions (PDFs) for the photometric redshifts of galaxies across a vast area of 17,000 square degrees, encompassing objects with a median 5$\sigma$ point-source depth of $g$ = 24.3, $r$ = 23.9, $i$ = 23.5, and $z$ = 22.8 mag. Our approach uses deep learning, specifically integrating a Recurrent Neural Network architecture with a Mixture Density Network, to leverage magnitudes and colors as input features for constructing photometric redshift PDFs across the whole DECam Local Volume Exploration (DELVE) survey sky footprint. Subsequently, we rigorously evaluate the reliability and robustness of our estimation methodology, gauging its performance against other well-established machine learning methods to ensure the quality of our redshift estimations. Our best results constrain photometric redshifts with the bias of $-0.0013$, a scatter of $0.0293$, and an outlier fraction of $5.1\%$. These point estimates are accompanied by well-calibrated PDFs evaluated using diagnostic tools such as Probability Integral Transform and Odds distribution. We also address the problem of the accessibility of PDFs in terms of disk space storage and the time demand required to generate their corresponding parameters. We present a novel Autoencoder model that reduces the size of PDF parameter arrays to one-sixth of their original length, significantly decreasing the time required for PDF generation to one-eighth of the time needed when generating PDFs directly from the magnitudes.</description>

      <title>Discontinuous Galerkin finite element method for the continuum radiative transfer problem inside axis-symmetric circumstellar envelopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of the continuum radiative transfer problem inside circumstellar envelopes is both a theoretical and numerical challenge, especially in the frequency-dependent and multi-dimensional case. While approximate methods are easier to handle numerically, they often fail to accurately describe the radiation field inside complex geometries. For these cases, it is necessary to directly solve numerically the radiative transfer equation. We investigate the accuracy of a discontinuous Galerkin finite element method (DGFEM hereafter) applied to the frequency-dependent two dimensional radiative transfer equation, coupled with the radiative equilibrium equation, inside axis-symmetric circumstellar envelopes. The DGFEM is a variant of finite element methods. It employs discontinuous elements and flux integrals along their boundaries, ensuring local conservation. However, as opposed to the classical finite-element methods, the solution is discontinuous across element edges. We implemented the method in a code and tested its accuracy by comparing our results with the benchmarks from the literature. For all the tested cases, the temperature profile agrees within one percent. Additionally, the emerging spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and images, obtained subsequently by ray-tracing techniques from the DGFEM solution, agree on average within $5~\mathrm{\%}$ and $10~\mathrm{\%}$, respectively. We show that the DGFEM can accurately describe the temperature profile inside axis-symmetric circumstellar envelopes. Consecutively the emerging SEDs and images are also well reproduced. The discontinuous Galerkin finite element method provides an alternative method (other than Monte Carlo methods for instance) for solving the radiative transfer equation, and could be used in cases that are more difficult to handle with the other methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an overview of the operations and engineering interface for Planetary Radio Interferometry and Doppler Experiment (PRIDE) radio astronomy observations as a scientific component of the ESA s Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE) mission, as well as other prospective planetary and space science missions. The article discusses advanced scheduling and planning methods that make it possible to create observing schedules for observations of specific spacecraft in concurrence with observations of natural radio sources. In order to put this into practice and find suitable natural background calibrator sources for PRIDE of JUICE mission, we developed planning and scheduling software. The conventional scheduling software for natural celestial radio sources is not set up to include spacecraft as observation targets in the necessary control files. Therefore, difficulties already arise during observation planning. We report on the development of new and the adaptation of existing routines used in astrophysical and geodetic VLBI for satellite scheduling and planning. The analysis of the PRIDE science observations led to improved observational planning, and the mission s scheduling methodologies were studied using a systems engineering approach. In addition, we highlighted the new procedures, like finding charts for selecting calibrator radio sources over a range of frequency bands and the outcomes of those strategies for science operation planning. A simulation of the flyby of Venus during the cruise phase of the JUICE spacecraft, based on the Tudat software, is also presented, resulting in a promising opportunity to test PRIDE techniques and evaluate the improvements that PRIDE observables can make to natural bodies ephemerides.</description>

      <title>Time-delay interferometry with onboard optical delays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20196v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time-delay interferometry (TDI) is a data processing technique for space-based gravitational-wave detectors to create laser-noise-free equal-optical-path-length interferometers virtually on the ground. It relies on the interspacecraft signal propagation delays, which are delivered by intersatellite ranging monitors. Also delays due to onboard signal propagation and processing have a nonnegligible impact on the TDI combinations. However, these onboard delays were only partially considered in previous TDI-related research; onboard optical path lengths have been neglected so far. In this paper, we study onboard optical path lengths in TDI. We derive analytical models for their coupling to the second-generation TDI Michelson combinations and verify these models numerically. Furthermore, we derive a compensation scheme for onboard optical path lengths in TDI and validate its performance via numerical simulations.</description>
