      <title>A new approach to strong convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A family of random matrices $\boldsymbol{X}^N=(X_1^N,\ldots,X_d^N)$ converges strongly to a family $\boldsymbol{x}=(x_1,\ldots,x_d)$ in a $C^*$-algebra if $\|P(\boldsymbol{X}^N)\|\to\|P(\boldsymbol{x})\|$ for every noncommutative polynomial $P$. This phenomenon plays a central role in several recent breakthrough results on random graphs, geometry, and operator algebras. However, strong convergence is notoriously difficult to prove and has generally required delicate problem-specific methods.
  In this paper, we develop a new approach to strong convergence that uses only soft arguments. Our method exploits the fact that for many natural models, the expected trace of $P(\boldsymbol{X}^N)$ is a rational function of $\frac{1}{N}$ whose lowest order asymptotics are easily understood. We develop a general technique to deduce strong convergence directly from these inputs using the inequality of A. and V. Markov for univariate polynomials and elementary Fourier analysis. To illustrate the method, we develop the following applications.
  1. We give a short proof of the result of Friedman that random regular graphs have a near-optimal spectral gap, and obtain a detailed understanding of the large deviations probabilities of the second eigenvalue.
  2. We prove a strong quantitative form of the strong convergence property of random permutation matrices due to Bordenave and Collins.
  3. We extend the above to any stable representation of the symmetric group, providing many new examples of the strong convergence phenomenon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the weakly asymmetric simple exclusion process on the integer lattice. Under suitable constraints on the strength of the weak asymmetry of the dynamics, we prove moderate deviation principles for the fluctuation fields when the process starts from stationary measures. As an application, we obtain sample path moderate deviation principles for the occupation time of the process in one dimension.</description>

      <title>On the rate of convergence in the Hall-Janson coverage theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a spherical Poisson Boolean model $Z$ in Euclidean $d$-space with $d \geq 2$, with Poisson intensity $t$ and radii distributed like $rY$ with $r \geq 0$ a scaling parameter and $Y$ a fixed nonnegative random variable with finite $(2d)$-th moment. Let $A \subset {\bf R}^d$ be compact with a nice boundary. Let $\alpha $ be the expected volume of a ball of radius $Y$, and suppose $r=r(t)$ is chosen so that $\alpha t r^d - \log t - (d-1) \log \log t$ is a constant indepenent of $t$. A classical result of Hall and of Janson determines the (non-trivial) large-$t$ limit of the probability that $A$ is fully covered by $Z$. In this paper we provide an $O((\log \log t)/\log t)$ bound on the rate of convergence in that result. With a slight adjustment to $r(t)$, this can be improved to $O(1/\log t)$.</description>

      <title>Self-Decomposable Laws Associated with General Tempered Stable (GTS) Distribution and their Simulation Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper describes the self-decomposable distribution and the background driving L\'evy process (BDLP) associated with the Generalized Tempered Stable (GTS) distribution. Two distributions are provided: the background driving L\'evy process (BDLP) of the GTS distribution and the self-decomposable distribution generated by the GTS distribution as BDLP. The derived self-decomposable distribution and the GTS distribution are used as stationary distribution in the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck type process. A simulation method, based on sampling the random integral representation, is applied to mimic S&amp;P 500 Index and Bitcoin daily cumulative return process.</description>

      <title>A probabilistic approach to continuous differentiability of optimal stopping boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain the first probabilistic proof of continuous differentiability of time-dependent optimal boundaries in optimal stopping problems. The underlying stochastic dynamics is a one-dimensional, time-inhomogeneous diffusion. The gain function is also time-inhomogeneous and not necessarily smooth. Moreover, we include state-dependent discount rate and the time-horizon can be either finite or infinite. Our arguments of proof are of a local nature that allows us to obtain the result under more general conditions than those used in the PDE literature. As a byproduct of our main result we also obtain the first probabilistic proof of the link between the value function of an optimal stopping problem and the solution of the Stefan's problem.</description>

      <title>One-dimensional SRBM with discontinuous state-dependent drift and variance and its stationary distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A semi-martingale reflecting Brownian motion is a popular process for diffusion approximations of queueing models including their networks. In this paper, we are concerned with the case that it lives on nonnegative half-line but the variance and drift of its Brownian component discontinuously change depending on its position. This reflecting diffusion process naturally arises from a state-dependent single server queue, studied by the author, and our main interest is in its stationary distribution, which is important for application. However, even the existence of such a reflecting diffusion process seems to be never considered because the discontinuous changes of the variance and drift are exceptional in stochastic analysis for a diffusion process. In this paper, we show that it exists as the weak solution of a stochastic integral equation, and derive its stationary distribution under a stability condition. Our basic tools are the generalized Ito formula for a convex function and local time. Proofs are rather elementary once it is understood how to use the Ito formula and local time.</description>

      <title>Concentration and fluctuation phenomena in the localized phase of the pinning model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit and expand the analysis in [15] of the localized phase of disordered pinning models. The arguments are developed for i.i.d. site disorder on which we assume only that the moment generating function is bounded in a neighborhood of the origin. Quantitative $C^\infty$ estimates on the free energy density are established, showing in particular that the regularity class is at least Gevrey-3. After explaining how a quenched concentration bound and the quenched Central Limit Theorem (CLT) on the number of the pinned sites, i.e., the contact number, can be extracted from the regularity estimates on the free energy, we establish a quenched Local CLT for the same quantity. The centering in these CLTs is random in the sense that it is disorder dependent and a concentration bound and the CLT are established also for the centering sequence, as well as a Hardy-Littlewood random walk type-estimate for its fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Solving marginals of the LDP for the directed landscape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the upper-tail Large Deviation Principle (LDP) for the parabolic Airy process and characterize the limit shape of the directed landscape under the upper-tail conditioning. The LDP result answers Conjecture 10.1 in Das, Dauvergne, and Vir\'{a}g (2024). The starting point of our proof is the metric-level LDP for the directed landscape from Das, Dauvergne, and Vir\'{a}g (2024) that reduces our work to solving a variational problem. Our proof is PDE-based and uses geometric arguments, connecting the variational problem to the weak solutions of Burgers' equation. Further, our method may generalize to the setting of the upper-tail LDP for the KPZ fixed point under the multi-wedge initial data, and we prove a decomposition result in this direction.</description>

      <title>Renormalized stochastic pressure equation with log-correlated Gaussian coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study periodic solutions to the following divergence-form stochastic partial differential equation with Wick-renormalized gradient on the $d$-dimensional flat torus $\mathbb{T}^d$,
  \[
  -\nabla\cdot\left(e^{\diamond (- \beta X) }\diamond\nabla U\right)=\nabla \cdot (e^{\diamond (- \beta X)} \diamond \mathbf{F}),
  \] where $X$ is the log-correlated Gaussian field, $\mathbf{F}$ is a random vector and $\diamond$ denotes the Wick product. The problem is a variant of the stochastic pressure equation, in which $U$ is modeling the pressure of a creeping water-flow in crustal rock that occurs in enhanced geothermal heating. In the original model, the Wick exponential term $e^{\diamond(-\beta X)}$ is modeling the random permeability of the rock. The porosity field is given by a log-correlated Gaussian random field $\beta X$, where $\beta&lt;\sqrt{d}$. We use elliptic regularity theory in order to define a notion of a solution to this (a priori very ill-posed) problem, via modifying the $S$-transform from Gaussian white noise analysis, and then establish the existence and uniqueness of solutions. Moreover, we show that the solution to the problem can be expressed in terms of the Gaussian multiplicative chaos measure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the asymptotics of the expected Wasserstein distance between the empirical measure of a Determinantal Point Process and the background volume form. The main DPP studied is the harmonic ensemble, where we get the optimal rate of convergence for homogeneous manifolds of dimension $d\geq 3$, and for two-point homogeneous manifolds. We also discuss some variations of this process on the torus.</description>

      <title>Large deviations for the maximum and reversed order statistics of Weibull-like variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by metastability in the zero-range process, we consider i.i.d.\ random variables with values in $\N_0$ and Weibull-like (stretched exponential) law $\mathbb P(X_i =k) = c \exp( - k^\alpha)$, $\alpha \in (0,1)$. We condition on large values of the sum $S_n= \mu n + s n^\gamma$ and prove large deviation principles for the rescaled maximum $M_n /n^\gamma$ and for the reversed order statistics. The scale is $n^\gamma$ with $\gamma = 1/(2-\alpha)$; on that scale, the big-jump principle for heavy-tailed variables and a naive normal approximation for moderate deviations yield bounds of the same order $n^{\gamma \alpha} = n^{2\gamma-1}$, the speed of the large deviation principles. The rate function for $M_n/n^\gamma$ is non-convex and solves a recursive equation similar to a Bellman equation.</description>

      <title>Critical one-arm probability for the metric Gaussian free field in low dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the bond percolation model on transient weighted graphs ${G}$ induced by the excursion sets of the Gaussian free field on the corresponding metric graph. Under the sole assumption that its sign clusters do not percolate, we derive an extension of Lupu's formula for the two-point function at criticality. We then focus on the low-dimensional case $0&lt; \nu &lt; \frac{\alpha}{2}$, where $\alpha$ governs the polynomial volume growth of $G$ and $\nu$ the decay rate of the Green's function on $G$. In particular, this includes the benchmark case ${G}=\mathbb{Z}^3$, for which $\alpha=3$ and $\nu= \alpha-2=1$. We prove under these assumptions that the critical one-arm probability decays with distance $R$ like $R^{-\frac{\nu}{2}}$, up to multiplicative constants.</description>

Abstract: Gradient flows play a substantial role in addressing many machine learning problems. We examine the convergence in continuous-time of a \textit{Fisher-Rao} (Mean-Field Birth-Death) gradient flow in the context of solving convex-concave min-max games with entropy regularization. We propose appropriate Lyapunov functions to demonstrate convergence with explicit rates to the unique mixed Nash equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Graph Random Walk for Time-of-Flight Charge Mobilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a graph random walk (GRW) method for the study of charge transport properties of complex molecular materials in the time-of-flight regime. The molecules forming the material are represented by the vertices of a directed weighted graph, and the charge carriers are random walkers. The edge weights are rates for elementary jumping processes for a charge carrier to move along the edge and are determined from a combination of the energies of the involved vertices and an interaction strength. Exclusions are built into the random walk to account for the Pauli exclusion principle. In time-of-flight experiments, charge carriers are injected into the material and the time until they reach a collecting electrode is recorded. In this setting, our GRW approach allows direct evaluation of the expected hitting time of the collecting nodes in the graph in terms of a typically sparse, linear system, thereby avoiding numerically cumbersome and potentially fluctuations-prone methods based on explicit time evolution from solutions of a high-dimensional system of coupled ordinary differential equations (the Master Equation) or from kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC). We validate the GRW approach by conducting numerical studies of charge dynamics of single and multiple carriers in diffusive and drift-diffusive regimes using a surrogate lattice model. The surrogate model allows varying types and strengths of energetic disorder from the reference baseline. Comparison with results from the Master Equation confirms the theoretical equivalence of both approaches also in numerical implementations. We further show that KMC results show substantial deviations due to inadequate sampling. All in all, we find that the GRW method provides a powerful alternative to the more commonly used methods without sampling issues and with the benefit of making use of sparse matrix methods.</description>

      <title>A hybrid approach to model reduction of Generalized Langevin Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a classical model of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics accounting for non-Markovian effects, which is referred to as the Generalized Langevin Equation in the literature. We derive reduced Markovian descriptions obtained through the neglection of inertial terms and/or heat bath variables. The adopted reduction scheme relies on the framework of the Invariant Manifold method, which allows to retain the slow degrees of freedom from a multiscale dynamical system. Our approach is also rooted on the Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem, which helps preserve the proper dissipative structure of the reduced dynamics. We highlight the appropriate time scalings introduced within our procedure, and also prove the commutativity of selected reduction paths.</description>

      <title>Numerical scheme for delay-type stochastic McKean-Vlasov equations driven by fractional Brownian motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the numerical scheme for delay-type stochastic McKean-Vlasov equations (DSMVEs) driven by fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter $H\in (0,1/2)\cup (1/2,1)$. The existence and uniqueness of the solutions to such DSMVEs whose drift coefficients contain polynomial delay terms are proved by exploting the Banach fixed point theorem. Then the propagation of chaos between interacting particle system and non-interacting system in $\mathcal{L}^p$ sense is shown. We find that even if the delay term satisfies the polynomial growth condition, the unmodified classical Euler-Maruyama scheme still can approximate the corresponding interacting particle system without the particle corruption. The convergence rates are revealed for $H\in (0,1/2)\cup (1/2,1)$. Finally, as an example that closely fits the original equation, a stochastic opinion dynamics model with both extrinsic memory and intrinsic memory is simulated to illustrate the plausibility of the theoretical result.</description>

      <title>Intertemporal Cost-efficient Consumption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We aim to provide an intertemporal, cost-efficient consumption model that extends the consumption optimization inspired by the Distribution Builder, a tool developed by Sharpe, Johnson, and Goldstein. The Distribution Builder enables the recovery of investors' risk preferences by allowing them to select a desired distribution of terminal wealth within their budget constraints.
  This approach differs from the classical portfolio optimization, which considers the agent's risk aversion modeled by utility functions that are challenging to measure in practice. Our intertemporal model captures the dependent structure between consumption periods using copulas. This strategy is demonstrated using both the Black-Scholes and CEV models.</description>

Abstract: We are concerned with the behaviour of stochastic systems with inputs and outputs, and how this might relate to the pursuit of a goal. We model this using what we term transducers, which are a mathematical object that captures only the external behaviour of such a system and not its internal state. We present a framework for reasoning about the optimality of such a process, when it is coupled to a 'teleo-environment' consisting of another transducer that also embodies a success criterion. We find that (globally) optimal transducers have a property closely related to Bellman's theorem: a transducer that is optimal in one time step will again be optimal in the next time step, but with respect to a different environment (obtained from the original one by a modified version of Bayesian filtering). We also consider bounded rationality and its relationship to constrained optimality, which in our framework means optimal within some subset of all transducers. We describe a condition that is sufficient for such a subset to have this Bellman property. Additionally, we show that a policy is deterministic if and only if there exists a teleo-envionment for which it is uniquely optimal among the set of all transducers; this is at least conceptually related to classical representation theorems from decision theory. This need not hold for constrained subsets; we give an example of this related to the so-called absent-minded driver problem. All of the formalism is defined using coinduction, following the style proposed by Czajka [9].</description>

      <title>Reality Only Happens Once: Single-Path Generalization Bounds for Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the inherent challenges in deploying transformers on time series is that \emph{reality only happens once}; namely, one typically only has access to a single trajectory of the data-generating process comprised of non-i.i.d. observations. We derive non-asymptotic statistical guarantees in this setting through bounds on the \textit{generalization} of a transformer network at a future-time $t$, given that it has been trained using $N\le t$ observations from a single perturbed trajectory of a Markov process. Under the assumption that the Markov process satisfies a log-Sobolev inequality, we obtain a generalization bound which effectively converges at the rate of ${O}(1/\sqrt{N})$. Our bound depends explicitly on the activation function ($\operatorname{Swish}$, $\operatorname{GeLU}$, or $\tanh$ are considered), the number of self-attention heads, depth, width, and norm-bounds defining the transformer architecture. Our bound consists of three components: (I) The first quantifies the gap between the stationary distribution of the data-generating Markov process and its distribution at time $t$, this term converges exponentially to $0$. (II) The next term encodes the complexity of the transformer model and, given enough time, eventually converges to $0$ at the rate ${O}(\log(N)^r/\sqrt{N})$ for any $r&gt;0$. (III) The third term guarantees that the bound holds with probability at least $1$-$\delta$, and converges at a rate of ${O}(\sqrt{\log(1/\delta)}/\sqrt{N})$.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Inference with Deep Weakly Nonlinear Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show at a physics level of rigor that Bayesian inference with a fully connected neural network and a shaped nonlinearity of the form $\phi(t) = t + \psi t^3/L$ is (perturbatively) solvable in the regime where the number of training datapoints $P$ , the input dimension $N_0$, the network layer widths $N$, and the network depth $L$ are simultaneously large. Our results hold with weak assumptions on the data; the main constraint is that $P &lt; N_0$. We provide techniques to compute the model evidence and posterior to arbitrary order in $1/N$ and at arbitrary temperature. We report the following results from the first-order computation:
  1. When the width $N$ is much larger than the depth $L$ and training set size $P$, neural network Bayesian inference coincides with Bayesian inference using a kernel. The value of $\psi$ determines the curvature of a sphere, hyperbola, or plane into which the training data is implicitly embedded under the feature map.
  2. When $LP/N$ is a small constant, neural network Bayesian inference departs from the kernel regime. At zero temperature, neural network Bayesian inference is equivalent to Bayesian inference using a data-dependent kernel, and $LP/N$ serves as an effective depth that controls the extent of feature learning.
  3. In the restricted case of deep linear networks ($\psi=0$) and noisy data, we show a simple data model for which evidence and generalization error are optimal at zero temperature. As $LP/N$ increases, both evidence and generalization further improve, demonstrating the benefit of depth in benign overfitting.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Approximation and Multiplier Bootstrap for Polyak-Ruppert Averaged Linear Stochastic Approximation with Applications to TD Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we obtain the Berry-Esseen bound for multivariate normal approximation for the Polyak-Ruppert averaged iterates of the linear stochastic approximation (LSA) algorithm with decreasing step size. Our findings reveal that the fastest rate of normal approximation is achieved when setting the most aggressive step size $\alpha_{k} \asymp k^{-1/2}$. Moreover, we prove the non-asymptotic validity of the confidence intervals for parameter estimation with LSA based on multiplier bootstrap. This procedure updates the LSA estimate together with a set of randomly perturbed LSA estimates upon the arrival of subsequent observations. We illustrate our findings in the setting of temporal difference learning with linear function approximation.</description>

      <title>Graphon Particle Systems, Part I: Spatio-Temporal Approximation and Law of Large Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a class of graphon particle systems with time-varying random coefficients. In a graphon particle system, the interactions among particles are characterized by the coupled mean field terms through an underlying graphon and the randomness of the coefficients comes from the stochastic processes associated with the particle labels. By constructing two-level approximated sequences converging in 2-Wasserstein distance, we prove the existence and uniqueness of the solution to the system. Besides, by constructing two-level approximated functions converging to the graphon mean field terms, we establish the law of large numbers, which reveals that if the number of particles tends to infinity and the discretization step tends to zero, then the discrete-time interacting particle system over the large-scale network converges to the graphon particle system. As a byproduct, we discover that the graphon particle system can describe the dynamic evolution of the distributed stochastic gradient descent algorithm over the large-scale network and prove that if the gradients of the local cost functions are Lipschitz continuous, then the graphon particle system can be regarded as the spatio-temporal approximation of the discrete-time distributed stochastic gradient descent algorithm as the number of network nodes tends to infinity and the algorithm step size tends to zero.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by work of Dolgopyat and N\'andori, we establish a general method for upgrading limit theorems for Birkhoff sums and cocycles over dynamical systems to mixing limit theorems under mild ergodicity and hyperbolicity assumptions. Building on previous work of Al-Saqban and Forni, we apply this method to obtain mixing limit theorems for particular subbundles of the Kontsevich-Zorich cocycle. In forthcoming work of Arana-Herrera and Honaryar these results are applied to study the arithmetic/homological complexity of long simple closed geodesics on negatively curved surfaces.</description>

Abstract: We prove a large deviation principle for deep neural networks with Gaussian weights and (at most linearly growing) activation functions. This generalises earlier work, in which bounded and continuous activation functions were considered. In practice, linearly growing activation functions such as ReLU are most commonly used. We furthermore simplify previous expressions for the rate function and a give power-series expansions for the ReLU case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider genealogies arising from a Markov population process in which individuals are categorized into a discrete collection of compartments, with the requirement that individuals within the same compartment are statistically exchangeable. When equipped with a sampling process, each such population process induces a time-evolving tree-valued process defined as the genealogy of all sampled individuals. We provide a construction of this genealogy process and derive exact expressions for the likelihood of an observed genealogy in terms of filter equations. These filter equations can be numerically solved using standard Monte Carlo integration methods. Thus, we obtain statistically efficient likelihood-based inference for essentially arbitrary compartment models based on an observed genealogy of individuals sampled from the population.</description>

      <title>MCGAN: Enhancing GAN Training with Regression-Based Generator Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have emerged as a powerful tool for generating high-fidelity data. However, the main bottleneck of existing approaches is the lack of supervision on the generator training, which often results in undamped oscillation and unsatisfactory performance. To address this issue, we propose an algorithm called Monte Carlo GAN (MCGAN). This approach, utilizing an innovative generative loss function, termly the regression loss, reformulates the generator training as a regression task and enables the generator training by minimizing the mean squared error between the discriminator's output of real data and the expected discriminator of fake data. We demonstrate the desirable analytic properties of the regression loss, including discriminability and optimality, and show that our method requires a weaker condition on the discriminator for effective generator training. These properties justify the strength of this approach to improve the training stability while retaining the optimality of GAN by leveraging strong supervision of the regression loss. Numerical results on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets demonstrate that the proposed MCGAN significantly and consistently improves the existing state-of-the-art GAN models in terms of quality, accuracy, training stability, and learned latent space. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm exhibits great flexibility for integrating with a variety of backbone models to generate spatial images, temporal time-series, and spatio-temporal video data.</description>

      <title>An extension of Krishnan's central limit theorem to the Brown-Thompson groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend a central limit theorem, recently established for the Thompson group $F=F_2$ by Krishnan, to the Brown-Thompson groups $F_p$, where $p$ is any integer greater than or equal to $2$. The non-commutative probability space considered is the group algebra $\mathbb{C}[F_p]$, equipped with the canonical trace. The random variables in question are $a_n:= (x_n + x_n^{-1})/\sqrt{2}$, where $\{x_i\}_{i\geq 0}$ represents the standard family of infinite generators. Analogously to the case of $F=F_2$, it is established that the limit distribution of $s_n = (a_0 + \ldots + a_{n-1})/\sqrt{n}$ converges to the standard normal distribution.
  Furthermore, it is demonstrated that for a state corresponding to Jones's oriented subgroup $\vec{F}$, such a central limit theorem does not hold.</description>

      <title>Boundary conditions and the two-point function plateau for the hierarchical $|\varphi|^4$ model in dimensions 4 and higher</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain precise plateau estimates for the two-point function of the finite-volume weakly-coupled hierarchical $|\varphi|^4$ model in dimensions $d \ge 4$, for both free and periodic boundary conditions, and for any number $n \ge 1$ of components of the field $\varphi$. We prove that, within a critical window around their respective effective critical points, the two-point functions for both free and periodic boundary conditions have a plateau, in the sense that they decay as $|x|^{-(d-2)}$ until reaching a constant plateau value of order $V^{-1/2}$ (with a logarithmic correction for $d=4$), where $V$ is size of the finite volume. The two critical windows for free and periodic boundary conditions do not overlap. The dependence of the plateau height on the location within the critical window is governed by an explicit $n$-dependent universal profile which is independent of the dimension. The proof is based on a rigorous renormalisation group method and extends the method used by Michta, Park and Slade (arXiv:2306.00896) to study the finite-volume susceptibility and related quantities. Our results lead to precise conjectures concerning Euclidean (non-hierarchical) models of spin systems and self-avoiding walk in dimensions $d \ge 4$.</description>

      <title>The torus plateau for the high-dimensional Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the Ising model on a $d$-dimensional discrete torus of volume $r^d$, in dimensions $d&gt;4$ and for large $r$, in the vicinity of the infinite-volume critical point $\beta_c$. We prove that for $\beta=\beta_c- {\rm const}\, r^{-d/2}$ (with a suitable constant) the susceptibility is bounded above and below by multiples of $r^{d/2}$, and that the two-point function has a ``plateau'' in the sense that it decays like $|x|^{-(d-2)}$ when $|x|$ is small relative to the volume but for larger $|x|$ it levels off to a constant value of order $r^{-d/2}$. We also prove that at $\beta=\beta_c- {\rm const}\, r^{-d/2}$ the renormalised coupling constant is nonzero, which implies a non-Gaussian limit for the average spin. The proof relies on near-critical estimates for the infinite-volume two-point function obtained recently by Duminil-Copin and Panis, and builds upon a strategy proposed by Papathanakos. The random current representation of the Ising model plays a central role in our analysis.</description>

Abstract: In this article we establish a new formula for the difference of a test function of the solution of a stochastic differential equation and of the test function of an It\^o process. The introduced formula essentially generalizes both the classical Alekseev-Gr\"obner formula from the literature on deterministic differential equations as well as the classical It\^o formula from stochastic analysis. The proposed It\^o-Alekseev-Gr\"obner formula is a powerful tool for deriving strong approximation rates for perturbations and approximations of stochastic ordinary and partial differential equations.</description>

Under suitable assumptions, lower and upper bounds for the finite-time blow-up solution are obtained. We provide sufficient conditions for the existence of a global weak solution to the system. Further, a lower bound for the probability of the finite-time blow-up solution of the considered system is provided by using Malliavin calculus.</description>

      <title>Logical limit laws for Mallows random permutations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.10148v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A random permutation $\Pi_n$ of $\{1,\dots,n\}$ follows the $\DeclareMathOperator{\Mallows}{Mallows}\Mallows(n,q)$ distribution with parameter $q&gt;0$ if $\mathbb{P} ( \Pi_n = \pi )$ is proportional to $\DeclareMathOperator{\inv}{inv} q^{\inv(\pi)}$ for all $\pi$. Here $\DeclareMathOperator{\inv}{inv} \inv(\pi) := |\{ i&lt;j : \pi(i)&gt; \pi(j) \}|$ denotes the number of inversions of $\pi$. We consider properties of permutations that can be expressed by the sentences of two different logical languages. Namely, the theory of one bijection ($\mathsf{TOOB}$), which describes permutations via a single binary relation, and the theory of two orders ($\mathsf{TOTO}$), where we describe permutations by two total orders. We say that the convergence law holds with respect to one of these languages if, for every sentence $\phi$ in the language, the probability $\mathbb{P} (\Pi_n\text{ satisfies } \phi)$ converges to a limit as $n\to\infty$. If moreover that limit is in the set $\{0,1\}$ for all sentences, then the zero-one law holds.
  We will show that with respect to $\mathsf{TOOB}$ the $\Mallows(n,q)$ distribution satisfies the zero-one law when $0&lt;q&lt;1$ is fixed, and for fixed $q&gt;1$ the convergence law fails. (In the case when $q=1$ Compton has shown the convergence law holds but not the zero-one law.)
  We will prove that with respect to $\mathsf{TOTO}$ the $\Mallows(n,q)$ distribution satisfies the convergence law but not the zero-one law for any fixed $q\neq 1$, and that if $q=q(n)$ satisfies $1 - 1/\log^*n &lt; q &lt; 1 + 1/\log^*n$ then $\Mallows(n,q)$ fails the convergence law. Here $\log^*$ denotes the discrete inverse of the tower function.</description>

      <title>On the Existence and Uniqueness of Stationary Distributions for Some Piecewise Deterministic Markov Processes With State-Dependent Jump Intensity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.11576v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a subclass of piecewise deterministic Markov processes with a Polish state space that involve a deterministic motion punctuated by random jumps, occurring in a Poisson-like fashion with some state-dependent rate, between which the trajectory is driven by one of the given semiflows. We prove that there is a one-to-one correspondence between stationary distributions of such processes and those of the Markov chains given by their post-jump locations. Using this result, we further establish a criterion guaranteeing the existence and uniqueness of the stationary distribution in a particular case, where the post-jump locations result from the action of a random iterated function system with an arbitrary set of transformations.</description>

Abstract: We compute the limit distribution of partial transposes (when both the number and the size of blocks tends to infinity) for a large class of ensembles of unitarily invariant random matrices. Furthermore, it is shown the asymptotic freeness relation between the ensembles of random matrices, their transposes and their left and right partial transposes.</description>

      <title>Harer-Zagier type recursion formula for the elliptic GinOE</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.11185v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the real eigenvalues of the elliptic Ginibre matrix indexed by the non-Hermiticity parameter $\tau \in [0,1]$, and present a Harer-Zagier type recursion formula for the even moments in the form of an $11$-term recurrence relation. For the symmetric GOE case ($\tau=1$), it reduces to a known 5-term recurrence relation. On the other hand, for the asymmetric cases when $\tau &lt; 1$, the recursion formula is new, even in the special case of the well-studied Ginibre ensemble ($\tau=0$), where it reduces to a 3-term recurrence. For the proof, we derive a seventh-order linear differential equation for the moment generating function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For branching processes, the generating functions for limit distributions of so-called ratios of probabilities of rare events satisfy the Schr\"oder-type integral-functional equations. Excepting limited special cases, the corresponding equations can not be solved analytically. I found a large class of Poisson-type offspring distributions, for which the Schr\"oder-type functional equations can be solved analytically. Moreover, for the asymptotics of limit distributions, the power and constant factor can be written explicitly. As a bonus, Bernoulli branching processes in random environments are treated. The beauty of this example is that the explicit formula for the generating function is unknown. Still, the closed-form expression for the power and constant factor in the asymptotic can be written with the help of some outstanding tricks. Also, the magic power $3$ in the Bernoulli binomial kernels, at which short-phase discrete oscillations turn into long-phase continuous ones.</description>

      <title>A non-inertial model for particle aggregation under turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05233v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new model for particle coalescence in a turbulent environment is presented, aiming to prove that turbulence enhances coalescence, for small-moderate Stokes numbers. The model is non-inertial, namely the velocity of particles is the velocity of the fluid; and a variant of Stokes number is introduced, based on space scales. Particles interact by coalescence and a sparse local regime is chosen, but instead of independent Brownian motions acting on different particles, we impose a common noise, modeling the turbulent fluid and having a length scale. In the scaling limit it becomes delta correlated and gives rise to a deterministic limit PDE for the density. The mean coalescence rate in this limit equation is not the trivial one of mean field theory but, through the solution of an auxiliary cell-equation, incorporates in the right qualitative way the dependence on the Stokes number and the turbulent kinetic energy.</description>

      <title>The distribution on permutations induced by a random parking function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11529v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A parking function on $[n]$ creates a permutation in $S_n$ via the order in which the $n$ cars appear in the $n$ parking spaces. Placing the uniform probability measure on the set of parking functions on $[n]$ induces a probability measure on $S_n$. We initiate a study of some properties of this distribution. Let $P_n^{\text{park}}$ denote this distribution on $S_n$ and let $P_n$ denote the uniform distribution on $S_n$. In particular, we obtain an explicit formula for $P_n^{\text{park}}(\sigma)$ for all $\sigma\in S_n$. Then we show that for all but an asymptotically $P_n$-negligible set of permutations, one has $P_n^{\text{park}}(\sigma)\in\left(\frac{(2-\epsilon)^n}{(n+1)^{n-1}},\frac{(2+\epsilon)^n}{(n+1)^{n-1}}\right)$. However, this accounts for only an exponentially small part of the $P_n^{\text{park}}$-probability. We also obtain an explicit formula for $P_n^{\text{park}}(\sigma^{-1}_{n-j+1}=i_1,\sigma^{-1}_{n-j+2}=i_2,\cdots, \sigma^{-1}_n=i_j)$, the probability that the last $j$ cars park in positions $i_1,\cdots, i_j$ respectively, and show that the $j$-dimensional random vector $(n+1-\sigma^{-1}_{n-j+l}, n+1-\sigma^{-1}_{n-j+2},\cdots, n+1-\sigma^{-1}_{n})$ under $P_n^{\text{park}}$ converges in distribution to a random vector $(\sum_{r=1}^jX_r,\sum_{r=2}^j X_r,\cdots, X_{j-1}+X_j,X_j)$, where $\{X_r\}_{r=1}^j$ are IID with the Borel distribution. We then show that in fact for $j_n=o(n^\frac16)$, the final $j_n$ cars will park in increasing order with probability approaching 1 as $n\to\infty$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10193v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a change in focus from the prevalent paradigm based on the branching property as a tool to analyze the structure of population models, to one based on the self-similarity property, which we also introduce for the first time in the setting of measure-valued processes. By extending the well-known Lamperti transformation for self-similar Markov processes to the Banach-valued case we are able to generalize celebrated results in population genetics that describe the frequency-process of measure-valued stable branching processes in terms of the subfamily of Beta-Fleming-Viot processes. In our work we describe the frequency process of populations whose total size evolves as any positive self-similar Markov process in terms of general $\Lambda$-Fleming-Viot processes. Our results demonstrate the potential power of the self-similar perspective for the study of population models in which the reproduction dynamics of the individuals depend on the total population size, allowing for more complex and realistic models.</description>

Abstract: We provide a new description of the scaling limit of dimer fluctuations in homogeneous Aztec diamonds via the intrinsic conformal structure of a space-like maximal surface in the three-dimensional Minkowski space $\mathbb{R}^{2,1}$. This surface naturally appears as the limit of the graphs of origami maps associated to symmetric t-embeddings of Aztec diamonds, fitting the framework recently developed in arXiv:2109.06272.</description>

      <title>On the Quenched Functional Central Limit Theorem for Stationary Random Fields under Projective Criteria</title>

      <description>arXiv:2106.01672v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we study and establish some quenched functional Central Limit Theorems (CLTs) for stationary random fields under a projective criteria. These results are functional generalizations of the theorems obtained by Zhang et al. (2020) and of the quenched functional CLTs for ortho-martingales established by Peligrad and Voln{\'y}  (2020) to random fields satisfying a Hannan type projective condition. In the work of Zhang et al. (2020), the authors have already proven a quenched functional CLT however the assumptions were not optimal as they require the existence of a 2 + $\delta$-moment. In this article, we establish the results under weaker assumptions, namely we only require an Orlicz space condition to hold. The methods used to obtain these generalizations are somewhat similar to the ones used by Zhang et al. (2020) but we improve on them in order to obtain results within the functional framework. Moreover, a Rosenthal type inequality for said Orlicz space is also derived and used to obtain a sufficient condition analogous to that of Theorem 4.4 in the work of Zhang et al. (2020). Finally, we apply our new results to derive some quenched functional CLTs under weak assumptions for a variety of stochastic processes.</description>

      <title>Cash-subadditive risk measures without quasi-convexity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2110.12198v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the literature of risk measures, cash subadditivity was proposed to replace cash additivity, motivated by the presence of stochastic or ambiguous interest rates and defaultable contingent claims. Cash subadditivity has been traditionally studied together with quasi-convexity, in a way similar to cash additivity with convexity. In this paper, we study cash-subadditive risk measures without quasi-convexity. One of our major results is that a general cash-subadditive risk measure can be represented as the lower envelope of a family of quasi-convex and cash-subadditive risk measures. Representation results of cash-subadditive risk measures with some additional properties are also examined. The notion of quasi-star-shapedness, which is a natural analogue of star-shapedness, is introduced and we obtain a corresponding representation result.</description>

      <title>Large independent sets in recursive Markov random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.04514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.04514v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computing the maximum size of an independent set in a graph is a famously hard combinatorial problem that has been well-studied for various classes of graphs. When it comes to random graphs, only the classical Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi-Gilbert random graph $G_{n,p}$ has been analysed and shown to have largest independent sets of size $\Theta(\log{n})$ w.h.p. This classical model does not capture any dependency structure between edges that can appear in real-world networks. We initiate study in this direction by defining random graphs $G^{r}_{n,p}$ whose existence of edges is determined by a Markov process that is also governed by a decay parameter $r\in(0,1]$. We prove that w.h.p. $G^{r}_{n,p}$ has independent sets of size $(\frac{1-r}{2+\epsilon}) \frac{n}{\log{n}}$ for arbitrary $\epsilon &gt; 0$, which implies an asymptotic lower bound of $\Omega(\pi(n))$ where $\pi(n)$ is the prime-counting function. This is derived using bounds on the terms of a harmonic series, Tur\'an bound on stability number, and a concentration analysis for a certain sequence of dependent Bernoulli variables that may also be of independent interest. Since $G^{r}_{n,p}$ collapses to $G_{n,p}$ when there is no decay, it follows that having even the slightest bit of dependency (any $r &lt; 1$) in the random graph construction leads to the presence of large independent sets and thus our random model has a phase transition at its boundary value of $r=1$. For the maximal independent set output by a greedy algorithm, we deduce that it has a performance ratio of at most $1 + \frac{\log{n}}{(1-r)}$ w.h.p. when the lowest degree vertex is picked at each iteration, and also show that under any other permutation of vertices the algorithm outputs a set of size $\Omega(n^{1/1+\tau})$, where $\tau=1/(1-r)$, and hence has a performance ratio of $O(n^{\frac{1}{2-r}})$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.03111v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the existence and finite-time blow-up for the solution of a reaction-diffusion system of semilinear stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) subjected to a two-dimensional fractional Brownian motion given by
  \begin{eqnarray*}
  du_{1}(t,x)&amp;=&amp;\left[ \Delta_{\alpha}u_{1}(t,x)+\gamma_{1}u_{1}(t,x)+u^{1+\beta_{1}}_{2}(t,x) \right]dt
  &amp;\qquad \ \ +k_{11}u_{1}(t,x)dB^{H}_{1}(t)+k_{12}u_{1}(t,x)dB^{H}_{2}(t),
  du_{2}(t,x)&amp;=&amp;\left[ \Delta_{\alpha}u_{2}(t,x)+\gamma_{2}u_{2}(t,x)+u^{1+\beta_{2}}_{1}(t,x) \right]dt
  &amp;\qquad \ \ +k_{21}u_{2}(t,x)dB^{H}_{1}(t)+k_{22}u_{2}(t,x)dB^{H}_{2}(t),
  \end{eqnarray*}
  for $x \in \mathbb{R}^{d},\ t \geq 0$, along with 
\begin{equation*}
  \begin{array}{ll}
  u_{i}(0,x)=f_{i}(x), &amp;x \in \mathbb{R}^{d}, \nonumber
  \end{array}
  \end{equation*}
  where $\Delta_{\alpha}$ is the fractional power $-(-\Delta)^{\frac{\alpha}{2}}$ of the Laplacian, $0&lt;\alpha \leq 2$ and $\beta_{i}&gt;0,\ \gamma_{i}&gt;0$ and $k_{ij}\geq 0, i,j=1,2$ are constants. We provide sufficient conditions for the existence of a global weak solution. Under the assumption that $\beta_{1}\geq \beta_{2}&gt;0$ with Hurst index $ 1/2 \leq H &lt; 1,$ we obtain the blow-up times for an associated system of random partial differential equations in terms of an integral representation of exponential functions of Brownian motions. Moreover, we provide lower and upper bounds for the finite-time blow-up of the above system of SPDEs and obtain the upper bounds for the probability of non-explosive solutions to our considered system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.04199v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A statistic on a statistical model is sufficient if it has no information loss, namely, the Fisher metric of the induced model coincides with that of the original model due to Kullback and Ay-Jost-L\^e-Schwachh\"ofer. We introduce a quantitatively weak version of sufficient statistics such that the Fisher metric of the induced model is bi-Lipschitz equivalent to that of the original model. We characterize such statistics in terms of the conditional probability or by the existence of a certain decomposition of the density function in a way similar to characterizations of sufficient statistics due to Fisher-Neyman and Ay-Jost-L\^e-Schwachh\"ofer.</description>

      <title>Boundary conditions and universal finite-size scaling for the hierarchical $|\varphi|^4$ model in dimensions 4 and higher</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.00896v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyse and clarify the finite-size scaling of the weakly-coupled hierarchical $n$-component $|\varphi|^4$ model for all integers $n \ge 1$ in all dimensions $d\ge 4$, for both free and periodic boundary conditions. For $d&gt;4$, we prove that for a volume of size $R^{d}$ with periodic boundary conditions the infinite-volume critical point is an effective finite-volume critical point, whereas for free boundary conditions the effective critical point is shifted smaller by an amount of order $R^{-2}$. For both boundary conditions, the average field has the same non-Gaussian limit within a critical window of width $R^{-d/2}$ around the effective critical point, and in that window we compute the universal scaling profile for the susceptibility. In contrast, and again for both boundary conditions, the average field has a massive Gaussian limit when above the effective critical point by an amount $R^{-2}$. In particular, at the infinite-volume critical point the susceptibility scales as $R^{d/2}$ for periodic boundary conditions and as $R^{2}$ for free boundary conditions. We identify a mass generation mechanism for free boundary conditions that is responsible for this distinction and which we believe has wider validity, in particular to Euclidean (non-hierarchical) models on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ in dimensions $d \ge 4$. For $d=4$ we prove a similar picture with logarithmic corrections. Our analysis is based on the rigorous renormalisation group method of Bauerschmidt, Brydges and Slade, which we improve and extend.</description>

Abstract: Enumeration of walks with small steps in the quadrant has been a topic of great interest in combinatorics over the last few years. In this article, it is shown how to compute exact asymptotics of the number of such walks with fixed start- and endpoints for orbit-summable models with finite group, up to arbitrary precision. The resulting representation greatly resembles one conjectured by Chapon, Fusy and Raschel for walks starting from the origin (AofA 2020), differing only in terms appearing due to the periodicity of the model. We will see that the dependency on start- and endpoint is given by discrete polyharmonic functions, which are solutions of $\triangle^n v=0$ for a discretisation $\triangle$ of a Laplace-Beltrami operator. They can be decomposed into a sum of products of lower order polyharmonic functions of either the start- or the endpoint only, which leads to a partial extension of a recent theorem by Denisov and Wachtel (Ann. Prob. 43.3).</description>

      <title>Deep learning algorithms for FBSDEs with jumps: Applications to option pricing and a MFG model for smart grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03245v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce various machine learning solvers for (coupled) forward-backward systems of stochastic differential equations (FBSDEs) driven by a Brownian motion and a Poisson random measure. We provide a rigorous comparison of the different algorithms and demonstrate their effectiveness in various applications, such as cases derived from pricing with jumps and mean-field games. In particular, we show the efficiency of the deep-learning algorithms to solve a coupled multi-dimensional FBSDE system driven by a time-inhomogeneous jump process with stochastic intensity, which describes the Nash equilibria for a specific mean-field game (MFG) problem for which we also provide the complete theoretical resolution. More precisely, we develop an extension of the MFG model for smart grids introduced in Alasseur, Campi, Dumitrescu and Zeng (Annals of Operations Research, 2023) to the case when the random jump times correspond to the jump times of a doubly Poisson process. We first provide an existence result of an equilibria and derive its semi-explicit characterization in terms of a system of FBSDEs in the linear-quadratic setting. We then compare the MFG solution to the optimal strategy of a central planner and provide several numerical illustrations using the deep-learning solvers presented in the first part of the paper.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Gaussian Fluctuations of Eigenvectors in Spectral Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12302v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The performance of spectral clustering relies on the fluctuations of the entries of the eigenvectors of a similarity matrix, which has been left uncharacterized until now. In this letter, it is shown that the signal $+$ noise structure of a general spike random matrix model is transferred to the eigenvectors of the corresponding Gram kernel matrix and the fluctuations of their entries are Gaussian in the large-dimensional regime. This CLT-like result was the last missing piece to precisely predict the classification performance of spectral clustering. The proposed proof is very general and relies solely on the rotational invariance of the noise. Numerical experiments on synthetic and real data illustrate the universality of this phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Zeroth-Order Sampling Methods for Non-Log-Concave Distributions: Alleviating Metastability by Denoising Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17886v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of sampling from non-logconcave distribution, based on queries of its unnormalized density. It first describes a framework, Diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC), based on the simulation of a denoising diffusion process with its score function approximated by a generic Monte Carlo estimator. DMC is an oracle-based meta-algorithm, where its oracle is the assumed access to samples that generate a Monte Carlo score estimator. Then we provide an implementation of this oracle, based on rejection sampling, and this turns DMC into a true algorithm, termed Zeroth-Order Diffusion Monte Carlo (ZOD-MC). We provide convergence analyses by first constructing a general framework, i.e. a performance guarantee for DMC, without assuming the target distribution to be log-concave or satisfying any isoperimetric inequality. Then we prove that ZOD-MC admits an inverse polynomial dependence on the desired sampling accuracy, albeit still suffering from the curse of dimensionality. Consequently, for low dimensional distributions, ZOD-MC is a very efficient sampler, with performance exceeding latest samplers, including also-denoising-diffusion-based RDMC and RS-DMC. Last, we experimentally demonstrate the insensitivity of ZOD-MC to increasingly higher barriers between modes or discontinuity in non-convex potential.</description>

      <title>Extended Flow Matching: a Method of Conditional Generation with Generalized Continuity Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18839v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The task of conditional generation is one of the most important applications of generative models, and numerous methods have been developed to date based on the celebrated flow-based models. However, many flow-based models in use today are not built to allow one to introduce an explicit inductive bias to how the conditional distribution to be generated changes with respect to conditions. This can result in unexpected behavior in the task of style transfer, for example. In this research, we introduce extended flow matching (EFM), a direct extension of flow matching that learns a ``matrix field'' corresponding to the continuous map from the space of conditions to the space of distributions. We show that we can introduce inductive bias to the conditional generation through the matrix field and demonstrate this fact with MMOT-EFM, a version of EFM that aims to minimize the Dirichlet energy or the sensitivity of the distribution with respect to conditions. We will present our theory along with experimental results that support the competitiveness of EFM in conditional generation.</description>

      <title>A supersymmetric quantum perspective on the explicit large deviations for reversible Markov jump processes, with applications to pure and random spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11525v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The large deviations at various levels that are explicit for Markov jump processes satisfying detailed-balance are revisited in terms of the supersymmetric quantum Hamiltonian $H$ that can be obtained from the Markov generator via a similarity transformation. We first focus on the large deviations at level 2 for the empirical density ${\hat p}(C) $ of the configurations $C$ seen during a trajectory over the large time-window $[0,T]$ and rewrite the explicit Donsker-Varadhan rate function as the matrix element $I^{[2]}[{\hat p}(.) ] = \langle \sqrt{ {\hat p} } \vert H \vert \sqrt{{\hat p}} \rangle $ involving the square-root ket $\vert \sqrt{{\hat p}} \rangle $. [The analog formula is also discussed for reversible diffusion processes as a comparison.] We then consider the explicit rate functions at higher levels, in particular for the joint probability of the empirical density ${\hat p}(C) $ and the empirical local activities ${\hat a}(C,C') $ characterizing the density of jumps between two configurations $(C,C')$. Finally, the explicit rate function for the joint probability of the empirical density ${\hat p}(C) $ and of the empirical total activity ${\hat A} $ that represents the total density of jumps of a long trajectory is written in terms of the two matrix elements $ \langle \sqrt{ {\hat p} } \vert H \vert \sqrt{{\hat p}} \rangle$ and $\langle \sqrt{ {\hat p} } \vert H^{off} \vert \sqrt{{\hat p}} \rangle $, where $H^{off} $ represents the off-diagonal part of the supersymmetric Hamiltonian $H$. This general formalism is then applied to pure or random spin chains with single-spin-flip or two-spin-flip transition rates, where the supersymmetric Hamiltonian $H$ correspond to quantum spin chains with local interactions involving Pauli matrices of two or three neighboring sites.</description>

      <title>Learning the mechanisms of network growth</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00793v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel model-selection method for dynamic networks. Our approach involves training a classifier on a large body of synthetic network data. The data is generated by simulating nine state-of-the-art random graph models for dynamic networks, with parameter range chosen to ensure exponential growth of the network size in time. We design a conceptually novel type of dynamic features that count new links received by a group of vertices in a particular time interval. The proposed features are easy to compute, analytically tractable, and interpretable. Our approach achieves a near-perfect classification of synthetic networks, exceeding the state-of-the-art by a large margin. Applying our classification method to real-world citation networks gives credibility to the claims in the literature that models with preferential attachment, fitness and aging fit real-world citation networks best, although sometimes, the predicted model does not involve vertex fitness.</description>

      <title>Growth in products of matrices: fastest, average, and generic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00610v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The problems that we consider in this paper are as follows. Let A and B be 2x2 matrices (over reals). Let w(A, B) be a word of length n. After evaluating w(A, B) as a product of matrices, we get a 2x2 matrix, call it W. What is the largest (by the absolute value) possible entry of W, over all w(A, B) of length n, as a function of n? What is the expected absolute value of the largest (by the absolute value) entry in a random product of n matrices, where each matrix is A or B with probability 0.5? What is the Lyapunov exponent for a random matrix product like that? We give partial answer to the first of these questions and an essentially complete answer to the second question. For the third question (the most difficult of the three), we offer a very simple method to produce an upper bound on the Lyapunov exponent in the case where all entries of the matrices A and B are nonnegative.</description>

      <title>Single-seed generation of Brownian paths and integrals for adaptive and high order SDE solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06464v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the success of adaptive time-stepping in ODE simulation, it has so far seen few applications for Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs). To simulate SDEs adaptively, methods such as the Virtual Brownian Tree (VBT) have been developed, which can generate Brownian motion (BM) non-chronologically. However, in most applications, knowing only the values of Brownian motion is not enough to achieve a high order of convergence; for that, we must compute time-integrals of BM such as $\int_s^t W_r \, dr$. With the aim of using high order SDE solvers adaptively, we extend the VBT to generate these integrals of BM in addition to the Brownian increments. A JAX-based implementation of our construction is included in the popular Diffrax library (https://github.com/patrick-kidger/diffrax).
  Since the entire Brownian path produced by VBT is uniquely determined by a single PRNG seed, previously generated samples need not be stored, which results in a constant memory footprint and enables experiment repeatability and strong error estimation. Based on binary search, the VBT's time complexity is logarithmic in the tolerance parameter $\varepsilon$. Unlike the original VBT algorithm, which was only precise at some dyadic times, we prove that our construction exactly matches the joint distribution of the Brownian motion and its time integrals at any query times, provided they are at least $\varepsilon$ apart.
  We present two applications of adaptive high order solvers enabled by our new VBT. Using adaptive solvers to simulate a high-volatility CIR model, we achieve more than twice the convergence order of constant stepping. We apply an adaptive third order underdamped or kinetic Langevin solver to an MCMC problem, where our approach outperforms the No U-Turn Sampler, while using only a tenth of its function evaluations.</description>

      <title>On Convergence of the Alternating Directions SGHMC Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13140v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study convergence rates of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithms with leapfrog integration under mild conditions on stochastic gradient oracle for the target distribution (SGHMC). Our method extends standard HMC by allowing the use of general auxiliary distributions, which is achieved by a novel procedure of Alternating Directions.
  The convergence analysis is based on the investigations of the Dirichlet forms associated with the underlying Markov chain driving the algorithms. For this purpose, we provide a detailed analysis on the error of the leapfrog integrator for Hamiltonian motions with both the kinetic and potential energy functions in general form. We characterize the explicit dependence of the convergence rates on key parameters such as the problem dimension, functional properties of both the target and auxiliary distributions, and the quality of the oracle.</description>
