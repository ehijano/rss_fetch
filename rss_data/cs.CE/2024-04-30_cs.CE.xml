      <title>ZSMILES: an approach for efficient SMILES storage for random access in Virtual Screening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Virtual screening is a technique used in drug discovery to select the most promising molecules to test in a lab. To perform virtual screening, we need a large set of molecules as input, and storing these molecules can become an issue. In fact, extreme-scale high-throughput virtual screening applications require a big dataset of input molecules and produce an even bigger dataset as output. These molecules' databases occupy tens of TB of storage space, and domain experts frequently sample a small portion of this data. In this context, SMILES is a popular data format for storing large sets of molecules since it requires significantly less space to represent molecules than other formats (e.g., MOL2, SDF). This paper proposes an efficient dictionary-based approach to compress SMILES-based datasets. This approach takes advantage of domain knowledge to provide a readable output with separable SMILES, enabling random access. We examine the benefits of storing these datasets using ZSMILES to reduce the cold storage footprint in HPC systems. The main contributions concern a custom dictionary-based approach and a data pre-processing step. From experimental results, we can notice how ZSMILES leverage domain knowledge to compress x1.13 more than state of the art in similar scenarios and up to $0.29$ compression ratio. We tested a CUDA version of ZSMILES targetting NVIDIA's GPUs, showing a potential speedup of 7x.</description>

      <title>Transforming Credit Guarantee Schemes with Distributed Ledger Technology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Credit Guarantee Schemes (CGSs) are crucial in mitigating SMEs' financial constraints. However, they are renownedly affected by critical shortcomings, such as a lack of financial sustainability and operational efficiency. Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) have shown significant revolutionary influence in several sectors, including finance and banking, thanks to the full operational traceability they bring alongside verifiable computation. Nevertheless, the potential synergy between DLTs and CGSs has not been thoroughly investigated yet. This paper proposes a comprehensive framework to utilise DLTs, particularly blockchain technologies, in CGS processes to improve operational efficiency and effectiveness. To this end, we compare key architectural characteristics considering access level, governance structure, and consensus method, to examine their fit with CGS processes. We believe this study can guide policymakers and stakeholders, thereby stimulating further innovation in this promising field.</description>

      <title>Human-AI Interaction in Industrial Robotics: Design and Empirical Evaluation of a User Interface for Explainable AI-Based Robot Program Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While recent advances in deep learning have demonstrated its transformative potential, its adoption for real-world manufacturing applications remains limited. We present an Explanation User Interface (XUI) for a state-of-the-art deep learning-based robot program optimizer which provides both naive and expert users with different user experiences depending on their skill level, as well as Explainable AI (XAI) features to facilitate the application of deep learning methods in real-world applications. To evaluate the impact of the XUI on task performance, user satisfaction and cognitive load, we present the results of a preliminary user survey and propose a study design for a large-scale follow-up study.</description>

      <title>Earth Observation based multi-scale analysis of crop diversity in the European Union: first insights for agro-environmental policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04551v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To understand the resilience of farms and the agricultural sector, as well as the provision of ecosystem services, we need to characterize and quantify crop diversity. Using a 10m resolution satellite-derived product, we created datasets of crop diversity across spatial and administrative scales for 27 EU countries and the UK in 2018. We define local crop diversity, or $\alpha$-diversity, at a 1km scale, corresponding to large or clusters of small-to-medium-sized farms. $\alpha$ crop diversities range from 2.3 to 4.4, with higher levels in systems with many small farms (averaging less than 10 ha). $\gamma$-diversity, the number and area of crops grown independently of location, increases from 2.85 at 1km to 3.86 at 10km, and levels off at 4.27 at 100km. These levels are higher than those reported in the U.S., possibly due to differences in farm structure and practices. $\beta$-diversity, the ratio of $\gamma$ and $\alpha$ diversities, measures the difference between agroecosystems and ranges from 1.2 to 2.3 across EU countries. We classify countries' crop diversities into four groups based on the magnitude and change of $\gamma$-diversity across scales, with implications for regional to national agro-environmental policy recommendations. Continental Copernicus crop type maps will enable temporal comparisons, and exploring ecosystem co-variates will deepen our understanding of the link between crop diversity and agro-ecosystem services.</description>

      <title>A cable finite element formulation based on exact tension field for static nonlinear analysis of cable structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05609v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a numerical exact cable finite element model for the static nonlinear analysis of cable structures. In this model, the exact expression of the tension field is derived based on the geometrically exact beam theory and the fundamental mechanical properties of cables. The equation system of the cable element is established by considering the equilibrium conditions at the element boundaries and the compatibility condition within the element. In contrast to existing research, which often focuses on providing explicit expressions for the cable model, the present work aims to provide a cable element formulation with numerical accuracy and a wider range of applicability. This is achieved by directly deriving the linearized equations of the element with the implicit expressions that include integrals. The proposed cable element is capable of solving for internal forces and deformation states, and can also be used to determine the unstrained length of the cable. Meanwhile, it can also include the effect of non-uniform cross-sectional stiffness along the cable axis. The implementations of solutions based on complete tangent matrix and element internal iteration are introduced, and the efficacy of the proposed cable element is demonstrated through numerical examples.</description>
