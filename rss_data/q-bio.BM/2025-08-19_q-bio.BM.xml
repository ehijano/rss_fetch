      <title>Implicitly and Differentiably Representing Protein Surfaces and Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a pipeline for representing a protein, or protein complex, as the union of signed distance functions (SDFs) by representing each atom as a sphere with the appropriate radius. While this idea has been used previously as a way to render images of proteins, it has not, to our knowledge, been widely adopted in a machine learning setting. Mirroring recent successful work applying SDFs to represent 3D geometry, we present a proof of concept that this representation of proteins could be useful in several biologically relevant applications. We also propose further experiments that are necessary to validate the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>BConformeR: A Conformer Based on Mutual Sampling for Unified Prediction of Continuous and Discontinuous Antibody Binding Sites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of antibody-binding sites (epitopes) on antigens is crucial for vaccine design, immunodiagnostics, therapeutic antibody development, antibody engineering, research into autoimmune and allergic diseases, and for advancing our understanding of immune responses. Despite in silico methods that have been proposed to predict both linear (continuous) and conformational (discontinuous) epitopes, they consistently underperform in predicting conformational epitopes. In this work, we propose a conformer-based model trained on antigen sequences derived from 1,080 antigen-antibody complexes, leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract local features and Transformers to capture long-range dependencies within antigen sequences. Ablation studies demonstrate that CNN enhances the prediction of linear epitopes, and the Transformer module improves the prediction of conformational epitopes. Experimental results show that our model outperforms existing baselines in terms of PCC, ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, and F1 scores on conformational epitopes.</description>

      <title>Applied causality to infer protein dynamics and kinetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of generative machine learning models, trained on the experimentally resolved structures deposited in the protein data bank, is an attractive approach to sampling conformational ensembles of proteins. Unfortunately, since the machine-learned model utilized to generate these ensembles is not tied to an equation of motion, such as a molecular dynamics integrator or other causal generator of the dynamics, there is no timescale or causal information encoded in them. As such, with this work, we use the structural ensembles generated from AlphaFold2 at a range of reduced MSA depths to parameterize the potential of mean force of an overdamped, memory-free, coarse-grained Langevin equation. This approach couples the AlphaFold2 ensembles to a causal model, allowing us to estimate the timescales spanned by the AlphaFold2-generated ensembles at each MSA depth. Performing this analysis on six variants of HIV-1 protease, we confirm an inverse relationship between MSA depth and the timescale of an ensemble's conformational fluctuations, since the MSA depth essentially serves as a conformational restraint, and AlphaFold2 is generally able to probe timescales at or below those seen in microsecond-long, unbiased molecular dynamics simulations. We conclude by generalizing this approach to other machine-learned structure-prediction methods.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-based QSAR Model for Therapeutic Strategies Targeting SmTGR Protein's Immune Modulating Role in Host-Parasite Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Schistosomiasis, a neglected tropical disease caused by Schistosoma parasites, remains a major global health challenge. The Schistosoma mansoni thioredoxin glutathione reductase (SmTGR) is essential for parasite redox balance and immune evasion, making it a key therapeutic target. This study employs predictive Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) modeling to identify potential SmTGR inhibitors. Using deep learning, a robust QSAR model was developed and validated, achieving high predictive accuracy. The predicted novel inhibitors were further validated through molecular docking studies, which demonstrated strong binding affinities, with the highest docking score of -10.76+-0.01kcal/mol. Visualization of the docked structures in both 2D and 3D confirmed similar interactions for the inhibitors and commercial drugs, further supporting their therapeutic effectiveness and the predictive ability of the model. This study demonstrates the potential of QSAR modeling in accelerating drug discovery, offering a promising avenue for developing novel therapeutics targeting SmTGR to improve schistosomiasis treatment.</description>

      <title>QUBODock: A Pip-Installable QUBO Tool for Ligand Pose Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present QUBODock, a pip-installable tool that formulates ligand pose generation as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem and solves it efficiently on CPU or GPU. QUBODock focuses exclusively on pose generation and deliberately excludes any built-in scoring function, allowing researchers to pair its poses with external scorers of their choice. The software provides a minimal, reproducible interface for (i) protein-ligand structure ingestion and preprocessing, (ii) QUBO model construction from geometric/compatibility constraints, and (iii) decoding solutions into candidate poses for downstream ranking. Implemented in Python with GPU acceleration, QUBODock emphasizes usability and reproducibility: it is distributed on PyPI and can be installed with a single command. We release the source to support benchmarking, teaching, and method development around QUBO-based docking pose generation.</description>

      <title>FlowMol3: Flow Matching for 3D De Novo Small-Molecule Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A generative model capable of sampling realistic molecules with desired properties could accelerate chemical discovery across a wide range of applications. Toward this goal, significant effort has focused on developing models that jointly sample molecular topology and 3D structure. We present FlowMol3, an open-source, multi-modal flow matching model that advances the state of the art for all-atom, small-molecule generation. Its substantial performance gains over previous FlowMol versions are achieved without changes to the graph neural network architecture or the underlying flow matching formulation. Instead, FlowMol3's improvements arise from three architecture-agnostic techniques that incur negligible computational cost: self-conditioning, fake atoms, and train-time geometry distortion. FlowMol3 achieves nearly 100% molecular validity for drug-like molecules with explicit hydrogens, more accurately reproduces the functional group composition and geometry of its training data, and does so with an order of magnitude fewer learnable parameters than comparable methods. We hypothesize that these techniques mitigate a general pathology affecting transport-based generative models, enabling detection and correction of distribution drift during inference. Our results highlight simple, transferable strategies for improving the stability and quality of diffusion- and flow-based molecular generative models.</description>

      <title>Generative Modeling of Full-Atom Protein Conformations using Latent Diffusion on Graph Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17064v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generating diverse, all-atom conformational ensembles of dynamic proteins such as G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is critical for understanding their function, yet most generative models simplify atomic detail or ignore conformational diversity altogether. We present latent diffusion for full protein generation (LD-FPG), a framework that constructs complete all-atom protein structures, including every side-chain heavy atom, directly from molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories. LD-FPG employs a Chebyshev graph neural network (ChebNet) to obtain low-dimensional latent embeddings of protein conformations, which are processed using three pooling strategies: blind, sequential and residue-based. A diffusion model trained on these latent representations generates new samples that a decoder, optionally regularized by dihedral-angle losses, maps back to Cartesian coordinates. Using D2R-MD, a 2-microsecond MD trajectory (12 000 frames) of the human dopamine D2 receptor in a membrane environment, the sequential and residue-based pooling strategy reproduces the reference ensemble with high structural fidelity (all-atom lDDT of approximately 0.7; C-alpha-lDDT of approximately 0.8) and recovers backbone and side-chain dihedral-angle distributions with a Jensen-Shannon divergence of less than 0.03 compared to the MD data. LD-FPG thereby offers a practical route to system-specific, all-atom ensemble generation for large proteins, providing a promising tool for structure-based therapeutic design on complex, dynamic targets. The D2R-MD dataset and our implementation are freely available to facilitate further research.</description>
