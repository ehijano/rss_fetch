      <title>Sparse learning enabled by constraints on connectivity and function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparse connectivity is a hallmark of the brain and a desired property of artificial neural networks. It promotes energy efficiency, simplifies training, and enhances the robustness of network function. Thus, a detailed understanding of how to achieve sparsity without jeopardizing network performance is beneficial for neuroscience, deep learning, and neuromorphic computing applications. We used an exactly solvable model of associative learning to evaluate the effects of various sparsity-inducing constraints on connectivity and function. We determine the optimal level of sparsity achieved by the $l_0$ norm constraint and find that nearly the same efficiency can be obtained by eliminating weak connections. We show that this method of achieving sparsity can be implemented online, making it compatible with neuroscience and machine learning applications.</description>

      <title>Limits on the computational expressivity of non-equilibrium biophysical processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many biological decision-making processes can be viewed as performing a classification task over a set of inputs, using various chemical and physical processes as "biological hardware." In this context, it is important to understand the inherent limitations on the computational expressivity of classification functions instantiated in biophysical media. Here, we model biochemical networks as Markov jump processes and train them to perform classification tasks, allowing us to investigate their computational expressivity. We reveal several unanticipated limitations on the input-output functions of these systems, which we further show can be lifted using biochemical mechanisms like promiscuous binding. We analyze the flexibility and sharpness of decision boundaries as well as the classification capacity of these networks. Additionally, we identify distinctive signatures of networks trained for classification, including the emergence of correlated subsets of spanning trees and a creased "energy landscape" with multiple basins. Our findings have implications for understanding and designing physical computing systems in both biological and synthetic chemical settings.</description>

      <title>SciAgents: Automating scientific discovery through multi-agent intelligent graph reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key challenge in artificial intelligence is the creation of systems capable of autonomously advancing scientific understanding by exploring novel domains, identifying complex patterns, and uncovering previously unseen connections in vast scientific data. In this work, we present SciAgents, an approach that leverages three core concepts: (1) the use of large-scale ontological knowledge graphs to organize and interconnect diverse scientific concepts, (2) a suite of large language models (LLMs) and data retrieval tools, and (3) multi-agent systems with in-situ learning capabilities. Applied to biologically inspired materials, SciAgents reveals hidden interdisciplinary relationships that were previously considered unrelated, achieving a scale, precision, and exploratory power that surpasses traditional human-driven research methods. The framework autonomously generates and refines research hypotheses, elucidating underlying mechanisms, design principles, and unexpected material properties. By integrating these capabilities in a modular fashion, the intelligent system yields material discoveries, critique and improve existing hypotheses, retrieve up-to-date data about existing research, and highlights their strengths and limitations. Our case studies demonstrate scalable capabilities to combine generative AI, ontological representations, and multi-agent modeling, harnessing a `swarm of intelligence' similar to biological systems. This provides new avenues for materials discovery and accelerates the development of advanced materials by unlocking Nature's design principles.</description>

      <title>When resampling/reweighting improves feature learning in imbalanced classification?: A toy-model study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A toy model of binary classification is studied with the aim of clarifying the class-wise resampling/reweighting effect on the feature learning performance under the presence of class imbalance. In the analysis, a high-dimensional limit of the feature is taken while keeping the dataset size ratio against the feature dimension finite and the non-rigorous replica method from statistical mechanics is employed. The result shows that there exists a case in which the no resampling/reweighting situation gives the best feature learning performance irrespectively of the choice of losses or classifiers, supporting recent findings in Cao et al. (2019); Kang et al. (2019). It is also revealed that the key of the result is the symmetry of the loss and the problem setting. Inspired by this, we propose a further simplified model exhibiting the same property for the multiclass setting. These clarify when the class-wise resampling/reweighting becomes effective in imbalanced classification.</description>

      <title>Structural Analysis of Amorphous GeO$_2$ under High Pressure Using Reverse Monte Carlo Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The structural properties of amorphous GeO$_2$, a prototypical network glass, were investigated under ambient to high pressure using reverse Monte Carlo simulations based on reported structure factors from in situ high-pressure neutron diffraction experiments with isotopic substitution. The results indicate the retention of the topological structure containing predominantly tetrahedral GeO$_4$ units up to ca.~\SI{4}{\giga\pascal} ($\rho/\rho_0 = 1.15$), which is explained by the reduction of cavity volumes. With further application of pressure, an increase in the number of GeO$_5$ units is first observed, which is then followed more gradually by an increase in the number of GeO$_6$ units.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised machine learning for detecting mutual independence among eigenstate regimes in interacting quasiperiodic chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06253v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many-body eigenstates that are neither thermal nor many-body-localized (MBL) were numerically found in certain interacting chains with moderate quasiperiodic potentials. The energy regime consisting of these non-ergodic but extended (NEE) eigenstates has been extensively studied for being a possible many-body mobility edge between the energy-resolved MBL and thermal phases. Recently, the NEE regime was further proposed to be a prethermal phenomenon that generally occurs when different operators spread at sizably different timescales. Here, we numerically examine the mutual independence among the NEE, MBL, and thermal regimes in the lens of eigenstate entanglement spectra (ES). Given the complexity and rich information embedded in ES, we develop an unsupervised learning approach that is designed to quantify the mutual independence among general phases. Our method is first demonstrated on an illustrative toy example that uses RGB color data to represent phases, then applied to the ES of an interacting generalized Aubry Andre model from weak to strong potential strength. We find that while the MBL and thermal regimes are mutually independent, the NEE regime is dependent on the former two and smoothly appears as the potential strength decreases. We attribute our numerically finding to the fact that the ES data in the NEE regime exhibits both an MBL-like fast decay and a thermal-like long tail.</description>

      <title>Efficient Classical Shadow Tomography through Many-body Localization Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.01258v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classical shadow tomography serves as a potent tool for extracting numerous properties from quantum many-body systems with minimal measurements. Nevertheless, prevailing methods yielding optimal performance for few-body operators necessitate the application of random two-qubit gates, a task that can prove challenging on specific quantum simulators such as ultracold atomic gases. In this work, we introduce an alternative approach founded on the dynamics of many-body localization, a phenomenon extensively demonstrated in optical lattices. Through an exploration of the shadow norm -- both analytically, employing a phenomenological model, and numerically, utilizing the TEBD algorithm -- we demonstrate that our scheme achieves remarkable efficiency comparable to shallow circuits or measurement-induced criticality, resulting in a significant improvement in the exponential exponent compared to the previous classical shadow protocol. Our findings are corroborated through direct numerical simulations encompassing the entire sampling and reconstruction processes. Consequently, our results present a compelling methodology for analyzing the output states of quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Fermionic Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19032v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce fermionic machine learning (FermiML), a machine learning framework based on fermionic quantum computation. FermiML models are expressed in terms of parameterized matchgate circuits, a restricted class of quantum circuits that map exactly to systems of free Majorana fermions. The FermiML framework allows for building fermionic counterparts of any quantum machine learning (QML) model based on parameterized quantum circuits, including models that produce highly entangled quantum states. Importantly, matchgate circuits are efficiently simulable classically, thus rendering FermiML a flexible framework for utility benchmarks of QML methods on large real-world datasets. We initiate the exploration of FermiML by benchmarking it against unrestricted PQCs in the context of classification with random quantum kernels. Through experiments on standard datasets (Digits and Wisconsin Breast Cancer), we demonstrate that FermiML kernels are on-par with unrestricted PQC kernels in classification tasks using support-vector machines. Furthermore, we find that FermiML kernels outperform their unrestricted candidates on multi-class classification, including on datasets with several tens of relevant features. We thus show how FermiML enables us to explore regimes previously inaccessible to QML methods.</description>

      <title>Higher-order topology protected by latent crystalline symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02704v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that rotation symmetry is not a necessary requirement for the existence of fractional corner charges in Cn-symmetric higher-order topological crystalline insulators. Instead, it is sufficient to have a latent rotation symmetry, which may be revealed upon performing an isospectral reduction on the system. We introduce the concept of a filling anomaly for latent crystalline symmetric systems, and propose modified topological invariants. The notion of higher-order topology in two dimensions protected by Cn symmetry is thus generalized to a protection by latent symmetry. Our claims are corroborated by concrete examples of models that show non-trivial corner charge in the absence of Cn-symmetry. This work extends the classification of topological crystalline insulators to include latent symmetries.</description>

      <title>Holographic reconstruction of black hole spacetime: machine learning and entanglement entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07395v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the bulk reconstruction of AdS black hole spacetime emergent from quantum entanglement within a machine learning framework. Utilizing neural ordinary differential equations alongside Monte-Carlo integration, we develop a method tailored for continuous training functions to extract the general isotropic bulk metric from entanglement entropy data. To validate our approach, we first apply our machine learning algorithm to holographic entanglement entropy data derived from the Gubser-Rocha and superconductor models, which serve as representative models of strongly coupled matters in holography. Our algorithm successfully extracts the corresponding bulk metrics from these data. Additionally, we extend our methodology to many-body systems by employing entanglement entropy data from a fermionic tight-binding chain at half filling, exemplifying critical one-dimensional systems, and derive the associated bulk metric. We find that the metrics for a tight-binding chain and the Gubser-Rocha model are similar. We speculate this similarity is due to the metallic property of these models.</description>
