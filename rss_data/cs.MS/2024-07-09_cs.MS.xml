      <title>Minimization of Nonlinear Energies in Python Using FEM and Automatic Differentiation Tools</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This contribution examines the capabilities of the Python ecosystem to solve nonlinear energy minimization problems, with a particular focus on transitioning from traditional MATLAB methods to Python's advanced computational tools, such as automatic differentiation. We demonstrate Python's streamlined approach to minimizing nonlinear energies by analyzing three problem benchmarks - the p-Laplacian, the Ginzburg-Landau model, and the Neo-Hookean hyperelasticity. This approach merely requires the provision of the energy functional itself, making it a simple and efficient way to solve this category of problems. The results show that the implementation is about ten times faster than the MATLAB implementation for large-scale problems. Our findings highlight Python's efficiency and ease of use in scientific computing, establishing it as a preferable choice for implementing sophisticated mathematical models and accelerating the development of numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Disciplined Geodesically Convex Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Convex programming plays a fundamental role in machine learning, data science, and engineering. Testing convexity structure in nonlinear programs relies on verifying the convexity of objectives and constraints. \citet{grant2006disciplined} introduced a framework, Disciplined Convex Programming (DCP), for automating this verification task for a wide range of convex functions that can be decomposed into basic convex functions (atoms) using convexity-preserving compositions and transformations (rules). However, the restriction to Euclidean convexity concepts can limit the applicability of the framework. For instance, many notable instances of statistical estimators and matrix-valued (sub)routines in machine learning applications are Euclidean non-convex, but exhibit geodesic convexity through a more general Riemannian lens. In this work, we extend disciplined programming to this setting by introducing Disciplined Geodesically Convex Programming (DGCP). We determine convexity-preserving compositions and transformations for geodesically convex functions on general Cartan-Hadamard manifolds, as well as for the special case of symmetric positive definite matrices, a common setting in matrix-valued optimization. For the latter, we also define a basic set of atoms. Our paper is accompanied by a Julia package SymbolicAnalysis.jl, which provides functionality for testing and certifying DGCP-compliant expressions. Our library interfaces with manifold optimization software, which allows for directly solving verified geodesically convex programs.</description>

      <title>Redistributor: Transforming Empirical Data Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.14219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.14219v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an algorithm and package, Redistributor, which forces a collection of scalar samples to follow a desired distribution. When given independent and identically distributed samples of some random variable $S$ and the continuous cumulative distribution function of some desired target $T$, it provably produces a consistent estimator of the transformation $R$ which satisfies $R(S)=T$ in distribution. As the distribution of $S$ or $T$ may be unknown, we also include algorithms for efficiently estimating these distributions from samples. This allows for various interesting use cases in image processing, where Redistributor serves as a remarkably simple and easy-to-use tool that is capable of producing visually appealing results. For color correction it outperforms other model-based methods and excels in achieving photorealistic style transfer, surpassing deep learning methods in content preservation. The package is implemented in Python and is optimized to efficiently handle large datasets, making it also suitable as a preprocessing step in machine learning. The source code is available at https://github.com/paloha/redistributor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.05244v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we propose a modification to the invariant polytope algorithm (ipa) using ideas of the finite expressible tree algorithm (feta) by M\"oller and Reif. We show that our new feta-flavoured-ipa applies to a wider range of matrix families.</description>
