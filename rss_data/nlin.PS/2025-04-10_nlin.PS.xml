      <title>Fractional Bloch oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the effect of fractionality on the bloch oscillations (BO) of a 1D tight-binding lattice when the discrete Laplacian is replaced by its fractional form. We obtain the eigenmodes and the dynamic propagation of an initially localized excitation in closed form as a function of the fractional exponent and the strength of the external potential. We find an oscillation period equal to that of the non-fractional case. The participation ratio is computed in closed form and it reveals that localization of the modes increases with a deviation from the standard case, and with an increase of the external constant field. When nonlinear effects are included, a competition between the tendency to Bloch oscillate, and the trapping tendency typical of the Kerr effect is observed, which ultimately obliterates the BO in the limit of large nonlinearity.</description>

      <title>Quantum hydrodynamics of a polariton fluid: pure energy relaxation terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cavity polaritons, hybrid half-light half-matter excitations in quantum microcavities in the strong-coupling regime demonstrate clear signatures of quantum collective behavior, such as analogues of BEC and superfluidity at surprisingly high temperatures. The analysis of the formation of these states demands an account of the relaxation processes in the system. Although there are well-established approaches for the description of some of them, such as finite lifetime polariton, an external optical pump, and coupling with an incoherent excitonic reservoir, the treatment of pure energy relaxation in a polariton fluid still remains a puzzle. Here, based on the quantum hydrodynamics approach, we derive the corresponding equations where the energy relaxation term appears naturally. We analyze in detail how it affects the dynamics of polariton droplets and the dispersion of elementary excitations of a uniform polariton condensate. Although we focus on the case of cavity polaritons, our approach can be applied to other cases of bosonic condensates, where the processes of energy relaxation play an important role.</description>

      <title>Low Regularity of Self-Similar Solutions of Two-Dimensional Riemann problems with Shocks for the Isentropic Euler system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We are concerned with the low regularity of self-similar solutions of two-dimensional Riemann problems for the isentropic Euler system. We establish a general framework for the analysis of the local regularity of such solutions for a class of two-dimensional Riemann problems for the isentropic Euler system, which includes the regular shock reflection problem, the Prandtl reflection problem, the Lighthill diffraction problem, and the four-shock Riemann problem. We prove that it is not possible that both the density and the velocity are in $H^1$ in the subsonic domain for the self-similar solutions of these problems in general. This indicates that the self-similar solutions of the Riemann problems with shocks for the isentropic Euler system are of much more complicated structure than those for the Euler system for potential flow; in particular, the density and the velocity are not necessarily continuous in the subsonic domain. The proof is based on a regularization of the isentropic Euler system to derive the transport equation for the vorticity, a renormalization argument extended to the case of domains with boundary, and DiPerna-Lions-type commutator estimates.</description>

      <title>Anomalous bulk-edge correspondence of nonlinear Rice-Mele model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02478v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bulk-edge correspondence (BEC) constitutes a fundamental concept within the domain of topological physics, elucidating the profound interplay between the topological invariants that characterize the bulk states and the emergent edge states. A recent highlight along this research line consists of establishing BEC under the eigenvalue's nonlinearity in a linear Hamiltonian by introducing auxiliary eigenvalues [\href{https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.132.126601}{ T. Isobe {\it et al.,} Phys. Rev. Lett. 132, 126601 (2024)}]. The purpose of this work aims to extend Isobe's analysis to uncover BEC of eigenvalue's nonlinearity in intrinsic nonlinear Hamiltonians. To achieve this, we numerically solve the nonlinear Rice-Mele (RM) model and identify two distinct types of nonlinear eigenvalues: the intrinsically nonlinear eigenvalues and the eigenvalue's nonlinearity introduced through the incorporation of auxiliary eigenvalues. Furthermore, we establish a novel form of BEC based on these auxiliary nonlinear eigenvalues, which we term the anomalous BEC of a nonlinear physical system. The concept of the anomalous BEC defined herein provides a novel perspective on the intricate interplay between topology and nonlinearity in the context of BEC.</description>
