      <title>Score-Based Diffusion Models for Photoacoustic Tomography Image Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photoacoustic tomography (PAT) is a rapidly-evolving medical imaging modality that combines optical absorption contrast with ultrasound imaging depth. One challenge in PAT is image reconstruction with inadequate acoustic signals due to limited sensor coverage or due to the density of the transducer array. Such cases call for solving an ill-posed inverse reconstruction problem. In this work, we use score-based diffusion models to solve the inverse problem of reconstructing an image from limited PAT measurements. The proposed approach allows us to incorporate an expressive prior learned by a diffusion model on simulated vessel structures while still being robust to varying transducer sparsity conditions.</description>

      <title>Restriction-induced time-dependent transcytolemmal water exchange: Revisiting the K\"arger exchange model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The K\"arger model and its derivatives have been widely used to incorporate transcytolemmal water exchange rate, an essential characteristic of living cells, into analyses of diffusion MRI (dMRI) signals from tissues. The K\"arger model consists of two homogeneous exchanging components coupled by an exchange rate constant and assumes measurements are made with sufficiently long diffusion time and slow water exchange. Despite successful applications, it remains unclear whether these assumptions are generally valid for practical dMRI sequences and biological tissues. In particular, barrier-induced restrictions to diffusion produce inhomogeneous magnetization distributions in relatively large-sized compartments such as cancer cells, violating the above assumptions. The effects of this inhomogeneity are usually overlooked. We performed computer simulations to quantify how restriction effects, which in images produce edge enhancements at compartment boundaries, influence different variants of the K\"arger-model. The results show that the edge enhancement effect will produce larger, time-dependent estimates of exchange rates in e.g., tumors with relatively large cell sizes (&gt;10 {\mu}m), resulting in overestimations of water exchange as previously reported. Moreover, stronger diffusion gradients, longer diffusion gradient durations, and larger cell sizes, all cause more pronounced edge enhancement effects. This helps us to better understand the feasibility of the K\"arger model in estimating water exchange in different tissue types and provides useful guidance on signal acquisition methods that may mitigate the edge enhancement effect. This work also indicates the need to correct the overestimated transcytolemmal water exchange rates obtained assuming the K\"arger-model.</description>

      <title>Designing gradient coils with the shape derivative and the closed B-spline curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes a versatile and efficient optimisation method for discrete coils that induce a magnetic field by their steady currents. The prime target is gradient coils for MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging). The derivative (gradient) of the $z$-component the magnetic field, which is calculated by the Biot--Savart's law, with respect to the $z$-coordinate in the Cartesian $xyz$ coordinate system is considered as the objective function. Then, the derivative of the objective function with respect to a change of coils in shape is formulated according to the concept of shape optimisation. The resulting shape derivative (as well as the Biot--Savart's law) is smoothly discretised with the closed B-spline curves. In this case, the control points (CPs) of the curves are naturally selected as the design variables. As a consequence, the shape derivative is discretised to the sensitivities of the objective function with respect to the CPs. Those sensitivities are available to solve the present shape-optimisation problem with a certain gradient-based nonlinear-programming solver. The numerical examples exhibit the mathematical reliability, computational efficiency, and engineering applicability of the proposed methodology based on the shape derivative/sensitivities and the closed B-spline curves.</description>

      <title>Yet anOther Dose Algorithm (YODA) for independent computations of dose and dose changes due to anatomical changes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $\textbf{Purpose:}$ To assess the viability of a physics-based, deterministic and adjoint-capable algorithm for performing treatment planning system independent dose calculations and for computing dosimetric differences caused by anatomical changes.
  $\textbf{Methods:}$ A semi-numerical approach is employed to solve two partial differential equations for the proton phase-space density which determines the deposited dose. Lateral hetereogeneities are accounted for by an optimized (Gaussian) beam splitting scheme. Adjoint theory is applied to approximate the change in the deposited dose caused by a new underlying patient anatomy.
  $\textbf{Results:}$ The quality of the dose engine was benchmarked through three-dimensional gamma index comparisons against Monte Carlo simulations done in TOPAS. The worst passing rate for the gamma index with (1 mm, 1 %, 10 % dose cut-off) criteria is 95.62 %. The effect of delivering treatment plans on repeat CTs was also tested. For a non-robustly optimized plan the adjoint component was accurate to 6.2 % while for a robustly optimized plan it was accurate to 1 %.
  $\textbf{Conclusions:}$ YODA is capable of accurate dose computations in both single and multi spot irradiations when compared to TOPAS. Moreover, it is able to compute dosimetric differences due to anatomical changes with small to moderate errors thereby facilitating its use for patient-specific quality assurance in online adaptive proton therapy.</description>

      <title>Automated HER2 Scoring in Breast Cancer Images Using Deep Learning and Pyramid Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is a critical protein in cancer cell growth that signifies the aggressiveness of breast cancer (BC) and helps predict its prognosis. Accurate assessment of immunohistochemically (IHC) stained tissue slides for HER2 expression levels is essential for both treatment guidance and understanding of cancer mechanisms. Nevertheless, the traditional workflow of manual examination by board-certified pathologists encounters challenges, including inter- and intra-observer inconsistency and extended turnaround times. Here, we introduce a deep learning-based approach utilizing pyramid sampling for the automated classification of HER2 status in IHC-stained BC tissue images. Our approach analyzes morphological features at various spatial scales, efficiently managing the computational load and facilitating a detailed examination of cellular and larger-scale tissue-level details. This method addresses the tissue heterogeneity of HER2 expression by providing a comprehensive view, leading to a blind testing classification accuracy of 84.70%, on a dataset of 523 core images from tissue microarrays. Our automated system, proving reliable as an adjunct pathology tool, has the potential to enhance diagnostic precision and evaluation speed, and might significantly impact cancer treatment planning.</description>

      <title>AutoMRISimQA: an automated system for daily quality control of a 3T MRI simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17365v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A software system named AutoMRISimQA was developed to monitor the daily performance of a wide-bore 3T scanner(MRI) which was designed and dedicated to radiotherapy simulation. The system can monitor the performance of the MRI simulator not only by using image quality indices such as signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), uniformity, ghosting and contrast but also performing a quick check of geometry accuracy as well as the external lasers quantitatively. It was implemented into the daily clinically workflow in 2013 and has been used for more than 10 years. It was also seamlessly integrated with QAtrack, allowing continuous monitoring of the consistency of the MRI simulator's performance.</description>

      <title>IQMDose3D: a software tool for reconstructing the dose in patient using patient planning CT images and the signals measured by IQM detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17394v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The integral quality monitor (IQM) system compares the signal measured with a large volume chamber mounted to the linear accelerator's head to the signal calculated using the patient DICOM RT plan for patient-specific quality assurance (PSQA). A method was developed to reconstruct the dose in patients using the signal measured by IQM chamber and patient planning CT images. A software tool named IQMDose3D was implemented to automate this procedure and integrated into the IQM-based PSQA workflow. IQMDose3D enables the physicists to evaluate PSQA by focusing on the clinical perspective by comparing the delivered plan to the approved clinical plan in terms of the clinical goals, dose-volume histogram (DVH) in addition to the three-dimensional (3D) gamma map and gamma pass rate.</description>

      <title>Polarization-artifact reduction and accuracy improvement of Jones-matrix polarization-sensitive optical coherence tomography by multi-focus averaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12761v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Polarization-sensitive optical coherence tomography (PS-OCT) is a promising biomedical imaging tool for differentiation of various tissue properties. However, the presence of multiple-scattering (MS) signals can degrade the quantitative polarization measurement accuracy. We demonstrate a method to reduce MS signals and increase the measurement accuracy of Jones matrix PS-OCT. This method suppresses MS signals by averaging of multiple Jones matrix volumes measured using different focal positions. The MS signals are decorrelated among the volumes by focus position modulation and are thus reduced by averaging. However, the single scattering signals are kept consistent among the focus-modulated volumes by computational refocusing. We validated the proposed method using a scattering phantom and a postmortem medaka fish. The results showed reduced artifacts in birefringence and degree-of-polarization uniformity measurements, particularly in deeper regions in the samples. This method offers a practical solution to mitigate MS-induced artifacts in PS-OCT imaging and improves quantitative polarization measurement accuracy.</description>
