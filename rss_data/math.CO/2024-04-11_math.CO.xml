      <title>Penney's game for permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the permutation analogue of Penney's game for words. Two players, in order, each choose a permutation of length $k\ge3$; then a sequence of independent random values from a continuous distribution is generated, until the relative order of the last $k$ numbers coincides with one of the chosen permutations, making that player the winner.
  We compute the winning probabilities for all pairs of permutations of length 3 and some pairs of length 4, showing that, as in the original version for words, the game is non-transitive. Our proofs introduce new bijections for consecutive patterns in permutations. We also give some formulas to compute the winning probabilities more generally, and conjecture a winning strategy for the second player when $k$ is arbitrary.</description>

      <title>Extremes of generalized inversions on symmetric groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical inversion statistic on symmetric groups is the sum of all indicators $\textbf{1}\{\pi(i) &gt; \pi(j)\}$ for a random permutation $\pi = (\pi(1), \ldots, \pi(n))$ and the pairs $(i,j)$ with $1 \leq i &lt; j \leq n$. The descent statistic counts all $i \in \{1, \ldots, n-1\}$ with $\pi(i) &gt; \pi(i+1)$. The number of inversions can be generalized by restricting the indicators to pairs $(i,j)$ with $i&lt;j$ and $|i-j| \leq d$ for some $d \in \{1, \ldots, n-1\}$. Likewise, the number of descents can be generalized by counting all $i \in \{1, \ldots, n-d\}$ with $\pi(i) &gt; \pi(i+d)$. These generalized statistics can be further extended to the signed and even-signed permutation groups. The bandwidth index $d$ can be chosen in dependence of $n$, and the magnitude of $d$ is significant for asymptotic considerations. It is known that each of these statistics is asymptotically normal for suitable choices of $d$. In this paper we prove the bivariate asymptotic normality and determine the extreme value asymptotics of generalized inversions and descents.</description>

      <title>A Family of Slow Exact $k$-Nim Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Slow Exact $k$-Nim is a variant of the well-known game of Nim. The rules of this variant are that in each move, $k$ of the $n$ stacks are selected and then one token is removed from each of the $k$ stacks. We will extend known results by proving results on the structure of the P-positions for the infinite family of Slow Exact $k$-Nim games where we play on all but one of the $n$ stacks. In addition, we will introduce a more general family of "slow" Nim variants, Slow SetNim($n$,$A$) which specifies the allowed moves via the set $A$. This family of games contains both Slow Exact $k$-Nim and the slow version of Moore's $k$-Nim. We give results for the infinite family of Slow SetNim($n$,$A$) for $A=\{n-1,n\}$, whose P-positions are closely related to those of Slow Exact $k$-Nim for $k=n-1$.</description>

      <title>Spectral expansion properties of pseudorandom bipartite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An $(a,b)$-biregular bipartite graph is a bipartite graph with bipartition $(X, Y)$ such that each vertex in $X$ has degree $a$ and each vertex in $Y$ has degree $b$. By the bipartite expander mixing lemma, biregular bipartite graphs have nice pseudorandom and expansion properties when the second largest adjacency eigenvalue is not large. In this paper, we prove several explicit properties of biregular bipartite graphs from spectral perspectives. In particular, we show that for any $(a,b)$-biregular bipartite graph $G$, if the spectral gap is greater than $\frac{2(k-1)}{\sqrt{(a+1)(b+1)}}$, then $G$ is $k$-edge-connected; and if the spectral gap is at least $\frac{2k}{\sqrt{(a+1)(b+1)}}$, then $G$ has at least $k$ edge-disjoint spanning trees. We also prove that if the spectral gap is at least $\frac{(k-1)\max\{a,b\}}{2\sqrt{ab - (k-1)\max\{a,b\}}}$, then $G$ is $k$-connected for $k\ge 2$; and if the spectral gap is at least $\frac{6k+2\max\{a,b\}}{\sqrt{(a-1)(b-1)}}$, then $G$ has at least $k$ edge-disjoint spanning 2-connected subgraphs. We have stronger results in the paper.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $H_7$ denote the $7$-vertex \textit{fan graph} consisting of a $6$-vertex path plus a vertex adjacent to each vertex of the path. Let $K_3 \vee \frac{m-3}{3}K_1$ be the graph obtained by joining each vertex of a triangle $K_3$ to $\frac{m-3}{3}$ isolated vertices. In this paper, we show that if $G$ is an $H_{7}$-free graph with size $m\geq 33$, then the spectral radius $ \rho(G)\leq 1+\sqrt{m-2},$ equality holds if and only if $G\cong K_3 \vee \frac{m-3}{3}K_1$ (possibly, with some isolated vertices).</description>

      <title>Large sets near idempotent and its product</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tootkaboni and Vahed introduced the notion of some large sets near idempotent along with some combinatorial properties. We characterize when the finite Cartesian product of central sets near idempotent is central near idempotent. Moreover, we provide a partial characterization for the infinite Cartesian product of the same. We then study the abundance of some large sets near idempotent. We also investigate the effect of tensor product near zero. Finally, as an application we provide a characterization of members of polynomials (with constant term 0) evaluated at idempotents in a near zero semigroup.</description>

      <title>On degree power sum in $P_k$-free graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a graph on $n$ vertices with degree sequence $(d_1,d_2......d_n)$. For a real $p \geq 1$, let $D_p(G)=\sum_{i=1}^nd_i^p$. A Tur\'an-type problem of degree power sum was initiated by Caro and Yuster \cite{caro2000degpower}: determining the function $D_p(n,H) :=\max \{D_p(G): \text{$G$ is an $n$-vertex $H$-free graph}\}$. They obtained some exact values for certain graphs $H$. For a path $P_k$, they mentioned that ``a close examination of the proof of Theorem 1.2 shows that the value of $n_0(k)$ in the statement of the theorem is $O(k^2)$", namely, they could show the $n$-vertex $P_k$-free graph with maximum degree power sum is $W_{n,k-1,\lfloor \frac{k}{2} \rfloor -1} = K_{\lfloor \frac{k}{2} \rfloor -1} \vee \left((n - \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil)K_1 \cup K_{1+k-2\lfloor \frac{k}{2} \rfloor} \right)$ when $n \geq c k^2$ for some constant $c$. In this note, we improve their result to a linear size of $k$ by a different approach. The bound is tight up to a constant factor.</description>

      <title>On the existence of $\delta$-temporal cliques in random simple temporal graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider random simple temporal graphs in which every edge of the complete graph $K_n$ appears once within the time interval [0,1] independently and uniformly at random. Our main result is a sharp threshold on the size of any maximum $\delta$-clique (namely a clique with edges appearing at most $\delta$ apart within [0,1]) in random instances of this model, for any constant~$\delta$. In particular, using the probabilistic method, we prove that the size of a maximum $\delta$-clique is approximately $\frac{2\log{n}}{\log{\frac{1}{\delta}}}$ with high probability (whp). What seems surprising is that, even though the random simple temporal graph contains $\Theta(n^2)$ overlapping $\delta$-windows, which (when viewed separately) correspond to different random instances of the Erdos-Renyi random graphs model, the size of the maximum $\delta$-clique in the former model and the maximum clique size of the latter are approximately the same. Furthermore, we show that the minimum interval containing a $\delta$-clique is $\delta-o(\delta)$ whp. We use this result to show that any polynomial time algorithm for $\delta$-TEMPORAL CLIQUE is unlikely to have very large probability of success.</description>

      <title>Good bounds for sets lacking skew corners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A skew corner is a triple of points in $\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}$ of the form $(x,y), (x, y + a)$ and $(x + a, y')$. Pratt posed the following question: how large can a set $A \subseteq [n] \times [n]$ be, provided it contains no non-trivial skew corner (i.e. one for which $a\not=0$)? We prove that $|A| \leq \exp(- c\log^c n) n^2$, for an absolute constant $c &gt; 0$, which, along with a construction of Beker, essentially resolves Pratt's question.
  Our argument is represents a two-dimensional variant of the method of Kelley and Meka, which they used to prove Behrend-type bounds in Roth's theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a finite ring with identity. The unit graph (unitary Cayley graph) of $R$ is the graph with vertex set $R$, where two distinct vertices $x$ and $y$ are adjacent exactly whenever $x+y$ is a unit in $R$ ($x-y$ is a unit in $R$). Here, we study independent sets of unit graphs of matrix rings over finite fields and use them to characterize all finite rings for which the unit graph is well-covered or Cohen-Macaulay. Moreover, we show that the unit graph of $R$ is well-covered if and only if the unitary Cayley graph of $R$ is well-covered and the characteristic of $R/J(R)$</description>

      <title>Edge-disjoint cycles with the same vertex set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1975, Erd\H{o}s asked for the maximum number of edges that an $n$-vertex graph can have if it does not contain two edge-disjoint cycles on the same vertex set. It is known that Tur\'an-type results can be used to prove an upper bound of $n^{3/2+o(1)}$. However, this approach cannot give an upper bound better than $\Omega(n^{3/2})$. We show that, for any $k\geq 2$, every $n$-vertex graph with at least $n \cdot \mathrm{polylog}(n)$ edges contains $k$ pairwise edge-disjoint cycles with the same vertex set, resolving this old problem in a strong form up to a polylogarithmic factor. The well-known construction of Pyber, R\"odl and Szemer\'edi of graphs without $4$-regular subgraphs shows that there are $n$-vertex graphs with $\Omega(n\log \log n)$ edges which do not contain two cycles with the same vertex set, so the polylogarithmic term in our result cannot be completely removed.
  Our proof combines a variety of techniques including sublinear expanders, absorption and a novel tool for regularisation, which is of independent interest. Among other applications, this tool can be used to regularise an expander while still preserving certain key expansion properties.</description>

      <title>Beyond trees: the metric geometry of subsets of weighted Hamming cubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Associated to any finite metric space are a large number of objects and quantities which provide some degree of structural or geometric information about the space. In this paper we show that in the setting of subsets of weighted Hamming cubes there are unexpected relationships between many of these quantities. We obtain in particular formulas for the determinant of the distance matrix, the $M$-constant and the cofactor sum for such spaces. This work extends previous results for unweighted metric trees, and more generally, for subsets of standard Hamming cubes, as well as results for weighted metric trees. Finally we consider polygonal equalities in these spaces, giving a complete description of nontrivial $1$-polygonal equalities that can arise in weighted Hamming cubes.</description>

      <title>Bigraded path homology and the magnitude-path spectral sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two important invariants of directed graphs, namely magnitude homology and path homology, have recently been shown to be intimately connected: there is a 'magnitude-path spectral sequence' or 'MPSS' in which magnitude homology appears as the first page, and in which path homology appears as an axis of the second page. In this paper we study the homological and computational properties of the spectral sequence, and in particular of the full second page, which we now call 'bigraded path homology'. We demonstrate that every page of the MPSS deserves to be regarded as a homology theory in its own right, satisfying excision and Kunneth theorems (along with a homotopy invariance property already established by Asao), and that magnitude homology and bigraded path homology also satisfy Mayer-Vietoris theorems. We construct a homotopy theory of graphs (in the form of a cofibration category structure) in which weak equivalences are the maps inducing isomorphisms on bigraded path homology, strictly refining an existing structure based on ordinary path homology. And we provide complete computations of the MPSS for two important families of graphs - the directed and bi-directed cycles - which demonstrate the power of both the MPSS, and bigraded path homology in particular, to distinguish graphs that ordinary path homology cannot.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given two irreducible conics $C$ and $D$ over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$ with $q$ odd, we show that there are $q^2/4+O(q^{3/2})$ points $P$ in $\mathbb{P}^2(\mathbb{F}_q)$ such that $P$ is external to $C$ and internal to $D$. This answers a question of Korchm\'{a}ros. We also prove the analogous result for higher-dimensional smooth quadric hypersurfaces over $\mathbb{P}^{n-1}$ with $n$ odd, where the answer is $q^{n-1}/4+O(q^{n-\frac{3}{2}})$.</description>

      <title>Transcendence properties of the Artin-Hasse exponential modulo $p$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $E_p(x)$ denote the Artin-Hasse exponential and let $\overline{E}_p(x)$ denote its reduction modulo $p$ in $\mathbb{F}_p[[x]]$. In this article we study transcendence properties of $\overline{E}_p(x)$ over $\mathbb{F}_p[x]$. We give two proofs that $\overline{E}_p(x)$ is transcendental, affirmatively answering a question of Thakur. We also prove algebraic independence results: i) for $f_1,\dots,f_r \in x\mathbb{F}_p[x]$ satisfying certain linear independence properties, we show that the $\overline{E}_p(f_1), \dots, \overline{E}_p(f_r)$ are algebraically independent over $\mathbb{F}_p[x]$ and ii) we determine the algebraic relations between $\overline{E}_p(cx)$, where $c \in \mathbb{F}_p^\times$. Our proof studies the higher derivatives of $\overline{E}_p(x)$ and makes use of iterative differential Galois theory.</description>

      <title>Quiver Laplacians and Feature Selection</title>

Abstract: The challenge of selecting the most relevant features of a given dataset arises ubiquitously in data analysis and dimensionality reduction. However, features found to be of high importance for the entire dataset may not be relevant to subsets of interest, and vice versa. Given a feature selector and a fixed decomposition of the data into subsets, we describe a method for identifying selected features which are compatible with the decomposition into subsets. We achieve this by re-framing the problem of finding compatible features to one of finding sections of a suitable quiver representation. In order to approximate such sections, we then introduce a Laplacian operator for quiver representations valued in Hilbert spaces. We provide explicit bounds on how the spectrum of a quiver Laplacian changes when the representation and the underlying quiver are modified in certain natural ways. Finally, we apply this machinery to the study of peak-calling algorithms which measure chromatin accessibility in single-cell data. We demonstrate that eigenvectors of the associated quiver Laplacian yield locally and globally compatible features.</description>

      <title>Computing the $D$-base and $D$-relation in finite closure systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Implicational bases (IBs) are a common representation of finite closure systems and lattices, along with meet-irreducible elements. They appear in a wide variety of fields ranging from logic and databases to Knowledge Space Theory. Different IBs can represent the same closure system. Therefore, several IBs have been studied, such as the canonical and canonical direct bases. In this paper, we investigate the $D$-base, a refinement of the canonical direct base. It is connected with the $D$-relation, an essential tool in the study of free lattices. The $D$-base demonstrates desirable algorithmic properties, and together with the $D$-relation, it conveys essential properties of the underlying closure system. Hence, computing the $D$-base and the $D$-relation of a closure system from another representation is crucial to enjoy its benefits. However, complexity results for this task are lacking. In this paper, we give algorithms and hardness results for the computation of the $D$-base and $D$-relation. Specifically, we establish the $NP$-completeness of finding the $D$-relation from an arbitrary IB; we give an output-quasi-polynomial time algorithm to compute the $D$-base from meet-irreducible elements; and we obtain a polynomial-delay algorithm computing the $D$-base from an arbitrary IB. These results complete the picture regarding the complexity of identifying the $D$-base and $D$-relation of a closure system.</description>

      <title>Forbidden induced subgraphs for graphs and signed graphs with eigenvalues bounded from below</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.10366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.10366v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The smallest eigenvalue of a graph is the smallest eigenvalue of its adjacency matrix. We show that the family of graphs with smallest eigenvalue at least $-\lambda$ can be defined by a finite set of forbidden induced subgraphs if and only if $\lambda &lt; \lambda^*$, where $\lambda^* = \rho^{1/2} + \rho^{-1/2} \approx 2.01980$, and $\rho$ is the unique real root of $x^3 = x + 1$. This resolves a question raised by Bussemaker and Neumaier. As a byproduct, we find all the limit points of smallest eigenvalues of graphs, supplementing Hoffman's work on those limit points in $[-2, \infty)$.
  We also prove that the same conclusion about forbidden subgraph characterization holds for signed graphs. Our impetus for the study of signed graphs is to determine the maximum cardinality of a spherical two-distance set with two fixed angles (one acute and one obtuse) in high dimensions. Denote by $N_{\alpha, \beta}(n)$ the maximum number of unit vectors in $\mathbb{R}^d$ where all pairwise inner products lie in $\{\alpha, \beta\}$ with $-1 \le \beta &lt; 0 \le \alpha &lt; 1$. Very recently Jiang, Tidor, Yao, Zhang and Zhao determined the limit of $N_{\alpha, \beta}(d)/d$ as $d\to\infty$ when $\alpha + 2\beta &lt; 0$ or $(1-\alpha)/(\alpha-\beta) \in \{1,\sqrt2,\sqrt3\}$, and they proposed a conjecture on the limit in terms of eigenvalue multiplicities of signed graphs. We establish their conjecture whenever $(1-\alpha)/(\alpha - \beta) &lt; \lambda^*$.</description>

Abstract: We characterize when the finite Cartesian product of central sets near idempotent is central near idempotent. Moreover, we provide a partial characterization for the infinite Cartesian product of the same. Then, we study the abundance of some large sets near idempotent. Also, we investigate the effect of tensor product near idempotent. Finally, as an application we provide the polynomial extension of Milliken-Taylor theorem near zero.</description>

      <title>Exact values for unbalanced Zarankiewicz numbers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2202.05507v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For positive integers $s$, $t$, $m$ and $n$, the Zarankiewicz number $Z_{s,t}(m,n)$ is defined to be the maximum number of edges in a bipartite graph with parts of sizes $m$ and $n$ that has no complete biparitite subgraph containing $s$ vertices in the part of size $m$ and $t$ vertices in the part of size $n$. A simple argument shows that, for each $t \geq 2$, $Z_{2,t}(m,n)=(t-1)\binom{m}{2}+n$ when $n \geq (t-1)\binom{m}{2}$. Here, for large $m$, we determine the exact value of $Z_{2,t}(m,n)$ in almost all of the remaining cases where $n=\Theta(tm^2)$. We establish a new family of upper bounds on $Z_{2,t}(m,n)$ which complement a family already obtained by Roman. We then prove that the floor of the best of these bounds is almost always achieved. We also show that there are cases in which this floor cannot be achieved and others in which determining whether it is achieved is likely a very hard problem. Our results are proved by viewing the problem through the lens of linear hypergraphs and our constructions make use of existing results on edge decompositions of dense graphs.</description>

      <title>Linear versus centred chromatic numbers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.15096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $\DeclareMathOperator{\chicen}{\chi_{\mathrm{cen}}}\DeclareMathOperator{\chilin}{\chi_{\mathrm{lin}}}$ A centred colouring of a graph is a vertex colouring in which every connected subgraph contains a vertex whose colour is unique and a \emph{linear colouring} is a vertex colouring in which every (not-necessarily induced) path contains a vertex whose colour is unique. For a graph $G$, the centred chromatic number $\chicen(G)$ and the linear chromatic number $\chilin(G)$ denote the minimum number of distinct colours required for a centred, respectively, linear colouring of $G$. From these definitions, it follows immediately that $\chilin(G)\le \chicen(G)$ for every graph $G$. The centred chromatic number is equivalent to treedepth and has been studied extensively. Much less is known about linear colouring. Kun et al [Algorithmica 83(1)] prove that $\chicen(G) \le \tilde{O}(\chilin(G)^{190})$ for any graph $G$ and conjecture that $\chicen(G)\le 2\chilin(G)$. Their upper bound was subsequently improved by Czerwinski et al [SIDMA 35(2)] to $\chicen(G)\le\tilde{O}(\chilin(G)^{19})$. The proof of both upper bounds relies on establishing a lower bound on the linear chromatic number of pseudogrids, which appear in the proof due to their critical relationship to treewidth. Specifically, Kun et al prove that $k\times k$ pseudogrids have linear chromatic number $\Omega(\sqrt{k})$. Our main contribution is establishing a tight bound on the linear chromatic number of pseudogrids, specifically $\chilin(G)\ge \Omega(k)$ for every $k\times k$ pseudogrid $G$. As a consequence we improve the general bound for all graphs to $\chicen(G)\le \tilde{O}(\chilin(G)^{10})$. In addition, this tight bound gives further evidence in support of Kun et al's conjecture (above) that the centred chromatic number of any graph is upper bounded by a linear function of its linear chromatic number.</description>

      <title>Percolation on High-dimensional Product Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.03722v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider percolation on high-dimensional product graphs, where the base graphs are regular and of bounded order. In the subcritical regime, we show that typically the largest component is of order logarithmic in the number of vertices. In the supercritical regime, our main result recovers the sharp asymptotic of the order of the largest component, and shows that all the other components are typically of order logarithmic in the number of vertices. In particular, we show that this phase transition is quantitatively similar to the one of the binomial random graph.
  This generalises the results of Ajtai, Koml\'os, and Szemer\'edi and of Bollob\'as, Kohayakawa, and \L{}uczak who showed that the $d$-dimensional hypercube, which is the $d$-fold Cartesian product of an edge, undergoes a phase transition quantitatively similar to the one of the binomial random graph.</description>

      <title>Expander graphs are globally synchronizing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.12788v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Kuramoto model is fundamental to the study of synchronization. It consists of a collection of oscillators with interactions given by a network, which we identify respectively with vertices and edges of a graph. In this paper, we show that a graph with sufficient expansion must be globally synchronizing, meaning that a homogeneous Kuramoto model of identical oscillators on such a graph will converge to the fully synchronized state with all the oscillators having the same phase, for every initial state up to a set of measure zero. In particular, we show that for any $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ and $p \geq (1 + \varepsilon) (\log n) / n$, the homogeneous Kuramoto model on the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph $G(n, p)$ is globally synchronizing with probability tending to one as $n$ goes to infinity. This improves on a previous result of Kassabov, Strogatz, and Townsend and solves a conjecture of Ling, Xu, and Bandeira. We also show that the model is globally synchronizing on any $d$-regular Ramanujan graph, and on typical $d$-regular graphs, for large enough degree $d$.</description>

      <title>Ordered unavoidable sub-structures in matchings and random matchings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.14042v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An ordered matching of size $n$ is a graph on a linearly ordered vertex set $V$, $|V|=2n$, consisting of $n$ pairwise disjoint edges. There are three different ordered matchings of size two on $V=\{1,2,3,4\}$: an alignment $\{1,2\},\{3,4\}$, a nesting $\{1,4\},\{2,3\}$, and a crossing $\{1,3\},\{2,4\}$. Accordingly, there are three basic homogeneous types of ordered matchings (with all pairs of edges arranged in the same way) which we call, respectively, lines, stacks, and waves.
  We prove an Erd\H{o}s-Szekeres type result guaranteeing in every ordered matching of size $n$ the presence of one of the three basic sub-structures of a given size. In particular, one of them must be of size at least $n^{1/3}$. We also investigate the size of each of the three sub-structures in a random ordered matching. Additionally, the former result is generalized to $3$-uniform ordered matchings.
  Another type of unavoidable patterns we study are twins, that is, pairs of order-isomorphic, disjoint sub-matchings. By relating to a similar problem for permutations, we prove that the maximum size of twins that occur in every ordered matching of size $n$ is $O\left(n^{2/3}\right)$ and $\Omega\left(n^{3/5}\right)$. We conjecture that the upper bound is the correct order of magnitude and confirm it for almost all matchings. In fact, our results for twins are proved more generally for $r$-multiple twins, $r\ge2$.</description>

Abstract: We offer a new structural basis for the theory of 3-connected graphs, providing a unique decomposition of every such graph into parts that are either quasi 4-connected, wheels, or thickened $K_{3,m}$'s. Our construction is explicit, canonical, and has the following applications: we obtain a new theorem characterising all Cayley graphs as either essentially 4-connected, cycles, or complete graphs on at most four vertices, and we provide an automatic proof of Tutte's wheel theorem.</description>

Abstract: Austrian Solitaire is a variation of Bulgarian Solitaire. It may be described as a card game, a method of asset inventory management, or a discrete dynamical system on integer partitions. We prove that the limit cycles in Austrian Solitaire do not depend on the initial configuration; in other words, each state space is connected. We show that a full Farey sequence completely characterizes these unique (and balanced) cycles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.11763v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hocquard, Kim, and Pierron constructed, for every even integer $D\ge 2$, a 2-degenerate graph $G_D$ with maximum degree $D$ such that $\omega(G_D^2)=\frac52D$. We prove for (a) all 2-degenerate graphs $G$ and (b) all graphs $G$ with $\mbox{mad}(G)&lt;4$, upper bounds on the clique number $\omega(G^2)$ of $G^2$ that match the lower bound given by this construction, up to small additive constants. We show that if $G$ is 2-degenerate with maximum degree $D$, then $\omega(G^2)\le \frac52D+72$ (with $\omega(G^2)\le \frac52D+60$ when $D$ is sufficiently large). And if $G$ has $\mbox{mad}(G)&lt;4$ and maximum degree $D$, then $\omega(G^2)\le \frac52D+532$. Thus, the construction of Hocquard et al. is essentially best possible. Our proofs introduce a "token passing" technique to derive crucial information about non-adjacencies in $G$ of vertices that are adjacent in $G^2$. This is a powerful technique for working with such graphs that has not previously appeared in the literature.</description>

Abstract: Fiol has characterized quotient-polynomial graphs as precisely the connected graphs whose adjacency matrix generates the adjacency algebra of a symmetric association scheme. We show that a collection of non-negative integer parameters of size $d + \frac{d(d-1)}{2}$ is adequate for describing symmetric association schemes of class $d$ that are generated by the adjacency matrix of their first non-trivial relation. We use this to generate a database of the corresponding quotient-polynomial graphs that have small valency and up to 6 classes, and among these find new feasible parameter sets for symmetric association schemes with noncyclotomic eigenvalues.</description>

Abstract: The study of symmetric structures is a new trend in Ramsey theory. Recently Di Nasso introduced a systematic study of symmetrization of classical Ramsey theoretical results and proved a symmetric version of several Ramsey theoretic results. In this paper Di Nasso asked if his method could be adapted to find new non-linear Diophantine equations that are partition regular. By analyzing additive, multiplicative, and symmetric large sets, we construct new partition regular equations that give a first affirmative answer to this question. Then we draw several new monochromatic patterns involving additive, multiplicative, and symmetric structures. Throughout our work, we use tools from the Algebra of the Stone-\v{C}ech Compactifications of discrete semigroups.</description>

      <title>Six-Vertex Model and Random Matrix Distributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.12495v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We survey the connections between the six-vertex (square ice) model of 2d statistical mechanics and random matrix theory. We highlight the same universal probability distributions appearing on both sides, and also indicate related open questions and conjectures. We present full proofs of two asymptotic theorems for the six-vertex model: in the first one the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble and GUE-corners process appear; the second one leads to the Tracy-Widom distribution $F_2$. While both results are not new, we found shorter transparent proofs for this text. On our way we introduce the key tools in the study of the six-vertex model, including the Yang-Baxter equation and the Izergin-Korepin formula.</description>

      <title>Charging solid partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02751v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solid partitions are the 4D generalization of the plane partitions in 3D and Young diagrams in 2D, and they can be visualized as stacking of 4D unit-size boxes in the positive corner of a 4D room. Physically, solid partitions arise naturally as 4D molten crystals that count equivariant D-brane BPS states on the simplest toric Calabi-Yau fourfold, $\mathbb{C}^4$, generalizing the 3D statement that plane partitions count equivariant D-brane BPS states on $\mathbb{C}^3$. In the construction of BPS algebras for toric Calabi-Yau threefolds, the so-called charge function on the 3D molten crystal is an important ingredient -- it is the generating function for the eigenvalues of an infinite tower of Cartan elements of the algebra. In this paper, we derive the charge function for solid partitions. Compared to the 3D case, the new feature is the appearance of contributions from certain 4-box and 5-box clusters, which will make the construction of the corresponding BPS algebra much more complicated than in the 3D.</description>

      <title>Improved bounds for five-term arithmetic progressions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10776v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $r_5(N)$ be the largest cardinality of a set in $\{1,\ldots,N\}$ which does not contain $5$ elements in arithmetic progression. Then there exists a constant $c\in (0,1)$ such that \[r_5(N)\ll \frac{N}{\exp((\log\log N)^{c})}.\] Our work is a consequence of recent improved bounds on the $U^4$-inverse theorem of the first author and the fact that $3$-step nilsequences may be approximated by locally cubic functions on shifted Bohr sets. This combined with the density increment strategy of Heath-Brown and Szemer{\'e}di, codified by Green and Tao, gives the desired result.</description>

      <title>From Zero-Freeness to Strong Spatial Mixing via a Christoffel-Darboux Type Identity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09317v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a unifying approach to derive the strong spatial mixing (SSM) property for the general 2-spin system from zero-free regions of its partition function. Our approach works for the multivariate partition function over all three complex parameters $(\beta, \gamma, \lambda)$, and we allow the zero-free regions of $\beta, \gamma$ or $\lambda$ to be of arbitrary shapes. As long as the zero-free region contains a positive point and it is a complex neighborhood of $\lambda=0$ when fixing $\beta, \gamma \in \mathbb{C}$, or a complex neighborhood of $\beta\gamma=1$ when fixing $\beta, \lambda\in \mathbb{C}$ or $\gamma, \lambda\in \mathbb{C}$ respectively, we are able to show that the corresponding 2-spin system exhibits SSM on such a region. The underlying graphs of the 2-spin system are not necessarily of bounded degree, while are required to include graphs with pinned vertices. We prove this result by establishing a Christoffel-Darboux type identity for the 2-spin system on trees. This identity plays an important role in our approach and is of its own interests. We also use certain tools from complex analysis such as Riemann mapping theorem.
  Our approach comprehensively turns all existing zero-free regions (to our best knowledge) of the partition function of the 2-spin system where pinned vertices are allowed into the SSM property. As a consequence, we obtain new SSM results for the 2-spin system beyond the direct argument for SSM based on tree recurrence. Moreover, we extend our approach to handle the 2-spin system with non-uniform external fields. As an application, we obtain a new SSM result for the non-uniform ferromagnetic Ising model from the celebrated Lee-Yang circle theorem.</description>

      <title>Polygonal corona limit on multigrid dual tilings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01257v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The growth pattern of an invasive cell-to-cell propagation (called the successive coronas) on the square grid is a tilted square. On the triangular and hexagonal grids, it is an hexagon. It is remarkable that, on the aperiodic structure of Penrose tilings, this cell-to-cell diffusion process tends to a regular decagon (at the limit). In this article we generalize this result to any regular multigrid dual tiling, by defining the characteristic polygon of a multigrid and its dual tiling. Exploiting this elegant duality allows to fully understand why such surprising phenomena, of seeing highly regular polygonal shapes emerge from aperiodic underlying structures, happen.</description>

      <title>New cluster algebras from old: integrability beyond Zamolodchikov periodicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00721v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider discrete dynamical systems obtained as deformations of mutations in cluster algebras associated with finite-dimensional simple Lie algebras. The original (undeformed) dynamical systems provide the simplest examples of Zamolodchikov periodicity: they are affine birational maps for which every orbit is periodic with the same period. Following on from preliminary work by one of us with Kouloukas, here we present integrable maps obtained from deformations of cluster mutations related to the following simple root systems: $A_3$, $B_2$, $B_3$ and $D_4$. We further show how new cluster algebras arise, by considering Laurentification, that is, a lifting to a higher-dimensional map expressed in a set of new variables (tau functions), for which the dynamics exhibits the Laurent property. For the integrable map obtained by deformation of type $A_3$, which already appeared in our previous work, we show that there is a commuting map of Quispel-Roberts-Thompson (QRT) type which is built from a composition of mutations and a permutation applied to the same cluster algebra of rank 6, with an additional 2 frozen variables. Furthermore, both the deformed $A_3$ map and the QRT map correspond to addition of a point in the Mordell-Weil group of a rational elliptic surface of rank two, and the underlying cluster algebra comes from a quiver that mutation equivalent to the $q$-Painlev\'e III quiver found by Okubo. The deformed integrable maps of types $B_2$, $B_3$ and $D_4$ are also related to elliptic surfaces.</description>
