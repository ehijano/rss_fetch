      <title>Simetr\'ias Algebraicas en Geometr\'ia y Arquitectura: Un Enfoque desde Grupos de Transformaciones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article develops an algebraic-geometric theoretical framework for the study of central, axial, and rotational symmetries in R2 and R3, with applications in the classification of conic and quadric surfaces through transformation groups. An analytical methodology based on group theory and geometric invariants is employed, complemented by numerical modeling using the Finite Element Method. As a result, it is demonstrated that the D8 symmetry of the Pantheon structurally optimizes stress distribution, while the hexagonal symmetry rho_{\pi/3} of the Soumaya Museum offers both aesthetic and structural advantages. The approach establishes a rigorous link between algebraic abstraction, geometry, and architectural design.</description>

      <title>Derived categories of generalized Kummer varieties: extended Mukai vector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the extended Mukai vectors for hyper-K\"ahler manifolds to investigate the derived equivalences of the hyper-K\"ahler manifolds which are deformation equivalent to generalized Kummer varieties. Inspired by the idea for hyper-K\"ahler manifolds of $\mathrm{K3}^{[n]}$-type, we obtain an integral lattice which is proved to be invariant under the derived equivalences of generalized Kummer type varieties. Such results and applications are described using derived monodromy groups.</description>

      <title>Equivariant Linearization and Rotation Domains on K3 Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a lot of K3 surface automorphisms of positive entropy having rotation domains of ranks 1 and 2. To carry out this construction, we first lay theoretical foundations concerning equivariant linearization of nonlinear maps under resolutions of quotient singularities, linear models near exceptional components, Salem numbers and multipliers at periodic points, two kinds of fixed point formulas and related indices at exceptional components. Then these basic tools are combined with the method of hypergeometric groups to enable us to detect various types of rotation domains on K3 surfaces.</description>

      <title>Higher rank Clifford's theorem on the smooth quadric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brill-Noether theory of curves has played a crucial role in the study of curves and their moduli since the 19th century, and has been extensively studied by several authors. Clifford's theorem provides a starting point in determining the emptiness of Brill-Noether loci by providing an upper bound on $h^0(L)$ for a line bundle $L$ on a smooth curve $C$ in terms of the degree of $L$. It also characterizes the cases for which equality holds.
  In this paper, we prove an analogous result for higher rank sheaves on $\mathbb{P}^1\times\mathbb{P}^1$. Depending on how nice the first Chern class is, and whether the sheaf has global generation properties, we prove sharp upper bounds on $h^0(E)$ for slope semistable sheaves $E$ in terms of $\operatorname{rk}(E)$ and $c_1(E)$. We also find that any $E$ achieving the bound is a twist of a Steiner-like bundle, or closely related to such a bundle. As part of our investigation, we show that general extensions of stable vector bundles on elliptic curves and del Pezzo surfaces are semistable.</description>

      <title>The Hesse Pencil Variety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and study the Hesse pencil variety $H_8$, obtained as the Zariski closure in the Grassmannian $G(1,9)$ of the set of pencils generated by a smooth plane cubic and its Hessian. We prove that $H_8$ has dimension $8$ and can be realized as the intersection of $G(1,9)$ with ten hyperplanes corresponding to the Schur module $\mathbb{S}_{(5,1)}\mathbb{C}^3$. Moreover, $H_8$ coincides with the closure of the $SL(3)$-orbit of the pencil $\langle x^3+y^3+z^3,\ xyz\rangle$ and contains eight additional orbits. The variety is singular, and its singular locus is precisely the union of two orbits, $O(\langle x^3,x^2y\rangle)$ and $O(\langle x^2y,x^2z\rangle)$.
  A key ingredient in our study is a cubic skew-invariant $R\in \bigwedge^3(\mathrm{Sym}^3\mathbb{C}^3)$ defined by $R(l^3,m^3,n^3)=(l\wedge m\wedge n)^3$, whose vanishing characterizes pencils generated by a cubic and its Hessian. This invariant allows us to write explicit equations defining $H_8$. A crucial geometric step in our argument is the fact that through four general points of $\mathbb{P}^2$ there pass exactly six Hesse configurations, which enables us to compute the multidegree of $H_8$ and conclude that it coincides with the variety defined by the invariant $R$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define a new perverse t-exact pullback operation on derived categories of constructible sheaves which generalizes most perverse t-exact functors in sheaf theory, such as microlocalization, the Fourier-Sato transform and vanishing cycles. This operation is defined for morphisms of algebraic stacks equipped with a relative exact (-1)-shifted symplectic structure, and can be used to define cohomological Donaldson-Thomas invariants in a relative setting. We prove natural functoriality properties for perverse pullbacks, such as smooth and finite base change, compatibility with products and Verdier duality.</description>

      <title>Weddle loci of net of quadrics and the rank of partially symmetric tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a connection between properties of partially symmetric tensors (i.e. tensors associated to linear systems of quadric hypersurfaces) and the geometry of some related loci, generalization of the Weddle loci introduced in \cite{CFF+22} for their role in the study of configurations of points and interpolation problems. In particular, we consider linear systems of plane conics and linear systems of quadric surfaces, and show that when the associated tensors have low rank, then the singularities of the corresponding Weddle loci satisfy a (sharp) lower bound. Thus, we obtain a criterion to exclude that the rank of some partially symmetric tensors is too low. In the final section, devoted to partially symmetric $n\times n\times n$ tensors which lie in one component $M$ of a standard decomposition of the space of $3$-dimensional tensors (\cite{IR22}), we prove that the number of singular points of the Weddle locus associated to a general tensor in $M$ equals the (recursively defined) $n$-th Jacobsthal number.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe affine monoids whose group of invertible elements is an active semidirect product of a unipotent group and a torus, in terms of comultiplications on the algebra of regular functions. We introduce the notion of a root monoid, which is constructed from a set of Demazure root pairs on an affine toric variety, and study the properties of such monoids.</description>

      <title>On the arithmetic of rational hypersurfaces in toric varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the toric variety $\mathcal{T}$, with Cox ring graded by $\deg(z_{2i})=(1,-1,0)$, $\deg(z_{2i+1})=(1,0,-1)$ and $\deg(w_\pm)=(0,1,0),(0,0,1)$, we study hypersurfaces $\widetilde{X}^{2n}\subset\mathcal T$ of multidegree $(2d+1,-d,-d)$ over a field $k$. These are the strict transforms of odd-degree hypersurfaces in $\mathbb{P}^{2n+1}$ with multiplicity $d$ along two skew conjugate $n$-planes. We prove that $\widetilde{X}^{2n}$ is $k$-rational and birational to $\mathbb{P}^{2n}$; and derive result on the distribution of its rational points over numbers and finite field. The case $d=1$ recovers the even-dimensional Fermat cubic.</description>

      <title>Generalized Divisors on DMH Stacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hartshorne developed a theory of generalized divisors on Gorenstein schemes to characterize codimension-one closed subschemes without embedded points. Generalized divisors can be viewed as a generalization of Weil divisors to non-normal schemes. The purpose of this paper is to extend generalized divisors on schemes to DMH stacks, where DMH stacks are Deligne-Mumford stacks satisfying specific conditions. We provide a detailed proof of the properties of total quotient sheaves under \'etale morphisms, thereby demonstrating the difficulty of directly defining generalized divisors on DMH stacks through fractional ideals of the total quotient sheaf. Instead, we propose to define generalized divisors on DMH stacks using reflexive coherent sheaves that are locally free of rank one at generic points. Furthermore, we rigorously establish the rationality of this definition on stacks.</description>

      <title>Torsion points of small order on cyclic covers of $\mathbb P^1$. II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $d \ge 2$ be an integer, $K$ an algebraically closed field such that $char(K)$ does not divide $d$, $n &gt; d$ an integer prime to $d$, $f(x)$ a degree $n$ monic polynomial with coefficients in $K$ and without repeated roots, and $\mathcal{C}_{f,d}$ a smooth projective model of the affine curve $y^d=f(x)$. Let $J(\mathcal{C}_{f,d})$ be the Jacobian of $\mathcal{C}_{f,d} $. We identify $\mathcal{C}_{f,d}$ with its canonical image in $J(\mathcal{C}_{f,d})$ (such that the infinite point of $\mathcal{C}_{f,d}$ goes to the zero of the group law on $J(\mathcal{C}_{f,d})$).
  We say that an integer $m&gt;1$ is $(n,d)$-reachable over $K$ if there exists a polynomial $f(x)$ as above such that $\mathcal{C}_{f,d}(K)$ contains a torsion point of order $m$.
  Earlier we proved that if $m$ is $(n,d)$-reachable, then either $m=d$ or $m \geq n$ (in addition, both $d$ and $n$ are $(n,d)$-reachable).
  In the present paper we prove the following.
  If $n&lt;m&lt;2n$ and if $m$ is $(n,d)$-reachable over $K$, then either $d|m$ or $m$ is congruent to $n$ modulo $d$.
  If $char(K)$ is $0$ or $&gt;n$, then $d [(n+d)/d]$ is $(n,d)$-reachable if and only if $n-(d-1) [(n+d)/d]\ge 0$.
  If $char(K)=0$, then $n+d$ is $(n,d)$-reachable if and only if $d^2-2d&lt;n$.
  If $d=2$ (the hyperelliptic case) and $char(K)=0$, then $m$ is $(n,d)$-reachable if $n+1 \le m \le 2n+1$.</description>

      <title>Affineness and reconstruction in higher Zariski geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explain how the geometric framework introduced in arXiv:2508.11621 [math.AG] provides a universal property for the 2-rings of perfect complexes on qcqs spectral or Dirac spectral schemes. As an application, given a qcqs spectral or Dirac spectral scheme $X$ this produces a comparison morphism from $\operatorname{Spec} \mathrm{Perf}_{X}$ to $X$ itself, which is moreover natural in $X$. When $X$ is an ordinary qcqs scheme, this construction supplies a new proof of the Balmer-Thomason reconstruction of $X$ from its space of thick subcategories, assuming the result for noetherian rings due to Neeman. As another application, we find spectral and Dirac spectral enhancements of support varieties arising for 2-rings in representation theory which "geometrize" the 2-rings that produce them. For example, given a finite group $G$ over a field $k$, this produces a "spectral support variety" $\mathcal{V}_{G}$ such that $\mathrm{Perf}_{\mathcal{V}_{G}}$ maps into the stable module category of $kG$. We derive these results as a corollary of a general affineness criterion for 2-schemes which are covered by the Zariski spectra of rigid 2-rings: this states that such 2-schemes are affine if and only if they are quasicompact and quasiseparated.</description>

      <title>Comparison of motives with rational coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study rational motives over an arbitrary base scheme $S$ and identify a natural, necessary and sufficient criterion guaranteeing that the principal models of rational motives agree. Starting from the free $\mathbb{Q}$-linearization $\mathbb{Q}[\mathbb S]$ of the motivic sphere spectrum and from the motivic rational Eilenberg MacLane spectrum $\mathbf{H}\mathbb{Q}$ built from rational finite correspondences, we analyse the canonical ring map $\Phi_S:\mathbb{Q}[\mathbb S]\to\mathbf{H}\mathbb{Q}$. Our main result shows that $\Phi_S$ is a stable motivic equivalence as soon as motivic cohomology groups computed in Ayoub's framework agree, for all smooth $S$-schemes $X$ of finite type and all bidegrees, with those computed in Voevodsky's (Nisnevich) theory. From this identification of stable homotopy sheaves we deduce several consequences: for every excellent geometrically unibranch base the map $\Phi_S$ is an equivalence; modules over $\mathbb{Q}[\mathbb S]$ recover the usual Beilinson/Ayoub/Morel incarnations of rational motives; and under the hypothesis that $\Phi_-$ is an equivalence formation of $\mathbf{H}\mathbb{Q}$ commutes with base change.</description>

Abstract: In [I. Arzhantsev and M. Zaidenberg, Borel subgroups of the automorphism groups of affine toric surfaces, arXiv:2507.09679 (2025)] we described the Borel subgroups and maximal solvable subgroups of the automorphism groups of affine toric surfaces. In the present paper, we introduce the notion of an integrable Borel subalgebra in the Lie algebra of the automorphism group of an affine variety. We show that they are precisely the tangent algebras of the Borel subgroups. We classify the integrable Borel subalgebras in the Lie algebras of the automorphism groups of toric affine surfaces, notably of the affine plane and its cyclic quotients.</description>

      <title>Prime Fano $4$-folds with semi-free torus actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a smooth complex prime Fano fourfold having a semi-free action of $\mathbb{C}^*$, then $X$ is contained in one of the families $\mathbb{P}^4,Q^4,W_5, X^{m}_{8}$. The families $\mathbb{P}^4,Q^4,W_5$ are unique up to isomorphism and have a semi-free $\mathbb{C}^*$-action.
  This is mostly proved by an analysis of closed symplectic $8$-manifolds with $b_{2}(M)=1$ with a semi-free Hamiltonian $S^1$-action using methods of equivariant symplectic geometry. In this setting some notable restrictions are obtained: the index is greater than $1$, $b_{4}(M)$ is bounded above and all fixed components are shown to be symplectomorphic to products of projective spaces. The proof of the main result appeals in the last step to the classification of prime Fano $4$-folds with index greater than $1$.</description>

      <title>Some Identities For Periods of Hulek-Verrill Threefolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Hulek--Verrill families of Calabi--Yau threefolds. They are birationally equivalent to fibred products of elliptic surfaces, so we expect to be able to compute periods on these threefolds by integrating products of elliptic periods over a contour on $\mathbb{P}^1$. We numerically verify this in several examples. This article was submitted to MATRIX Annals (2024) for inclusion in the proceedings of the conference "The Geometry of Moduli Spaces in String Theory", held 2--13 September 2024.</description>

      <title>Tropical super Gromov-Witten invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that super Gromov-Witten invariants can be defined and computed by methods of tropical geometry. When the target is a point, the super invariants are descendant invariants on the moduli space of curves, which can be computed tropically. When the target is a convex, toric variety $X$, we describe a procedure to compute the tropical Euler class of the SUSY normal bundle $\overline{N}_{n, \beta}$ on $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{0,n}(X, \beta)$, assuming it is locally tropicalizable in the sense of [CG], [CGM]. Then, we define the tropical, genus-0, $n$-marked, super Gromov-Witten invariant of $X$, and compute an example. This gives a tropical interpretation of super Gromov-Witten invariants of convex, toric varieties.</description>

      <title>Variations on cohomology rings and zero schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the theorem of Hausel and the author from arXiv:2212.11836 that relates equivariant cohomology rings and algebras of functions on zero schemes. This paper combines three separate results. We prove that for a reductive group G acting on a smooth projective variety one can see the equivariant cohomology ring as the ring of functions on the zero scheme over the Kostant section, provided that some transversality condition is satisfied. In particular, we show that the conclusion holds for spherical varieties. We then show a version for singular varieties, e.g. discriminant varieties, where in general we only recover a part of equivariant cohomology ring, generated by Chern classes. We also show that an analogous result, connecting equivariant K-theory to the ring of functions on the fixed-point scheme, holds for GKM spaces.
  This is a concise version of some results from the PhD thesis arXiv:2407.14659, which contains a broader introduction to the topic.</description>

      <title>On the moduli space of stable surfaces with $p_g=1$ realizing the minimal volume</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $M_1$ be the moduli space of the KSBA stable surfaces $X$ of geometric genus $p_g(X)=1$ realizing the minimal possible volume $K_X^2=\frac1{143}$. We show that its reduced part $M_{1,\rm red}$ is a $10$-dimensional projective variety isomorphic to the Baily--Borel compactification $\overline{F}_\Lambda^{\rm BB}$ of the moduli space of $\Lambda$-polarized K3 surfaces, where $\Lambda=II_{1,9}\simeq U\oplus E_8$ is a unimodular lattice of signature $(1,9)$. By a result of Brieskorn, $\overline{F}_\Lambda^{\rm BB}$ is a weighted projective space. We also verify the Viehweg hyperbolicity of the base of a Whitney equisingular family of stable surfaces in $M_1$.
  More generally, we prove that the same results hold for the moduli space $M_c$ of KSBA stable pairs $(X,B)$ with coefficients of $B$ belonging to a set $\mathcal C\subset [0,1]$ such that $\mathcal C\cup\{1\}$ attains a minimum, say $c$, and with $p_g(X)=1$, realizing the minimal possible volume $(K_X+B)^2=v(c)$. Indeed, we show that $M_{c,\rm red}$ is independent of $c$ and that for $c\le\frac7{13}$ $M_c$ is isomorphic to $\overline{F}_\Lambda^{\rm BB}$.</description>

      <title>Universal Properties and Constructions of Pullback Formalisms in Terms of Invariance and Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce fundamental notions and results about pullback formalisms, building on work of Drew-Gallauer. Our main application is producing a pullback formalism $\mathbf{SH}^{\mathrm{hol}}$ that encodes a version of motivic homotopy theory for complex analytic stacks, and establishing some of its properties. The notions introduced in this article will be used in later articles in which we also establish more properties of $\mathbf{SH}^{\mathrm{hol}}$, notably the gluing property of Morel and Voevodsky, the structure of a 6-functor formalism, and a realization map from the motivic homotopy theory of algebraic stacks defined by Khan-Ravi that is compatible with Grothendieck's six operations, generalizing Ayoub's results on Betti realization for schemes.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Rayleigh quotient optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rayleigh quotient minimization deals with optimizing a quadratic homogeneous function over a sphere. Its critical points correspond to the normalized eigenvectors of the symmetric matrix associated with the quadratic form. In this paper, we consider a homogeneous polynomial objective function $f$ over a sphere, a projective algebraic variety $X$, and we study the $X$-eigenpoints of $f$, which are classes of critical points of $f$ constrained to the sphere and the affine cone over $X$. The number of $X$-eigenpoints of a generic polynomial $f$ is the Rayleigh-Ritz degree of $X$. This invariant is a version of the Euclidean distance degree of a Veronese embedding of $X$. We provide concrete formulas in various scenarios, including those involving varieties of rank-one tensors.</description>

      <title>A transformal transcendence result for algebraic difference equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given an algebraic difference equation of the form \[\sigma^n(y)=f\big(y, \sigma(y),\dots,\sigma^{n-1}(y)\big)\] where $f$ is a rational function over a field $k$ of characteristic zero on which $\sigma$ acts trivially, it is shown that if there is a nontrivial algebraic relation amongst any number of $\sigma$-disjoint solutions, along with their $\sigma$-transforms, then there is already such a relation between three solutions. Here ``$\sigma$-disjoint" means $a\neq\sigma^r(b)$ for any integer $r$. A weaker version of the theorem, where ``three" is replaced by $n+4$, is also obtained when $\sigma$ acts non-trivially on $k$. Along the way a number of other structural results about primitive rational dynamical systems are established. These theorems are deduced as applications of a detailed model-theoretic study of finite-rank quantifier-free types in the theory of existentially closed difference fields of characteristic zero. In particular, it is also shown that the degree of non-minimality of such types over fixed-field parameters is bounded by $2$.</description>

      <title>Rigidity of the category of localizing motives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the category of localizing motives $\operatorname{Mot}^{\operatorname{loc}}$ -- the target of the universal finitary localizing invariant of idempotent-complete stable categories as defined by Blumberg-Gepner-Tabuada. We prove that this (presentable stable) category is rigid symmetric monoidal in the sense of Gaitsgory and Rozenblyum. In particular, it is dualizable. More precisely, we prove a more general version of this result for the category $\operatorname{Mot}^{\operatorname{loc}}_{\mathcal{E}}$ -- the target of the universal finitary localizing invariant of dualizable modules over a rigid symmetric monoidal category $\mathcal{E}.$
  We obtain general results on morphisms and internal $\operatorname{Hom}$ in the categories $\operatorname{Mot}^{\operatorname{loc}}_{\mathcal{E}}$ of localizing motives. As an application we compute the morphisms in multiple non-trivial examples. In particular, we prove the corepresentability statements for $\operatorname{TR}$ (topological restriction) and $\operatorname{TC}$ (topological cyclic homology) when restricted to connective $\mathbb{E}_1$-rings. As a corollary, for a connective $\mathbb{E}_{\infty}$-ring $R$ we obtain a $\operatorname{TR}(R)$-module structure on the nil $K$-theory spectrum $NK(R).$
  We also apply the rigidity theorem to define refined versions of negative cyclic homology and periodic cyclic homology. This was announced previously in \cite{E24b}, and certain very interesting examples were computed by Meyer and Wagner in \cite{MW24}. Here we do several computations in characteristic $0,$ in particular showing that in seemingly innocuous situations the answer can be given by an interesting algebra of overconvergent functions.</description>

      <title>On the algebraic properties of the B\"or\"oczky configuration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The B\"or\"oczky configuration of lines and (multiple) points exhibits extremal behavior in commutative algebra and combinatorics. Examples of this appear in the context of the containment problem for ordinary and symbolic powers and the proof of the Dirac-Motzkin conjecture by Green and Tao. This paper studies the algebraic properties of B\"or\"oczky configurations for arbitrary values of $n$. Our results compute the Waldschmit constant of the defining ideal of these configurations. Moreover, we use the weighted projective plane $\mathbb{P}(1,2,3)$ to give an upper bound for the degree of the minimal generators of their ideal. Finally, this construction is applied to an elliptic curve in $\mathbb{P}^2$ to give a new counterexample to the containment $I^{(3)}\subseteq I^2$.</description>

      <title>First-order definability of Campana Points and Darmon Points in algebraic function fields in one variable over number fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give first-order definitions of Campana and Darmon points in algebraic function fields in one variable over number fields. These sets are geometric generalizations of $n$-full integers (integers whose nonzero valuations are at least $n$) and perfect $n$th powers, respectively, to more general algebraic varieties. For this we exploit the theory of quadratic Pfister forms, which were used by Becher, Daans &amp; Dittmann to extend to the case of algebraic function fields in one variable the methods used by Koenigsmann when proving that $\mathbb{Z}$ is universally defined in $\mathbb{Q}$. These methods had already been generalized to arbitrary global fields by Park (2013) and Eisentr\"ager &amp; Morrison (2018), and the author had already exploited these methods to find first-order definitions of Campana points (2024) and Darmon points (2024, with Handley) in the context of number fields. With the newly expanded version of these methods, we now transfer those results to the new context of algebraic function fields in one variable over number fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The arithmetic rank of an ideal in a polynomial ring over an algebraically closed field is the smallest number of equations needed to define its vanishing locus set-theoretically. We determine the arithmetic rank of the generic $m$-residual intersection of an ideal generated by $n$ indeterminates for all $m\geq n$ and in every characteristic. We further give an explicit description of its set-theoretic generators. Our main result provides a sharp upper bound for the arithmetic rank of any residual intersection of a complete intersection ideal in any Noetherian local ring. In particular, given a complete intersection ideal of height at least two, any of its generic residual intersections -- including its generic link -- fails to be a set-theoretic complete intersection in characteristic zero.</description>

Abstract: As a consequence of the Borel--Weil--Bott theorem, the nonvanishing of Hodge numbers of line bundles on a Grassmannian can be reinterpreted in terms of the existence of $t$-core partitions inside a rectangle. We sharpen known conditions for the nonvanishing of Hodge numbers of line bundles on a Grassmannian and give an elementary proof of the Nakano vanishing theorem in this setting. Using the theory of $t$-core partitions, we determine when $H^i(\mathrm{Gr}(k,n),\Omega^j(t))$ vanishes in the cases $t=3$ and $i+j\geq k(n-k)-1$.</description>

Abstract: We give necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of polyhedral K\"ahler metrics on $\mathbb{CP}^n$ whose singular set is a hyperplane arrangement and whose cone angles are in $(0, 2\pi)$. These conditions take the form of linear and quadratic constraints on the cone angles and are entirely determined by the intersection poset of the arrangement. Our proof of existence relies on a parabolic version of the Kobayashi-Hitchin correspondence, due to T. Mochizuki.</description>

Abstract: Using geometric methods, we show that for any squarefree polynomial $f \in \mathbb{F}_q[t]$ of degree $n \ge 2$, every residue class modulo $f$ can be represented as a product of two monic irreducible polynomials of degree at most $n$, provided $q$ is sufficiently large in terms of $n$. This proves the function field analogue of a conjecture of Erd\H{o}s in the large $q$ regime.</description>

Abstract: The wild de Rham spaces parameterize isomorphism classes of (stable) meromorphic connections, defined on principal bundles over wild Riemann surfaces. Working on the Riemann sphere, we will deformation-quantize the standard open part of de Rham spaces, which corresponds to the moduli of linear partial differential equations with meromorphic coefficients. We treat the general (possibly nongeneric) untwisted/unramified case with semisimple formal residue, for any polar divisor and reductive structure group, but without using parabolic/parahoric structure. The main ingredients are: i) constructing the quantum Hamiltonian reduction of a (tensor) product of quantized coadjoint orbits in dual truncated-current Lie algebras, involving the corresponding category-O Verma modules; and ii) establishing sufficient conditions on the coadjoint orbits, so that generically all meromorphic connections are stable, and the (semiclassical) moment map for the gauge-group action is faithfully flat.</description>

      <title>Matrix Correlators as Discrete Volumes of Moduli Space I: Recursion Relations, the BMN-limit and DSSYK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show certain correlators in generic one-matrix models define a notion of ``discrete'' volumes of the moduli space of Riemann surfaces, generalizing the connection between random matrices and JT gravity. We prove they obey a discrete, Mirzakhani-like recursion relation. Their fundamental discreteness crucially relies upon studying these matrix integrals away from the usual double-scaling limit. In a BMN-like limit of large traces, this recursion universally goes over to a continuous one, and the correlators asymptote to the volumes of Kontsevich. Finally, we demonstrate that the ETH matrix integral for DSSYK furnishes a discrete, $q$-analog of the Weil--Petersson volumes, thereby proving a conjecture due to K. Okuyama.</description>

      <title>Rational Points on a Family of Genus 3 Hyperelliptic Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the rational points on certain members of the following family of hyperelliptic curves \[C_a \colon y^2 = x^8 + (4-4a^4) x^6 + (8a^4 + 6)x^4 + (4-4a^4)x^2 + 1\] via the method first developed by Dem'yanenko \cite{dem1966rational} and then further generalized by Manin \cite{manin1969p}. In particular, we show that the method of Chabauty--Coleman, while applicable to certain members of this family, is not the most efficient way of computing $C_a(\mathbb{Q})$. We adapt the approach of \cite{kulesz1999application}, incorporating root numbers to further restrict the possible ranks of the elliptic curves arising in the Jacobian decomposition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.18609v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: These notes develop the foundations of Milnor-Witt K-theory for fields of arbitrary characteristic, without any perfectness assumptions. Extending the work of Morel and Feld, we establish all functorial properties of Milnor-Witt K-theory with careful attention to twists. A main new contribution is the computation of transfers in the general, in particular inseparable, case using Grothendieck (differential) trace maps. The results provide a complete framework for the functoriality axioms of Milnor-Witt modules and form the basis for an upcoming work on Chow-Witt groups with Niels Feld and Fangzhou Jin.</description>

      <title>Correspondences acting on constant cycle curves on K3 surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.02723v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Constant cycle curves on a K3 surface $X$ over $\mathbb{C}$ have been introduced by Huybrechts (2014) as curves whose points all define the same class in the Chow group. In this paper we study correspondences $Z \subseteq X\times X$ over $\mathbb{C}$ acting on the group $\mbox{ccc}(X)$ of cycles generated by irreducible constant cycle curves. We construct for any $n\geq 2$ and any very ample line bundle $L$ a locus $Z_n(L)\subseteq X\times X$ of expected dimension $2$, which yields a correspondence that acts on $\mbox{ccc}(X)$, when it has the expected dimension. We provide examples of $Z_n(L)$ for low $n$ and exhibit one correspondence different from $Z_n(L)$ acting on $\mbox{ccc}(X)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.15072v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a description of Voevodsky's $\infty$-category of motivic spectra in terms of the subcategory of motives of smooth proper varieties. As applications, we construct weight filtrations on the Betti and \'{e}tale cohomologies of algebraic varieties with coefficients in any complex oriented ring spectrum. We show that these filtrations satisfy $\ell\mathrm{dh}$-descent, giving an effective way of calculating them in positive characteristic. In the complex motivic case, we further refine the weight filtration to one defined at the level of stable homotopy types.</description>

We show that if $md \leqslant 21$ then there exists an $(m-2)$-dimensional family of complex projective $K3$ surfaces with real multiplication by $E$. Analogous results are proved for CM number fields and also for all known higher-dimensional hyperk\"ahler manifolds.</description>

We establish necessary and sufficient conditions under which these homomorphisms are automorphisms, and verify that they satisfy the Jacobian conjecture. Additionally, we provide a necessary condition within this family to obtain wild automorphisms, and independently derive a property related to the upper semicontinuity of the {\L}ojasiewicz exponent at infinity.</description>

Abstract: Given a smooth, projective curve $Y$, a point $y_0 \in Y$, a positive integer $n$, and a transitive subgroup $G$ of the symmetric group $S_{d}$ we study smooth, proper families, parameterized by algebraic varieties, of pointed degree $d$ covers of $(Y,y_0)$, $(X,x_{0})\to (Y,y_0)$, branched in $n$ points of $Y\setminus y_{0}$, whose monodromy group equals $G$. We construct a Hurwitz space $H$, an algebraic variety whose points are in bijective correspondence with the equivalence classes of pointed covers of $(Y,y_0)$ of this type. We construct explicitly a family parameterized by $H$, whose fibers belong to the corresponding equivalence classes, and prove that it is universal. We use classical tools of algebraic topology and of complex algebraic geometry.</description>

As an application, we discuss rationality problems for regular surfaces and the structure of the plane Cremona group.</description>

      <title>Towards a characterization of toric hyperk\"{a}hler varieties among symplectic singularities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03012v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $(X, \omega)$ be a conical symplectic variety of dimension $2n$ which has a projective symplectic resolution. Assume that $X$ admits an effective Hamiltonian action of an $n$-dimensional algebraic torus $T^n$, compatible with the conical $\mathbf{C}^*$-action. A typical example of $X$ is a toric hyperkahler variety $Y(A,0)$.
  In this article, we prove that this property characterizes $Y(A,0)$ with $A$ unimodular. More precisely, if $(X, \omega)$ is such a conical symplectic variety, then there is a $T^n$-equivariant (complex analytic) isomorphism $\varphi: (X, \omega) \to (Y(A,0), \omega_{Y(A,0)})$ under which both moment maps are identified. Moreover $\varphi$ sends the center $0_X$ of $X$ to the center $0_{Y(A,0)}$ of $Y(A,0)$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we generalize Zhou valuations, originally defined on complex domains, to the framework of general schemes. We demonstrate that an algebraic version of the Jonsson--Musta\c{t}\u{a} conjecture is equivalent to the statement that every Zhou valuation is quasi-monomial. By introducing a mixed version of jumping numbers and Tian functions associated with valuations, we obtain characterizations of a valuation being a Zhou valuation or computing some jumping number using the Tian functions. Furthermore, we establish the correspondence between Zhou valuations in algebraic settings and their counterparts in analytic settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22233v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We review the notion of stable supermap from SUSY curves to a fixed target superscheme, and prove that when the target is (super)projective, stable supermaps are parameterized by a Deligne-Mumford superstack with superschematic and separated diagonal. We characterize the bosonic reduction of this moduli superstack and see that it has a surjective morphism onto the moduli stack of stable maps from spin curves to the bosonic reduction of the target, whose fibers are linear schemes; for this reason, the moduli superstack of stable supermaps is not proper unless such linear schemes reduce to a point. Using Manin-Penkov-Voronov's super Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch theorem we also make a formal computation of the virtual dimension of the moduli superstack, which agrees with the characterization of the bosonic reduction just mentioned and with the dimension formula for the case of bosonic target existing in the literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09857v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $Y$ be a compact Gorenstein analytic space with only isolated singularities and trivial dualizing sheaf. A recent paper of Imagi studies the deformation theory of $Y$ in case the singularities of $Y$ are weighted homogeneous and rational and $Y$ is K\"ahler. In this note, assuming that $H^1(Y;\mathcal{O}_Y) =0$, we generalize Imagi's results to the case where the singularities of $Y$ are Du Bois, with no assumption that they be weighted homogeneous, and where the K\"ahler assumption is replaced by the hypothesis that there is a resolution of singularities of $Y$ satisfying the $\partial\bar\partial$-lemma. As a consequence, if the singularites of $Y$ are additionally local complete intersections, then the deformations of $Y$ are unobstructed. The log Calabi-Yau and Fano cases are also discussed.</description>

Abstract: We show that the $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano index of a canonical weak Fano $3$-fold is at most $66$. This upper bound is optimal and gives an affirmative answer to a conjecture of Chengxi Wang in dimension $3$. During the proof, we establish a new Riemmann--Roch formula for canonical $3$-folds and provide a detailed study of non-isolated singularities on canonical Fano $3$-folds, concerning both their local and global properties. Our proof also involves a Kawamata--Miyaoka type inequality and geometry of foliations of rank $2$ on canonical Fano $3$-folds.</description>

Abstract: Using orbifold Hilbert schemes, we compactify all two-dimensional Hitchin systems corresponding to types A0-tilde, D4-tilde, E6-tilde, E7-tilde, and E8-tilde, thereby obtaining four rational elliptic surfaces with C*-actions. Their singular fibers and relative minimal models are listed in the main table. To this end, we prove that Hilbert schemes of orbifold surfaces are connected smooth projective schemes under suitable conditions, and we use the Hilbert-Chow morphism to construct the minimal resolutions of the coarse moduli spaces.</description>

Abstract: We study modular differential equations (MDEs) of high orders for weak Jacobi forms and find necessary conditions for weak Jacobi forms to satisfy MDEs of order 3 with respect to the heat operator. We investigate all possible MDEs for the elliptic genus of six-dimensional manifolds with a trivial first Chern class. We prove that the minimal possible order of the MDE for the elliptic genus of a strict six-dimensional Calabi--Yau variety is four, and find MDEs of order 7 for hyperk\"ahler varieties of dimension 6. The latter MDEs correspond to the generic case. The non-generic weak Jacobi forms of weight 0 and index 3 form a divisor that contains two cubic plane curves in the coefficient space.</description>

Abstract: For a prime number $p$ and a $p$-quasisyntomic commutative ring $R$, Bhatt--Morrow--Scholze defined motivic filtrations on the $p$-completions of $\mathrm{THH}(R), \mathrm{TC}^{-}(R), \mathrm{TP}(R),$ and $\mathrm{TC}(R)$, with the associated graded objects for $\mathrm{TP}(R)$ and $\mathrm{TC}(R)$ recovering the prismatic and syntomic cohomology of $R$, respectively. We give an alternate construction of these filtrations that applies also when $R$ is a well-behaved commutative ring spectrum; for example, we can take $R$ to be $\mathbb{S}$, $\mathrm{MU}$, $\mathrm{ku}$, $\mathrm{ko}$, or $\mathrm{tmf}$. We compute the mod $(p,v_1)$ syntomic cohomology of the Adams summand $\ell$ and observe that, when $p \ge 3$, the motivic spectral sequence for $V(1)_*\mathrm{TC}(\ell)$ collapses at the $\mathrm{E}_2$-page.</description>

      <title>Simplicial arrangements with few double points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01892v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In their solution to the orchard-planting problem, Green and Tao established a structure theorem which proves that in a line arrangement in the real projective plane with few double points, most lines are tangent to the dual curve of a cubic curve. We provide geometric arguments to prove that in the case of a simplicial arrangement, the aforementioned cubic curve cannot be irreducible. It follows that Gr\"{u}nbaum's conjectural asymptotic classification of simplicial arrangements holds under the additional hypothesis of a linear bound on the number of double points.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Toda lattice and equivariant $K$-homology of affine Grassmannian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02941v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the phenomenon known as ``quantum equals affine'' in the setting of $T$-equivariant quantum $K$-theory of the flag variety $G/B$, as established by Kato for any semisimple algebraic group $G$. In particular, we focus on the $K$-Peterson isomorphism between the $T$-equivariant quantum $K$-ring $QK_T(SL_n(\mathbb{C})/B)$ and the $T$-equivariant $K$-homology ring $K_*^T(\mathrm{Gr}_{SL_n})$ of the affine Grassmannian, after suitable localizations on both sides. Building on an earlier work by Ikeda, Iwao, and Maeno, we present an explicit algebraic realization of the $K$-Peterson map via a rational substitution that sends the generators of the quantum $K$-theory ring to explicit rational expressions in the fundamental generators of $K_*^T(\mathrm{Gr}_{SL_n})$, thereby matching the Schubert bases on both sides. Our approach builds on recent developments in the theory of $QK_T(SL_n(\mathbb{C})/B)$ by Maeno, Naito, and Sagaki, as well as the theory of $K$-theoretic double $k$-Schur functions introduced by Ikeda, Shimozono, and Yamaguchi. This concrete formulation provides new insight into the combinatorial structure of the $K$-Peterson isomorphism in the equivariant setting. As an application, we establish a factorization formula for the $K$-theoretic double $k$-Schur function associated with the maximal $k$-irreducible $k$-bounded partition.</description>

      <title>Worldsheet fermion correlators, modular tensors and higher genus integration kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07947v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The cyclic product of an arbitrary number of Szeg\"o kernels for even spin structure $\delta$ on a compact higher-genus Riemann surface $\Sigma$ may be decomposed via a descent procedure which systematically separates the dependence on the points $z_i \in \Sigma$ from the dependence on the spin structure $\delta$. In this paper, we prove two different, but complementary, descent procedures to achieve this decomposition. In the first procedure, the dependence on the points $z_i \in \Sigma$ is expressed via the meromorphic multiple-valued Enriquez kernels of e-print 1112.0864 while the dependence on $\delta$ resides in multiplets of functions that are independent of $z_i$, locally holomorphic in the moduli of $\Sigma$ and generally do not have simple modular transformation properties. The $\delta$-dependent constants are expressed as multiple convolution integrals over homology cycles of $\Sigma$, thereby generalizing a similar representation of the individual Enriquez kernels. In the second procedure, which was proposed without proof in e-print 2308.05044, the dependence on $z_i$ is expressed in terms the single-valued, modular invariant, but non-meromorphic DHS kernels introduced in e-print 2306.08644 while the dependence on $\delta$ resides in modular tensors that are independent of $z_i$ and are generally non-holomorphic in the moduli of $\Sigma$. Although the individual building blocks of these decompositions have markedly different properties, we show that the combinatorial structure of the two decompositions is virtually identical, thereby extending the striking correspondence observed earlier between the roles played by Enriquez and DHS kernels. Both decompositions are further generalized to the case of linear chain products of Szeg\"o kernels.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19351v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study statistical models that are parametrized by squares of linear forms. All critical points of the likelihood function are real and positive. There is one critical point in each region of the projective hyperplane arrangement defined by the linear forms. We examine the ideal and singular locus of the model, and we give a determinantal presentation for its likelihood correspondence. We characterize tropical degenerations of the MLE, we describe the log-normal polytopes, and we explore connections to determinantal point processes.</description>

      <title>When any four solutions are independent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08387v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that if any four distinct solutions of a rational difference equation are algebraically independent, then any number of distinct solutions to the equation are independent. A nontrivial variant of this result is given for autonomous difference equations or algebraic dynamical systems, where we show the degree of nonminimality is at most one. The results have a natural interpretation in terms of invariant or periodic subvarieties of algebraic dynamical systems and $\sigma$-varieties. Surprisingly, the proofs of these results rely on the classification of finite simple groups.</description>
