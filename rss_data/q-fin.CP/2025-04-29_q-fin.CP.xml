      <title>Multi-Horizon Echo State Network Prediction of Intraday Stock Returns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stock return prediction is a problem that has received much attention in the finance literature. In recent years, sophisticated machine learning methods have been shown to perform significantly better than ''classical'' prediction techniques. One downside of these approaches is that they are often very expensive to implement, for both training and inference, because of their high complexity. We propose a return prediction framework for intraday returns at multiple horizons based on Echo State Network (ESN) models, wherein a large portion of parameters are drawn at random and never trained. We show that this approach enjoys the benefits of recurrent neural network expressivity, inherently efficient implementation, and strong forecasting performance.</description>

      <title>QuantBench: Benchmarking AI Methods for Quantitative Investment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The field of artificial intelligence (AI) in quantitative investment has seen significant advancements, yet it lacks a standardized benchmark aligned with industry practices. This gap hinders research progress and limits the practical application of academic innovations. We present QuantBench, an industrial-grade benchmark platform designed to address this critical need. QuantBench offers three key strengths: (1) standardization that aligns with quantitative investment industry practices, (2) flexibility to integrate various AI algorithms, and (3) full-pipeline coverage of the entire quantitative investment process. Our empirical studies using QuantBench reveal some critical research directions, including the need for continual learning to address distribution shifts, improved methods for modeling relational financial data, and more robust approaches to mitigate overfitting in low signal-to-noise environments. By providing a common ground for evaluation and fostering collaboration between researchers and practitioners, QuantBench aims to accelerate progress in AI for quantitative investment, similar to the impact of benchmark platforms in computer vision and natural language processing.</description>

      <title>A high-order recombination algorithm for weak approximation of stochastic differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The authors present an algorithm for the application of the high-order recombination method first introduced by Terry Lyons and Christian Litterer in ``high-order recombination and an application to cubature on Wiener space'' (Ann. Appl. Probab 22(4):1301-1327, 2012), to real-world problems in mathematical finance. They also give numerical examples showing that the algorithm presented successfully avoids the explosive increase in the number of support of the measure that achieves high-order approximations.</description>

      <title>Some PDE results in Heston model with applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present here some results for the PDE related to the logHeston model. We present different regularity results and prove a verification theorem that shows that the solution produced via the Feynman-Kac theorem is the unique viscosity solution for a wide choice of initial data (even discontinuous) and source data. In addition, our techniques do not use Feller's condition at any time. In the end, we prove a convergence theorem to approximate this solution by means of a hybrid (finite differences/tree scheme) approach.</description>

      <title>Deep Declarative Risk Budgeting Portfolios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have spurred the development of end-to-end frameworks for portfolio optimization that utilize implicit layers. However, many such implementations are highly sensitive to neural network initialization, undermining performance consistency. This research introduces a robust end-to-end framework tailored for risk budgeting portfolios that effectively reduces sensitivity to initialization. Importantly, this enhanced stability does not compromise portfolio performance, as our framework consistently outperforms the risk parity benchmark.</description>

      <title>Modern Computational Methods in Reinsurance Optimization: From Simulated Annealing to Quantum Branch &amp; Bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16530v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose and implement modern computational methods to enhance catastrophe excess-of-loss reinsurance contracts in practice. The underlying optimization problem involves attachment points, limits, and reinstatement clauses, and the objective is to maximize the expected profit while considering risk measures and regulatory constraints. We study the problem formulation, paving the way for practitioners, for two very different approaches: A local search optimizer using simulated annealing, which handles realistic constraints, and a branch &amp; bound approach exploring the potential of a future speedup via quantum branch &amp; bound. On the one hand, local search effectively generates contract structures within several constraints, proving useful for complex treaties that have multiple local optima. On the other hand, although our branch &amp; bound formulation only confirms that solving the full problem with a future quantum computer would require a stronger, less expensive bound and substantial hardware improvements, we believe that the designed application-specific bound is sufficiently strong to serve as a basis for further works. Concisely, we provide insurance practitioners with a robust numerical framework for contract optimization that handles realistic constraints today, as well as an outlook and initial steps towards an approach which could leverage quantum computers in the future.</description>
