      <title>Reheating in geometric Weyl-invariant Einstein-Cartan gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Weyl-invariant purely gravitational theories formulated within the Einstein-Cartan framework. In the Einstein-frame description, these models are dynamically equivalent to standard general relativity coupled to an axion-like pseudoscalar degree of freedom, which naturally drives a period of cosmic inflation. Without committing to a specific microscopic mechanism for reheating, we demonstrate that the post-inflationary reheating dynamics play a crucial role in shaping the inflationary predictions. In particular, we show that assumptions about the reheating temperature and the equation-of-state parameter can significantly affect the predicted values of inflationary observables, highlighting the necessity of consistently incorporating reheating effects in the phenomenological analysis of inflationary models.</description>

      <title>Jacobson's thermodynamic approach to classical gravity applied to non-Riemmanian geometries: remarks on the simplicity of Nature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three decades ago, Ted Jacobson surprised us with a very appealing approach to classical gravity. According to his proposal, the gravitational field equations are the consequence of the first law of thermodynamics applied, locally, to a Rindler observer. Together with the dynamical laws of black holes, Jacobson's approach has become a very strong piece of evidence supporting the intimate connection between gravity, thermodynamics, and quantum theory. Jacobson's approach being formulated for Riemannian geometries, we have wondered what its consequences would be for non-Riemannian geometries, i.e., those that involve torsion, non metricity, or both. The results of our quest have been particularly appealing: we have found that the gravitational theory that derives from the Einstein-Hilbert action, arguably ``the simplest one'', does not belong to the pool of gravitational theories available for Nature's selection (except in the Riemannian case). In the search of a unique alternative, we have also considered the hypotheses employed in the formulation of the Lanczos-Lovelock theories of gravity. Together, the two approaches point towards the gravitational theory that derives from the Einstein-Hilbert action plus a term quadratic in the torsion vector as the one that would be selected by Nature in the non-Riemannian case without non metricity. The same strategy cannot be followed in the full non-Riemannian case as the two approaches are mutually inconsistent.</description>

      <title>Realization of quintom dark energy after DESI DR2 in Nieh-Yan modified teleparallel gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations from the DESI Collaboration indicate a preference for quintom dark energy, i.e., its equation of state evolves across the cosmological constant boundary $w=-1$. It is well known that models with single perfect fluid or single scalar field minimally coupled to Einstein gravity develop perturbative instabilities around the crossing, thereby cannot realize the quintom scenario. In this paper, we provide a method to circumvent the instability problem of these models by introducing the coupling of dark energy to the Nieh-Yan density in teleparallel gravity. We show that with this coupling the background evolution is not affected, but the dark energy perturbation is removed from the menu of dynamical degrees of freedom, thus avoiding the intrinsic difficulties in the old models.</description>

      <title>Charged Superradiant Instability of Spherically Symmetric Regular Black Holes in de Sitter Spacetime: Time- and Frequency-Domain Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the superradiant instability of Ay\'on-Beato-Garc\'ia-de Sitter (ABG-dS) black holes under massless charged scalar perturbations using both time-domain evolutions and frequency-domain computations. We show that the instability occurs only for the spherically symmetric mode with $\ell=0$, whereas asymptotically flat ABG black holes remain stable in the massless limit, which underscores the essential role of the cosmological horizon in providing a confining boundary. We further study the dependence of the growth rate on the cosmological constant $\Lambda$, the scalar charge $q$, and the black hole charge $Q$, finding that it reaches a maximum at intermediate values of $\Lambda$ and $q$ and increases monotonically with $Q$. Compared with Reissner-Nordstr\"om-de Sitter black holes, ABG-dS black holes exhibit distinct instability characteristics due to the modified electrostatic potential induced by nonlinear electrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Null Raychaudhuri Equation and the Impossibility of Traversable Wormholes in Unimodular Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate the traversability of wormhole throats as a local and covariant null defocusing condition derived from the Raychaudhuri equation. Since unimodular gravity preserves the local geometric structure of spacetime, the null focusing properties of geodesic congruences are unchanged with respect to general relativity. We show that any genuinely traversable wormhole in unimodular gravity necessarily violates the null energy condition, establishing a local no--go theorem for wormholes supported by ordinary matter in this framework.</description>

      <title>Non-exotic asymptotically flat wormholes in $f(Q,T)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the possible existence of static and spherically symmetric wormhole solutions within the context of the newly formulated extended $f(Q,T)$ gravity. We analyze a linear model, $f(Q,T)=\alpha Q+ \beta T$, and focus on traversable wormholes. By applying the variational method, we derive modified versions of the field equations that are influenced by an anisotropic matter source for a zero redshift function. It has been observed that the violation of energy conditions is influenced by the parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$. We reach the conclusion that solutions which violate the radial and lateral null energy condition in the context of general relativity may still adhere to the energy conditions within the realm of $f(Q,T)$ gravity. To begin with, by utilizing a linear equation of state for radial pressure, we obtain a power-law shape function. Additionally, we investigate solutions defined by a variable equation of state parameter. A broad spectrum of non-exotic wormhole solutions has been identified, contingent upon the particular parameters of the model.</description>

      <title>Chaotic Dynamics due Prolate and Oblate Sources in Kerr-like and Hartle-Thorne Spacetimes with and without Magnetic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As demonstrated by observations, every stellar-mass object rotates around some axis; some objects spin faster than others due to different mechanisms. Furthermore, these spinning objects are slightly deformed and are no longer perfect spheres because of hydrostatic equilibrium. The well-known Kerr solution of the Einstein Field Equations (EFE) represents the spacetime surrounding a rotating spherical gravitational source. However, real objects deviate from a perfect sphere and may be prolate or oblate. There are several solutions of the EFE that represent the spacetime of deformed objects. The Kerr--like (KL) metric represents the spacetime surrounding this kind of object, where the deformation is characterized by the mass quadrupole moment parameter $q_{\mathrm{KL}}$. When $q_{\mathrm{KL}} \neq 0$, the Carter constant no longer exists and the equations of motion (EOM) are no longer integrable; therefore, the system exhibits chaotic orbits. Another widely used solution is the Hartle--Thorne (HT) metric, which has similar characteristics and represents a slightly deformed, slowly rotating star. The HT metric has several versions, and two of them were selected to test their validity. The traditional HT version, which contains logarithmic terms, is less accurate than the version with exponential terms. Moreover, both the KL and HT metrics may be extended to include contributions due to the magnetic dipole moment of the source. The equations of motion (EOM) were computed, and these new dynamical systems display several interesting features, which are shown in their Poincar'e sections.</description>

      <title>Path Integrated Geodesics and Distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the quantum corrections to the kinematics of geometry, specifically geodesics, are presented. This is done by employing the path integral over the geodesics. Interestingly, the geodesics do not see any modifications in this framework. However for the distances, it is demonstrated that these quantum corrections exhibit distinct behaviors for time-like, light-like, and space-like geodesics. For time-like geodesics, the maximum correction is the Planck length, which disappears when the classical separation vanishes. The light-like geodesics do not exhibit quantum corrections, meaning that the causal light cone remains the same in both classical and quantum frameworks under certain conditions. The quantum corrections for space-like geodesics impose a minimum on space-like separation, potentially playing a role in removing singularities by preventing null congruences from being closer than the Planck length. This framework also explores the correspondence between space-like/time-like geodesics and quantum/statistical physics.</description>

      <title>A Local Lorentz Invariance test with LAGEOS satellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong theoretical arguments suggest that a breakdown of Lorentz Invariance could arise under some very particular conditions. From an experimental point of view, it is important to test the Local Lorentz Invariance with ever greater precision and in all contexts, regardless of the theoretical motivation for the possible violation. In this paper we discuss some aspects of the gravitational sector. Tests of Lorentz Invariance in the context of gravity are difficult and rare in the literature. Possible violations could arise from quantum physics applied to gravity or the presence of vector and tensor fields mediating the gravitational interaction together with the metric tensor of General Relativity. We present our results in the latter case. We analyzed the orbit of the LAGEOS and LAGEOS II satellites over a period of almost three decades. The effects of the possible preferred frame represented by the cosmic microwave background radiation on the mean argument of latitude of the satellites orbit were considered. These effects would manifest themselves mainly through the post-Newtonian parameter $\alpha_1$, a parameter that has a null value in General Relativity. We constrain this parameterized post-Newtonian parameter down to the level of $\alpha_1 \le 2\times10^{-5}$, improving a previous limit obtained through the Lunar Laser Ranging technique.</description>

      <title>$\delta N$ formalism with gradient interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The standard $\delta N$ formalism, a cornerstone for calculating nonlinear curvature perturbations on super-Hubble scales, relies on the separate universe assumption, in which spatial gradients are neglected. However, this approximation breaks down in scenarios critical for primordial black hole formation, such as transitions to an ultra-slow-roll phase, where gradient interactions induce significant non-conservation of the comoving curvature perturbation. In this Letter, we introduce a framework that incorporates gradient corrections into the $\delta N$ formalism at a desired order by adding an effective source term to the background Klein--Gordon equation. This approach allows for a nonlinear treatment of curvature perturbations at the end of inflation considering initial conditions at the time of horizon exit. By computing the equilateral non-Gaussianity parameter $f_{\mathrm{NL}}^{\mathrm{eq}}$, we demonstrate that our method captures essential features missed by the standard $\delta N$, offering a simple yet rigorous pathway to determine nonlinear evolution expected from cosmological perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>Tripartite quantum steering in Schwarzschild spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of Hawking radiation on quantum steering and steering asymmetry in a tripartite system embedded in Schwarzschild spacetime. All tripartite steering types were classified,comprising three "1 to 2" and three "2 to 1" steering cases. Through a systematic analysis of all physically relevant scenarios (including accessible and inaccessible modes), we classify three canonical scenarios with one, two and three physically accessible modes. In the scenario of three physically accessible modes, Hawking radiation disrupts quantum steering, with the maximum steering asymmetry during the two-way steering to one-way steering transition precisely demarcating the phase boundary between these regimes. For two physically accessible modes, Hawking radiation exhibits dual behavior: enhancing the steering from Alice and Bob to anti-Charlie under certain parameters while suppressing it under others, while net strengthening other steering types. When considering one physically accessible mode, the Hawking effect of the black hole significantly enhances quantum steering. These findings provide new insights into quantum correlations in curved spacetime and establish observable signatures of Hawking effects in quantum steering phenomena.</description>

      <title>Ellis--Bronnikov wormhole in Quasi-topological Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.01029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct higher-dimensional traversable wormholes in quasi-topological gravity (QTG) supported by a phantom scalar field. Using a static, spherically symmetric ansatz, we numerically analyze how quasi-topological gravity corrections affect the geometry and physical properties of the wormhole solutions. The resulting wormhole solutions are symmetric about the throat. Negative mass can arise for certain choices of parameters. For certain parameter ranges, the scalar charge $\mathcal{D}$ of the phantom field rapidly decreases with increasing the higher-curvature coupling parameter $\alpha$ and approaches zero. Moreover, by changing $\alpha$, the overall level of the Kretschmann scalar is also lowered. Finally, for sufficiently large $\alpha$, $-g_{tt}$ becomes close to zero near the throat, exhibiting a ``horizon''-like structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.01111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We uncover the physical nature of the electric and magnetic monopoles discovered by McGuire and Ruffini on Misner strings accompanying charged nutty black holes, showing that these strings carry singular, nonuniform flows of electric and magnetic fields. These fields inevitably have nonzero divergence, thereby simulating the effective electric and magnetic charge densities along the strings. The latter create a complex short-range electromagnetic hair zone around the horizon, making the combined Misner-Dirac strings classically observable. Typical features of this new type of hair are presented. We also note that rotation can act as a hair generator even in the absence of NUT.</description>

      <title>Testing the wormhole echo hypothesis for GW231123</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The short-duration gravitational-wave (GW) event GW231123 has inferred component masses in the pair-instability mass gap and exhibits a burst-like morphology with no clearly inspiral, making it an interesting target for tests beyond the standard binary black hole (BBH) interpretation. In this work, motivated by its phenomenological similarity to GW190521, we test whether GW231123 is compatible with a wormhole-echo scenario by modeling a leading echo pulse with a well-motivated phenomenological sine-Gaussian wavepacket. We perform Bayesian model comparison against a BBH baseline described by the IMRPhenomXPHM-SpinTaylor waveform, and obtain the Bayes factor ratio $\ln B^{\rm Echo}_{\rm BBH} = 1.87$, corresponding to weak-to-moderate support for the echo hypothesis. In our previous analysis for GW190521 within the same overall framework, we found $\ln B^{\rm Echo}_{\rm BBH} \approx -2.9$, implying a shift of $\Delta \ln B \approx 4.8$ between the two events. This sign change indicates that GW231123 is more compatible with a single-pulse echo description than GW190521.</description>

      <title>Reduced Phase Space Quantization and Quantum Corrected Entropy of Schwarzschild-de Sitter Horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the quantization of the Schwarzschild--de Sitter (SdS) black hole (BH) using the Misner--Sharp--Hernandez (MSH) mass as the internal energy in a reduced phase space framework. After introducing the canonical variables of the reduced phase space, we derive a discrete spectrum for the surface areas of the BH event horizon (EH) as well as MSH masses. We utilized the MSH mass spectrum to obtain the entropy of the BH. The entropy of the BH and cosmic EHs reveals a logarithmic correction to the Bekenstein--Hawking term. Our results support the robustness of the logarithmic form of quantum corrections in SdS thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolicity analysis of the linearised 3+1 formulation in the Teleparallel Equivalent of General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the properties of the principal symbol of the 3+1 equations of motion in Teleparallel Equivalent of General Relativity (TEGR) and assess the conditions for hyperbolicity. We use the Hamiltonian formulation based on the vectorial, antisymmetric, symmetric trace-free, and trace (VAST) decomposition of the canonical variables in the Hamiltonian formalism, and the Hamilton's equations previously presented in the literature. We study the system of differential equations at the linear level, and show that the principal symbol has a sector with imaginary eigenvalues, which renders the system not hyperbolic. This situation persists by taking spatial derivatives in either one or three coordinate directions, and it should be interpreted as a problem of the specific gauge choice instead of a general problem with TEGR. The first practical use of Hamilton's equations in this work can be extended for proving well-posedness in spherical symmetry, and establish numerical relativity setups in TEGR.</description>

      <title>Cosmic evolution from Lorentz-violating bumblebee dynamics and Tsallis holographic dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, the behavior, evolution, and expansion of the universe are investigated within a Lorentz-violating framework driven by Tsallis holographic dark energy. The cosmological extension is implemented through a spontaneously symmetry-breaking Bumblebee field, which is assumed to play a fundamental role in the dynamics of the universe. Estimates for key Lorentz-violating quantities are obtained, and the evolution of the Hubble parameter is analyzed from the early universe era to the present epoch. This formulation provides an alternative perspective on the Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>Observable Optical Signatures, Particle Dynamics and Epicyclic Frequencies of Mod(A)Max Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the observable optical signatures of the Mod(A)Max black hole spacetime. We analyze key optical features, including the photon sphere, black hole shadow, and photon trajectories, and examine how these observables depend on the underlying geometric parameters, such as the electric charge and the Mod(A)Max coupling parameter. We further study the dynamics of neutral test particles in the vicinity of the black hole by deriving the effective potential within the Hamiltonian formalism. Using this potential, we obtain the specific energy and specific angular momentum for test particles on circular orbits of fixed radius, as well as the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO), and explore how the geometric parameters influence these quantities and the ISCO radius. Finally, we derive the epicyclic (azimuthal, radial, and vertical) frequencies to analyze quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) exploring how the geometric parameters influences these and discuss their physical implications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.02272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the equilibrium configurations and the radial perturbations of neutron stars in a subclass of Scalar-Vector-Tensor (SVT) theories. By solving the generalised Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations in SVT theories for several values of the modified gravity parameter, we examine the impact of the spontaneous scalarization of charged neutron star (NSs), which arises from the coupling of the scalar field to the electromagnetic tensor and double-dual Reimann tensor, $L^{\mu\nu\alpha\beta}F_{\mu\nu}F_{\alpha\beta}$. Then we extend our study by deriving the action at quadratic order in linear perturbations of radial type and computing scalar quasinormal modes (QNMs)as well as the normal modes (NMs) showing the coincidence of stability and maximum mass points in generlar relativity (GR) is still present in this modified theory.</description>

      <title>Complete asymptotics in the formation of quiescent big bang singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are three categories of mathematical results concerning quiescent big bang singularities: the derivation of asymptotics in a symmetry class; the construction of spacetimes given initial data on the singularity; and the proof of big bang formation in the absence of symmetries, including the proof of stable big bang formation. In a recent article, the first author demonstrated the existence of developments corresponding to a geometric notion of initial data on a big bang singularity. Moreover, this article, combined with previous articles by the second author, gives a unified and geometric perspective on large classes of seemingly disparate results in the first two categories. Concerning the third category, Oude Groeniger et al recently formulated a general condition on initial data ensuring big bang formation, including curvature blow up. This result, among other things, generalises previous results on stable big bang formation. However, it does not include a statement saying that the solutions induce initial data on the singularity. Here we tie all three categories of results together by demonstrating that the solutions of Oude Groeniger et al induce data on the singularity. However, the results are more general and can potentially be used to derive similar conclusions in other gauges.</description>

      <title>Impact of Perfect Fluid Dark Matter on the Appearance of Rotating Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how dark matter affects the immediate environment of black holes (BHs) is crucial for interpreting horizon-scale observations. We study rotating BHs surrounded by perfect fluid dark matter (PFDM), exploring their observable features through both analytical and numerical approaches. Using the existence criterion of the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO), we first derive joint constraints on the PFDM intensity parameter~k and the spin parameter~a. Within the resulting physically allowed parameter regime, we perform high-resolution, general-relativistic ray-tracing simulations of thin accretion disks at 87~GHz and 230~GHz, capturing the detailed brightness morphology and photon ring structure shaped by PFDM. By incorporating angular diameter measurements of M87^{*} and Sgr~A^{*} from the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT), we further narrow down the viable parameter space and directly compare synthetic images with EHT observations of M87^{*}. We find that the inclusion of PFDM improves the agreement with the observed compact shadow and asymmetric brightness distribution, suggesting that dark matter may leave observable imprints on horizon-scale images. Our results position PFDM as a physically motivated extension to the Kerr geometry and highlight a promising astrophysical pathway for probing dark matter near BHs with current and future VLBI campaigns.</description>

      <title>Model-Agnostic Population Inference for Gravitational-Wave Astronomy: From LIGO to LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inferring the intrinsic population of compact binary mergers is complicated by detector selection biases and measurement uncertainties. Traditional parametric methods are limited by the need to presuppose functional forms, introducing model-dependent biases. To overcome these limitations, we introduce an inference framework powered by deep generative modeling. We develop a flexible, data-driven population model using a Correlated Compound-Mixture Density Network. This architecture integrates mixture models to handle multimodality, Gaussian copulas for parameter dependencies, and a library of flexible marginal distributions. The network is trained to approximate the posterior distribution of the population's hyperparameters using amortized variational inference with Normalizing Flows on catalogs of gravitational-wave events. We demonstrate the framework's capabilities in two distinct regimes. First, using simulated catalogs of supermassive black hole binary mergers for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), we show that the method accurately recovers complex three-dimensional distributions and absolute merger rates from sparse datasets, effectively correcting for selection effects and measurement uncertainties. Second, we validate the framework on real observational data from the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA GWTC-3 catalog, successfully inferring the population of stellar-mass binary black holes using an injection-based selection effect correction. Our results confirm that the method is robust, scalable, and applicable across different detector sensitivities and source populations.</description>

      <title>An autoencoder-based surrogate waveform model for quasi-circular binary-black-hole mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The generation of accurate waveforms from binary black hole (BBH) mergers is a major effort in Gravitational-Wave Astronomy. In recent years, machine-learning-based surrogate models for BBH waveforms have been proposed. Those offer the potential to dramatically accelerate waveform generation while maintaining accuracy competitive with that of traditional waveform approximants. In this work, we investigate the viability of autoencoders as generative models for gravitational-wave signals from quasi-circular BBH mergers. We introduce AESur3dq8, a novel surrogate waveform model based on autoencoders that enables the rapid and accurate construction of large template banks, producing millions of waveforms in under a second using modest computational resources. The model is trained on the numerical-relativity-informed surrogate NRHybSur3dq8 and subsequently fine-tuned using the SXS catalog of BBH simulations. We demonstrate that waveforms generated by AESur3dq8 achieve mismatches of order $10^{-4}$ with respect to Numerical Relativity waveforms, and that parameter estimation performed with these templates yields results fully consistent with those reported by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration for observed gravitational-wave events.</description>

      <title>Remarks on Dirac-Bergmann algorithm, Dirac's conjecture and the extended Hamiltonian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Dirac-Bergmann algorithm for the Hamiltonian analysis of constrained systems is a nice and powerful tool, widely used for quantization and non-perturbative counting of degrees of freedom. However, certain aspects of its application to systems with first-class constraints are often overlooked in the literature, which is unfortunate, as a naive treatment leads to incorrect results. In particular, when transitioning from the total to the extended Hamiltonian, the physical information encoded in the constrained modes is lost unless a suitable redefinition of gauge invariant quantities is made. An example of this is electrodynamics, in which the electric field gets an additional contribution to its longitudinal component in the form of the gradient of an arbitrary Lagrange multiplier. Moreover, Dirac's conjecture, the common claim that all first-class constraints are independent generators of gauge transformations, is somewhat misleading in the standard notion of gauge symmetry used in field theories. At the level of the total Hamiltonian, the true gauge generator is a specific combination of primary and secondary first-class constraints; in general, Dirac's conjecture holds only in the case of the extended Hamiltonian.
  The aim of the paper is primarily pedagogical. We review these issues, providing examples and general arguments. Also, we show that the aforementioned redefinition of gauge invariants within the extended Hamiltonian approach is equivalent to a form of the Stueckelberg trick applied to variables that are second-class with respect to the primary constraints.</description>

      <title>Running Love Numbers of Charged Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.00349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Loops of virtual particles from the vacuum of quantum field theory (QFT) render black holes tidally deformable. We compute the static tidal response of unspinning charged black holes at arbitrary radius, using the perturbative formalism developed in 2501.18684. Since the gravitational and electromagnetic tidal responses mix, we generalize the notion of Love numbers to Love matrices. We derive the coupled equations of motion for the metric and electromagnetic fluctuations around purely electric and magnetic backgrounds. For large charged black holes, which are described by the Effective Field Theory (EFT) of gravity, we compute the full set of Love matrices induced by an arbitrary tower of $F^{2n}$ operators. We find that, although quantum corrections break electromagnetic duality, the Love matrices in electric and magnetic backgrounds are related by a $Z_2$ symmetry under electric-magnetic exchange. Going beyond EFT, we compute the Love matrices of small magnetic black holes. We show that the running of the Love matrices is governed by the running of the $U(1)$ gauge coupling, and we derive the correspondence between Love and $U(1)$ beta functions for arbitrary harmonics. The overall picture that emerges is that the QFT-induced tidal response of magnetic black holes saturates in the strong-field regime. These results imply that nearly-extremal magnetic black holes charged under an Abelian dark sector could be probed by gravitational-wave observations.</description>

Abstract: We embed the covariant, gauge-invariant gravitational radiation criteria of Fern\'andez-\'Alvarez and Senovilla, based in terms of conformal geometry and the Bel-Robinson tensor, into the hydrodynamic framework of gauge/gravity duality. This construction uncovers a direct correspondence between bulk gravitational waves and dissipative processes in the boundary theory, from which a natural notion of entropy production emerges. We further analyze a smooth flat limit in which the dual fluid becomes Carrollian, with dissipation governed by Carroll-covariant tensors. As an example, we apply our framework to the Robinson-Trautman family of solutions.</description>

      <title>Has Kronos devoured Planet Nine and its epigones?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Planet Nine hypothesis encompasses a body of about 5-8 Earth's masses whose orbital plane would be inclined to the ecliptic by one or two tens of degrees and whose perihelion distance would be as large as about 240-385 astronomical units. Recently, a couple of his epigones have appeared: Planet X and Planet Y. The former is a sort of minor version of Planet Nine in that all its physical and orbital parameters would be smaller. Instead, the latter would have a mass ranging from that of Mercury to the Earth's one and semimajor axis within 100-200 astronomical units. By using realistic upper bounds for the orbital precessions of Saturn, one can get insights on their position which, for Planet Nine, appears approximately confined around its aphelion. Planet Y can be just a Mercury-sized object at no less than about 125 astronomical units, while Planet X appears to be ruled out. Dedicated data reductions by modeling such perturber(s) are required to check the present conclusions, to be intended as hints of what might be detectable should planetary ephemerides include them. A probe on the same route of Voyager 1 would be perturbed by Planet Nine by about 20-40 km after some decades.</description>

      <title>A structural criterion for asymptotic states in Supersymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In quantum field theory, the algebraic existence of a field does not guarantee the existence of a corresponding localized asymptotic particle state. This distinction is well established in the presence of infrared effects, long-range correlations, and environmental interactions, and becomes particularly relevant in supersymmetric theories, where fermionic and bosonic degrees of freedom are constrained at the algebraic level but need not share identical asymptotic behavior. In this work we introduce a minimal and predynamical localization criterion that distinguishes algebraically allowed degrees of freedom from those capable of forming stable, phasecoherent asymptotic states. The criterion is formulated in terms of long-time stability under slow structural fluctuations of an effective background, without modifying the underlying field equations or introducing new physical interactions. We show that fermionic and scalar fields respond qualitatively differently to such structural effects. While fermionic modes may retain asymptotic stability, scalar modes generically exhibit decoherence and damping, preventing their interpretation as localized one-particle states. This provides a conservative and model-independent perspective on how supersymmetric algebraic structures may coexist with an asymmetric observable particle spectrum. The analysis is intentionally non-constructive and does not rely on specific supersymmetrybreaking mechanisms, cosmological assumptions, or new dynamical ingredients. Rather, it clarifies localization as an independent structural requirement for particle existence within standard quantum field theory.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by bulk replica wormholes, we study the boundary effective theory that describes the near-horizon fluctuations of a near-extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole. This theory consists of a Schwarzian mode and a $U(1)$ phase mode. We compute the partition function of this boundary theory on replica geometries, from which the entropy is derived. Our analysis reveals a rich phase structure, in which the dominance of connected or disconnected replica configurations leads to a phase transition controlled by the temperature and the coupling constants $C$, $K$, and $\mathcal{E}$ of the 1d effective theory.</description>

      <title>Black Hole Interior and Quantum Error Correction with Dynamical Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.01241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: According to the island formula, information in the code subspace defined in the black hole interior is embedded in the Hawking radiation after the Page time. At first sight, this embedding suggests that operations acting on the Hawking radiation could modify the information in the code subspace, potentially leading to an apparent violation of causality. Indeed, in previous studies based on the PSSY model, which incorporates only the topological degrees of freedom of gravity, it was shown that when the error is sufficiently large, a violation of causality can arise, as indicated by a nonvanishing mutual information. In this paper, we investigate the situation in which dynamical gravity also acts on the Hawking radiation. In this case, operations on the Hawking radiation induce nontrivial backreaction on the bulk spacetime appearing in the gravitational path integral for the mutual information -- an effect that is absent when the Hawking radiation is non-gravitating. We find that this backreaction renders the relevant mutual information vanishing. This result implies that, in theories with dynamical gravity, the apparent violation of causality is resolved.</description>

      <title>Detectability and Model Discriminability of the Dark Ages 21 cm Global Signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The 21 cm signal from neutral hydrogen atom is almost the only way to directly probe the Dark Ages. The Dark Ages 21 cm signal, observed at frequencies below 50 MHz, can serve as a powerful probe of cosmology, as the standard cosmological model predicts a well-defined 21 cm spectral shape. In this work, we assess the detectability and model-selection power of 21 cm observations assuming physically motivated foregrounds, optimistic error levels, and several observing strategies for the signals predicted in various cosmological models. Using a Bayesian evidence-based comparison, we find that wide-band observations covering 1-50 MHz can identify the evidence of non-zero 21 cm signals from models considered in this paper except the one with a smooth spectrum that peaks at lower frequencies. In particular, observations below 15 MHz are essential to avoid degeneracies with the foreground. Furthermore, even with observations measured at 5 MHz intervals over the frequency range 1-50 MHz, the 21 cm signal can be identified if the errors are sufficiently small. This indicates that the intrinsic 21 cm spectral shape can be captured without foreground degeneracy even with a limited number of frequency channels.</description>

      <title>Factorized neural posterior estimation for rapid and reliable inference of parameterized post-Einsteinian deviation parameters in gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The direct detection of gravitational waves (GWs) by LIGO has strikingly confirmed general relativity (GR), but testing GR via GWs requires estimating parameterized post-Einsteinian (ppE) deviation parameters in waveform models. Traditional Bayesian inference methods like Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) provide reliable estimates but suffer from prohibitive computational costs, failing to meet the real-time demands and surging data volume of future GW detectors. Here, we propose a factorized neural posterior estimation framework: we construct independent normalizing flow models for each of the nine ppE deviation parameters and effectively integrate prior information from other source parameters via a conditional embedding network. Leveraging a hybrid neural network with a convolutional neural network and a Residual Neural Network for feature extraction, our method performs rapid and statistically reliable posterior inference directly from binary black hole signals. Compared to conventional MCMC, our approach achieves millisecond-scale inference time with a speedup factor of $9 \times 10^4$. Comprehensive validations show that the posterior estimates pass the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and achieve empirical coverage probabilities close to theoretical targets. This work demonstrates the great potential of deep learning for GW parameter estimation and provides a viable technical solution for real-time GR tests with next-generation detectors.</description>

      <title>A single field inflationary potential consistent with recent observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current observations indicate that an inverse exponential form of the inflaton potential provides an excellent description of single-field inflation. This potential fits the SPA$+$BK$+$DESI data sets well with in the $1\sigma$ bound in the $n_{\rm s}$-$r$ plane, thereby offering a simple and observationally viable single field inflationary scenario. To describe post-inflationary evolution and reheating, we extend the inverse exponential potential by adding a steep exponential term that remains negligible during inflation but becomes important afterwards. The resulting full potential develops a minimum after the end of inflation, leading to oscillations of the scalar field and consequently reheating of the Universe. We find that the maximum reheating temperature attainable in this scenario is of order $10^{13}\,\mathrm{GeV}$. The inverse exponential potential therefore emerges as a compelling candidate for early-Universe inflation, combining theoretical simplicity with robust observational viability.</description>

      <title>Shear subdiffusion in non-relativistic holography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.01971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study shear fluctuations in non-relativistic holographic systems coupled to torsional Newton-Cartan geometry, using asymptotically Lifshitz spacetimes in Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton gravity. We identify a universal subdiffusive shear mode characterized by the quartic dispersion relation $\omega=-iD_4 k^4$, in sharp contrast to the conventional hydrodynamic diffusion. We derive this result analytically through a systematic higher-order matched asymptotic expansion connecting near-horizon and far-region solutions, and we verify it with direct numerical quasinormal mode calculations. Our numerics demonstrate that the first non-hydrodynamic mode is purely imaginary and gapped, following the dispersion relation $\omega=-i\omega_0-i D k^2$, and that both the hydrodynamic and the first non-hydrodynamic modes pass through pole-skipping points. These results highlight Lifshitz holography as an efficient framework for anomalous transport in strongly coupled non-relativistic quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Universal Relations and Correlation Analysis of Proto-Neutron Star Properties in Energy-Momentum Squared Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Proto-neutron stars (PNSs) are the hot, lepton-rich remnants of the core collapse supernovae, which go through a cooling phase and become cold, stable Neutron stars (NSs). Since PNSs are also superdense objects with strong gravitational fields, we can use them to probe general relativity (GR) in the high-curvature regime, similar to NSs. In this study, we analyze the macroscopic properties like mass, radius, compactness, tidal deformability, $f$-mode oscillations and gravitational binding energy of PNSs using four different relativistic mean-field (RMF) equations of state (EOSs) with fixed entropy per baryon ($S$ =1, 2) and varying the lepton fractions ($Y_l$). The variation of $S$ and $Y_l$ has a noticeable effect on these properties. Extending our study beyond GR, we explore these effects within the framework of Energy-Momentum Squared Gravity (EMSG). This modified gravity theory adds the squared energy-momentum terms to the field equations with a free parameter $\alpha$. In the weak-field regimes, EMSG remains indistinguishable from GR, but in the strong-field regimes, such as PNSs or NSs, it shows measurable deviations. Varying the free parameter $\alpha$, we observe significant changes in the macroscopic properties of the PNSs. After that, we focus on the universal relations of the macroscopic properties and the correlations of the universal relations. We find that, despite significant changes in the macroscopic properties induced by the variations of $S$, $Y_l$ and $\alpha$, the correlations remain strong and nearly unaffected.</description>

      <title>Quantum clock and Newtonian time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An extension of standard quantum mechanics is proposed in which the Newtonian time parameter appearing in the unitary evolution operator is replaced with the time shown by a `quantum clock'. A quantum clock is defined by the following properties: (a) the time that the clock shows is non-decreasing, (b) the clock ticks at random with random tick sizes, and (c) on average the clock shows the Newtonian time. We show that the leading term in the evolution equation for the density matrix associated with any quantum clock model gives the von Neumann equation. Modifications to the von Neumann equation are worked out in detail in a parametric family of examples for which the tick sizes have a gamma distribution. The leading correction to the von Neumann equation is given by the Lindblad equation generated by the Hamiltonian, but there are higher-order terms that generalize the von Neumann equation and the Lindblad equation. Lower bounds on the parameters of these quantum clock models are derived by use of the precision limit of an atomic clock.</description>

      <title>LISA Non-Linear Dynamics and Tilt-To-Length Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the LISA mission, Tilt-To-Length (TTL) coupling is expected to be one of the dominant instrumental noise contributions after laser frequency noise is suppressed based, on assumptions on the size of the coupling and angular jitter levels. This work uses for the first time a closed-loop, non-linear, and time-varying dynamics implementation to simulate detailed angular jitters for the spacecraft and optical benches. In turn, this gives an improved expectation of the TTL contribution to the interferometric output. It is shown that the TTL coupling impact is limited given current estimates on the size of coupling coefficients. A time-domain Least Squares estimator is used to infer the TTL parameters from the simulated measurements. The bias and correlations limit the estimator in the case of regular datasets with amplified TTL coefficients to a relative error of $10\%$, but the subtraction of the TTL signal still works well. For lower readout noises, the estimation error diverges, which can be mitigated using a regularization term. Alternatively, using sinusoidal maneuvers improves the inference to a high accuracy of $0.1\%$ for TTL coefficients around the expected level, removing all correlations in the inferred parameters. This validates the maneuver design by Wegener et al. (2025) in this closed-loop setting.</description>

      <title>Black Hole Evaporation as a Topological Tunneling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the quantization of the electromagnetic field near the event horizon of a Schwarzschild black hole using Euclidean path integrals. Our result for the vacuum energy describes a black hole surrounded by a finite volume of photons at $T_{H} = \frac{1}{8\pi G M}$, the black hole quantum atmosphere. The total entropy includes contributions from this atmosphere, and the Bekenstein entropy, which arises from the Gibbons--Hawking--York boundary term, which encodes topological information. We show that the contribution of the quantum atmosphere to the black hole specific heat is positive, indicating that the system may become thermodynamically stable.
  By analyzing homology groups, we show that the black hole evaporation is a tunneling between topologically distinct spacetimes: Schwarzschild ($\chi = 2)$ transitions to the flat spacetime ($\chi = 1$) via Hawking radiation, where $\chi$ is the Euler characteristic, a topological invariant. This process resembles instanton-driven tunneling in Yang-Mills theories, where topologically non-trivial solutions dominate the vacuum amplitude. In our case, the Gibbons--Hawking--York term dominates the transition amplitude, which induces the evaporation process. These results corroborate the Parikh-Wilczek picture of Hawking radiation and the interpretation of Euclidean black holes as gravitational instantons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2101.04212v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The conservation law for the orbital plus spin angular momentum of a free Dirac particle in curved spacetime requires that the affine connection has the antisymmetric part: the torsion tensor, which extends general relativity to the Einstein$-$Cartan theory of gravity. In the presence of torsion, the Dirac equation becomes a nonlinear, cubic equation in the spinor wave function. We show that the energy eigenvalues of the corresponding Hamiltonian as functions of the momentum are different for the fermion and antifermion components of the spinor, violating charge conjugation symmetry, and also depend on the helicity. Consequently, particles of matter and antimatter have different dispersion relations and therefore different masses. This mass difference increases with density and becomes significant near the Cartan density, which existed in the early Universe. Because antimatter particles were more massive than matter particles, they were also slower during pair production in the early Universe and therefore had higher cross sections for gravitational capture by primordial black holes. This difference might have led to the matter$-$antimatter imbalance in the observable Universe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14851v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article delves into the observational signatures and theoretical underpinnings of rotating astrophysical objects, with a particular focus on superspinars -exotic objects characterized by the absence of event horizons due to their high angular momentum. While solutions within General Relativity (Kerr superspinars) predict such objects, their classical forms harbor naked singularities, violate causality, and exhibit problematic repulsive gravitational effects. These characteristics render classical superspinars theoretically objectionable, leading to the consideration of them as physically implausible. On the other hand, the incompatibility between General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics suggests the exploration of alternative models, particularly those in which Quantum Gravity dominates the core and prevents the formation of scalar curvature singularities. This work demonstrates that superspinars without scalar curvature singularities can avoid all the complications associated with Kerr superspinars. Moreover, from a phenomenological standpoint, it is shown that the silhouettes of these superspinars could be markedly distinct from those of black holes and classical Kerr superspinars. To substantiate these differences, we perform a comprehensive analysis of inner null geodesics and investigate the structure of the Planckian region within superspinars without scalar curvature singularities. Our study reveals that only these superspinars provide the potential for distant observers to directly observe the extremely high curvature regions within their interiors.</description>

Abstract: We prove the nonlinear stability of the cosmological region of Kerr de Sitter spacetimes. More precisely, we show that solutions to the Einstein vacuum equations with positive cosmological constant arising from data on a cylinder that is uniformly close to the Kerr de Sitter geometry (with possibly different mass and angular momentum parameters at either end) are future geodesically complete and display asymptotically de Sitter-like degrees of freedom. The proof uses an ADM formulation of the Einstein equations in parabolic gauge. Together with a well-known theorem of Hintz-Vasy [Acta Math. 220 (2018)], our result yields a global stability result for Kerr de Sitter from Cauchy data on a spacelike hypersurface bridging two black hole exteriors.</description>

Abstract: Under the existence of a massless spinor with respect to the total connection in a spacetime modeled as a Lorentzian manifold with internal boundaries, such as finite volume semi-classical Black Holes, we show that a topological mechanism naturally induces terms in the Einstein-Cartan gravitational action that can be interpreted as General Relativity with dark energy. This may alleviate the problems of dark energy. The topological information is carried by a harmonic 1-form associated to the first co-holomology group of the spacetime, which induces a spacetime contortion acting on the horizontal bundle.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the emission of radiation from general sources in quantum scalar, electromagnetic and gravitational fields using the Rindler coordinate frame, which is suitable for a uniformly accelerated observer, in the Minkowski vacuum. In particular, we point out that, to recover the usual Larmor radiation in the interaction picture, it is necessary to incorporate the Unruh effect. Thus, the observation of classical Larmor radiation could be seen as vindicating the Unruh effect in the sense that it is not correctly reproduced in this context unless the Unruh effect is taken into account.</description>

Abstract: We present a new approach to the conservative dynamics of binary systems, within the effective one-body (EOB) framework, based on the use of a Lagrange multiplier to impose the mass-shell constraint. When applied to the post-Minkowskian (PM) description of the two-body problem in Einsteinian gravity, this Lagrange-EOB (LEOB) approach allows for a new formulation of the conservative dynamics that avoids the drawbacks of the recursive definition of EOB-PM Hamiltonians. Using state-of-the-art expressions of the resummed waveform and radiation reaction, we apply our new formalism to the construction of an aligned-spin, quasi-circular, inspiraling EOB waveform model, called {\tt LEOB-PM}, that incorporates analytical information up to the 4PM level, completed by 4PN contributions up to the sixth order in eccentricity, in the orbital sector, and by 4.5PN contributions, in the spin-orbit sector. In the nonspinning case, we find that an uncalibrated LEOB-PM model delivers maximum EOB/NR unfaithfulness ${\bar{F}}_{\rm EOBNR}$ (with the Advanced LIGO noise in the total mass range $10-200M_\odot$) varying between $0.2\%$ and $1\%$ over all the nonspinning dataset of the Simulating eXtreme Spacetime (SXS) Numerical Relativity (NR) catalog up to mass ratio $q=15$. It also delivers excellent phasing agreement with the $q=32$ configuration of the RIT catalog. We also found consistency between binding energies within a few percent at the NR merger location. Then, when NR-informing the dynamics of the model (both orbital and spinning sectors) by using 17 SXS dataset, we find that the EOB/NR unfaithfulness (compared to 530 spin-aligned SXS waveforms) has a median value of $5.39\times 10^{-4}$, or $6.13\times 10^{-4}$ (depending on the spin-spin interactions), reaching at most $\sim 1\%$ in some of the high-spin corners.</description>

      <title>Stability Analysis of Four $f(Q)$ Gravity Models : A Cosmological Review in the Background of Bianchi-I Anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21715v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the non-metricity scalar $Q$ as the functional argument, several $f(Q)$ gravity models are found to be proposed which are perfectly able to mimic the late-time accelerated expansion as pointed out by the type Ia supernovae observations. Temperature fluctuation differences for two celestial hemispheres, Hubble tension, voids, dipole modulation, anisotropic inflation, etc. motivates us to think beyond the $\Lambda$CDM model and the cosmological principle. Bianchi-I model portrays an anisotropic universe imposing shear. $f(Q)$ model also enables us to produce early inflation to late de Sitter universe without the requirement of $\Lambda$CDM. Ambiguities regarding fine-tuning or coincidences can be avoided alongwith. So, this article finds different stationary points of cosmic evolution with $f(Q)$ models habilitating in Bianchi-I anisotropic universe. Depending on models' nature, fixed points with different categories are found. Perturbations are followed wherever are applicable. While pursuing cosmological implications towards these fixed points, some are found to be formed only for the consideration of $f(Q)$ gravity and Bianchi-I both. Besides different prediction towards early inflation to late-time expansion which are available in existing literature of dynamical system studies, occurances of ultra slow roll inflation is predicted. For particular $f(Q)$ model, shear is predicted to decay leaving behind a constant valued residue. This models a universe that gradually turns more homogeneous. In some other models, depending on initial conditions, a final isotropic leftover is marked as the future fate of anisotropic world. More than one stable points are marked for special cases and are cosmologically interpreted.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet Black Holes under the Generalized Uncertainty Principle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10092v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the impact of the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) on the thermodynamics of five-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (EGB) black holes. A modified mass-temperature relation is derived under the assumption of local equilibrium, revealing that the black hole evolves into a stable remnant with a finite temperature, rather than completely evaporating. The corrected entropy, obtained within this framework, deviates from the commonly expected logarithmic form and aligns with similar findings in higher-dimensional Schwarzschild-Tangherlini spacetimes. Our results support the argument that the GUP-induced corrections to the black hole entropy are sensitive to the dimension of spacetime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14105v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define entropic marginally outer trapped surfaces (E-MOTSs) as a generalization of apparent horizons. We then show that, under first-order perturbations around a stationary black hole, the dynamical black hole entropy proposed by Hollands, Wald, and Zhang, defined on a background Killing horizon, can be expressed as the Wall entropy evaluated on an E-MOTS associated with it. Our result ensures that the Hollands-Wald-Zhang entropy reduces to the standard Wald entropy in each stationary regime of a dynamical black hole, thereby reinforcing the robustness of the dynamical entropy formulation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03548v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the $1/c$ expansion of general relativity within a formulation that is compatible with both the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner and the Kol-Smolkin decompositions. The Einstein-Hilbert action takes a common form for those decompositions as they are dual to each other. We first develop a method to expand this generic form without choosing a particular slicing and then push the expansion up to $c^{-3}$ order within this novel approach. Next, we apply our technique to the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner decomposition and expand it up to $c^{-3}$ order explicitly. In order to demonstrate the applicability of our method and to highlight the duality at the level of expansion, we also perform the expansion in the Kol-Smolkin decomposition up to $c^{-1}$ order. Lastly, we make some all-order observations.</description>

      <title>Post-Newtonian expansion of scale-dependent gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04810v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scale-dependent gravity is an extension of general relativity in which the Newton and cosmological constants may vary slightly with the energy scale due to remnant low-energy quantum effects. A fundamental feature of this approach is the scale-setting procedure. In a previous work, a covariant expression for the scale, consistent with conservation laws, was established. Here, we apply the full Will-Nordtvedt version of the parameterized post-Newtonian (PPN) formalism to this framework, assuming that the constants can be expressed as a power series in the scale. We find that a new potential arises at the first post-Newtonian order, which is absent from the standard PPN formalism. This potential modifies the definitions of pressure and internal energy but does not affect center-of-mass orbits and is, therefore, not constrained by Solar System tests.</description>

Abstract: We study the evolution of matter density perturbations in the framework of massive conformal gravity (MCG). Starting from the conservation of the energy-momentum tensor, we find the continuity and Euler equations for the conformal perfect fluid that fills the MCG universe. We then obtain the perturbed MCG cosmological equations, from which we derive the equation that determines the linear growth of matter fluctuations in the MCG universe. The resulting growth equation shows that MCG enhances cosmic structure formation at high redshifts and suppresses it at low redshifts when compared to the $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model.</description>

      <title>Environmentally-induced chaos: Extreme-mass-ratio systems of rotating black holes in astrophysical environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20191v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extreme-mass-ratio inspirals, in which a stellar-mass object orbits a supermassive black hole, are prime sources of millihertz gravitational waves for upcoming space-based detectors. While most studies assume idealized vacuum backgrounds, realistic extreme-mass-ratio binaries are embedded in astrophysical environments such as accretion disks, stellar clusters, or dark matter spikes, disks, and halos, which can significantly alter the orbital dynamics. We explore bound geodesics around general-relativistic solutions describing rotating black holes surrounded by matter halos for the first time, mapping how environmental effects interfere with the spacetime symmetries of vacuum spinning (Kerr) black holes. In particular, we find that the loss of a Carter-like constant leads to geodesic non-integrability and the onset of chaos. This manifests through the formation of resonant islands and chaotic layers around transient orbital resonances in phase space--features that are otherwise completely absent in integrable Kerr geodesics. Resonant islands, which are extended, non-zero volume regions in phase space, encapsulate periodic orbit points. Non-integrability dictates that all geodesics inside the resonant island share the periodicity of the resonance. Thus, the lifespan of resonances around non-Kerr objects can be significantly enhanced beyond the predicted lifetime of Kerr resonances. Consequently, these effects can leave distinct imprints on gravitational-wave signals, with significant implications for gravitational-wave modeling and parameter inference of astrophysical extreme-mass-ratio inspirals.</description>

      <title>Multi-messenger lensing time delay as a probe of the graviton mass</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03196v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational lensing is a powerful probe of cosmology and astrophysics. With the prospect of the first strongly lensed gravitational waves on the horizon, we highlight an opportunity to test fundamental physics. In this work, we assume a nonzero mass for the graviton, which leads to gravitational waves following timelike geodesics instead of null geodesics. We derive standard gravitational lensing equations, such as the scattering angle, the time-delay between different images and the magnification, which normally rely on the assumption of null geodesics. We show that a single strongly lensed multi-messenger event is enough to constrain the graviton mass to $m&lt; 3 \cdot 10^{-23}$ eV/c$^{2}$. Notably this constraint is independent of the lens model, the waveform model, and of cosmology. Additionally, we explore magnification of images and find that they offer at least three orders of magnitude weaker bounds than the time delay, and have a dependence on the correct modeling of the lens and cosmology.</description>

      <title>Is GW190521 a gravitational wave echo of wormhole remnant from another universe?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07831v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A particularly compelling aspect of the GW190521 event detected by the LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA (LVK) collaboration is that it has an extremely short duration, and lacks a clearly identifiable inspiral phase usually observed in the binary black holes (BBHs) coalescence. In this work, we hypothesize that GW190521 might represent a single, isolated gravitational wave (GW) echo pulse from the wormhole, which is the postmerger remnant of BBHs in another universe and connected to our universe through a throat. The ringdown signal after BBHs merged in another universe can pass through the throat of wormhole and be detected in our universe as a short-duration echo pulse. Our analysis results indicate that our model yields a network signal-to-noise ratio comparable to that of the standard BBHs merger model reported by the LVK collaboration. For GW190521, Bayesian model selection yields $\ln \mathcal{B}^{\text{Echo}}_{\text{BBH}} \simeq -2.9$, indicating that the data favor the BBH hypothesis over our echo-for-wormhole model.</description>

      <title>Robust topological invariants of timelike circular orbits for spinning test particles in black hole spacetimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01447v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spin-curvature coupling in the Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon (MPD) formalism induces non-geodesic motion, shifting the orbital parameters of spinning test particles in black hole spacetimes. We investigate whether these quantitative shifts alter the qualitative, global structure of the orbit manifold. Using a topological approach, we study timelike circular orbits (TCOs) for spinning particles in static, spherically symmetric spacetimes. By constructing an auxiliary vector field, we compute the topological winding number $W$ in horizon-bounded regions of asymptotically flat, anti-de Sitter (AdS), and de Sitter (dS) backgrounds. We find that $W$ is robust against both the magnitude and direction of the particle's spin: between two horizons, $W = -1$, guaranteeing at least one unstable TCO; outside the outermost horizon in asymptotically flat and AdS spacetimes, $W = 0$, enforcing that TCOs must appear in stable-unstable pairs or be absent. This spin independence reveals that the fundamental orbital structure is a property of spacetime geometry itself, not of the particle's spin. We validate this with quantitative examples in Schwarzschild, Schwarzschild-AdS, and Schwarzschild-dS spacetimes, showing explicit spin-induced TCO shifts while confirming the invariant topology. This result provides a topological foundation for interpreting gravitational waveforms from extreme mass-ratio inspirals involving spinning secondaries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02676v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that every open connected region of relativistic spacetime $(M,\textbf{g})$ that encloses a $b$-incomplete half-curve has an open connected subregion that encloses a $b$-incomplete half-curve and is also 'small' in the following sense: it is the image, under the bundle projection map, of some open region in the (connected) orthonormal frame bundle $O^+M$ over that spacetime which is bounded, and whose closure is Cauchy incomplete, with respect to any 'natural' distance function on $O^+M$. As a corollary, it follows that every $b$-incomplete half-curve can be covered by a sequence of singular regions which are images of a sequence of bounded subsets of $O^+M$ whose diameter, with respect to any 'natural' distance function on $O^+M$, tends to zero. We discuss to what extent these results can be interpreted in favour of the claim that singular structure in classical general relativity is 'localizable'.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04806v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a systematic post-Newtonian treatment of binary charged black holes immersed in external magnetic fields within the framework of Einstein-Maxwell theory. By incorporating a uniform external magnetic field into the two-body Lagrangian expanded to first post-Newtonian order, we derive the complete equations of motion that capture both gravitational and electromagnetic interactions. The magnetic Lorentz force fundamentally alters the orbital dynamics, breaking the conservation of linear and angular momentum and inducing transitions from planar to three-dimensional trajectories. {Through numerical integration of these equations, we compute the resulting gravitational waveforms and characterize the distinctive magnetic field signatures through time-domain and frequency-domain analysis.} Our results demonstrate that strong background magnetic fields can substantially modify the orbital evolution and leave distinctive signatures in the gravitational wave signals. These findings provide a promising avenue for detecting charged black holes and probing magnetic field environments through gravitational wave observations.</description>

      <title>Static Charged Polytropic Spheres with a Cosmological Constant: Physical Acceptability and Trapped Orbits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09846v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider static charged fluid spheres with a cosmological constant. We assume a polytropic equation of state, $p \propto \rho^\Gamma$, and a power law charge distribution, $q\propto r^n$. Using this, we convert the generalised Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation into a differential equation for the mass profile. By solving this equation numerically, we analyse both physical and geometric properties of charged polytropic fluid spheres for different values of $n$ and $\Gamma$. By imposing subluminal sound speeds and energy conditions, we restrict ourselves to configurations that are physically acceptable. Then, within these physical models, we study internal trapping of circular geodesics and find the trapping regions in the $n$-$\Gamma$ parameter space. Going beyond the traditionally studied case of null geodesics, we consider orbits of charged and/or massive particles as well. We show that for neutral null particles (and only for them), the possibility of internal trapping is determined purely through geometry. In the other three cases, properties such as the particle's own charge and/or energy also play a role. In general, we find that trapping of all types of particles is allowed for a broad range of $n$ and $\Gamma$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14134v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the influence of extra dimensions on the nature of the arrow of time. We demonstrate that the observed arrow of time can be explained by the monotonic growth of the multidimensional manifold's volume. Unlike traditional cosmological approaches based on the entropy of matter or radiation, our model identifies the primary temporal direction with the Bekenstein-Hawking-Wald entropy of the geometric background.
  By establishing a formal relation between the statistical weight of the multidimensional manifold and the multiplicity of causally disconnected regions, we reveal that time's directionality is driven by dominant entropy production in the higher-dimensional bulk. A key consequence of this approach is that the arrow of time remains a persistent feature for a 4D observer even in the vacuum limit. This global geometric evolution suppresses local statistical fluctuations and ensures a robust and stable entropy flow throughout the manifold.</description>

      <title>Stability Protected Phantom Bound in Expansion Modulated Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17873v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent cosmological observations, including DESI Data Release 2 (DR2) \cite{DESIDR2}, allow for mild redshift evolution of the dark energy equation of state (EoS), motivating renewed interest in the phantom regime ($w&lt;-1$). A no-go result is presented for a class of single field effective scalar cosmologies with Hubble modulated kinetic response, as motivated by infrared modified and nonlocal gravitational frameworks \cite{DeserWoodard2007,Maggiore2014}. Imposing ghost freedom, $\mathcal{M}\equiv \partial\rho_\phi/\partial X&gt;0$, renders the phantom divide ($w_\phi=-1$) an invariant and dynamically stable manifold of the cosmological flow, extending standard kinematical no-go theorems to a dynamical systems framework. Continuous ghost free evolution into the phantom regime is forbidden, although $w_\phi\to -1$ can be approached asymptotically. The late time dynamics generically converge to a de~Sitter like attractor driven by expansion induced kinetic suppression rather than potential fine tuning. These results clarify the role of stability constraints in shaping late time cosmic acceleration in single field effective scalar cosmologies.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Resonance Detectability during Binary Neutron Star Inspiral: Accurate Mismatch Computations for Low-lying Dynamical Tides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21086v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute deviations from observed gravitational wave signals, where the amplitude of the signal is unchanged. As an example, we consider the detectability of low lying dynamical tides in binary neutron star or neutron star black hole mergers. Tidal forces can excite oscillatory modes of one or both of the stars in the binary when the orbital frequency of the binary system sweeps through the resonant mode frequency dissipating energy into the vibrational mode. The orbital energy loss to the vibrational mode extracts energy from the orbital motion, advancing the time to merger. The inspiral then continues with an excess phase and a time advance. Both will cause a mismatch when fitting to a system that has not gone through the resonance. To resolve this effect, we compute the mismatch for current and planned detectors using both a quasi-analytical approach that relies on the computation of moment integrals and an optimized version of the standard numerical match function. We conclude that detectability can occur for time advances of the order of 1 ms with advanced LVK detectors for an excess energy-flux that is a few percent of the gravitational wave emission. Our results contrast with previous work, which model this effect solely as a phase shift of the waveform or by using the difference in the number of cycles induced by the resonant behavior. We show that tidal resonance effects primarily cause a time advance of the merger, rather than a phase difference, and that the single-frequency approximation commonly used in the literature significantly overestimates the detectability of this effect.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Constraints on $\Lambda$(t)CDM Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.18591v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Problems with the concordance cosmology $\Lambda$CDM as the cosmological constant problem, coincidence problems and Hubble tension has led to many proposed alternatives, as the $\Lambda(t)$CDM, where the now called $\Lambda$ cosmological term is allowed to vary due to an interaction with pressureless matter. Here, we analyze one class of these proposals, namely, $\Lambda=\alpha'a^{-2}+\beta H^2+\lambda_*$, based on dimensional arguments. Using SNe Ia, cosmic chronometers data plus constraints on $H_0$ from SH0ES and Planck satellite, we constrain the free parameters of this class of models. By using the Planck prior over $H_0$, we conclude that the $\lambda_*$ term can not be discarded by this analysis, thereby disfavouring models only with the time-variable terms. The SH0ES prior over $H_0$ has an weak evidence in this direction. The subclasses of models with $\alpha'=0$ and with $\beta=0$ can not be discarded by this analysis. Finally, by using distance priors from CMB, the $\Lambda$ time-dependence was quite restricted.</description>

      <title>Shearing Off the Tree: Emerging Branch Structure and Born's Rule in an Equilibrated Multiverse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06755v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Within the many worlds interpretation (MWI) it is believed that, as time passes on, the linearity of the Schr\"odinger equation together with decoherence generate an exponentially growing tree of branches where "everything happens", provided the branches are defined for a decohering basis. By studying an example, using exact numerical diagonalization of the Schr\"odinger equation to compute the decoherent histories functional, we find that this picture needs revision. Our example shows decoherence for histories defined at a few times, but a significant fraction (often the vast majority) of branches shows strong interference effects for histories of many times. In a sense made precise below, the histories independently sample an equilibrated quantum process, and, remarkably, we find that only histories that sample frequencies in accordance with Born's rule remain decoherent. Our results suggest that there is more structure in the many worlds tree than previously anticipated, influencing arguments of both proponents and opponents of the MWI.</description>

      <title>Krylov Complexity in early universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18405v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Lanczos algorithm offers a framework for constructing wave functions in closed and open quantum systems from their Hamiltonians. Since the early universe is inherently an open system, we employ this algorithm to investigate Krylov complexity across various cosmological phases: inflation, radiation domination (RD), and matter domination (MD). Our results highlight a clear distinction in Krylov complexity between the closed- and open-system methodologies. To accurately capture the influence of potentials during RD and MD, we examine a set of inflationary potentials, including the Higgs potential, $R^2$ inflation, and chaotic inflation, while incorporating violations of slow-roll conditions. This study is conducted in conformal time through the preheating stage. Numerically, we find that the evolution of Krylov complexity and Krylov entropy shows remarkable similarity across different potentials during RD and MD. Furthermore, we rigorously construct an open two-mode squeezed state using the second kind of Meixner polynomial. Based on this construction, we derive for the first time the evolution equations for the squeezing parameter $r_k$ and phase $\phi_k$ in terms of the scale factor. Our analysis indicates that dissipative effects lead to rapid decoherence-like behavior. In addition, we observe that the inflationary universe behaves as a strongly dissipative system, whereas during the RD and MD epochs the universe exhibits weak dissipative characteristics. This work opens new perspectives for studying the universe from a quantum-informational viewpoint.</description>

      <title>The Stochastic Siren: Astrophysical Gravitational-Wave Background Measurements of the Hubble Constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01997v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the first measurement of the Hubble constant $H_0$ using the stochastic gravitational-wave background arising from binary black hole mergers. This astrophysical background is sensitive to the expansion history of the Universe and thus can be used for cosmological parameter inference independently of not only electromagnetic methods, but also gravitational-wave standard siren approaches. We describe the background's cosmological dependence and show how it can be used as a ``stochastic siren'' to measure $H_0$. By analyzing existing resolved binary black hole mergers and the current non-detection of the background, we find that $H_0$ can be measured more accurately relative to using resolved mergers alone. We also note that the stochastic siren may serve a unique role in the Hubble tension in that the lower bound of the $H_0$ measurement would progressively increase with continued non-detection of the background.</description>

      <title>Strongly Coupled Sectors in Inflation: Gapless Theories and Unparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17840v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute correlation functions of the primordial density perturbations when they couple to a gapless, strongly coupled sector of spectator fields -- ``unparticles" -- during inflation. We first derive a four-point function of conformally coupled scalars for all kinematic configurations in de Sitter, which exchanges an unparticle at tree-level, by performing direct integration using the Mellin-Barnes method. To obtain inflationary bispectra and trispectra, we apply weight-shifting operators to the conformally coupled scalar correlator. We show that the correlators solve differential equations determined by the additional symmetries enjoyed by the unparticle propagator. Based on these differential equations, we are able to discuss the spinning-unparticle exchanges, focusing on two possible cases where the currents or the stress tensor of unparticles are coupled to inflatons, with the help of spin-raising operators. Finally, we study the phenomenology of the resulting shape functions. Depending on the value of the unparticle scaling dimension, we classify three characteristic shapes for the inflationary bispectra, including near-equilateral, near-orthogonal, and a novel shape which appears when the scaling dimensions are close to half-integers. More generally, we find that the leading order squeezed limits are insufficient to conclusively determine the detection of a light particle or unparticle. Only the full shapes of bispectra and trispectra can break this degeneracy.</description>

      <title>Four-point correlation functions in axion inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02331v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study parity violation in the early universe by examining the four-point correlation function within the axion inflation model. Using an open quantum system formalism from our previous work, we calculate the influence functional to fourth order, from which we then derive the inflaton four-point correlation function. When we decompose this function using isotropic basis functions, the expansion coefficients $\zeta_{\ell',\ell'',\ell'''}$ naturally split into parity-even and parity-odd components. In the large $\xi$ approximation, which enhances the production of right-handed photons in the model, the derivation of these coefficients simplifies. We work out the lowest-order nonvanishing parity-odd $\zeta_{234}$ term which clearly indicates the presence of parity violation. Moreover, our derived values of the coefficients are consistent with recent observational data from galaxy surveys.</description>

      <title>Fullshape power spectrum for the Symmetron modified gravity model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09304v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We make use of the perturbation theory for modified gravity models that we developed in previous works and apply it to construct the fullshape galaxy power spectrum for the Symmetron modified gravity model. First, we study the growth rate, that is a scale dependent quantity, and compare our results with those of the $n=1 $ Hu-Sawcki (HS) model, finding that the Symmetron has a growth quite similar to the HS F6 in the wavenumber interval $0.01 \leq k \leq 0.1 $ and for redshifts where Symmetron model is viable. We also propose a growth parametrization that turns to be a good approximation for the HS and Symmetron models, with a deviation less than $0.6 \%$. To compute the RSD multipoles we employ an expansion of the velocity moments generating function that is suitable for general modified gravity models. Later, we apply the fk-Perturbation Theory (fkPT) approximation to reduce the computation time of nonlinear kernels, to find the fullshape galaxy power spectrum for the Symmetron, and study the differences with HS model. The RSD multipoles of the Symmetron result similar to those of the HS F6 model. Next, we integrate this theory to an MCMC sampler and validate our results by fitting our parameters to EZMocks to recover the parameters that bring the model to GR. We found a similar agreement in the model validation between Symmetron and F6 model, recovering the simulation cosmological parameters, and concluding that our pipeline is ready to make cosmological parameters' inference with real data.</description>

      <title>DESI results and Dark Energy from QCD topological sectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14182v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a physically motivated dark-energy (DE) model rooted in the topological structure of the Quantum ChromoDynamic (QCD) vacuum. In this framework, DE arises from the difference between the vacuum energy of an expanding FRW universe and Minkowski spacetime, induced by QCD topological sectors. The resulting DE term in the Friedmann equation scales with the Hubble rate, $\rho_{\rm DE}(t)\propto H(t)$, once DE dominates cosmic expansion, i.e. when the Universe is close to the de Sitter regime with $H\approx$ constant. The QCD scale, $\Lambda_{\rm QCD}\sim100~{\rm MeV}$, naturally fixes the DE density and explains why its influence becomes significant only recently. The construction relies solely on the Standard Model of particle physics, introducing no new fields or couplings. The most fundamental change is the possibility of modifying the evolution of the background cosmology in the Friedmann equation. Key predictions include: (a) A present-day equation of state parameter $w_{\rm DE,0}&gt;-1$ that asymptotically approaches the de Sitter limit $w_{\rm DE}=-1$ in the future. (b) A present-day Hubble constant $H_0$ that asymptotically approaches a constant $\overline{H}$ set by $\Lambda_{\rm QCD}$. (b) For $z\ge 0$, $w_{\rm DE}(z)$ may lie above or below $-1$ and can cross this boundary multiple times at different $z$, behavior qualitatively consistent with the recent DESI findings. (c) In our framework, any deviation from $\Lambda$CDM leads to a corresponding deviation of $H(z)$, which can be tested with existing and future cosmological observations.</description>

      <title>GW231123: Likely a product of successive mergers from $\sim 10 $ stellar-mass black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17551v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: GW231123 is an exceptionally massive binary black hole (BBH) merger with unusually high component spins. Such extreme properties challenge conventional stellar evolution models predicting a black hole mass gap due to pair-instability supernovae. We test possible formation scenarios for GW231123 using population-informed priors on BH spin distributions, in light of population properties built on the previous (GWTC-3) data. Our analysis shows that GW231123 belongs to the high-spin subpopulation that is naturally interpreted as hierarchical BBH mergers. By comparing the spin magnitudes and component masses of GW231123 to those of the remnants of previous mergers, we show that both components of GW231123 are multi-generation ($&gt;$2G) merger remnants, and plausibly originated from the successive mergers of $\sim 6$ and $\sim 4$ first-generation BHs, respectively. This suggests that repeated mergers can be frequent and even more massive intermediate-mass black holes may be produced. Thus mechanisms that can efficiently harden the BBHs' orbits are required, e.g., gas dynamical friction in the disks of active galactic nuclei.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22439v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The exponential-tail behaviours of the probability density function (PDF) of the primordial curvature perturbation are confirmed in the mild-waterfall variants of hybrid inflation with the use of the stochastic formalism of inflation. On top of these tails, effective upper bounds on the curvature perturbation are also observed, corresponding to the exact hilltop trajectory during the waterfall phase. We find that in the model where the leading and higher-order terms in the expansion of the inflaton potential around the critical point are fine-tuned to balance, this upper bound can be significantly reduced, even smaller than the primordial black hole (PBH) threshold, as a novel perturbation-reduction mechanism than the one proposed by Tada and Yamada. It makes PBH formation much difficult compared to the Gaussian or exponential-tail approximation. We also introduce Johnson's $S_U$-distribution as a useful fitting function for the PDF, which reveals a nonlinear mapping between the Gaussian field and the curvature perturbation.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Inference of Gravity through Realistic 3D Modeling of Wide Binary Orbits: General Algorithm and a Pilot Study with HARPS Radial Velocities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11996v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When 3D relative displacement $\mathbf{r}$ and velocity $\mathbf{v}$ between the pair in a gravitationally-bound system are precisely measured, the six measured quantities at one phase can allow elliptical orbit solutions at a given gravitational parameter $G$. Due to degeneracies between orbital-geometric parameters and $G$, individual Bayesian inferences and their statistical consolidation are needed to infer $G$ as recently suggested by a Bayesian 3D modeling algorithm. Here I present a fully general Bayesian algorithm suitable for wide binaries with two (almost) exact sky-projected relative positions (as in the Gaia data release 3) and the other four sufficiently precise quantities. Wide binaries meeting the requirements of the general algorithm to allow for its full potential are rare at present, largely because the measurement uncertainty of the line-of-sight (radial) separation is usually larger than the true separation. As a pilot study, the algorithm is applied to 32 Gaia binaries for which precise HARPS radial velocities are available. The value of $\Gamma \equiv \log_{10}\sqrt{G/G_{\rm N}}$ (where $G_{\rm N}$ is Newton's constant) is $-0.002_{-0.018}^{+0.012}$ supporting Newton for a combination of 24 binaries with Newtonian acceleration $g_{\rm N}&gt;10^{-9}$m\,s$^{-2}$, while it is $\Gamma=0.134_{-0.036}^{+0.056}$ ($0.143_{-0.041}^{+0.068}$) for 8 (6) binaries with $g_{\rm N}&lt;10^{-9}$ ($&lt;10^{-9.5}$) m\,s$^{-2}$ representing $&gt; 3.5\sigma$ discrepancy with Newton. However, one system (Stars HD189739 and HD189760) dominates the signal. Without it, the tension with Newton is significantly lessened with $\Gamma=0.063_{-0.041}^{+0.065}$. Thus, to verify the tentative signal, many such systems need to be discovered and their kinematic nature such as any possibility of hidden tertiary stars needs to be thoroughly addressed. The pilot study demonstrates the potential of the algorithm.</description>

      <title>Crossing the phantom divide in scalar-tensor and vector-tensor theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17231v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: DESI observations of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs), combined with cosmic microwave background (CMB) and type-Ia supernova (SN Ia) data, suggest that the dark energy equation of state $w_{\rm DE}$ crosses the phantom divide from $w_{\rm DE} &lt; -1$ to $w_{\rm DE} &gt; -1$ at low redshifts. In shift-symmetric Horndeski and generalized Proca theories with luminal gravitational-wave speed and no direct couplings to dark matter, we show that such a phantom-divide crossing is generically difficult without theoretical pathologies. Breaking the shift symmetry in Horndeski theories allows this transition. We construct an explicit model with broken shift symmetry, in which the scalar field has a potential in addition to a Galileon self-interaction and a quadratic kinetic term. This model realizes the desired phantom-divide crossing at low redshifts without introducing ghosts and Laplacian instabilities.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics and topological classifications of static non-extremal four-charge AdS black hole in the five-dimensional $\mathcal{N} = 2$, $STU-W^2U$ gauged supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20164v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate thermodynamical aspects of a novel static non-extremal black hole solution in the five-dimensional anti-de Sitter (AdS) space carrying four independent electric charge parameters and with a negative cosmological constant, within the framework of $D=5$, $\mathcal{N} = 2$ gauged supergravity coupled to three vector multiplets specified by the pre-potential $\mathcal{V} = STU -W^2U \equiv 1$. A central outcome of our work is the demonstration that the thermodynamics of this solution consistently satisfies both the differential and integral forms of the first law of black hole thermodynamics. When the fourth charge is set to zero, our configuration reduces to the known three-charge static non-extremal AdS$_5$ black hole within the gauged $STU$ model, and its thermodynamic behavior connects smoothly to that limit. Finally, we also provide a brief discussion about topological classifications of its thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Evading the BBN bound with a soft stiff period</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08384v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmic inflation is the leading theory to explain early Universe history and structure formation. Non-oscillatory inflation is a class of models which can naturally introduce a post-inflationary stiff period of the Universe's evolution which boosts the signal of primordial gravitational waves (GWs), making it possible to observe them in forthcoming GW experiments. However, this pushes the GW energy density high enough to destabilise the process of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). This problem can be overcome by "softening" the stiff period, so that the field is gradually tending towards freefall from a frozen start. Here, we consider a modified hybrid inflation model where the stiff period is driven by the waterfall field, allowing the barotropic parameter of the Universe to vary, so that it does not violate the BBN constraint but produces a characteristic gravitational wave spectrum soon to be observable.</description>

      <title>Surgery and total mean curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10617v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove Gromov's conjecture on the total mean curvature of fill-ins in various cases. Our methods are based on surgery to reduce the statement to fill-ins of spheres, which can be treated by instances of the positive mass theorem. For spin fill-ins, where we permit the mean curvature to take negative values, we build on a classical surgery result of Lawson-Michelsohn and a recent positive mass theorem with creases by Kazaras-Khuri-Lin. For non-spin fill-ins of spin manifolds, where we assume the mean curvature to be non-negative, we develop a novel quantitative surgery process to reduce the general situation to a result of Shi-Wang-Wei. We also treat the case of fill-ins of non-spin manifolds, provided there is a fixed positive lower bound on the mean curvature.</description>
