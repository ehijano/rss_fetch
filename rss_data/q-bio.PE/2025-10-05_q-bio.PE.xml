      <title>Dynamics of memory B cells and plasmablasts in healthy individuals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our adaptive immune system relies on the persistence over long times of a diverse set of antigen-experienced B cells to encode our memories of past infections and to protect us against future ones. While longitudinal repertoire sequencing promises to track the long-term dynamics of many B cell clones simultaneously, sampling and experimental noise make it hard to draw reliable quantitative conclusions. Leveraging statistical inference, we infer the dynamics of memory B cell clonal dynamics and conversion to plasmablasts, which includes clone creation, degradation, abundance fluctuations, and differentiation. We find that memory B cell clones degrade slowly, with a half-life of 10 years. Based on the inferred parameters, we predict that it takes about 50 years to renew 50\% of the repertoire, with most observed clones surviving for a lifetime. We infer that, on average, 1 out of 100 memory B cells differentiates into a plasmablast each year, more than expected from purely antigen-stimulated differentiation, and that plasmablast clones degrade with a half-life of about one year in the absence of memory imports. Our method is general and could be applied to other longitudinal repertoire sequencing B cell subsets.</description>

      <title>The land use-climate change-biodiversity nexus in European islands stakeholders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To promote climate adaptation and mitigation, it is crucial to understand stakeholder perspectives and knowledge gaps on land use and climate changes. Stakeholders across 21 European islands were consulted on climate and land use change issues affecting ecosystem services. Climate change perceptions included temperature, precipitation, humidity, extremes, and wind. Land use change perceptions included deforestation, coastal degradation, habitat protection, renewable energy facilities, wetlands, and others. Additional concerns such as invasive species, water or energy scarcity, infrastructure problems, and austerity were also considered. Climate and land use change impact perceptions were analysed with machine learning to quantify their influence. The predominant climatic characteristic is temperature, and the predominant land use characteristic is deforestation. Water-related problems are top priorities for stakeholders. Energy-related problems, including energy deficiency and issues with wind and solar facilities, rank high as combined climate and land use risks. Stakeholders generally perceive climate change impacts on ecosystem services as negative, with natural habitat destruction and biodiversity loss identified as top issues. Land use change impacts are also negative but more complex, with more explanatory variables. Stakeholders share common perceptions on biodiversity impacts despite geographic disparity, but they differentiate between climate and land use impacts. Water, energy, and renewable energy issues pose serious concerns, requiring management measures.</description>

      <title>Evolution du Principe d'Exclusion Comp\'etitive : Le r\^ole des math\'ematiques</title>

Abstract: Everyone can see that over the last 150 years, theoretical ecology has become considerably more mathematical. But what is the nature of this phenomenon? Are mathematics applied, as in the use of statistical tests, for example, or are they involved, as in physics, where laws cannot be expressed without them? Through the history of the {\em Competitive Exclusion Principle} formulated at the very beginning of the 20th century by the naturalist Grinnell concerning the distribution of brown-backed chickadees, up to its modern integration into what is known in mathematics as population dynamics, I highlight the effectiveness of what could be called the mathematical novel in clarifying certain concepts in theoretical ecology.</description>

      <title>Identifying Asymptomatic Nodes in Network Epidemics using Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Infected individuals in some epidemics can remain asymptomatic while still carrying and transmitting the infection. These individuals contribute to the spread of the epidemic and pose a significant challenge to public health policies. Identifying asymptomatic individuals is critical for measuring and controlling an epidemic, but periodic and widespread testing of healthy individuals is often too costly. This work tackles the problem of identifying asymptomatic individuals considering a classic SI (Susceptible-Infected) network epidemic model where a fraction of the infected nodes are not observed as infected (i.e., their observed state is identical to susceptible nodes). In order to classify healthy nodes as asymptomatic or susceptible, a Graph Neural Network (GNN) model with supervised learning is adopted where a set of node features are built from the network with observed infected nodes. The approach is evaluated across different network models, network sizes, and fraction of observed infections. Results indicate that the proposed methodology is robust across different scenarios, accurately identifying asymptomatic nodes while also generalizing to different network sizes and fraction of observed infections.</description>

      <title>phylo2vec: a library for vector-based phylogenetic tree manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19490v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phylogenetics is a fundamental component of evolutionary analysis frameworks in biology and linguistics. Recently, the advent of large-scale genomics and the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has highlighted the necessity for phylogenetic software to handle large datasets. While significant efforts have focused on scaling optimisation algorithms, visualization, and lineage identification, an emerging body of research has been dedicated to efficient representations of data for genomes and phylogenetic trees. Compared to the traditional Newick format which represents trees using strings of nested parentheses, modern tree representations utilize integer vectors to define the tree topology traversal. This approach offers several advantages, including easier manipulation, increased memory efficiency, and applicability to machine learning.
  Here, we present the latest release of phylo2vec (or Phylo2Vec), a high-performance software package for encoding, manipulating, and analysing binary phylogenetic trees. At its core, the package is based on the phylo2vec representation of binary trees, and is designed to enable fast sampling and tree comparison. This release features a core implementation in Rust for improved performance and memory efficiency, with wrappers in R and Python (superseding the original release), making it accessible to a broad audience in the bioinformatics community.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Mutation as a Mechanism for the Emergence of SARS-CoV-2 New Variants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10471v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predicting the future evolutionary trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 remains a critical challenge, particularly due to the pivotal role of spike protein mutations. It is therefore essential to develop evolutionary models capable of continuously integrating new experimental data. In this study, we employ a cladogram algorithm that incorporates established assumptions for mutant representation -- using both four-letter and two-letter formats -- along with an n-mer distance algorithm to construct a cladogenetic tree of SARS-CoV-2 mutations. This tree accurately captures the observed changes across macro-lineages. We introduce a stochastic method for generating new strains on this tree based on spike protein mutations. For a given set A of existing mutation sites, we define a set X comprising x randomly generated mutation sites on the spike protein. The intersection of A and X, denoted as set Y, contains y sites. Our analysis indicates that the position of a generated strain on the tree is primarily determined by x. Through large-scale stochastic sampling, we predict the emergence of new macro-lineages. As x increases, the dominance among macro-lineages shifts: lineage O surpasses N, P surpasses O, and eventually Q surpasses P. We identify threshold values of x that delineate transitions between these macro-lineages. Furthermore, we propose an algorithm for predicting the timeline of macro-lineage emergence. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 evolution adheres to statistical principles: the emergence of new strains can be driven by randomly generated spike protein sites, and large-scale stochastic sampling reveals evolutionary patterns underlying the rise of distinct macro-lineages.</description>
