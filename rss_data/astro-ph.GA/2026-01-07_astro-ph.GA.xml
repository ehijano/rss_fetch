      <title>Exactly solved model of a one dimensional self gravitating system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A model one-dimensional self consistent steady state collisionless self-gravitating system in which all the particles have the same energy is presented. This has the remarkable property that the position and velocity of the particles orbiting in their own self consistent potential are given exactly, in terms of time, by the truncations of sine and cosine functions to the first two terms in their respective Taylor series. The potential and density also have simple analytic expressions in terms of time as parameter. It is not being claimed that this system has any direct astronomical application. However, it does motivate a conjecture about the behaviour of the density, potential, and orbits near caustics in simulations of cold collisionless dark matter. It is a rather surprising result which might interest practitioners of stellar dynamics and serve as an elementary example in teaching the subject.</description>

      <title>Electron temperature relations and the direct N, O, Ne, S and Ar abundances of 49959 star-forming galaxies in DESI Data Release 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the largest direct-method abundance catalogue of galaxies to date, containing measurements of 49$\,$959 star-forming galaxies at $z &lt; 0.96$ from DESI Data Release 2. By directly measuring electron temperatures across multiple ionization zones, we provide constraints on a number of electron temperature relations finding good consistency with previous literature relations. Using these temperature measurements, we derive reliable abundances for N, O, Ne, S and Ar and measure the evolution of abundances and abundance ratios of as a function of metallicity and other galaxy properties. Our measurements include direct oxygen abundances for 49$\,$766 galaxies, leading to the discovery of the two most metal-poor galaxies in the nearby Universe, with oxygen abundances of $\rm 12+\log(O/H) = 6.77_{-0.03}^{+0.03}~\rm dex$ (1.2\% $\rm Z_{\odot}$) and $\rm 12+\log(O/H) = 6.81_{-0.04}^{+0.04}~\rm dex$ (1.3\% $\rm Z_{\odot}$). We identify a rare outlier population of 139 galaxies with high N/O ratios at low metallicity, reminiscent of galaxy abundances observed in the early Universe. We find these high N/O galaxies are more massive than typical galaxies at the same metallicity. We find the Ne/O ratio is constant at low metallicity but increases significantly at $\rm 12+log(O/H) &gt; 8.105\pm0.004$ dex. We show that the S/O and Ar/O abundance ratios are strongly correlated, consistent with the expected additional Type Ia enrichment channel for S and Ar. In this work we present an initial survey of the key properties of the sample, with this dataset serving as a foundation for extensive future work on galaxy abundances at low redshift.</description>

      <title>Hunting for the First Explosions at the High-Redshift Frontier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has spectroscopically confirmed galaxies up to $z\sim14$, 300 Myr after the Big Bang, and several candidates have been discovered at $z\sim15-25$, with one candidate as high as $z\sim30$, only 100 Myr after the Big Bang. Such objects are unexpected, since theoretical studies have not predicted the existence of detectable galaxies at $z\sim30$. While any $z\sim30$ candidates may be contaminants at lower redshifts, we explore whether such extreme redshift sources could be consistent with hyper-energetic transient events linked to the formation of the first, metal-free, stars. Specifically, we consider pair-instability supernovae (PISNe), a predicted class of extreme thermonuclear explosions that leave no remnant behind. Using cosmological simulations, we investigate an overdense cosmic region, where star formation and subsequent PISNe occur at $z\sim30-40$, even within standard cosmology. Assessing the likelihood of such a region, the corresponding number of PISNe at $z\gtrsim20$, and their observed flux, we find that JWST has a non-negligible chance to detect a PISN event at extremely high redshifts. If a transient event were confirmed at $z\sim30$, this would provide a direct glimpse into the epoch of first star formation, dramatically extending the empirical reach of astronomy.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Chance Superpositions: Largest Catalog of Quasar-Galaxy Pairs at a Projected Separation of $D \lesssim 20$ kpc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the largest catalogue to date of Galaxies On Top Of Quasars (GOTOQs), systems where the sightline to a background quasar passes directly through or very close to a foreground galaxy. Using $\approx$1.1 million quasar spectra from SDSS DR16 and the DESI Early Data Release, we identify 1345 unique GOTOQs over the redshift range $0.0045 \leq z \leq 1.09$, more than quadrupling the number previously known. The catalogue combines both absorption agnostic and absorption selected searches, enabling a statistically robust characterization of gas in galaxies at projected separations $D \lesssim 20$ kpc. The GOTOQ emission line ratios indicate that their host galaxies are predominantly normal, star forming disks with typical dust extinctions of $A_V \approx 0.5$ mag. We measure the MgII covering fraction at $D \lesssim 20$ kpc and find it to be remarkably high, $f_c = 98.2^{+1.3}_{-4.5}$ per cent, indicating that these systems trace gas rich, metal enriched regions at the disk halo interface. The median colour excess towards the quasar line of sight, $E(B-V) = 0.087$, is significantly higher than that of typical MgII absorbers, underscoring the dust rich nature of GOTOQ sightlines. From a high signal to noise composite spectrum, we report the first statistical detection of the diffuse interstellar band at $\lambda 4428$ ($W_r = 0.055 \pm 0.011$ angstrom), revealing the presence of complex organic molecules at the disk halo interface. This catalogue provides a powerful reference sample for future multi wavelength studies of gas flows, cold gas, and dust evolution in the inner circumgalactic medium.</description>

      <title>CHANG-ES XXXVII. Effects of spectral aging on radio scale heights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02483v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Cosmic rays and magnetic fields play an important role for the formation and evolution of galaxies. Radio continuum observations allows us to study them in the haloes of edge-on galaxies. Aims. We explore the frequency dependence of the radio scale height which depends on cosmic ray transport and electron cooling. We test the influence of fundamental galaxy properties, such as star-formation rate (SFR), mass and size. Methods. We used radio continuum data of 16 edge-on galaxies from the Continuum HAloes in Nearby Galaxies -- an EVLA Survey (CHANG-ES). We included maps from the LOw Frequency ARray at 144 MHz and from the Jansky Very Large Array at 3 GHz with 7" angular resolution. We extracted vertical intensity profiles within the effective radio radius and fitted beam-convolved double-exponential models to separate thin and thick discs. For the thick radio discs, we computed mean spectral indices and scale-height ratios between 144 MHz and 3 GHz. Results. We find a mean scale-height ratio of 1.26 \pm 0.16. This is much lower than what we would expect for either cosmic ray diffusion or advection if synchrotron and inverse Compton losses dominate for the electrons. There is a moderate positive correlation between the ratio and spectral index of the thick disc: galaxies with high ratios have flat radio spectra. The ratio does not depend on any other galaxy parameter. The radio spectrum of the thick disc, as indicated by the radio spectral index, steepens with total mass (strong correlation) and flattens with SFR-to-mass surface density (moderate correlation). Conclusions. Galaxies with galactic winds have flat radio continuum spectra and large scale heights at low frequencies. This shows effective transport of cosmic rays in such systems.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Origins of Azimuthal Metallicity Variations in the Galactic Disk: Insights from Kinematic Ridges with Gaia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kinematic and spectroscopic studies in the past few years have revealed coherent azimuthal metallicity variations across the Milky Way's disk that may be the result of dynamical processes associated with non-axisymmetric features of the Galaxy. At the same time, stellar kinematics from Gaia have uncovered ridge-like features in the velocity space, raising the question of whether these chemical and dynamical substructures share a common origin. Using a sample of disk stars from Gaia DR3, we find that azimuthal metallicity variations are correlated with kinematic ridges in the V_phi-R plane, suggesting a shared origin. We utilize a suite of Milky Way test-particle simulations to assess the role of transient spiral arms, the bar, and interactions with a Sagittarius-like dwarf galaxy in simultaneously shaping both chemical and kinematic substructures. Among the physical mechanisms explored, bar and spiral arm interactions are the ones that consistently reproduce both the chemo-kinematic features and alignment observed in the Gaia data. While our model of an interaction with a Sagittarius-like dwarf galaxy can also induce kinematic and metallicity substructure, the amplitude of the azimuthal metallicity variations are too weak, suggesting this is likely not the dominant influence. Although additional contributing processes cannot be ruled out, the azimuthal metallicity variations observed in Gaia are best explained by a dynamical origin. Our results support the view that that azimuthal metallicity variations in the Galaxy are driven by similar dynamical mechanisms responsible for generating the kinematic ridges and co-moving groups.</description>

      <title>Star Formation in Galaxy Collisions: Dependence on Impact Velocity and Gas Mass of Galaxies in GADGET-4 Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates variations in the star formation rate during galaxy collisions when the initial conditions of velocity and gas mass are altered. For this purpose, hydrodynamic simulations were performed using the GADGET-4 code, with initial conditions generated by the Galstep and SnapshotJoiner programs. Systems of two galaxies on a head-on collision course were modeled with relative initial velocities ranging from 100 km/s to 1000 km/s, considering two scenarios: the first with identical galaxies, and the second with galaxies of different sizes. In simulations of systems with higher initial relative velocities, both found more intense peaks in the star formation rate, triggered by the first contact of the collision, followed by a strong decline caused by gas dispersion. In contrast, for systems with lower initial velocities, mergers between galaxies were observed, leading to multiple peaks in the star formation rate. A greater initial distance between galaxies has also been linked to whether or not the galaxy system merges, since it implies longer timescales for gravitational action, which leads to higher relative velocities at the moment of collision. Furthermore, the star formation rate in galaxies was found to have a clear dependence on initial gas content. Furthermore, the initial gas content in galaxies was found to have a clear dependence on star formation rates. Overall, our results show that the relative impact velocity, the initial distance between the galaxies, and the gas content are important parameters for analyzing the star formation rate in colliding galaxies.</description>

      <title>The origin of strong $\alpha$-element bimodalities in FIRE simulations of Milky Way-mass galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the Milky Way's characteristic features is a strongly bimodal distribution of $\alpha$-process elements, such as Mg, at fixed [Fe/H] in stellar abundances. We examine patterns in [Mg/Fe] versus [Fe/H] in FIRE-2 simulations of Milky Way-mass galaxies. Out of 16 galaxies, 4 are capable of producing a strongly bimodal distribution. In all four galaxies, the high-$\alpha$ population corresponds to an older, radially-compact, thick disk, and the low-$\alpha$ population corresponds to a younger, radially-extended, thin disk, similar to the MW.The transition from high- to low-$\alpha$ took $0.3-1.2\Gyr$ and began $5.5-6.5\Gyr$ ago. [Mg/Fe] decreased at relatively fixed [Fe/H], both in the galaxy overall and at fixed radii: Fe enrichment nearly balanced gas accretion (and therefore dilution), but Mg enrichment was weaker. Importantly, this transition occurred during a period of relatively low gas fraction ($5-15\%$), immediately after a rapid decline in star formation (halving within a few hundred Myr), which caused an increase in Fe-producing white-dwarf supernovae relative to Mg-producing core-collapse supernovae. Only one case coincided with a major merger coalescence. We find similar trends in measuring stars by their current radius and by their birth radius, therefore, radial redistribution did not play a dominant role in the formation of a bimodality or its spatial dependence today. Overall, in FIRE-2, strong $\alpha$-element bimodalities are relatively uncommon ($\sim25\%$), often not associated with a major merger, and arise primarily from a rapid decline in star formation during relatively low gas fraction.</description>

      <title>Composite Bulges -- V. Detecting signatures of gas inflows in IFU data: The MUSE view of ionised gas kinematics in nearby galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using VLT/MUSE data, we study the ionised-gas kinematics in a mass- and volume-limited ($M_* \geq 10^{10} M_\odot$, $D \leq 20$\,Mpc) sample of 21 nearby galaxies to identify signatures of extended shocks within their inner kiloparsec, which appear as coherent velocity jumps in kinematic maps. By removing angular momentum, shocks in gas cause inflows, which can trigger nuclear star formation and fuel AGN activity. To identify the signatures of extended shocks, we examine residual velocity fields after subtracting a modelled rotating disc, and we study velocity difference between various gas tracers. Combining our kinematic analysis with BPT ionisation diagnostic maps and dust morphology, we find that 11 of 21 galaxies ($\sim$52%) show extended shock signatures with velocity jumps consistent with models of bar-driven shocks. This is likely a lower limit, as three additional galaxies ($\sim$15%) exhibit shocks along bars, potentially reaching the nucleus but obscured by AGN outflows. We trace shock signatures inwards close to the resolution limit, which suggests that shocks may be the prevailing mechanism of inflow in the central kpc of galaxies. The only two unbarred galaxies in our sample are also the only systems with unperturbed kinematics and no shocks, strongly linking the perturbed gas dynamics in centres of galaxies to the presence of bars. All galaxies with inner bars show LINER- or Seyfert-like nuclear emission, whereas galaxies without inner bars exhibit all emission types, indicating that regardless of gas supply, inner bars suppress star formation in galactic nuclei.</description>

      <title>COUGS-DESI: A Catalog of Unusual Galaxies with Polar Structures in the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polar-structure galaxies (PSGs) host photometrically and kinematically decoupled components oriented at large angles to one another. These systems, which include polar rings, polar disks, polar halos, polar bulges, polar dust lanes, and polar tidal structures, provide valuable insights into galaxy formation and evolution, although their rarity has limited statistical studies. We aim to construct the largest and most homogeneous catalog of PSGs to date in order to enable robust statistical studies of their properties and occurrence rates in the local Universe. Using DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys (DR10) data, we identified PSG candidates in the Siena Galaxy Atlas (SGA) through visual inspection, convolutional neural network classification, and cross-matching with previously reported systems. Each galaxy was assigned a PSG subtype and host morphology. We analyzed general properties of PSGs and compared them with those for all galaxies in the SGA. Simple image simulations were used to evaluate projection effects. The resulting Catalog of Unusual Galaxies with polar Structures in the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys (COUGS-DESI) contains 2,989 PSG candidates, including 342 previously known objects. Projection effects from random galaxy overlaps are negligible. The sample spans a wide range of polar morphologies, with 1,113 polar rings, 75 polar bulges, 216 polar halos, 185 polar dust lanes, and 1,315 polar tidal structures. PSGs constitute 2.2% of local non-dwarf galaxies, with polar rings representing 0.7%. Approximately 1% of S0 galaxies in the SGA host polar rings, whereas spirals constitute the most common morphological type among the PSG hosts in our catalog. COUGS--DESI increases the number of known PSG candidates by an order of magnitude and provides a foundation for detailed studies of the formation and evolution of polar structures.</description>

      <title>E-XQR-30: Evidence for an Increase in the Ionization State of Metal Absorbers from z~6 to z~2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the evolution of the ionization state of metal-enriched gas in and around galaxies near the epoch of reionization using a sample of 488 metal absorption systems at 4.3&lt;z&lt;6.3 from the E-XQR-30 survey. We classify the absorption systems based on whether they display only low-ionization absorption (CII, SiII, MgII), only high-ionization absorption (CIV, SiIV), or both. The percentage of low-ionization-only systems decreases from 24% at $z\sim$6 to 2% at $z\sim$4.3, whilst the fraction of high-ionization-only systems increases from 52% to 82%. For mixed absorbers (with both low and high ionization absorption), we use the column density ratios log(N_CII/N_CIV) and log(N_SiII/N_SiIV) to quantify the average ionization as a function of redshift. The log(N_SiII/N_SiIV) ratio does not change significantly over 5$\lesssim z \lesssim$6.3. We combine the E-XQR-30 log(N_CII/N_CIV) measurements with literature measurements at $z\sim$2-4 and find that the log(N_CII/N_CIV) ratio declines by a factor of $\sim$20 between $z\sim$6 and $z\sim$2. To explore possible drivers of this evolution, we run photoionization models of gas slabs illuminated by a uniform UV background at fixed density, metallicity and HI column density. We find that the increase in the ionization state of metal absorbers towards lower redshifts can likely be explained by some combination of 1) an increase in the metallicity of CIV-absorbing gas and 2) a decrease in the typical HI column densities of the absorbing gas, driven by the declining cosmic mean density and a rapid rise in the strength of the UV background during the final stages of reionization.</description>

      <title>The Origin of Spin-Alignment of Dark Matter Subhalos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Subhalo spin is essential for modeling galaxy formation and controlling systematic uncertainties in intrinsic alignment (IA) studies. However, the physical mechanisms governing subhalo spin acquisition within the tidal environments of host halos remain poorly understood. In this work, we investigate the alignment between subhalo and host halo spins using the high-resolution cosmological $N$-body simulation, Shin-Uchuu. We find that the spin alignment between subhalos and host halos becomes increasingly pronounced toward the central regions. Our analysis reveals that subhalos typically acquire spin in the same direction as their orbital angular momentum. Since the orbital angular momentum of most subhalos is aligned with the host halo spin, an overall alignment between subhalo and host spins emerges. When classified by orbital orientation, however, subhalo spins in the inner regions are found to be oriented perpendicularly or anti-parallel to the host spin for polar and retrograde orbits, respectively. These results provide strong evidence that subhalo spins are acquired through torques exerted by the tidal field of the host halo. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the mass ratio and the radial distance from the host center are the primary parameters governing subhalo spin alignment, while the dependence on the accretion redshift is found to be negligible.</description>

      <title>A Tale of Two Dust Disks in Our Milky</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic dust plays a vital role in stellar and galactic formation and evolution, but its three-dimensional structure in the Milky Way has remained unclear due to insufficient precise reddening and distance measurements. Although early studies typically adopted a single-disk model, we detect two distinct components at Galactocentric distances of 5-14 kpc, enabled by photometric, spectroscopic, and astrometric measurements of over 5 million stars. The thin dust disk's scale height increases radially from 60 to 200 pc, while the thick disk grows from 300 to 800 pc. For the first time, we find the thin and thick dust disk correlates spatially with molecular and atomic hydrogen disk, respectively. The thin, thick, and combined disks have scale lengths of 9.6+1.2-1.1 kpc, 4.2+0.4-0.3 kpc, and 6.6+0.3-0.3 kpc, respectively. The gas-to-dust ratio shows an exponential radial gradient, increasing from around 60 at 5 kpc to around 470 at 14 kpc. These findings provide new insights into dust morphology in the Galaxy and raise fundamental questions that require further investigation.</description>

      <title>A Galactic Supernova Remnant Candidate at l =25.8, b=+0.2 Revealed by Near-Infrared Imaging and Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present high-resolution near-infrared spectroscopic observations of the newly identified supernova remnant (SNR) candidate G25.8+0.2 obtained with the Immersion Grating Infrared Spectrograph (IGRINS) on the Harlan J. Smith Telescope. The source was originally discovered in the UKIRT Wide-field Infrared Survey for Fe+ (UWIFE; Lee et al. 2014). Our spectra reveal multiple kinematic components in the [Fe II] 1.644 um emission. The high-velocity components exhibit elevated [Fe II]/Br gamma ratios characteristic of shock excitation, while the low-velocity components are dominated by hydrogen and helium recombination lines and are consistent with photoionized gas, indicating an H II-region origin. G25.8+0.2 lies within the G26 complex, a large (~15'x 30', corresponding to ~28 pc x 57 pc at a distance of 6.5 kpc) star-forming region in the inner Galaxy. The shock-excited [Fe II] filaments closely trace the morphology of the bright radio shell that partially encloses centrally filled soft X-ray emission, strongly suggesting recent supernova activity in this region. We discuss the physical nature of G25.8+0.2 and its relationship to the surrounding G26 star-forming complex. In addition, we derive the extinction toward the source using Brackett-line ratios and constrain the spectral types of the dominant ionizing stars from the He I 2.058 um/Br gamma line ratios.</description>

      <title>Beyond Sgr A* and M87*: Sub-Microarcsecond Black Hole Shadow Detection via Lunar-based Extremely Long Baseline Interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 1.3 mm ground-based very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) array, the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT), is limited by the Earth's diameter and can image the supermassive black hole (SMBH) shadows of only M87* and Sgr A*. Extending the array with an assumed lunar-based telescope could achieve $\sim 0.85\ \mu$as angular resolution at 230 GHz, enabling black hole shadow detection for a larger SMBH sample. The concept is motivated by space VLBI missions and lunar exploration, including the ongoing Lunar Orbit VLBI Experiment (LOVEX) aboard QueQiao-2 (Chang'E-7) and the planned International Lunar Research Station (ILRS). We assess shadow detectability for 31 SMBH with predicted large angular sizes, exploring different telescope location and antenna size. Assuming a telescope at the lunar antipode, we simulate the Moon-Earth (u,v) coverage and show that source geometry relative to the Moon's orbit determines whether the primary indicator of shadow, first visibility null, can be sampled. Using a geometric ring model, we identify six high-priority targets: M104, NGC 524, PGC 049940, NGC 5077, NGC 5252, and NGC 1052. Shadows of M104, NGC 5077, and NGC 1052 are detectable with a 5 m lunar-based telescope; PGC 049940 requires 20 m; NGC 524 and NGC 5252 require 100 m. Photon ring detection for Sgr A*, M87*, NGC 1600, and M31 is possible if space telescopes fill the baseline coverage gaps and sensitivity requirements are met. These results provide a clear scientific and technical motivation for lunar-based telescopes in future black hole shadow studies.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Anisotropy of Dispersion Measure Contribution from the Galactic Halo by Using Fast Radio Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a data-driven approach to reconstruct the all-sky distribution of the dispersion measure contribution from the Galactic halo ($\mathrm{DM_{halo}}$) through a spherical harmonic expansion, enabling an investigation of its possible anisotropies. Based on the NE2001 model and using 92 localized and 574 unlocalized non-repeating fast radio bursts (FRBs) at Galactic latitudes $|b|&gt;15^\circ$, we find a significant dipole anisotropy in $\mathrm{DM_{halo}}$, pointing toward $(l=130^\circ,\, b=+5^\circ)$ with a $1\sigma$ uncertainty of approximately $28^\circ$. The $\mathrm{DM_{halo}}$ value in this direction is $63\pm9~\mathrm{pc~cm^{-3}}$, exceeding the all-sky mean by about $2.6\sigma$. This result is not significantly affected by the choice of Galactic ISM models. Furthermore, even when using a refined sample of 62 localized FRBs (excluding CHIME detections, repeaters, and unlocalized events), the dipole anisotropic structure persists, with a direction of $(l=141^\circ,\, b=+51^\circ)$ and a larger 1$\sigma$ uncertainty of $\sim 44^\circ$. Model comparisons using the Akaike Information Criterion and Bayesian evidence yield consistent preferences, and together they suggest that current FRB data slightly favor the existence of a dipole structure in $\mathrm{DM_{halo}}$. If this feature is not a statistical fluctuation or systematic error, its physical origin requires further investigation. Future FRB samples with larger sizes and more complete sky coverage will be essential to confirm or refute this possible anisotropic structure.</description>

      <title>BEACON: JWST NIRCam Pure-parallel Imaging Survey. II. Physical Properties of $z=7-14$ Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present photometric properties of 161 galaxy candidates at $z=7-14$ selected from the second data release (DR2) of BEACON, a JWST Cycle 2 pure-parallel NIRCam imaging program. Carefully selected from 36 independent pointings (corresponding to $\sim350$\,arcmin$^2$ sky coverage), and hence with reduced cosmic variance, our galaxy candidates provide an unbiased sample for investigating galaxy properties over a wide range of environments. We measure the physical properties, including UV continuum slope ($\beta_{\rm UV}$), stellar mass ($M_*$), star formation rate (SFR), and sizes. Our highest redshift galaxy candidate at $z=13.71\pm0.15$ has a remarkably bright UV luminosity of $M_{\rm UV}=-21.19\pm0.08$, making it the brightest galaxy at $z&gt;12$ if spectroscopically confirmed. With an extremely blue UV slope, compact morphology, and high star formation rate surface density ($\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$), this candidate may have extremely low metallicity, high ionizing photon escape fraction, or contributions from an AGN. Among our multiple independent sightlines, we identify three fields of galaxy number overdensity with $&gt;3\sigma$ significance. The properties of galaxies in various environments do not exhibit significant differences, implying either that accelerated galaxy evolution in overdense regions is not yet widespread at $z&gt;7$, or that the current constraints are limited by sample size. Our simulations indicate that increasing the sample by an order of magnitude would allow such environmental trends to be robustly confirmed or ruled out, underscoring the importance of future pure-parallel observations.</description>

      <title>GATOS XI : Excess dust heating in the Narrow Line Regions of nearby AGN revealed with JWST/MIRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present JWST/MIRI imaging of eight nearby Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) from the GATOS survey to investigate the physical conditions of extended dust in their narrow line regions (NLRs). In four galaxies (ESO 428-G14, NGC 4388, NGC 3081, and NGC 5728), we detect spatially resolved dust structures extending ~100-200 pc along the NLR. In these systems, we find a strong link between the morphology of the dust, the radio ejecta, and the coronal [Si VI] emission, implying that dust carries imprints of the processes shaping the NLR. Using spatially resolved spectral energy distributions, we show that dust in the NLR has systematically steeper slopes than star forming clumps. This dust emits at temperatures in the range 150 - 220 K, at a distance of ~150 pc from the nucleus. Using simple models, we show that, even under optimistic assumptions of grain size and AGN luminosity, the excess MIR emission cannot be explained by AGN illumination alone. We interpret this excess heating as in-situ. We show that shocks with velocities of $v_{\rm shock} \sim 200- 400 \, \rm km/s$ in dense gas can close this gap, and in some cases even account for the total observed emission. This, combined with multiple lines of evidence for shocks in these regions, supports a scenario in which shocks not only coexist with dust but may be playing a key role in heating it. Our findings reveal shocks may be an important and previously overlooked driver of extended dust emission in the central hundreds of parsecs in AGN.</description>

      <title>A Long Tidal Feature Extending from a Low-Redshift Galaxy Revealed in Rubin Data Preview 1 Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Data Preview 1 (DP1), we present the detection and photometric analysis of a stellar stream extending along the minor axis of a massive disk-galaxy, LEDA 751050, at a redshift of z = 0.1 in the Extended Chandra Deep Field-South (ECDFS). This feature appears to be an analog of the M31 Giant Stellar Stream, spanning around 130 kpc by 15 kpc, with an estimated stellar mass of M_* = 6x10^8 M_Sun, and a mean g-band surface brightness (SB) of mu_g = 28.6 mag/arcsec^2. This discovery demonstrates Rubin's ability to reveal low-SB substructures and foreshadows the future capabilities when the full Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) data set is actualized.</description>

      <title>Thick Disks, Thin Hopes: Suppressed Capture and Merger Rates in AGN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiple models have been suggested over the years to explain the structure and support of accretion disks around supermassive black holes, from the standard thin thermal-pressure-dominated $\alpha$-disk model to more recent models that describe geometrically thicker radiation or magnetic or turbulence-dominated disks. In any case, objects embedded in the disk (e.g. compact objects, stars, gas, dust) can undergo gravitational and hydrodynamic interactions with each other leading to interesting processes such as binary interaction/capture, gravitational wave merger events, dynamical friction, accretion, gap opening, etc. It has long been argued that disks of active galactic nuclei (AGN) can enhance the rates for many of these events; however, almost all of that analysis has assumed specific thin-disk models (with aspect ratios $H/R \lesssim 0.01$). We show here that the rates for processes such as these that are mediated by gravitational cross-sections has a very strong inverse dependence on the thickness $H/R$ (scaling as steeply as $(H/R)^{-8}$), and $H/R$ can vary in the outer disk (where these processes are often invoked) by factors $\gtrsim 1000$ depending on the assumed source of pressure support in the disk. This predicts rates that can be lower by tens of orders-of-magnitude in some models, demonstrating that it is critical to account for disk parameters such as aspect ratio and different sources of disk pressure when computing any meaningful predictions for these rates. For instance, if magnetic pressure is important in the outer disk, as suggested in recent work, capture rates would be suppressed by factors $\sim 10^{10}-10^{20}$ compared to previous studies where magnetic pressure was ignored.</description>

      <title>Catching 3I/ATLAS Using a Solar Oberth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The third interstellar object to be discovered, 3I/ATLAS, has a unique and continually unfolding story to tell about its nature and origin as it is monitored by telescopes on Earth, orbiting Earth and around the Solar System. Previous research into missions using chemical propulsion have only really addressed the direct case, where the opportunity to launch already expired before 3I/ATLAS's discovery. In contrast, investigations herein exploit 'Optimum Interplanetary Trajectory Software' to simulate an alternative indirect option for chemical propulsion, namely the Solar Oberth Manoeuvre (SOM). For a SOM, a low perihelion burn provides maximum benefit from the Oberth Effect, and accelerates the spacecraft rapidly towards the receding 3I/ATLAS. Though in principle feasible, results indicate this option presents significant challenges. For possible launch years between 2031 and 2037 inclusive, a 2035 launch permits the most efficient transfer to 3I/ATLAS. The reference mission requires a SOM at 3.2 Solar Radii from the Sun's centre, with an intercept after 35-50 years. It is found the SOM can leverage spacecraft masses up to $\sim{500}$ kg. Two or three solid propellant boosters could deliver the required SOM $\Delta$V, and furthermore a refuelled Starship Block 3 in LEO has sufficient performance for such a mission. As inevitable with a SOM, some of the payload mass would be needed for a heat shield to protect against the high solar flux at low perihelion.</description>

      <title>Discovery of an Extremely Luminous Type II Cepheid in the Andromeda Giant Stellar Stream: Evidence for a Hierarchical Triple with an Inner Binary Merger</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the discovery of LAMOST J0041+3948, the most luminous post-AGB Type II Cepheid (TIIC) known, located in the Andromeda Giant Stellar Stream. Its spectral energy distribution (SED) exhibits a strong near-infrared excess, indicating the presence of a circumbinary dusty disk and hence binarity. SED fitting yields an effective temperature of $T_{\rm eff}=6738_{-262}^{+234}\,$K and a post-AGB luminosity of $\log(L/L_{\odot})=4.32_{-0.08}^{+0.07}$. Comparison with theoretical evolutionary tracks suggests a ~$2.0$-$4.0\,M_{\odot}$ progenitor when accounting for a possible scattered-light contribution. ZTF Light curves reveal a pulsation period of 89d that lies close to the period-luminosity relation for long-period RV Tauri stars. Follow-up spectroscopy reveals clear $s$-process enrichment and signatures consistent with an accretion disk around the companion. The inferred progenitor is significantly younger and more massive than a typical stream member, suggesting that an additional mechanism such as a stellar merger is required. We propose a formation channel in which the present post-AGB binary descends from a hierarchical triple system. In this scenario, the inner binary merged after the system was displaced to its current location by the galaxy merger event, and the resulting massive merger remnant subsequently evolved into the extremely luminous post-AGB star observed today.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Stellar-to-Halo Mass Relation with Galaxy Clustering and Weak Lensing from DES Year 3 Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22367v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a framework to study the relation between the stellar mass of a galaxy and the total mass of its host dark matter halo using galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing measurements. We model a wide range of scales, roughly from $\sim 100 \; {\rm kpc}$ to $\sim 100 \; {\rm Mpc}$, using a theoretical framework based on the Halo Occupation Distribution and data from Year 3 of the Dark Energy Survey (DES) dataset. The new advances of this work include: 1) the generation and validation of a new stellar mass-selected galaxy sample in the range of $\log M_\star/M_\odot \sim 9.6$ to $\sim 11.5$; 2) the joint-modeling framework of galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing that is able to describe our stellar mass-selected sample deep into the 1-halo regime; and 3) stellar-to-halo mass relation (SHMR) constraints from this dataset. In general, our SHMR constraints agree well with existing literature with various weak lensing measurements. We constrain the free parameters in the SHMR functional form $\log M_\star (M_h) = \log(\epsilon M_1) + f\left[ \log\left( M_h / M_1 \right) \right] - f(0)$, with $f(x) \equiv -\log(10^{\alpha x}+1) + \delta [\log(1+\exp(x))]^\gamma / [1+\exp(10^{-x})]$, to be $\log M_1 = 11.506^{+0.325}_{-0.404}$, $\log \epsilon = -1.632^{+0.306}_{-0.181}$, $\alpha = -1.638^{+0.108}_{-0.099}$, $\gamma = 0.596^{+0.251}_{-0.210}$ and $\delta = 3.810^{+2.045}_{-1.811}$. The inferred average satellite fraction is within $\sim 5-35\%$ for our fiducial results and we do not see any clear trends with redshift or stellar mass. Furthermore, we find that the inferred average galaxy bias values follow the generally expected trends with stellar mass and redshift. Our study is the first SHMR in DES in this mass range, and we expect the stellar mass sample to be of general interest for other science cases.</description>

      <title>Supermassive black hole growth from stellar binary encounters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02316v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The growth of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) remains a central problem in astrophysics, with current observations providing only limited constraints on the underlying mechanisms. One possible growth channel is stellar accretion via the Hills mechanism, wherein a SMBH tidally breaks up a passing binary star, capturing and eventually accreting a member of the binary. We adopt a framework based on kinematics to predict capture rates from parameters that include the central number density of stars, the stellar velocity dispersion, the binary fraction, and black hole mass. We then estimate the growth of SMBHs across a range of galactic environments. In a data set of 91 galaxies of various types and masses, we identify two candidates with SMBHs for which stellar accretion may be a driver of growth. Closer to home, a recent analysis of observed hypervelocity stars from the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) implicates binary star interactions with a massive black hole. Every hypervelocity star produced in this way leaves a bound partner that may be accreted, providing an active growth channel for the LMC's black hole.</description>

      <title>A census of quiescent galaxies across $0.5 &lt; z &lt; 8$ with JWST/MIRI: Mass-dependent number density evolution of quiescent galaxies in the early Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12235v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent JWST observations have revealed a large population of quiescent galaxies (QGs) at high redshift ($z \sim 4-8$), challenging current models of early galaxy formation and quenching. Accurate number density estimates are crucial but remain uncertain. We present a systematic study of QGs at $0.5 &lt; z &lt; 8$ using a mass-complete sample from the JWST/PRIMER survey with deep NIRCam and MIRI imaging. We demonstrate that MIRI photometry is essential for refining the QG sample: it helps to mitigate contamination from dusty star-forming galaxies in the high-mass regime at $z \sim 3-5$ and aids in recovering lower-mass QG candidates at $z &gt; 5$ that are often missed without including MIRI data. We find that the evolution of the QG number density is strongly mass-dependent. The density of massive QGs ($\log (M_{\star}/M_{\odot}) &gt; 10.6$) declines rapidly, falling from $n \approx 1.32\times10^{-5}~~\mathrm{Mpc^{-3}}$ at $z \sim 3-4$ to $n &lt; 1 \times10^{-6}~~\mathrm{Mpc^{-3}}$ at $z \sim 6$, and becomes negligible at $z &gt; 6$. In contrast, low-mass QGs ($9.5 &lt; \log (M_{\star}/M_{\odot}) &lt; 10.6$) exhibit a remarkably constant number density of $n \sim 3\times10^{-6}~\mathrm{Mpc^{-3}}$ across the redshift range $z = 4-8$. This plateau suggests that these high-redshift, low-mass QGs may be galaxies undergoing temporary quenching episodes, likely subject to rejuvenation upon future gas accretion. Comparisons with leading galaxy formation models reveal significant tensions: most models underestimate the abundance of massive QGs at $z &gt; 4$ and fail to reproduce the flat density evolution observed for the low-mass population.</description>

      <title>Supermassive Dark Stars and their remnants as a possible solution to three recent cosmic dawn puzzles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08477v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has begun to revolutionize our view of the Cosmos. The discovery of Blue Monsters (i.e., ultra-compact yet very bright high-z galaxies) and the Little Red Dots (i.e., very compact dustless strong Balmer break cosmic dawn sources) pose significant challenges to pre-JWST era models of the assembly of first stars and galaxies. In addition, JWST data further strengthen the problem posed by the origin of the supermassive black holes that power the most distant quasars observed. Stars powered by Dark Matter annihilation (i.e., Dark Stars) can form out of primordial gas clouds during the cosmic dawn era and subsequently might grow via accretion and become supermassive. In this paper we argue that Supermassive Dark Stars (SMDSs) offer natural solutions to the three puzzles mentioned above.</description>

      <title>Galactic bars are already mature at Cosmic Noon: bar strength and flatness at z ~ 1.5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04163v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the nature of $z&gt;1$ galactic bars. Once thought to be highly transient, our results demonstrate otherwise. Our sample consists of nine massive ($&gt;10^{10.5}\,\rm M_{\odot}$) star-forming barred-spiral galaxies at $z_{\rm spec} \sim 1.5$. Using rest-frame near-IR (F444W) JWST/NIRCam imaging, we apply ellipse fitting along with 1D and 2D morphological modeling to directly measure bar properties. We find that five galaxies host flat surface brightness profiles (bar S\'ersic index $&lt;0.4$), indicative of highly evolved, "mature" bars. By contrast, only two galaxies show exponential profiles, characteristic of young bars, and these are also shorter in absolute length than the flat bars. We therefore conclude that a large fraction of bars at this epoch have already matured, thereby indicating the presence of well-settled disks required to facilitate bar formation and sustained evolution well before $z\sim1.5$. To assess the gravitational impact of the bars, we calculate the maximum transverse-to-radial force ratio ($Q_{b}$). We find that $Q_{b}$ values are comparable to, or weaker than, those of bars in the local Universe, Seven of the nine bars show only a marginal increase in strength with maturity (from exponential to flat bars). Contrarily however, the remaining two bars are flat, but have the lowest $Q_{b}$ values in our sample. We hence propose that the mature bars at $z\sim 1.5$ may experience phases of weakening due to rapid gas inflows and/or minor mergers. In conclusion, our work sheds light on the rapidly evolving nature of high-z bars and paves the way for larger statistical studies.</description>

      <title>The Milky Way Bulge Extra-Tidal Star Survey: NGC 6569</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19074v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present spectroscopic evidence for tidal debris associated with the bulge globular cluster NGC 6569, based on medium-resolution (R ~ 11,000) Anglo-Australian Telescope spectra of 303 stars. Targets were selected using Blanco DECam Bulge Survey (BDBS) photometry and Gaia DR3 astrometry, spanning 7-30 arcmin (~1-5 rt, where rt is the King-model tidal radius) from the cluster center. Orbit-based modeling predicts a strongly time-variable Jacobi radius, with rJ ~ 8-11 arcmin near pericenter and ~18-22 arcmin near apocenter, so stars just outside rt can be unbound and feeding leading and lagging tidal tails. We identify 40 stars with kinematics and abundances consistent with previous, or borderline, cluster membership. The seven highest-quality candidates (S/N &gt; 30) have mean [Fe/H] = -0.83 +/- 0.14 and [alpha/Fe] = +0.38 +/- 0.06 dex, matching the bound population. Interpreting these stars as recently stripped debris implies a present-day mass-loss rate of 1.0-1.6 solar masses per Myr, or 5.6 +/- 1.3% of the current cluster mass per Gyr. These results indicate ongoing tidal stripping of NGC 6569 and quantify its contribution to the bulge field. This paper is part of the Milky Way Bulge Extra-Tidal Star Survey (MWBest) and is our first detailed debris study of a massive bulge globular cluster.</description>

      <title>The Advanced X-ray Imaging Satellite (AXIS) Community Science Book</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00253v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The AXIS Community Science Book represents the collective effort of 592 scientists worldwide to define the transformative science enabled by the Advanced X-ray Imaging Satellite (AXIS), a next-generation X-ray mission selected by NASA's Astrophysics Probe Program for Phase A study. AXIS will advance the legacy of high-angular-resolution X-ray astronomy with ~1.5'' imaging over a wide 24' field of view and an order of magnitude greater collecting area than Chandra in the 0.3-12 keV band. Combining sharp imaging, high throughput, and rapid response capabilities, AXIS will open new windows on virtually every aspect of modern astrophysics, exploring the birth and growth of supermassive black holes, the feedback processes that shape galaxies, the life cycles of stars and exoplanet environments, and the nature of compact stellar remnants, supernova remnants, and explosive transients. This book compiles 138 community-contributed science cases developed by five Science Working Groups focused on AGN and supermassive black holes, galaxy evolution and feedback, compact objects and supernova remnants, stellar physics and exoplanets, and time-domain and multi-messenger astrophysics. Together, these studies establish the scientific foundation for next-generation X-ray exploration in the 2030s and highlight strong synergies with facilities of the 2030s, such as JWST, Roman, Rubin/LSST, SKA, ALMA, ngVLA, and next-generation gravitational-wave and neutrino networks.</description>

      <title>A high-dynamic-range view of the growth of structure and the warm/hot Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13818v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Baryons heat to temperatures above $&gt;\!\!10^5\,\mathrm{K}$ as they accrete onto massive overdensities -- galaxies, groups, clusters, and filaments -- where they ionize and become optically transparent. Deep mm-wave observations such as those with ALMA have begun to probe a handful ($\sim\,$4) of massive systems at $z\!\sim\!2-4$, while low-resolution mm-wave surveys have detected thousands of objects at arcminute resolution out to $z\!\approx\!2$. To truly advance the field of the evolution of large-scale structures, mapping the warm/hot distribution of ionized gas out to the redshift of their formation, the ESO community requires a large-aperture single-dish (sub-)mm telescope. This will need to provide several orders of magnitude higher mapping speeds than currently available while preserving the few arcsecond resolution required for imaging the gas and removing contaminating radio and dusty thermal signals across the full (sub-)mm wavelength range.</description>
