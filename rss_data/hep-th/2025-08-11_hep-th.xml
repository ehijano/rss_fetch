      <title>Universal sectors of two-dimensional Carrollian CFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit modular invariance in two-dimensional Carrollian conformal field theories from a geometric perspective. Focusing on the characters of the induced and highest-weight representations of the theory, we show that there are regions of parameter space where the vacuum character dominates in the dual channel. We use this property to zoom into different subsectors of the Carrollian theory. One of them is reminiscent of the Schwarzian sector of a relativistic CFT2 and has a flat space holographic interpretation as O-plane orbifold. It exists only for the highest-weight representation. We prove that for all sectors with vacuum dominance in the dual channel, the specific heat is negative, concurrent with the holographic interpretation of the negative specific heat of asymptotically flat spacetimes with horizons.</description>

      <title>Learning geometries beyond asymptotic AdS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a data-driven method for holographic bulk reconstruction that works even when the spacetime is not asymptotically AdS. Given the data of boundary Green functions within a finite frequency window, we iteratively adjust a bulk metric with a finite radial cutoff until its holographic Green functions reproduce the boundary data. Based on the holographic Wilsonian renormalization group for the Klein-Gordon equation in an undetermined curve space, we construct a radial flow equation and transform it into a Neural ODE, which is an infinite-depth neural network for modeling continuous dynamics. Assuming the double-trace coupling $h$ in the Wilsonian action is real, we demonstrate that the Neural ODE can effectively learn the metrics with AdS, Lifshitz, and hyperscaling violated asymptotics. In particular, we apply the algorithm to the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model which slightly deviates from the conformal limit. In the hyperparameter space spanned by the rescaled temperature $\bar{T}$ and the radial cutoff $\epsilon$, we identify a critical curve along which the learned metric is close to AdS$_2$ black hole with finite cutoff. We derive an approximate analytical expression for this curve, from which an effective bulk dual of the SYK coupling $v$ is established. Our work provides a promising way for using machine learning to depict the novel bulk geometry dual to the non-conformal boundary systems in the real world.</description>

      <title>Quantum Geometric Phases as a New Window on Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05881v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how low-frequency gravitational waves (LFGWs), originating from distant astrophysical or cosmological sources, can induce purely quantum geometric phases in mesoscopic optomechanical systems. These phases represent subtle imprints with no classical counterpart, going beyond standard dynamical or Berry-type contributions that admit Hannay-angle analogues. Such ultra-weak waves couple to the motion of a mechanical mirror and generate distinctive phase shifts in the system's quantum state that cannot arise in any classical description. To access this effect, we propose a Ramsey-type interferometric protocol in which the photon-number states of a quantized optical mode become entangled with the mirror's center-of-mass motion, enabling a direct readout of the LFGW-induced geometric phase. This framework establishes a distinctly quantum approach for probing low-frequency gravitational wave modes, offering an alternative to conventional detection strategies based on spacetime strain.</description>

      <title>$AdS_3 \times S^3$ Virasoro-Shapiro amplitude with KK modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the first curvature correction to the string amplitude of four Kaluza--Klein (KK) modes on $AdS_3 \times S^3 \times M_4$, with $M_4=K3$ or $T^4$, in type IIB string theory, which is holographically dual to the four--point correlator $\langle \mathcal{O}_{p_1} \mathcal{O}_{p_2} \mathcal{O}_{p_3} \mathcal{O}_{p_4} \rangle$ of certain half--BPS operators in the boundary D1--D5 CFT. The result takes the form of an integral over the Riemann sphere, analogous to the flat-space Virasoro--Shapiro amplitude, but with insertions of single-valued multiple polylogarithms of weight three. Our results are obtained in two steps. First, we derive the $AdS_3 \times S^3$ Virasoro--Shapiro amplitude in the special case $\langle \mathcal{O}_{p} \mathcal{O}_{p} \mathcal{O}_{1} \mathcal{O}_{1} \rangle$, by matching the CFT block expansion with an ansatz based on single-valued multiple polylogarithms. We then employ the $AdS \times S$ Mellin formalism to generalize the result to the general case of four arbitrary KK modes $\langle \mathcal{O}_{p_1} \mathcal{O}_{p_2} \mathcal{O}_{p_3} \mathcal{O}_{p_4} \rangle$. Our analysis yields an infinite set of results for operator anomalous dimensions and OPE data in D1--D5 CFT at strong coupling. In particular, the resulting scaling dimensions of certain operators are shown to be consistent with classical string theory computations.</description>

      <title>Continuous spin field in the $\mathbf{AdS_6}$ space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A representation of the $\mathfrak{so}(2,5)$ algebra corresponding to the continuous spin field in $\mathbf{AdS_6}$ is considered. The algebra is realized using the Lie-Lorentz derivative, which naturally incorporates $\mathbf{AdS_6}$ geometry and spin degrees of freedom. Within this framework, we derive explicit expressions for the Casimir operators in terms of both the covariant derivative and the spin invariants. The continuous spin representation under consideration is defined by a system of operator constraints that generalize those known for six-dimensional Minkowski space. We demonstrate that these constraints completely fix all Casimir operators of the $\mathfrak{so}(2,5)$ algebra, with the eigenvalues determined by a dimensional real parameter $\boldsymbol{\mu}$ and a positive (half-)integer $s$.</description>

      <title>On massive higher spins and gravity. II. Spin 3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we continue our investigation of gravitational interactions for massive higher spins, extending our recent work on massive spin 5/2 to massive spin 3, including its massless and partially massless limits. To construct the minimal gravitational interactions (i.e. vertexes containing both standard minimal interactions and non-minimal ones, which are necessary for any $s \ge 5/2$), we use a gauge invariant frame-like formalism. Similarly to the spin 5/2 case, there is a special point $m^2 = 6\Lambda$, which corresponds to a boundary of the unitary allowed region in $dS_4$, where minimal interactions disappear, leaving only the non-minimal ones.</description>

      <title>Exact Sum Rules and Zeta Generating Formulas from the ODE/IM correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate exact sum rules (ESRs) and zeta generating formulas (ZGFs) for quantum mechanics defined by the ${\cal PT}$-symmetric potential $V_{\cal PT}(x) = x^{2K} (ix)^\varepsilon$ with $K,\varepsilon \in \mathbb{N}$, as well as the Hermitian potential $V_{\cal H}(x) = x^{2 K}$ with $K \in {\mathbb N} + 1$, based on the fusion relations of the $A_{2M-1}$ T-system in the framework of the ODE/IM correspondence. In this setup, the fusion relations on the integrable model (IM) side correspond to recurrence relations among quantization conditions on the ordinary differential equation (ODE) side, which we reformulate in terms of spectral zeta functions (SZFs), $\zeta_n(s) = \sum_{\alpha \in {\mathbb N}_0} E_{n,\alpha}^{-s}$, where $n$ denotes the fusion label. The ESRs yield algebraic relations among SZFs at fixed $n$, while the ZGFs establish explicit functional mappings between SZFs at different fusion labels. These structures are governed by a selection rule depending on both $M$ and $n$, induced in general by the combination of the structure of the Chebyshev polynomials appearing in the fusion relations and the $\mathbb{Z}_{2M+2}$ Symanzik rotational symmetry. Our results provide a novel spectral interpretation of the T-system in integrable models and point toward hidden algebraic structures governing global spectral data in $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric and Hermitian quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Geometry of supergravity and the Batalin--Vilkovisky formulation of the $\mathcal N=1$ theory in ten dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide full details of a BV formulation of $\mathcal N=1$ supergravity in ten dimensions, to all orders in fermions, built from the generalised geometry description of the theory. In contrast to standard treatments, we introduce neither the degrees of freedom corresponding to orthonormal frames for the metric nor the local Lorentz symmetries that remove them again. Instead, we observe that the field space has a fibred structure, with the fermionic degrees of freedom spanning the fibres. We explain in detail how this geometric picture allows one to understand simultaneous variations of spinorial quantities and the metric with respect to which the spinor bundles are defined. This leads to additional terms in certain commutators on field space which account for the Lorentz transformation terms appearing in the calculation of the supersymmetry algebra. Unencumbered by the Lorentz degrees of freedom, we provide an efficient and full demonstration that our action satisfies the classical master equation.</description>

      <title>Schwinger--DeWitt expansion for the heat kernel of nonminimal operators in causal theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We suggest a systematic calculational scheme for heat kernels of covariant nonminimal operators in causal theories whose characteristic surfaces are null with respect to a generic metric. The calculational formalism is based on a pseudodifferential operator calculus which allows one to build a linear operator map from the heat kernel of the minimal operator to the nonminimal one. This map is realized as a local expansion in powers of spacetime curvature, dimensional background fields, and their covariant derivatives with the coefficients -- the functions of the Synge world function and its derivatives. Finiteness of these functions, determined by multiple proper time integrals, is achieved by a special subtraction procedure which is an important part of the calculational scheme. We illustrate this technique on the examples of the vector Proca model and the vector field operator with a nondegenerate principal symbol. We also discuss smoothness properties of heat kernels of nonminimal operators in connection with the nondegenerate nature of their operator symbols.</description>

      <title>Vacuum polarization in the horizonless Bardeen metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the renormalized stress-energy tensor for a massless quantum scalar field in the background of the horizonless Bardeen spacetime. Within the weak-field approximation, we show that the vacuum fluctuations differ significantly between conformally and non-conformally coupled fields, both in magnitude and in their behavior at short and intermediate distances. At large distances, we recover the universal asymptotic behavior previously observed in black hole and Newtonian star backgrounds. Going beyond the weak-field regime, we find that, for certain parameter ranges, the modes of the field can develop imaginary frequencies, leading to instabilities and an exponential growth of vacuum fluctuations. We also discuss critically the applicability of the anomaly-induced effective action for computing the renormalized stress-energy tensor in the conformally coupled case.</description>

      <title>On the Determination of Collisional Stopping Power via Kaluza-Klein Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, the tools of general relativity are used to analytically derive collisional stopping power. We start from a Kaluza-Klein inspired, five-dimensional diffeomorphism-invariant action, and upon compactification, obtain a four-dimensional effective theory in which the matter fields are treated to be brane-localized. The medium response to the projected electron is encoded in symmetric tensor fields coupled covariantly to both electromagnetic and fermionic parts via Lagrangian-derived interactions. When $R_c \sim \Lambda_{\text{EM}}^{-1}$, $\Lambda_{\text{EM}} \gg m_e$ and $g_4^2 = \frac{3\pi^2 m_e v}{4\gamma^3 R_c^2 e^2 \Lambda_{\text{EM}}}$ are satisfied, the leading term of Bethe-Moller formula is shown to be recovered in the large $R'$ limit. The construction presented here may serve as an alternative approach that uses compactification geometry and medium excitations to determine observable couplings and stopping power. The model intrinsically supports phenomena linked to anisotropy and nonlinear response, as well as gravitational or extra-dimensional effects in laboratory-scale systems via the study of stopping power and particle range.</description>

      <title>Stable Islands of Weak Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an exploration of the phenomenology of Horndeski gravity, focusing on regimes that produce weak gravity compared to General Relativity. This letter introduces a novel method to generate models of modified gravity theories that produce a specific observational behaviour while fulfilling stability criteria, without imposing a fixed parametrisation. We start from the inherently stable basis of linear Horndeski theory, implemented in the recently released Einstein-Boltzmann solver mochi_class. The time evolution of the basis functions is designed with Gaussian processes that directly include the stability and phenomenology criteria during the generation. Here, we focus on models with weak gravity that suppress the growth of Large-Scale Structure at late times. To achieve this behaviour, we mainly focus on the design of a dynamical effective Planck mass for theories with a vanishing fifth force. We find a broad range of weak-gravity islands in Horndeski theory space. We also include additional features, like a vanishing modification to gravity at $z=0$, and extend the exploration to islands of gravity with a non-zero fifth force. Finally, we show that replacing the $\Lambda$CDM expansion model by the DESI $w_0w_a$CDM best fit also produces stable islands of weak gravity.</description>

      <title>Role of Plaquette Term in Genuine $2+1$D String Dynamics on Quantum Simulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the advent of quantum simulators of $2+1$D lattice gauge theories (LGTs), a fundamental open question is under what circumstances the observed physics is genuinely $2+1$D rather than effectively $1+1$D. Here, we address this question in the ongoing strong effort to quantum-simulate string dynamics in $2+1$D LGTs on state-of-the-art quantum hardware. Through tensor network simulations and analytic derivations, we show that the plaquette term, which represents a magnetic field and only emerges in $d&gt;1$ spatial dimensions, plays a crucial role in \textit{genuine} $2+1$D string dynamics deep in the confined regime. In its absence and for minimal-length (Manhattan-distance) strings, we demonstrate how string breaking, although on a lattice in $d=2$ spatial dimensions, can be effectively mapped to a $1+1$D dynamical process independently of lattice geometry. Our findings not only answer the question of what qualifies as genuine $2+1$D string dynamics, but also serve as a clear guide for future quantum simulation experiments of $2+1$D LGTs.</description>

      <title>Fast radio bursts by stellar wind microlensing of a faint background source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By assuming the inverse square law of solar wind plasma density as representative of other stars, it is shown that just outside a star the {\it outward} deflection of a passing radio signal at $\nu\approx 1$~GHz (which is capable of penetrating the plasma) is about 5 times larger than the gravitational inward deflection by the star, and the ensuing lens equation which takes both effects into account is a cubic polynomial with three roots and a new strong lensing caustic. The geometric optics approach is valid for a radio source size $\lesssim 1$~pc. Microlensing magnification of a steady background source occurs typically over a timescale of milliseconds, resulting in $\approx 80$ Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) per day over the whole sky, which can only perturb the isotropy of FRB distribution at the several \% level. Moreover, repeating FRBs could be triggered by the periodic interception of the line-of-sight of the background source by members of a binary system. The temporal signatures of such FRBs are consistent with the power spectrum of solar wind density fluctuations on corresponding scales, except the mean density of the wind is a few times higher than the solar value.</description>

Abstract: The formation of topological defects during continuous second-order phase transitions is well described by the Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM). However, when the spontaneously broken symmetry is only approximate, such transitions become smooth crossovers, and the applicability of KZM in these scenarios remains an open question. In this work, we address this problem by analyzing both a weakly coupled Ginzburg-Landau model and a strongly coupled holographic setup, each featuring pseudo-spontaneous breaking of a global U(1) symmetry. In the slow quench regime, we observe a breakdown of the universal power-law scaling predicted by the Kibble-Zurek Mechanism. Specifically, the defect density acquires an exponential correction dependent on the quench rate, following a universal form dictated by the source of explicit symmetry breaking. Although these dynamics extend beyond the scope of the traditional KZM, we demonstrate that a generalized framework, that incorporates the effects of explicit symmetry breaking into the dynamical correlation length, remains valid and accurately captures the non-equilibrium defect formation across the entire range of quench rates.</description>

      <title>A lattice study of two dimensional SU(2) gauge theories with a single massless Majorana fermion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Massless overlap fermions in the real representation of two dimensional $SU(N_c)$ gauge theories exhibit a mod($2$) index due to the rigidity of its spectrum when viewed as a function of the background gauge field - lattice gauge fields on a periodic torus come under two classes; ones that have one set of chirally paired zero modes and ones that do not. Focusing on $SU(2)$ and a single Majorana fermion in an integer representation, $J$; we present numerical evidence that shows only one of these classes survives the continuum limit and this depends on the boundary conditions of the fermion and the gauge field. As such, two of the four possible partition functions are zero in the continuum limit. By defining modified partition functions which do not include the zero modes of the overlap fermions in the fermion determinant, we are able to define an expectation value for a fermion bilinear as ratios of two mixed partition functions. This observable is referred to as the topological condensate and has a non-zero expectation value on any finite physical torus and also has a non-zero limit as the size of the torus is taken to infinity. We study the spectral density of fermions and the scaling of the lowest eigenvalue with the size of the torus to show the absence of any spontaneous symmetry breaking but the emergence of zero modes in the infinite volume limit where it is prohibited in finite volume. These results remain the same for $J = 1, 2, 3, 4$. These results motivate us to propose an independent plaquette model which reproduces the correct physics in the infinite volume limit using a single partition function.</description>

Abstract: In our paper we pay attention to the problem of uniqueness (classification) of higher-dimensional electro-magnetic static, asymptotically flat, non-extremal solutions of multi-dimensional Einstein (n-2)-form gauge field gravity theory, which possess a photon sphere. The photon sphere is uniquely described by its asymptotic data. Conformal positive energy theorem is the key tool in the proof.</description>

      <title>Planckian bound on IR/UV mixing from cold-atom interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: IR/UV mixing (a mechanism causing ultraviolet quantum-gravity effects to manifest themselves also in a far-infrared regime) is a rare case of feature found in several approaches to the quantum-gravity problem. We here derive the implications for "soft" IR/UV mixing (corrections to the dispersion relation that are linear in momentum) of some recent cold-atom-interferometry measurements. For both signs of the IR/UV-mixing correction term we establish bounds on the characteristic length scale which reach the Planck-length milestone. Intriguingly, for values of the characteristic scale of about half the Planck length we find that IR/UV mixing provides a solution for a puzzling discrepancy between Cesium-based and Rubidium-based atom-interferometric measurements of the fine structure constant.</description>

      <title>Exact Analytical Traversable Wormhole Solutions in Teleparallel $F(T)$ Gravity with the de Rham-Gabadadze-Tolley Massive Graviton Sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive a novel class of exact, static, spherically symmetric traversable wormhole solutions in teleparallel $F(T)$ gravity augmented by the non-linear de Rham-Gabadadze-Tolley (dRGT) graviton mass term. By using the Morris-Thorne ansatz with a generalized redshift function including constant, logarithmic, and power-law profiles, we rigorously integrate the dRGT-modified conservation laws together with the teleparallel field equations to reconstruct both the shape function $b(r)$ and the possible torsion-based teleparallel $F(T)$ solutions. Our solutions, which accommodate both pressureless dust and dark-energy perfect fluids, are naturally expressed via special function representations. We verify the flaring-out condition $b'(r_0)&lt;1$, demonstrate the absence of event horizons, and show that the null and weak energy conditions are either strictly satisfied or incur only controlled violations at the throat. These results establish teleparallel massive gravity as a self-consistent, mathematically rich framework for asymptotically flat wormhole geometries without necessarily invoking an explicit cosmological constant.</description>

      <title>Gauge Theory Bootstrap: Pion amplitudes and low energy parameters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10772v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Following the Gauge Theory Bootstrap method proposed in our previous work [arXiv:2309.12402], we compute pion scattering phase shifts for all partial waves with angular momentum $\ell\le 3$ up to 2 GeV and calculate the low energy $\chi$PT coefficients $\bar{\ell}_{1,2,4,6}$. The method looks for the most general S-matrix that matches at low energy the tree level amplitudes of the non-linear sigma model and at high energy, QCD sum rules and form factors. This is a theoretical/numerical calculation that uses as only data the pion mass $m_\pi$, pion decay constant $f_\pi$ and the QCD parameters $N_c=3$, $N_f=2$, $m_q$ and $\alpha_s$. All results are in reasonable agreement with experiment. In particular, we find the $\rho(770)$, $f_2(1270)$ and $\rho(1450)$ resonances. The interplay between the UV gauge theory and low energy pion physics is an example of a general situation where we know the microscopic theory as well as the effective theory of long wavelength fluctuations but we want to solve the strongly coupled dynamics at intermediate energies. The bootstrap builds a bridge between the low and high energy by determining the consistent S-matrix that matches both and provides, in this case, a new direction to understand the strongly coupled physics of gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Mapping from Exact RG to Holographic RG in Flat Space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00628v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In earlier papers a method was given for constructing from first principles a holographic bulk dual action in Euclidean AdS space for a Euclidean CFT on the boundary. The starting point was an Exact RG for the boundary theory. The bulk action is obtained from the evolution operator for this ERG followed by a field redefinition. This procedure guarantees that the boundary correlators are all recovered correctly. In this paper we use the same method in an attempt to construct a holographic dual action for the free $O(N)$ model where the bulk is flat Euclidean space with a plane boundary wall. The scalar cubic interaction is found to be local (in $D=3$) but depends on the distance from the boundary - which can be interpreted as a non constant background dilaton field. The spin 2 - scalar - scalar interaction is found to be non local - in contrast to the AdS case. A field redefinition that makes the kinetic term quartic in derivatives can be done to eliminate this non locality. It is shown that the action can be obtained by gauge fixing an action that has the linearized gauge invariance associated with general coordinate invariance. Boundary correlators (two point and three point) are shown to be reproduced by bulk calculations - as expected in this approach to holography.</description>

      <title>Perturbative unitarity bounds from momentum-space entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23709v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Physical theories have a limited regime of validity and hence must be accompanied by a breakdown diagnostic to establish when they cease to be valid as parameters are varied. For perturbative theories, estimates of the first neglected order offer valuable guidance, but one is often interested in sharp bounds beyond which perturbation theory necessarily fails. In particle physics, it is common to employ the bounds on partial waves imposed by unitarity as such a diagnostic. Unfortunately, these bounds don't extend to curved spacetime, where scattering experiments are challenging to define. Here, we propose to use the growth of entanglement in momentum space as a breakdown diagnostic for perturbation theory in general field theories. This diagnostic can be readily used in cosmological spacetimes and does not require any flat spacetime limit. More in detail, we consider the so-called purity of the reduced density operator constructed by tracing out all but one of the Fourier modes in an effective theory and we present a diagrammatic technique to compute it perturbatively. Constraints on the regime of validity of perturbation theory are then derived when the perturbative purity violates its unitarity bounds.
  In flat spacetime, we compare these purity bounds to those from partial waves. We find general qualitative agreement but with remarkable differences: purity bounds can be sometimes weaker, but other times they exist when no partial wave bounds exist. We then derive purity bounds for scalar field theories in de Sitter spacetime for a variety of interactions that appear in inflationary models. Importantly, our bounds make no reference to time evolution and in de Sitter they depend exclusively on scale-invariant ratios of the physical kinematics.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate that a broad class of modular inflation models predicts the emergence of new physics within an energy range of approximately \( 10^{15} \, \mathrm{GeV} \) to \( 10^{17} \, \mathrm{GeV} \). This prediction arises by comparing the moduli-dependent species scale with observational constraints on inflation. Specifically, we illustrate this within the context of \( SL(2, \mathbb{Z}) \)-modular inflation models by re-expressing inflationary observables in terms of the species scale. We further discuss the implications of this approach for generic Calabi-Yau threefolds.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamics without Boost-Invariance from Kinetic Theory: From Perfect Fluids to Active Flocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00025v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the hydrodynamic equations of perfect fluids without boost invariance [1] from kinetic theory. Our approach is to follow the standard derivation of the Vlasov hierarchy based on an a-priori unknown collision functional satisfying certain axiomatic properties consistent with the absence of boost invariance. The kinetic theory treatment allows us to identify various transport coefficients in the hydrodynamic regime. We identify a drift term that effects a relaxation to an equilibrium where detailed balance with the environment with respect to momentum transfer is obtained. We then show how the derivative expansion of the hydrodynamics of flocks can be recovered from boost non-invariant kinetic theory and hydrodynamics. We identify how various coefficients of the former relate to a parameterization of the so-called equation of kinetic state that yields relations between different coefficients, arriving at a symmetry-based understanding as to why certain coefficients in hydrodynamic descriptions of active flocks are naturally of order one, and others, naturally small. When inter-particle forces are expressed in terms of a kinetic theory influence kernel, a coarse-graining scale and resulting derivative expansion emerge in the hydrodynamic limit, allowing us to derive diffusion terms as infrared-relevant operators distilling different parameterizations of microscopic interactions. We conclude by highlighting possible applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01680v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze how the axion parameter, the Einstein-Maxwell-Scalar (EMS) coupling constant, and the charge density affect the chaotic properties of a charged hairy black hole, as characterized by the quantum Lyapunov exponent. We inject charged shock waves from the asymptotic boundary and compute the out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs). Due to the relevant deformation in the boundary theory induced by a bulk scalar field, the bulk solution flows to a more general Kasner spacetime near the black hole singularity. We examine the behavior of chaotic parameters, including the Lyapunov exponent, butterfly velocity, and scrambling time delay, under this deformation. We find that as the deformation parameter increases, the ratio of the quantum Lyapunov exponent to the surface gravity decreases. For sufficiently large deformation, the Lyapunov exponent in the deformed geometry can exceed that of the axion Reissner-Nordstrom case. We observe that boundary deformation generally reduces the scrambling time delay, with the EMS coupling having a significant effect on the delay. These results provide further insight into the role of boundary deformations in modifying chaotic properties in charged hairy black holes.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we calculate the holographic central charge ($c_{sDG}$) associated with sine dilaton gravity (sDG) in the semiclassical limit. In the low energy limit, the sDG flows into the ordinary JT gravity which is a conjectured dual of ordinary Schwarzian quantum mechanics at strong coupling. We compute the associated central charge ($c_{JT}$), which reveals $c_{sDG}&gt;c_{JT}$. We identify this as an artifact of the UV completion of JT gravity in terms of sine dilaton gravity.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Packaging II: A Group-Theoretic Framework for Packaging Under Finite, Compact, Higher-Form, and Hybrid Symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20295v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Symmetry packaging is the phenomenon whereby, upon particle creation, all the internal quantum numbers (IQNs) become locked into a single irreducible representation (irrep) block of the gauge group, as required by locality and gauge invariance. The resulting packaged quantum states exhibit characteristic symmetry constraints and entanglement patterns. We develop a group-theoretic framework to describe the symmetry packaging for a variety of concrete symmetries and to classify the corresponding packaged states: \textbf{(1)} We prove that for any finite or compact group $G$, there exist $G$-associated packaged subspaces, in which every vector is automatically a packaged state. In particular, in multi-particle systems, any nontrivial representation of $G$ induces inseparable packaged entanglement that locks together all IQNs. \textbf{(2)} We apply this framework to symmetry packaging in finite groups (cyclic group $\mathbb{Z}_N$, charge conjugation $C$, fermion parity, parity $P$, time reversal $T$, and dihedral groups), compact groups ($\mathrm{U}(1)$, $\mathrm{SU}(N)$, $\mathrm{SU}(2)$, and $\mathrm{SU}(3)$), $p$-form symmetries, and hybrid symmetries. In each case, gauge invariance and superselection rules forbid the factorization of the resulting states. We illustrate how Bell-type packaged entangled states, color confinement, and hybrid gauge-invariant configurations all arise naturally. These results yield a complete classification of packaged quantum states. \textbf{(3)} Finally, we extend the packaging principle to incorporate full spacetime symmetry and hybrid systems of local, global, and Lorentz/Poincar\'e charges. Our approach unifies tools from group theory, gauge theory, and topological classification. These results may be useful for potential applications in high energy physics, quantum field theory, and quantum technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00119v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In field theory, domain walls are constructed by embedding localized field configurations varying in one space dimension, such as the $\phi^4$ kink, in two or three space dimensions. At the classical level, the kink mass straightforwardly turns into the energy per unit length or area, known as the domain wall tension. The quantum contribution to the tension is more difficult to compute, because the quantum fluctuations about the domain wall in the additional coordinates must be included. We show that spectral methods, making use of scattering data for the interaction of quantum fluctuations with the domain wall background, are an efficient way to compute the leading quantum correction to the domain wall tension. In particular we demonstrate that within this approach it is straightforward to pass from one renormalization scheme to another.</description>

Abstract: 6d (2,0) SCFTs of type $\mathfrak{g}$ have protected subsectors that were conjectured in arxiv:1404.1079 to be captured by $\mathcal{W}_\mathfrak{g}$ algebras. We write down the crossing equations for mixed four-point functions $\langle S_{k_1} S_{k_2}S_{k_3}S_{k_4}\rangle$ of 1/2-BPS operators $S_{k_i}$ in 6d (2,0) theories and detail how a certain twist reduces this system to a 2d meromorphic CFT multi-correlator bootstrap problem. We identify the relevant 6d (2,0) $\mathcal{W}$-algebras of type $\mathfrak{g} = \{A_{N-1},D_N\}$ as truncations of $\mathcal{W}_{1+\infty}$ and solve OPE associativity conditions for their structure constants, both using $\texttt{OPEdefs}$ and the holomorphic bootstrap of arxiv:1503.07111. With this, we solve the multi-correlator bootstrap for twisted 6d four-point correlators $\mathcal{F}_{k_1k_2k_3k_4}$ involving all $S_{k_i}$ up to $\{k_i\}=4$ and extract closed-form expressions for 6d OPE coefficients. We describe the implications of our CFT data on conformal Regge trajectories of the (2,0) theories and finally, demonstrate the consistency of our results with protected higher-derivative corrections to graviton scattering in M-theory on $AdS_7\times S^4/\mathbb{Z}_\mathfrak{o}$.</description>

      <title>Superconformal Weight Shifting Operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08682v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a framework for constructing superconformal blocks for correlators of general supermultiplets in theories with $\mathrm{SU}(m,m|2n)$ symmetry, such as four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=2$ and $\mathcal{N} = 4$ conformal theories. We use analytic superspace, viewed as the super-Grassmannian $\mathrm{Gr}(m|n,2m|2n)$, which includes 4D Minkowski space ($m=2,n=0$). In this formalism, superblocks for non-half-BPS correlators are analogous to non-supersymmetric conformal blocks for correlators of fields with spin. We construct $\mathrm{SU}(m,m|2n)$-covariant differential operators which generalise the existing conformal weight-shifting operators, and thus allow us to derive all superconformal blocks from the known half-BPS blocks. Our results provide a framework from which to advance the conformal bootstrap in 4D supersymmetric settings, with potential extensions to lower and higher-dimensional SCFTs. The Grassmannian formalism is also seen to offer a natural and often simpler alternative to the embedding space formalism of non-supersymmetric CFTs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09568v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the noncompact open $SL(2, \mathbb{C})$ spin chain the eigenfunctions of the special matrix element of monodromy matrix are constructed. The key ingredients of the whole construction are local Yang-Baxter $\mathcal{R}$-operators, $Q$-operator and raising operators obtained by reduction from the $Q$-operator. The calculation of various scalar products and the proof of orthogonality are based on the properties of $Q$-operator and demonstrate its hidden role. The symmetry of eigenfunctions with respect to reflection of the spin variable $s \to 1-s$ is established. The Mellin-Barnes representation for eigenfunctions is derived and equivalence with initial coordinate representation is proved. The transformation from one representation to another is grounded on the application of $A$-type Gustafson integral generalized to the complex field.</description>

      <title>The Baby Universe is Fine and the CFT Knows It: On Holography for Closed Universes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10649v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Big bang/big crunch closed universes can be realized in AdS/CFT, even though they lack asymptotically AdS boundaries. With enough bulk entanglement, the bulk Hilbert space of a closed universe can be holographically encoded in the CFT. We clarify the relation of this encoding to observer-clone proposals and refute recent arguments about the breakdown of semiclassical physics in such spaces. In the limit of no bulk entanglement, the holographic encoding breaks down. The oft-cited one-dimensional nature of the closed universe Hilbert space represents the limitation of the external (CFT) Hilbert space to access the quantum information in the closed universe, similar to the limitations imposed on observers outside a perfectly isolated quantum lab. We advocate that the CFT nevertheless continues to determine the physical properties of the closed universe in this regime, showing how to interpret this relationship in terms of a final state projection in the closed universe. We provide a dictionary between the final state wavefunction and CFT data. We propose a model of the emergence of an arrow of time in the universe with a given initial or final state projection. Finally, we show that the conventional EFT in the closed universe, without any projection, can be recovered as a maximally ignorant description of the final state. This conventional EFT is encoded in CFT data, and it can be probed by computing coarse-grained observables. We provide an example of one such observable. Taken together, these results amount to a clean bill of health for baby universes born of AdS/CFT.</description>

      <title>You've got a Freund--Rubin in Me: The Aretakis Instability of Extremal Black Branes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12529v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate how the Aretakis instability affects non-dilatonic extremal black $p$-branes by focusing on their near-horizon geometry. Crucially, the strength of the instability, \textit{i.e.} the number of transverse derivatives needed to see non-decay/blow-up of fields on the horizon at late null time, is given by the scaling dimensions with respect to the near-horizon $\mathrm{AdS}_{p+2}$-factor. This renders the problem of determining the severity of the Aretakis instability equivalent to computing the Kaluza--Klein spectrum of fields on Freund--Rubin spaces. We use this to argue that non-dilatonic extremal black branes suffer from the Aretakis instability even in the absence of additional fields -- we find that this is weaker than for extremal black holes. We also argue that the scaling dimensions determine the smoothness of stationary deformations to the original black brane background -- here, our findings indicate that generically more modes can lead to worse curvature singularities compared to extremal black holes.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Entropy of Quantum Corners</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16800v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In gravitational theories with boundaries, diffeomorphisms can become physical and acquire a non-vanishing Noether charge. Using the covariant phase space formalism, on shell of the gravitational constraints, the latter localizes on codimension-$2$ surfaces, the corners. The corner proposal asserts that these charges, and their algebras, must be important ingredients of any quantum gravity theory. In this manuscript, we continue the study of quantum corner symmetries and algebras by computing the entanglement entropy and quantum informational properties of quantum states abiding to the quantum representations of corners in the framework of $2$-dimensional gravity. We do so for two classes of states: the vacuum and coherent states, properly defined. We then apply our results to JT gravity, seen as the dimensional reduction of $4$d near extremal black holes. There, we demonstrate that the entanglement entropy of some coherent quantum gravity states -- states admitting a semiclassical description -- scales like the dilaton, reproducing the semiclassical area law behavior and further solidifying the quantum informational nature of entropy of quantum corners. We then study general states and their gluing procedure, finding a formula for the entanglement entropy based entirely on the representation theory of $2$d quantum corners.</description>

      <title>Bipartite Fluctuations of Critical Fermi Surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04331v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fluctuations of conserved quantities within a subsystem are non-local observables that provide unique insights into quantum many-body systems. In this paper, we study bipartite charge (and spin) fluctuations across interaction-driven ``metal-insulator transitions'' out of Landau Fermi liquids. The ``charge insulators'' include a class of non-Fermi-liquid states of fractionalized degrees of freedom, such as compressible composite Fermi liquids (for spinless electrons) and incompressible spin-liquid Mott insulators (for spin-$1/2$ electrons). We find that charge fluctuations $F$ exhibit distinct leading-order scalings across the transition: $F \sim L\log(L)$ in Landau Fermi liquids and $F \sim L$ in charge insulators, where $L$ is the linear size of the subsystem. In composite Fermi liquids, under certain conditions, we also identify a universal constant term $-f(\theta)|\sigma_{xy}|/(2\pi)$ when the subsystem geometry contains a sharp corner, where $f(\theta)$ denotes a function of the corner angle, and $\sigma_{xy}$ is the Hall conductivity. At the critical point, provided the transition is continuous, the leading scaling $F\sim L$ is accompanied by a subleading universal corner contribution $-\log(L)f(\theta)C_{\rho}/2$ with the same angle dependence $f(\theta)$, and the universal coefficient $C_{\rho}$ is directly related to the predicted universal jumps in longitudinal and Hall resistivities. These results establish fluctuation-transport relations, paving the way for numerical and experimental studies of unconventional quantum criticalities in metals.</description>

      <title>Explicit decoders using fixed-point amplitude amplification based on QSVT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06051v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reliably transmitting quantum information via a noisy quantum channel is a central challenge in quantum information science. While constructing a decoder is crucial to this goal, little was known about quantum circuit implementations of decoders that reach high communication rates. In this paper, we provide two decoders with explicit quantum circuits capable of recovering quantum information when the decoupling condition is satisfied, i.e., when quantum information is in principle recoverable. These are applicable to both entanglement-assisted and non-assisted settings. By developing a technique that relies on a symmetric structure of the decoders, we show that they are applicable to any noise model. As a consequence, for any noisy channel, our decoders can be used to achieve a communication rate arbitrarily close to the quantum capacity by increasing the number of channel uses. To construct the decoders, we employ the fixed-point amplitude amplification (FPAA) based on the quantum singular value transformation (QSVT), extending a previous approach applicable only to erasure noise. Our constructions offer advantages in the computational cost, largely reducing the circuit complexity compared to previous explicit decoders. Through an investigation of the decoding problem, unique advantages of the QSVT-based FPAA are highlighted.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10601v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a recently discovered mathematical correspondence between the spectra of a naively discretized lattice fermion and that of a periodically driven (i.e., Floquet) quantum system and turn it into an infrared equivalence between the two systems. The equivalence can be framed as a duality relation, allowing us to simulate a two-flavor discrete-time fermion theory on the lattice side, where the two flavors arise from time discretization, using a single-flavor fermion theory on the Floquet side. Our demonstration establishes an equivalence between (i) the fermion content, (ii) the correlation functions, and consequently (iii) observables of the two theories in the infrared. We also show how interactions may be incorporated into this equivalence.</description>

Abstract: We develop a novel and systematic approach to computing the $(2n-1)$-form Chern-Simons potential given the Pontryagin density, i.e. the $n^{\text{th}}$ Chern character, in arbitrary even dimensions $D=2 n \geq 2$. Throughout we work with a generic affine connection, that results in a non-vanishing torsion in general, and allows for non-metricity, which accommodates the existence of non-trivial Chern characters and hence Pontryagin densities. We outline an algorithm, with its implementation as a code, which lets one to determine the Chern-Simons potential given the Pontryagin density in an arbitrary even dimension.</description>

      <title>Precision calculation of the EFT likelihood with primordial non-Gaussianities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10915v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform a precision calculation of the effective field theory (EFT) conditional likelihood for large-scale structure (LSS) using the saddle-point expansion method in the presence of primordial non-Gaussianities (PNG). The precision is manifested at two levels: one corresponding to the consideration of higher-order noise terms, and the other to the inclusion of contributions around the saddle points. In computing the latter, we encounter the same issue of the negative modes as in the context of false vacuum decay, which necessitates deforming the original integration contour into a combination of the steepest descent contours to ensure a convergent and real result. We demonstrate through detailed calculations that, upon incorporating leading-order PNG, both types of extensions introduce irreducible field-dependent contributions to the conditional likelihood. This insight motivates the systematic inclusion of additional effective terms within the forward modeling framework. Our work facilitates Bayesian forward modeling under non-Gaussian initial conditions, thereby enabling more stringent constraints on the parameters describing PNG.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20395v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that solutions to the strong CP problem based on modular invariance can be extended to incorporate features that appear in string compactifications: quarks with mostly positive modular weights and non-trivial gauge kinetic functions. This requires assuming that singularities and zeroes only appear at special points, such as decompactification limits. We discuss the impact of these assumptions on string gauge unification.</description>

      <title>Structure Scalars for Charged Dissipative Spherical Collapse in $f(R, T)$ Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23605v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the structure scalars constructed from the orthogonal splitting of the Riemann tensor for the spacetime metric describing the interior of a charged matter configuration undergoing dissipative collapse in the framework of $f(R,T)$ gravity (where $R$ and $T$ are the Ricci scalar and the trace of energy-momentum tensor, respectively), and also the way these quantities influence the various physical parameters of the collapsing matter. In absence of dissipation, the energy density inhomogeneity is found to be influenced by the structure scalar $X_{TF}$ and the mass-function of the collapsing matter. Further, the presence of charge affects the structure scalars and the total mass-energy content. The dependence of the various physical parameters like heat dissipation, energy density inhomogeneity, evolution of the expansion scalar, the shear scalar, effective homogeneous energy density, and pressure anisotropy on the structure scalars, have been clearly indicated along with a discussion on the complexity factor of the collapsing configuration. The $f(R,T)$ junction conditions have been presented, showing the matching conditions for the matter Lagrangian and their derivatives at the boundary. The energy conditions are also presented and the possibility of violation of the Strong Energy Condition has been discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19450v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In order to derive model-independent observational bounds on dark energy/modified gravity theories, a typical approach is to constrain parametrised models intended to capture the space of dark energy theories. Here we investigate in detail the effect that the nature of these parametrisations can have, finding significant effects on the resulting cosmological dark energy constraints. In order to observationally distinguish well-motivated and physical parametrisations from unphysical ones, it is crucial to understand the theoretical priors that physical parametrisations place on the phenomenology of dark energy. To this end we discuss a range of theoretical priors that can be imposed on general dark energy parametrisations, and their effect on the constraints on the phenomenology of dynamical dark energy. More specifically, we investigate both the phenomenological $\{\mu,\Sigma\}$ parametrisation as well as effective field theory (EFT) inspired approaches to model dark energy interactions. We compare the constraints obtained in both approaches for different phenomenological and theory-informed time-dependences for the underlying functional degrees of freedom, discuss the effects of priors derived from gravitational wave physics, and investigate the interplay between constraints on parameters constraining only the background evolution vs. parameters controlling linear perturbations.</description>

      <title>One-Loop Galaxy Bispectrum: Consistent Theory, Efficient Analysis with COBRA, and Implications for Cosmological Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22110v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an efficient and accurate pipeline for the analysis of the redshift-space galaxy bispectrum multipoles at one-loop order in effective field theory (EFT). We provide a systematic theory derivation based on power counting, which features the first comprehensive treatment of stochastic EFT contributions -- these are found to significantly improve the match to data. Our computational pipeline utilizes the COBRA technique that expands the linear matter power spectrum over a basis of principal components based on a singular value decomposition, allowing the cosmology dependence to be captured to sub-permille accuracy with just eight templates. This transforms the problem of computing the one-loop EFT bispectrum to a simple tensor multiplication, reducing the computation time to around a second per cosmology with negligible loss of accuracy. Using these tools, we study the cosmological information in the bispectrum by analyzing PTChallenge simulations, whose gigantic volume provides the most powerful test of the one-loop EFT bispectrum so far. We find that the one-loop prediction provides an excellent match to the bispectrum data up to $k_{\rm max}=0.15~h$ Mpc$^{-1}$, as evidenced by the precise recovery of the dark matter density $\omega_\text{cdm}$, Hubble constant $H_0$, and mass fluctuation amplitude $\sigma_8$ parameters, and the amplitude of equilateral primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG) $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm equil}$. Combined with the power spectrum, the COBRA-based one-loop bispectrum multipoles yield tighter constraints than the tree-level bispectrum monopole, with the posteriors on $\omega_{\text{cdm}}$, $H_0$, and $\sigma_8$ shrinking by 41\%, 25\%, and 19\%, respectively. This suggests that the COBRA-based bispectrum analysis will be an important tool in the interpretation of data from ongoing redshift surveys such as DESI and Euclid.</description>
