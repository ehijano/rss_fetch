      <title>A note about solvable and non-solvable finite groups of the same order type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two finite groups are said to have the same order type if for each positive integer $n$ both groups have the same number of elements of order $n$. In 1987 John G. Thompson asked if in this case the solvability of one group implies the solvability of the other group.
  In 2024 Pawel Piwek gave a negative example. He constructed two groups of order $2^{365}\cdot3^{105}\cdot7^{104}\approx7.3\cdot10^{247}$ of the same order type, where only one is solvable.
  In this note we produce a much smaller example of order $2^{13}\cdot3^4\cdot7^3=227598336$.</description>

      <title>Initiating the proof of the Liebeck--Nikolov--Shalev conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Liebeck, Nikolov, and Shalev conjectured that for every subset A of a finite simple group S with |A|&gt;1, there exist O( log|S| / log|A| ) conjugates of A whose product is S. This paper is a companion to [Lifshitz: Completing the proof of the Liebeck-Nikolov-Shalev conjecture] and together they prove the conjecture. In this paper we prove the conjecture in the regime where $|A|&gt;|S|^c$ for an absolute constant c&gt;0.
  We also prove that the following Skew Product Theorem holds for all finite simple groups. Namely we show that either the product of two conjugates of A has size at least $|A|^{1.49}$, or S is the product of boundedly many conjugates of A.</description>

      <title>Fuchs' problem for endomorphisms of nonabelian groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1960, L\'{a}szl\'{o} Fuchs posed the problem of determining which groups $G$ are realizable as the group of units in some ring $R$. In \cite{chebolu2022fuchs}, we investigated the following variant of Fuchs' problem, for abelian groups: which groups $G$ are realized by a ring $R$ where every group endomorphism of $G$ is induced by a ring endomorphism of $R$? Such groups are called fully realizable. In this paper, we answer the aforementioned question for several families of nonabelian groups: symmetric, dihedral, quaternion, alternating, and simple groups; almost cyclic $p$-groups; and groups whose Sylow $2$-subgroup is either cyclic or normal and abelian. We construct three infinite families of fully realizable nonabelian groups using iterated semidirect products.</description>

      <title>Coarse structures on locally compact abelian groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the study of the large-scale geometry of topological groups, we investigate particular families of subsets of topological groups named group ideals. We compare different group ideals in the realm of locally compact groups. In particular, we show that a subset of a locally compact abelian group is relatively compact if and only if it is coarsely bounded. Using this result, we prove that an infinite-dimensional Banach space cannot be embedded into any product of locally compact groups.</description>

      <title>Scissors automorphism groups and their homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In any category with a reasonable notion of cover, each object has a group of scissors automorphisms. We prove that under mild conditions, the homology of this group is independent of the object, and can be expressed in terms of the scissors congruence K-theory spectrum defined by Zakharevich. We therefore obtain both a group-theoretic interpretation of Zakharevich's higher scissors congruence K-theory, as well as a method to compute the homology of scissors automorphism groups. We apply this to various families of groups, such as interval exchange groups and Brin--Thompson groups, recovering results of Szymik--Wahl, Li, and Tanner, and obtaining new results as well.</description>

      <title>A group from a map and orbit equivalence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.00637v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In two papers published in 1979, R. Bowen and C. Series defined a dynamical system from a Fuchsian group, acting on the hyperbolic plane $\mathbb{H}^2$. The dynamics is given by a map on $S^1$ which is, in particular, an expanding piecewise homeomorphism of the circle. In this paper we consider a reverse question: which dynamical conditions for an expanding piecewise homeomorphism of $S^1$ are sufficient for the map to be a ``Bowen-Series-type" map (see below) for some group $G$ and which groups can occur? We give a partial answer to these questions.</description>

      <title>Whitehead's problem and condensed mathematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09122v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the better-known independence results in general mathematics is Shelah's solution to Whitehead's problem of whether $\mathrm{Ext}^1(A,\mathbb{Z})=0$ implies that an abelian group $A$ is free. The point of departure for the present work is Clausen and Scholze's proof that, in contrast, one natural interpretation of Whitehead's problem within their recently-developed framework of condensed mathematics has an affirmative answer in $\mathsf{ZFC}$. We record two alternative proofs of this result, as well as several original variations on it, both for their intrinsic interest and as a springboard for a broader study of the relations between condensed mathematics and set theoretic forcing. We show more particularly how the condensation $\underline{X}$ of any locally compact Hausdorff space $X$ may be viewed as an organized presentation of the forcing names for the points of canonical interpretations of $X$ in all possible set-forcing extensions of the universe, and we argue our main result by way of this fact. We show also that when interpreted within the category of light condensed abelian groups, Whitehead's problem is again independent of the $\mathsf{ZFC}$ axioms. In fact we show that it is consistent that Whitehead's problem has a negative solution within the category of $\kappa$-condensed abelian groups for every uncountable cardinal $\kappa$, but that this scenario, in turn, is inconsistent with the existence of a strongly compact cardinal.</description>
