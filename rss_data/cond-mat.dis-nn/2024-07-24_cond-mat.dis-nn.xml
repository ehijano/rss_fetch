      <title>Stochastic weight matrix dynamics during learning and Dyson Brownian motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the update of weight matrices in learning algorithms can be described in the framework of Dyson Brownian motion, thereby inheriting many features of random matrix theory. We relate the level of stochasticity to the ratio of the learning rate and the mini-batch size, providing more robust evidence to a previously conjectured scaling relationship. We discuss universal and non-universal features in the resulting Coulomb gas distribution and identify the Wigner surmise and Wigner semicircle explicitly in a teacher-student model and in the (near-)solvable case of the Gaussian restricted Boltzmann machine.</description>

      <title>Coarse geometric approach to topological phases: Invariants from real-space representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that topological phases include disordered materials if the underlying invariant is interpreted as originating from coarse geometry. This coarse geometric framework, grounded in physical principles, offers a natural setting for the bulk-boundary correspondence, reproduces physical knowledge, and leads to an efficient and tractable numerical approach for calculating invariants. As a showcase, we give a detailed discussion of the framework for three-dimensional systems with time-reversal symmetry. We numerically reproduce the known disorder-free phase diagram of a tunable, effective tight-binding model and analyze the evolution of the topological phase under disorder.</description>

      <title>Residue imaginary velocity induces many-body delocalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Localization and delocalization are historic topics central to quantum and condensed matter physics. We discover a new delocalization mechanism attributed to a residue imaginary (part of) velocity $\operatorname{Im}(v)$, feasible for ground states or low-temperature states of non-Hermitian quantum systems under periodic boundary conditions. Interestingly, a disorder field contributing to $\operatorname{Im}(v)$ may allow strong-disorder-limit delocalization when $\operatorname{Im}(v)$ prevails over the Anderson localization. We demonstrate such delocalization with correlation and entanglement behaviors, as well as its many-body nature and generalizability to finite temperatures and interactions. Thus, the nontrivial physics of $\operatorname{Im}(v)$ significantly enriches our understanding of delocalization and breeds useful applications, e.g., in quantum adiabatic processes.</description>

      <title>Unraveling Complexity: Singular Value Decomposition in Complex Experimental Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analyzing complex experimental data with multiple parameters is challenging. We propose using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) as an effective solution. This method, demonstrated through real experimental data analysis, surpasses conventional approaches in understanding complex physics data. Singular values and vectors distinguish and highlight various physical mechanisms and scales, revealing previously challenging elements. SVD emerges as a powerful tool for navigating complex experimental landscapes, showing promise for diverse experimental measurements.</description>

      <title>Interplay between two mechanisms of resistivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mechanisms of resistivity can be divided into two basic classes: one is dissipative (like scattering on phonons) and another is quasi-elastic (like scattering on static impurities). They are often treated by the empirical Matthiessen rule, which says that total resistivity is just the sum of these two contributions, which are computed separately. This is quite misleading for two reasons. First, the two mechanisms are generally correlated. Second, computing the elastic resistivity alone masks the fundamental fact that the linear-response approximation has a vanishing validity interval at vanishing dissipation. Limits of zero electric field and zero dissipation do not commute for the simple reason that one needs to absorb the Joule heat quadratic in the applied field. Here, we present a simple model that illustrates these two points. The model also illuminates the role of variational principles for non-equilibrium steady states.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Out-of-Equilibrium Quantum Dynamics in Disordered Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a linear-scaling numerical method for exploring nonequilibrium electron dynamics in systems of arbitrary complexity. Based on the Chebyshev expansion of the time evolution of the single-particle density matrix, the method gives access to nonperturbative excitation and relaxation phenomena in models of disordered materials with sizes on the experimental scale. After validating the method by applying it to saturable optical absorption in clean graphene, we uncover that disorder can enhance absorption in graphene and that the interplay between light, anisotropy, and disorder in nanoporous graphene might be appealing for sensing applications. Beyond the optical properties of graphene-like materials, the method can be applied to a wide range of large-area materials and systems with arbitrary descriptions of defects and disorder.</description>

      <title>Signatures of paracrystallinity in amorphous silicon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The structure of amorphous silicon (a-Si) has been studied for decades. The two main theories are based on a continuous random network and on a `paracrystalline' model, respectively -- the latter being defined as showing localized structural order resembling the crystalline state whilst retaining an overall amorphous network. However, the extent of this local order has been unclear, and experimental data have led to conflicting interpretations. Here we show that signatures of paracrystallinity in an otherwise disordered network are indeed compatible with the existing body of experimental observations for a-Si. We use quantum-mechanically accurate, machine-learning-driven simulations to systematically sample the configurational space of quenched a-Si, thereby allowing us to elucidate the boundary between amorphization and crystallization. We analyze our dataset using structural and local-energy descriptors to show that paracrystalline models are consistent with experiments in both regards. Our work provides a unified explanation for seemingly conflicting theories in one of the most widely studied amorphous networks.</description>

      <title>Emergent strength-dependent scale-free mobility edge in a non-reciprocal long-range Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper model</title>

Abstract: We investigate the properties of mobility edge in an Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper model with non-reciprocal long-range hopping. The results reveal that there can be a new type of mobility edge featuring both strength-dependent and scale-free properties. By calculating the fractal dimension, we find that the positions of mobility edges are robust to the strength of non-reciprocal long-range hopping. Furthermore, through scale analysis of the observables such as fractal dimension, eigenenergy and eigenstate, etc., we show that four different specific mobility edges can be observed in the system. This paper extends the family tree of mobility edges and hopefully it will shed more light on the related theory and experiment.</description>

      <title>Clustering of negative topological charge precedes plastic failure in 3D glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15359v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The deformation mechanism in amorphous solids subjected to external shear remains poorly understood because of the absence of well-defined topological defects mediating the plastic deformation. The notion of soft spots has emerged as a useful tool to characterize the onset of irreversible rearrangements and plastic flow, but these entities are not clearly defined in terms of geometry and topology. In this study, we unveil the phenomenology of recently discovered, precisely defined topological defects governing the microscopic mechanical and yielding behavior of a model 3D glass under shear deformation. We identify the existence of vortex-like and anti-vortex-like topological defects within the 3D non-affine displacement field. The number density of these defects exhibits a significant anti-correlation with the plastic events, with defect proliferation-annihilation cycles matching the alternation of elastic-like segments and catastrophic plastic drops, respectively. Furthermore, we observe collective annihilation of these point-like defects via plastic events, with large local topological charge fluctuations in the vicinity of regions that feature strong non-affine displacements. We reveal that plastic yielding is driven by several large sized clusters of net negative topological charge, the massive annihilation of which triggers the onset of plastic flow. These findings suggest a geometric and topological characterization of soft spots and pave the way for the mechanistic understanding of topological defects as mediators of plastic deformation in glassy materials.</description>

      <title>Universal Performance Gap of Neural Quantum States Applied to the Hofstadter-Bose-Hubbard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01981v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural Quantum States (NQS) have demonstrated significant potential in approximating ground states of many-body quantum systems, though their performance can be inconsistent across different models. This study investigates the performance of NQS in approximating the ground state of the Hofstadter-Bose-Hubbard (HBH) model, a boson system on a two-dimensional square lattice with a perpendicular magnetic field. Our results indicate that increasing magnetic flux leads to a substantial increase in energy error, up to three orders of magnitude. Importantly, this decline in NQS performance is consistent across different optimization methods, neural network architectures, and physical model parameters, suggesting a significant challenge intrinsic to the model. Despite investigating potential causes such as wave function phase structure, quantum entanglement, fractional quantum Hall effect, and the variational loss landscape, the precise reasons for this degradation remain elusive. The HBH model thus proves to be an effective testing ground for exploring the capabilities and limitations of NQS. Our study highlights the need for advanced theoretical frameworks to better understand the expressive power of NQS which would allow a systematic development of methods that could potentially overcome these challenges.</description>
