      <title>Incentives for self-isolation based on incidence rather than prevalence could help to flatten the curve: a modelling study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, numerous advances have been made in understanding how epidemic dynamics is affected by changes in individual behaviours. We propose an SIS-based compartmental model to tackle the simultaneous and coupled evolution of an outbreak and of the adoption by individuals of the isolation measure. The compliance with self-isolation is described with the help of the imitation dynamics framework. Individuals are incentivised to isolate based on the prevalence and the incidence rate of the outbreak, and are tempted to defy isolation recommendations depending on the duration of isolation and on the cost of putting social interactions on hold. We are able to derive analytical results on the equilibria of the model under the homogeneous mean-field approximation. Simulating the compartmental model on empirical networks, we also do a preliminary check of the impact of a network structure on our analytical predictions. We find that the dynamics collapses to surprisingly simple regimes where either the imitation dynamics no longer plays a role or the equilibrium prevalence depends on only two parameters of the model, namely the cost and the relative time spent in isolation. Whether individuals prioritise disease prevalence or incidence as an indicator of the state of the outbreak appears to play no role on the equilibria of the dynamics. However, it turns out that favouring incidence may help to flatten the curve in the transient phase of the dynamics. We also find a fair agreement between our analytical predictions and simulations run on an empirical multiplex network.</description>

      <title>Detectability threshold in weighted modular networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the necessary condition to detect, by means of spectral modularity optimization, the ground-truth partition in networks generated according to the weighted planted-partition model with two equally sized communities. We analytically derive a general expression for the maximum level of mixing tolerated by the algorithm to retrieve community structure, showing that the value of this detectability threshold depends on the first two moments of the distributions of node degree and edge weight. We focus on the standard case of Poisson-distributed node degrees and compare the detectability thresholds of five edge-weight distributions: Dirac, Poisson, exponential, geometric, and signed Bernoulli. We show that Dirac distributed weights yield the smallest detectability threshold, while exponentially distributed weights increase the threshold by a factor $\sqrt{2}$, with other distributions exhibiting distinct behaviors that depend, either or both, on the average values of the degree and weight distributions. Our results indicate that larger variability in edge weights can make communities less detectable. In cases where edge weights carry no information about community structure, incorporating weights in community detection is detrimental.</description>

      <title>A New Lens on the Sustainability of the AI Revolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the Economic Productivity of Energy (EPE), GDP generated per unit of energy consumed, as a quantitative lens to assess the sustainability of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolution. Historical evidence shows that the first industrial revolution, pre-scientific in the sense that technological adoption preceded scientific understanding, initially disrupted this ratio: EPE collapsed as profits outpaced efficiency, with poorly integrated technologies, and recovered only with the rise of scientific knowledge and societal adaptation. Later industrial revolutions, such as electrification and microelectronics, grounded in established scientific theory, did not exhibit comparable declines. Today's AI revolution, highly profitable yet energy-intensive, remains pre-scientific and may follow a similar trajectory in EPE. We combine this conceptual discussion with cross-country EPE data spanning the last three decades. We find that the advanced economies exhibit a consistent linear growth in EPE: those countries are the ones that contribute most to global GDP production and energy consumption, and are expected to be the most affected by the AI transition. Therefore, we advocate for regular monitoring of EPE: transparent reporting of AI-related energy use and productivity-linked incentives can expose hidden energy costs and prevent efficiency-blind economic expansion. Embedding EPE within sustainability frameworks would help align technological innovation with energy productivity, a critical condition for sustainable growth.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We venture that the long evolution of science may be viewed as unfolding over three blurred epochs. The first epoch spans the slow, haphazard, error-ridden realization of scientific truths along with foundational scientific methods. The second epoch covers the discovery that everything is formed from atoms and other building blocks. And in the age of computation, the third epoch affords the science of complex systems.</description>

      <title>Breaking Down the Scoring: Interrater Reliability and National Bias in Olympic Breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Introduction: The inclusion of Breaking in the 2024 Paris Olympic Games introduced a distinctive competition format in which two athletes compete head-to-head in battle rounds. Unlike other aesthetic sports, where athletes receive independent scores for their performances, Breaking judges assess the relative performance quality between two competitors across five predefined evaluation aspects. This may considerably increase their cognitive load and warrants a thorough examination of judging reliability and potential national bias, the tendency of judges to favor athletes from their own country. Methods: Official scoring data from the 2024 Olympic Breaking events were analyzed. Interrater reliability was assessed using the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient, while national bias was estimated using mixed-effects modelling based on judges' individual scores. Results: The analyses revealed low to moderate interrater reliability in Breaking, notably lower than levels reported in other aesthetic sports. Moreover, substantial national bias was detected, with judges displaying a systematic tendency to favor athletes from their own country. Discussion: Although the observed national bias, despite its notable magnitude, likely had only a limited effect on final competition outcomes, the relatively low interrater reliability highlights potential weaknesses in the current scoring framework that may warrant refinement. Nonetheless, Breaking's unique system of aggregating judges' scores into discrete votes appears to reduce the influence of individual judges on competition outcomes, thereby enhancing the system's robustness against unilateral score manipulation.</description>

      <title>The Inequity of Consumption-Based Tax Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the lack of redistributive effectiveness of consumption-based tax systems with respect to social fairness. Through numerical simulations, we explore the wealth exchanges among economic agents subject to flat consumption taxes, comparing universal redistribution with optimal targeted approaches. The results demonstrate that consumption taxes exhibit inherent regressivity, disproportionately burdening the poorest 40% of households who contribute over half of total tax revenue for most tax rates. The findings challenge the equity of consumption taxes and provide quantitative insights for designing more fair fiscal policies.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Line Break prediction models for detecting defensive breakthrough in football</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In football, attacking teams attempt to break through the opponent's defensive line to create scoring opportunities. This action, known as a Line Break, is a critical indicator of offensive effectiveness and tactical performance, yet previous studies have mainly focused on shots or goal opportunities rather than on how teams break the defensive line. In this study, we develop a machine learning model to predict Line Breaks using event and tracking data from the 2023 J1 League season. The model incorporates 189 features, including player positions, velocities, and spatial configurations, and employs an XGBoost classifier to estimate the probability of Line Breaks. The proposed model achieved high predictive accuracy, with an AUC of 0.982 and a Brier score of 0.015. Furthermore, SHAP analysis revealed that factors such as offensive player speed, gaps in the defensive line, and offensive players' spatial distributions significantly contribute to the occurrence of Line Breaks. Finally, we found a moderate positive correlation between the predicted probability of being Line-Broken and the number of shots and crosses conceded at the team level. These results suggest that Line Breaks are closely linked to the creation of scoring opportunities and provide a quantitative framework for understanding tactical dynamics in football.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of compliance with democratic and technical standards of i-voting in elections to academic senates in Czech higher education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The shift towards increased remote work and digital communication, driven by recent global developments, has led to the widespread adoption of i-voting systems, including in academic institutions. This paper critically evaluates the use of i-voting platforms for elections to academic senates at Czech public universities, focusing on the democratic and technical challenges they present. A total of 18 out of 26 Czech public universities have implemented remote electronic voting for these elections. Yet, the systems often lack the necessary transparency, raising significant concerns regarding their adherence to democratic norms, such as election security, voter privacy, and the integrity of the process. Through interviews with system developers and administrators, along with a survey of potential voters, the study underscores the critical need for transparency. Without it, a comprehensive assessment of the technical standards and the overall legitimacy of the i-voting systems remains unattainable, potentially undermining the credibility of the electoral outcomes.</description>

      <title>Modeling language ideologies for the dynamics of languages in contact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.02845v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In multilingual societies, it is common to encounter different language varieties. Various approaches have been proposed to discuss different mechanisms of language shift. However, current models exploring language shift in languages in contact often overlook the influence of language ideologies. Language ideologies play a crucial role in understanding language usage within a cultural community, encompassing shared beliefs, assumptions, and feelings towards specific language forms. These ideologies shed light on the social perceptions of different language varieties expressed as language attitudes. In this study, we introduce an approach that incorporates language ideologies into a model for contact varieties by considering speaker preferences as a parameter. Our findings highlight the significance of preference in language shift, which can even outweigh the influence of language prestige associated, for example, with a standard variety. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of the degree of interaction between individuals holding opposing preferences on the language shift process. Quite expectedly, our results indicate that when communities with different preferences mix, the coexistence of language varieties becomes less likely. However, variations in the degree of interaction between individuals with contrary preferences notably lead to non-trivial transitions from states of coexistence of varieties to the extinction of a given variety, followed by a return to coexistence, ultimately culminating in the dominance of the previously extinct variety. By studying finite-size effects, we observe that the duration of coexistence states increases exponentially with network size. Ultimately, our work constitutes a quantitative approach to the study of language ideologies in sociolinguistics.</description>

Abstract: The most pragmatic first step in the all-but-inevitable 3rd-millennium V\"olkerwanderung of humanity throughout the Solar System is the establishment of a permanent human presence on the Moon. This research examines: 1. the human, agricultural, and technical water needs of a 100-person, 500 m x 100 m x 6 m self-sustaining lunar colony; 2. choosing a strategic location for the moonbase; 3. a heat drill model by which the needed lunar water ice could be sublimated; and 4. the robust water treatment and recovery infrastructure and water management personnel that would be needed for a self-sustaining moonbase.</description>

      <title>Low Total Fertility in Simple Economic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13816v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low total fertility rates throughout the world have lead to concerns about economic growth, military security, international political power, environment impacts, and quality of life. Overall total fertility rates of today's societies are complex emergent functions of culture, biology, and economic policies that are notoriously difficult to forecast. In order to study the dynamic, stochastic nature of total fertility rates, population and wealth trajectories as functions of infertility and birth cost are generated from a minimal, endogenous, agent-based model of a simple foraging economy. A harvesting model from mathematical ecology is added to reflect death by "natural causes". With these added limits of finite lifespans, decreasing total fertility rates are shown to lead to population levels consistently below the actual carry capacity of the landscape. These below carry-capacity population levels generate higher total and per capita wealth. The stochastic population trajectories generated demonstrate instabilities that significantly increase the likelihood of extinction within reasonable time frames. Society may possibly be encouraged by this increasing wealth (and perhaps reduced environmental degradation) to continue decreasing total fertility rates, further increasing the extinction risk. Conversely, the additional wealth might increase total fertility rates through relatively lower birth costs. Tax-funded subsidies are added to the model to determine if directly reducing birth costs can significantly increase total fertility rates to escape these stochastic instabilities. This research demonstrates that understanding attempts to mitigate the consequences of declining total fertility rates must include modeling of the dynamic and stochastic nature of these population trajectories.</description>

      <title>Coping with the Dunkelflaute: Power system implications of variable renewable energy droughts in Europe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17683v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coping with prolonged periods of low availability of wind and solar power, also referred to as renewable energy droughts or "Dunkelflaute", emerges as a key challenge for realizing decarbonized energy systems based on renewable energy sources. Here we investigate the role of long-duration electricity storage and geographical balancing in dealing with such events, combining a time series analysis of renewable availability with power sector modeling of 35 historical weather years. We find that extreme droughts define long-duration storage operation and investment. Assuming policy-relevant interconnection in our model, we find 351 TWh long-duration storage capacity or 7% of yearly electricity demand in the least-cost system that can cope with the most extreme event in Europe. While nuclear power can partially reduce storage needs, the storage-mitigating effect of fossil backup plants in combination with carbon removal is limited. Policymakers and system planners should prepare for a rapid expansion of long-duration storage to safeguard the renewable energy transition in Europe.</description>

Abstract: Urban sprawl reshapes cities, yet its quantitative laws remain elusive. Analyzing built-up expansion in 19 cities (1985-2015) with tools from surface growth physics in radial geometry, we reveal anisotropic, branch-like growth and a piecewise linear scaling between area and population. We uncover a robust local roughness exponent $\alpha_{\text{loc}}\approx 0.54$, coexisting with variable $\beta$ and $z$. This unusual coexistence of universal and variable exponents offers a rare empirical testbed for nonequilibrium growth and an empirical basis for modeling urban sprawl.</description>

      <title>Large cities lose their growth advantage as urban systems mature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12417v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The share of the world population living in cities with more than one million people rose from 11\% in 1975 to 24\% in 2025 (our estimates). Will this trend towards greater concentration in large cities continue or level off? We introduce two new city population datasets that use consistent city definitions across countries and over time. The first covers the world between 1975 and 2025, using satellite imagery. The second covers the U.S. between 1850 and 2020, using census microdata. We find that urban growth follows a characteristic life cycle. Early in urbanization, large cities grow faster than smaller ones. As urban systems mature, growth rates equalize across sizes. We use this life cycle to project future population concentration in large cities. Our projections suggest that 38\% of the world population will be living in cities with more than one million people by 2100. This estimate is higher than the 33\% implied by the well-known theory of proportional growth but lower than the 42\% obtained by extrapolating current trends.</description>

Abstract: Human mobility forms the backbone of contact patterns through which infectious diseases propagate, fundamentally shaping the spatio-temporal dynamics of epidemics and pandemics. While traditional models are often based on the assumption that all individuals have the same probability of infecting every other individual in the population, a so-called random homogeneous mixing, they struggle to capture the complex and heterogeneous nature of real-world human interactions. Recent advancements in data-driven methodologies and computational capabilities have unlocked the potential of integrating high-resolution human mobility data into epidemic modeling, significantly improving the accuracy, timeliness, and applicability of epidemic risk assessment, contact tracing, and intervention strategies. This review provides a comprehensive synthesis of the current landscape in human mobility-informed epidemic modeling. We explore diverse sources and representations of human mobility data, and then examine the behavioral and structural roles of mobility and contact in shaping disease transmission dynamics. Furthermore, the review spans a wide range of epidemic modeling approaches, ranging from classical compartmental models to network-based, agent-based, and machine learning models. And we also discuss how mobility integration enhances risk management and response strategies during epidemics. By synthesizing these insights, the review can serve as a foundational resource for researchers and practitioners, bridging the gap between epidemiological theory and the dynamic complexities of human interaction while charting clear directions for future research.</description>
