      <title>A Subquadratic Two-Party Communication Protocol for Minimum Cost Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss the maximum flow problem in the two-party communication model, where two parties, each holding a subset of edges on a common vertex set, aim to compute the maximum flow of the union graph with minimal communication. We show that this can be solved with $\tilde{O}(n^{1.5})$ bits of communication, improving upon the trivial $\tilde{O}(n^2)$ bound.
  To achieve this, we derive two additional, more general results:
  1. We present a randomized algorithm for linear programs with two-sided constraints that requires $\tilde{O}(n^{1.5}k)$ bits of communication when each constraint has at most $k$ non-zeros. This result improves upon the prior work by [Ghadiri, Lee, Padmanabhan, Swartworth, Woodruff, Ye, STOC'24], which achieves a complexity of $\tilde{O}(n^2)$ bits for LPs with one-sided constraints. Upon more precise analysis, their algorithm can reach a bit complexity of $\tilde{O}(n^{1.5} + nk)$ for one-sided constraint LPs. Nevertheless, for sparse matrices, our approach matches this complexity while extending the scope to two-sided constraints.
  2. Leveraging this result, we demonstrate that the minimum cost flow problem, as a special case of solving linear programs with two-sided constraints and as a general case of maximum flow problem, can also be solved with a communication complexity of $\tilde{O}(n^{1.5})$ bits.
  These results are achieved by adapting an interior-point method (IPM)-based algorithm for solving LPs with two-sided constraints in the sequential setting by [van den Brand, Lee, Liu, Saranurak, Sidford, Song, Wang, STOC'21] to the two-party communication model. This adaptation utilizes techniques developed by [Ghadiri, Lee, Padmanabhan, Swartworth, Woodruff, Ye, STOC'24] for distributed convex optimization.</description>

      <title>A Dynamic Programming Approach to Evader Pathfinding in Static Pursuit Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interdiction of escaping adversaries in urban networks is a critical security challenge. State-of-the-art game-theoretic models, such as the Escape Interdiction Game (EIG), provide comprehensive frameworks but assume a highly dynamic interaction and entail significant computational complexity, which can be prohibitive for real-time applications. This paper investigates a crucial sub-problem: an evader's optimal pathfinding calculus when faced with a static or pre-determined defender deployment. We propose the Dynamic Programming for Evader Route Optimization (DPERO) algorithm, which models the environment as a graph with probabilistic risks at various nodes. By transforming the multiplicative survival objective into an additive cost function using logarithms, we frame the task as a shortest path problem solvable with value iteration. This approach allows for the efficient computation of a path that optimally balances safety and distance. Experimental results on simulated grid networks demonstrate that DPERO identifies routes with significantly higher survival probabilities compared to naive shortest-path baselines, validating its efficacy as a practical tool for vulnerability analysis and strategic planning.</description>

      <title>Streaming Max-Cut in General Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Max-Cut is a fundamental combinatorial optimization problem that has been studied in various computational settings. In this work, we initiate the study of its streaming complexity in general metric spaces with access to distance oracles. We give a $(1 + \epsilon)$-approximation algorithm for estimating the Max-Cut value sliding-window streams using only poly-logarithmic space. This is the first sliding-window algorithm for Max-Cut even in Euclidean spaces, and it achieves a similar error-space tradeoff as the state-of-the-art insertion-only algorithms in Euclidean settings [Chen, Jiang, Krauthgamer, STOC'23], but without relying on Euclidean structures. In sharp contrast, we prove a polynomial-space lower bound for any $\mathrm{poly}(n)$-approximation in the dynamic streaming setting. This yields a separation from the Euclidean case, where the polylogarithmic-space $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation extends to dynamic streams.
  On the technical side, our sliding-window algorithm builds on the smooth histogram framework of [Braverman and Ostrovsky, SICOMP'10]. To make this framework applicable, we establish the first smoothness bound for metric Max-Cut. Moreover, we develop a streaming algorithm for metric Max-Cut in insertion-only streams, whose key ingredient is a new metric reservoir sampling technique.</description>

      <title>Online Multiple Resource Allocation Problems with Departures via the Primal-Dual Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we propose primal-dual algorithms for different variants of the online resource allocation problem with departures. In the basic variant, requests (items) arrive over time to a set of resources (knapsacks) and upon arrival, the duration of time a request may occupy a resource, the demand and reward if the request can be granted, become known. %We assume that the duration of stay of a request may depend on the resource. %and that resources may have different capacity sizes. The goal of the algorithm is to decide whether to accept/reject a request upon arrival and to which resource to allocate it such that the reward obtained over time is maximized. Under some mild assumptions, we show that the proposed primal-dual algorithm achieves a competitive ratio of $O\big(\log(\bar\theta^{\max}\cdot\bar d^{\max})\big)$, where $\bar \theta^{\max}$ is the maximum value density fluctuation ratio and $\bar d^{\max}$ is the maximum duration fluctuation ratio. We prove similar results for two other variants, namely, one with an additional load balancing constraint, and the multi-dimensional variant where an admitted request consumes capacity on multiple resources. Our results show that the primal-dual approach offers a simple, unified framework for obtaining competitive ratios comparable to those previously obtained via threshold policies known for these problems. Additionally, we show that this framework allows us to incorporate additional constraints, such as load-balancing constraints, without sacrificing the competitive ratio.</description>

      <title>A Polynomial Space Lower Bound for Diameter Estimation in Dynamic Streams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the space complexity of estimating the diameter of a subset of points in an arbitrary metric space in the dynamic (turnstile) streaming model. The input is given as a stream of updates to a frequency vector $x \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}^n$, where the support of $x$ defines a multiset of points in a fixed metric space $M = ([n], \mathsf{d})$. The goal is to estimate the diameter of this multiset, defined as $\max\{\mathsf{d}(i,j) : x_i, x_j &gt; 0\}$, to a specified approximation factor while using as little space as possible.
  In insertion-only streams, a simple $O(\log n)$-space algorithm achieves a 2-approximation. In sharp contrast to this, we show that in the dynamic streaming model, any algorithm achieving a constant-factor approximation to diameter requires polynomial space. Specifically, we prove that a $c$-approximation to the diameter requires $n^{\Omega(1/c)}$ space. Our lower bound relies on two conceptual contributions: (1) a new connection between dynamic streaming algorithms and linear sketches for {\em scale-invariant} functions, a class that includes diameter estimation, and (2) a connection between linear sketches for diameter and the {\em minrank} of graphs, a notion previously studied in index coding. We complement our lower bound with a nearly matching upper bound, which gives a $c$-approximation to the diameter in general metrics using $n^{O(1/c)}$ space.</description>

      <title>Mechanisms for Quantum Advantage in Global Optimization of Nonconvex Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present new theoretical mechanisms for quantum speedup in the global optimization of nonconvex functions, expanding the scope of quantum advantage beyond traditional tunneling-based explanations. As our main building-block, we demonstrate a rigorous correspondence between the spectral properties of Schr\"{o}dinger operators and the mixing times of classical Langevin diffusion. This correspondence motivates a mechanism for separation on functions with unique global minimum: while quantum algorithms operate on the original potential, classical diffusions correspond to a Schr\"{o}dinger operators with a WKB potential having nearly degenerate global minima. We formalize these ideas by proving that a real-space adiabatic quantum algorithm (RsAA) achieves provably polynomial-time optimization for broad families of nonconvex functions. First, for block-separable functions, we show that RsAA maintains polynomial runtime while known off-the-shelf algorithms require exponential time and structure-aware algorithms exhibit arbitrarily large polynomial runtimes. These results leverage novel non-asymptotic results in semiclassical analysis. Second, we use recent advances in the theory of intrinsic hypercontractivity to demonstrate polynomial runtimes for RsAA on appropriately perturbed strongly convex functions that lack global structure, while off-the-shelf algorithms remain exponentially bottlenecked. In contrast to prior works based on quantum tunneling, these separations do not depend on the geometry of barriers between local minima. Our theoretical claims about classical algorithm runtimes are supported by rigorous analysis and comprehensive numerical benchmarking. These findings establish a rigorous theoretical foundation for quantum advantage in continuous optimization and open new research directions connecting quantum algorithms, stochastic processes, and semiclassical analysis.</description>

      <title>Fair Minimum Labeling: Efficient Temporal Network Activations for Reachability and Equity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Balancing resource efficiency and fairness is critical in networked systems that support modern learning applications. We introduce the Fair Minimum Labeling (FML) problem: the task of designing a minimum-cost temporal edge activation plan that ensures each group of nodes in a network has sufficient access to a designated target set, according to specified coverage requirements. FML captures key trade-offs in systems where edge activations incur resource costs and equitable access is essential, such as distributed data collection, update dissemination in edge-cloud systems, and fair service restoration in critical infrastructure. We show that FML is NP-hard and $\Omega(\log |V|)$-hard to approximate, and we present probabilistic approximation algorithms that match this bound, achieving the best possible guarantee for the activation cost. We demonstrate the practical utility of FML in a fair multi-source data aggregation task for training a shared model. Empirical results show that FML enforces group-level fairness with substantially lower activation cost than baseline heuristics, underscoring its potential for building resource-efficient, equitable temporal reachability in learning-integrated networks.</description>

      <title>Transductive and Learning-Augmented Online Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the predictable nature of real-life in data streams, we study online regression when the learner has access to predictions about future examples. In the extreme case, called transductive online learning, the sequence of examples is revealed to the learner before the game begins. For this setting, we fully characterize the minimax expected regret in terms of the fat-shattering dimension, establishing a separation between transductive online regression and (adversarial) online regression. Then, we generalize this setting by allowing for noisy or \emph{imperfect} predictions about future examples. Using our results for the transductive online setting, we develop an online learner whose minimax expected regret matches the worst-case regret, improves smoothly with prediction quality, and significantly outperforms the worst-case regret when future example predictions are precise, achieving performance similar to the transductive online learner. This enables learnability for previously unlearnable classes under predictable examples, aligning with the broader learning-augmented model paradigm.</description>

      <title>Robust Optimality of Bundling Goods Beyond Finite Variance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When selling many goods with independent valuations, we develop a distributionally robust framework, consisting of a two-player game between seller and nature. The seller has only limited knowledge about the value distribution. The seller selects a revenue-maximizing mechanism, after which nature chooses a revenue-minimizing distribution from all distributions that comply with the limited knowledge. When the seller knows the mean and variance of valuations, bundling is known to be an asymptotically optimal deterministic mechanism, achieving a normalized revenue close to the mean. Moving beyond this variance assumption, we assume knowledge of the mean absolute deviation (MAD), accommodating more dispersion and heavy-tailed valuations with infinite variance. We show for a large range of MAD values that bundling remains optimal, but the seller can only guarantee a revenue strictly smaller than the mean. Another noteworthy finding is indifference to the order of play, as both the max-min and min-max versions of the problem yield identical values. This contrasts with deterministic mechanisms and the separate sale of goods, where the order of play significantly impacts outcomes. We further underscore the universality of the optimal bundling price by demonstrating its efficacy in optimizing not only absolute revenue but also the absolute regret and ratio objective among all bundling prices</description>

      <title>Perspectives on Stochastic Localization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We survey different perspectives on the stochastic localization process of [Eld13], a powerful construction that has had many exciting recent applications in high-dimensional probability and algorithm design. Unlike prior surveys on this topic, our focus is on giving a self-contained presentation of all known alternative constructions of Eldan's stochastic localization, with an emphasis on connections between different constructions. Our hope is that by collecting these perspectives, some of which had primarily arisen within a particular community (e.g., probability theory, theoretical computer science, information theory, or machine learning), we can broaden the accessibility of stochastic localization, and ease its future use.</description>

      <title>Maximum Biclique for Star 1,2,3 -free and Bounded Bimodularwidth Twin-free Bipartite Graphs $\star$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There are three usual definitions of a maximum bipartite clique (biclique) in a bipartite graph\,: either maximizing the number of vertices, or of edges, or finding a maximum balanced biclique. The first problem can be solved in polynomial time, the last ones are NP-complete. Here we show how these three problems may be efficiently solved for two classes of bipartite graphs: Star123-free twin-free graphs, and bounded bimodularwidth twin-free graphs, a class that may be defined using bimodular decomposition. Our computation requires O(n^2) time and requires a decomposition is provided, which takes respectively O(n + m) and O(mn^3) time.</description>

      <title>Approximation schemes for capacity vehicle routing problems: A survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.01826v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Finding the shortest travelling tour of vehicles with capacity k from the depot to the customers is called the Capacity vehicle routing problem (CVRP). CVRP plays an essential position in logistics systems, and it is the most intensively studied problem in combinatorial optimization. In complexity, CVRP with k $\ge$ 3 is an NP-hard problem, and it is APX-hard as well. We already knew that it could not be approximated in metric space. Moreover, it is the first problem resisting Arora's famous approximation framework. So, whether there is, a polynomial-time (1+$\epsilon$)-approximation for the Euclidean CVRP for any $\epsilon&gt;0$ is still an open problem. This paper will summarize the research progress from history to up-to-date developments. The survey will be updated periodically.</description>

      <title>Highly Connected Steiner Subgraph -- Parameterized Algorithms and Applications to Hitting Set Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.02708v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a simple connected undirected graph G = (V, E), a set X \subseteq V(G), and integers k and p, STEINER SUBGRAPH EXTENSION problem asks if there exists a set S \supseteq X with at most k vertices such that G[S] is p-edge-connected. This is a natural generalization of a well-studied problem STEINER TREE (set p=1 and X as the set of all terminals). In this paper, we initiate the study of STEINER SUBGRAPH EXTENSION from the perspective of parameterized complexity and give a fixed-parameter algorithm parameterized by k and p on graphs of bounded degeneracy. In case we remove the assumption of the input graph being bounded degenerate, then the STEINER SUBGRAPH EXTENSION problem becomes W[1]-hard. Besides being an independent advance on the parameterized complexity of network design problems, our result has natural applications. In particular, we use our result to obtain singly exponential-time FPT algorithms for several vertex deletion problem studied in the literature, where the goal is to delete a smallest set of vertices such that (i) the resulting graph belongs to a specific hereditary graph class, and (ii) the deleted set of vertices induces a p-edge-connected subgraph of the input graph.</description>

      <title>Learning Safe Strategies for Value Maximizing Buyers in Uniform Price Auctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03674v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the bidding problem in repeated uniform price multi-unit auctions from the perspective of a value-maximizing buyer. The buyer aims to maximize their cumulative value over $T$ rounds while adhering to per-round return-on-investment (RoI) constraints in a strategic (or adversarial) environment. Using an $m$-uniform bidding format, the buyer submits $m$ bid-quantity pairs $(b_i, q_i)$ to demand $q_i$ units at bid $b_i$, with $m \ll M$ in practice, where $M$ denotes the maximum demand of the buyer.
  We introduce the notion of safe bidding strategies as those that satisfy the RoI constraints irrespective of competing bids. Despite the stringent requirement, we show that these strategies satisfy a mild no-overbidding condition, depend only on the valuation curve of the bidder, and the bidder can focus on a finite subset without loss of generality. Though the subset size is $O(M^m)$, we design a polynomial-time learning algorithm that achieves sublinear regret, both in full-information and bandit settings, relative to the hindsight-optimal safe strategy.
  We assess the robustness of safe strategies against the hindsight-optimal strategy from a richer class. We define the richness ratio $\alpha \in (0,1]$ as the minimum ratio of the value of the optimal safe strategy to that of the optimal strategy from richer class and construct hard instances showing the tightness of $\alpha$. Our algorithm achieves $\alpha$-approximate sublinear regret against these stronger benchmarks. Simulations on semi-synthetic auction data show that empirical richness ratios significantly outperform the theoretical worst-case bounds. The proposed safe strategies and learning algorithm extend naturally to more nuanced buyer and competitor models.</description>

      <title>Simple and Optimal Sublinear Algorithms for Mean Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05254v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the sublinear multivariate mean estimation problem in $d$-dimensional Euclidean space. Specifically, we aim to find the mean $\mu$ of a ground point set $A$, which minimizes the sum of squared Euclidean distances of the points in $A$ to $\mu$. We first show that a multiplicative $(1+\varepsilon)$ approximation to $\mu$ can be found with probability $1-\delta$ using $O(\varepsilon^{-1}\log \delta^{-1})$ many independent uniform random samples, and provide a matching lower bound. Furthermore, we give two estimators with optimal sample complexity that can be computed in optimal running time for extracting a suitable approximate mean:
  1. The coordinate-wise median of $\log \delta^{-1}$ sample means of sample size $\varepsilon^{-1}$. As a corollary, we also show improved convergence rates for this estimator for estimating means of multivariate distributions.
  2. The geometric median of $\log \delta^{-1}$ sample means of sample size $\varepsilon^{-1}$. To compute a solution efficiently, we design a novel and simple gradient descent algorithm that is significantly faster for our specific setting than all other known algorithms for computing geometric medians.
  In addition, we propose an order statistics approach that is empirically competitive with these algorithms, has an optimal sample complexity and matches the running time up to lower order terms.
  We finally provide an extensive experimental evaluation among several estimators which concludes that the geometric-median-of-means-based approach is typically the most competitive in practice.</description>

      <title>Extending Stable and Popular Matching Algorithms from Bipartite to Arbitrary Instances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16173v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider stable and popular matching problems in arbitrary graphs, which are referred to as stable roommates instances. We extend the 3/2-approximation algorithm for the maximum size weakly stable matching problem to the roommates case, which solves a more than 20 year old open question of Irving and Manlove about the approximability of maximum size weakly stable matchings in roommates instances with ties [Irving and Manlove 2002] and has nice applications for the problem of matching residents to hospitals in the presence of couples. We also extend the algorithm that finds a maximum size popular matching in bipartite graphs in the case of strict preferences and the algorithm to find a popular matching among maximum weight matchings. While previous attempts to extend the idea of promoting the agents or duplicating the edges from bipartite instances to arbitrary ones failed, these results show that with the help of a simple observation, we can indeed bridge the gap and extend these algorithms</description>

      <title>Concurrent Composition for Differentially Private Continual Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03299v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many intended uses of differential privacy involve a $\textit{continual mechanism}$ that is set up to run continuously over a long period of time, making more statistical releases as either queries come in or the dataset is updated. In this paper, we give the first general treatment of privacy against $\textit{adaptive}$ adversaries for mechanisms that support dataset updates and a variety of queries, all arbitrarily interleaved. It also models a very general notion of neighboring, that includes both event-level and user-level privacy.
  We prove several $\textit{concurrent}$ composition theorems for continual mechanisms, which ensure privacy even when an adversary can interleave queries and dataset updates to the different composed mechanisms. Previous concurrent composition theorems for differential privacy were only for the case when the dataset is static, with no adaptive updates. Moreover, we also give the first interactive and continual generalizations of the "parallel composition theorem" for noninteractive differential privacy. Specifically, we show that the analogue of the noninteractive parallel composition theorem holds if either there are no adaptive dataset updates or each of the composed mechanisms satisfies pure differential privacy, but it fails to hold for composing approximately differentially private mechanisms with dataset updates.
  We then formalize a set of general conditions on a continual mechanism $M$ that runs multiple continual sub-mechanisms such that the privacy guarantees of $M$ follow directly using the above concurrent composition theorems on the sub-mechanisms, without further privacy loss. This enables us to give a simpler and more modular privacy analysis of a recent continual histogram mechanism of Henzinger, Sricharan, and Steiner. In the case of approximate DP, ours is the first proof showing that its privacy holds against adaptive adversaries.</description>

      <title>Breaking Barriers: Combinatorial Algorithms for Non-monotone Submodular Maximization with Sublinear Adaptivity and $1/e$ Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07062v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the rapid growth of data in modern applications, parallel algorithms for maximizing non-monotone submodular functions have gained significant attention. In the parallel computation setting, the state-of-the-art approximation ratio of $1/e$ is achieved by a continuous algorithm (Ene &amp; Nguyen, 2020) with adaptivity $ O\left(\log(n)\right)$. In this work, we focus on size constraints and present the first combinatorial algorithm matching this bound -- a randomized parallel approach achieving $1/e-\varepsilon$ approximation ratio. This result bridges the gap between continuous and combinatorial approaches for this problem. As a byproduct, we also develop a simpler $(1/4-\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm with high probability ($\ge 1-1/n$). Both algorithms achieve $ O\left(\log(n)\log(k)\right)$ adaptivity and $O\left(n\log(n)\log(k)\right)$ query complexity. Empirical results show our algorithms achieve competitive objective values, with the $(1/4-\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm particularly efficient in queries.</description>

      <title>The connectivity carcass of a vertex subset in a graph: both odd and even case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06266v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G=(V,E)$ be an undirected unweighted multi-graph and $S\subseteq V$ be a subset of vertices. A set of edges with the least cardinality whose removal disconnects $S$, that is, there is no path between at least one pair of vertices from $S$, is called a Steiner mincut for $S$ or simply an $S$-mincut. Connectivity Carcass is a compact data structure storing all $S$-mincuts in $G$ announced by Dinitz and Vainshtein in an extended abstract by Dinitz and Vainshtein in 1994. The complete proof of various results of this data structure for the simpler case when the capacity of $S$-mincut is odd appeared in the year 2000 in SICOMP. Over the last couple of decades, there have been attempts towards the proof for the case when the capacity of $S$-mincut is even, but none of them met a logical end. We present the following results.
  - We present the first complete, self-contained exposition of the connectivity carcass which covers both even and odd cases of the capacity of $S$-mincut.
  - We derive the results using an alternate and much simpler approach. In particular, we derive the results using submodularity of cuts -- a well-known property of graphs expressed using a simple inequality.
  - We also show how the connectivity carcass can be helpful in efficiently answering some basic queries related to $S$-mincuts using some additional insights.</description>

      <title>Finding d-Cuts in Graphs of Bounded Diameter, Graphs of Bounded Radius and H-Free Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11389v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The d-Cut problem is to decide if a graph has an edge cut such that each vertex has at most d neighbours at the opposite side of the cut. If $d=1$, we obtain the intensively studied Matching Cut problem. The d-Cut problem has been studied as well, but a systematic study for special graph classes was lacking. We initiate such a study and consider classes of bounded diameter, bounded radius and $H$-free graphs. We prove that for all $d\geq 2$, d-Cut is polynomial-time solvable for graphs of diameter 2, $(P_3+P_4)$-free graphs and $P_5$-free graphs. These results extend known results for $d=1$. However, we also prove several NP-hardness results for d-Cut that contrast known polynomial-time results for $d=1$. Our results lead to full dichotomies for bounded diameter and bounded radius and to almost-complete dichotomies for H-free graphs.</description>

      <title>Chameleon2++: An Efficient and Scalable Variant Of Chameleon Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02612v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hierarchical clustering remains a fundamental challenge in data mining, particularly when dealing with large-scale datasets where traditional approaches fail to scale effectively. Recent Chameleon-based algorithms - Chameleon2, M-Chameleon, and INNGS-Chameleon have proposed advanced strategies but they still suffer from $O(n^2)$ computational complexity, especially for large datasets. With Chameleon2 as the base algorithm, we introduce Chameleon2++ that addresses this challenge.
  Our algorithm has three parts. First, Graph Generation - we propose an approximate $k$-NN search instead of an exact one, specifically we integrate with the Annoy algorithm. This results in fast approximate nearest neighbor computation, significantly reducing the graph generation time. Second, Graph Partitioning - we propose use of a multi-level partitioning algorithm instead of a recursive bisection one. Specifically we adapt the hMETIS algorithm instead of the FM. This is because multi-level algorithms are robust to approximation introduced in the graph generation phase yielding higher-quality partitions, and that too with minimum configuration requirements. Third, Merging - we retain the flood fill heuristic that ensures connected balanced components in the partitions as well as efficient partition merging criteria leading to the final clusters.
  These enhancements reduce the overall time complexity to $O(n\log n)$, achieving scalability. On real-world benchmark datasets used in prior Chameleon works, Chameleon2++ delivers an average of 4% improvement in clustering quality. This demonstrates that algorithmic efficiency and clustering quality can co-exist in large-scale hierarchical clustering.</description>
